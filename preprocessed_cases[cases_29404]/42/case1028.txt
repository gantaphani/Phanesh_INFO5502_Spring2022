we consider here principally whether an ij adverse credibility finding is supported by substantial evidence where petitioner written asylum application and subsequent testimony contain material inconsistencies that reach to the heart of the claim of persecution whether an ij was required to afford petitioner an opportunity to respond before basing an adverse credibility determination on such inconsistencies whether the bia engaged in improper by relying on evidence in the record not cited in the ij decision whether the bia erred in declining to make administrative findings regarding the corrected abortion certificate which petitioner submitted for the first time on appeal,and whether the bia erred in denying petitioner request for withholding of removal or other relief under the cat.
background 
petitioner xian tuan ye ye,a native and citizen of china,petitions this court for review of a july,order of the board of immigration appeals bia,affirming an april,decision of immigration judge ij sandy hom,see in re xian tuan ye,file no.a new york,ny which denied ye application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under article of the united nations convention against torture cat 
ye illegally entered the united states at puerto rico over a decade ago,in february.he applied for asylum and withholding of deportation in october,claiming that his wife had been abducted and forced to undergo an abortion,that he opposed the abortion because of his christian beliefs,and that family planning officials fined and threatened him for speaking out against the abortion to others at his church.following a hearing in october,the ij denied ye application,making an adverse credibility finding and concluding that ye forced abortion claim could not stand without a nexus to a protected ground,in light of law in denying ye relief,the ij noted that ye written application failed to mention that he had been detained for a period and beaten very badly,and in that respect was inconsistent with his later testimony.
ye appealed to the bia,which affirmed the ij decision in july.the bia found ampl e support for the ij adverse credibility determination,noting that t he account in ye asylum application omits events which were so crucial to his claim that it is not credible that ye would have overlooked them when preparing the application if they had in fact occurred.the bia specifically highlighted ye failure to mention in his form the facts he testified to at his hearing regarding a detention in which he was beaten,and his having distributed leaflets.
in june,ye moved the bia to reconsider its decision in light of congress expansion of the definition of refugee to include victims of coercive family planning policies.see a providing that involuntary sterilization constitutes persecution on account of political opinion matter of,bia holding that an alien whose wife has been subjected to coercive family policy may establish past persecution to himself.
in april,the bia granted ye motion and remanded the case to the same ij who had presided over ye initial application.once again,the ij denied ye asylum application,finding that he failed to demonstrate eligibility under either a religious persecution or coercive family planning theory.regarding ye family planning claim,the ij again found that ye was not credible,this time emphasizing inconsistencies between a ye testimony and an abortion certificate submitted in support of his application,and b ye and testimony concerning how and when his wife pregnancy was discovered.the ij also found ye ineligible for withholding of removal or relief under the cat because he had not demonstrated that he was more likely than not to be tortured or persecuted upon his return to china.
ye appealed to the bia,which affirmed the ij adverse credibility finding,relying on inconsistencies highlighted by the ij and bia in their and opinions but not reiterated in the ij decision.specifically,the bia noted that while ye form indicated that he was taken to the family planning office and threatened with arrest,he later testified that he was detained and severely beaten over a period and while ye testified in that he was released after he asked someone to do him a favor,he testified in that he was released because his uncle posted bond for him.in light of these inconsistencies,which the bia found reach to the heart of ye asylum claim,the bia declined to address the ij findings about the authenticity of the abortion certificate finally,the bia affirmed the ij finding that ye failed to meet his burden with respect to cat relief.ye filed a timely petition for review.
discussion 
when the bia issues an opinion,the opinion becomes the basis for judicial review of the decision of which the alien is complaining.yan chen gonzales,cir quoting niam ashcroft,cir.here,the bia adopted the conclusions of the ij and upheld its adverse credibility finding,but did so for reasons other than those cited in the ij most recent decision.because this is most analogous to a case in which the bia adopts the decision of the ij and merely supplements the ij decision,we will review the decision of the ij as supplemented by the bia.xue hong yang doj,cir holding that when the bia rejects part of the basis of an ij decision,but affirms the holding in every other respect,we review the ij opinion as modified by the bia yan chen,at holding that when the bia does not adopt the decision of the ij to any extent,we review the bia decision only.
we review the ij factual findings,including his adverse credibility determinations,under the substantial evidence standard.see b b t he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary emphases added zhou yun zhang ins,cir w e will not disturb a factual finding if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence in the record when considered as a whole.internal quotation marks omitted.
as we have reiterated on multiple occasions,we afford particular deference to the credibility determinations of an ij.wu biao chen ins,cir quoting montero ins,cir.accordingly,our review does not permit us to engage in an independent evaluation of the cold record or ask ourselves whether,if we were sitting as fact finders,we would credit or discredit an applicant testimony.guan gonzales,cir.where the ij adverse credibility finding is based on specific examples in the record of inconsistent statements by the asylum applicant about matters material to his claim of persecution,or on contradictory evidence or inherently improbable testimony regarding such matters,a reviewing court will generally not be able to conclude that a reasonable adjudicator was compelled to find otherwise.zhou yun zhang,at.
of course,the fact that the agency has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application can not insulate the decision from review.ramsameachire ashcroft,cir.an adverse credibility determination must be based on specific,cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.ins,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.inconsistent testimony often bears a legitimate nexus to an adverse credibility finding,but it need not be fatal if it is minor and isolated,and the testimony is otherwise generally consistent,rational,and believable.see diallo ins,cir.
in upholding the ij adverse credibility determination,the bia relied primarily on omissions in ye written application for asylum that were inconsistent with his subsequent testimony specifically,the bia emphasized that,in describing his mistreatment at the hands of chinese authorities,ye testified to a significantly different event that was nowhere outlined in his application.far from being a mere omission in his paperwork,the bia concluded that this inconsistency reaches to the heart of ye claim because this is the only persecutory event which the respondent claims happened to him directly,aside from his wife alleged abortion.
upon our review of the record,we agree with the bia assessment that ye inconsistent statements concerning the nature of his mistreatment support the ij adverse credibility fi
