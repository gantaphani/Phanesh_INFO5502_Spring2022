this motion by the government to vacate a stay of removal formerly called deportation following the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus raises issues concerning the standard to be applied by the district court in issuing a stay of removal,the standard to be applied by this court in staying a trial court ruling pending appeal,and,with respect to the merits,the continued validity,in light of ins cyr,d,of our decision in domond ins,cir.domond held that an alien,subject to removal because of a felony committed prior to the effective dates of the and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat,but convicted after those dates was ineligible for discretionary relief pursuant to former section c of the immigration and nationality act ina,c repealed.the issues arise from a ruling of the district court for the eastern district of new york john gleeson,district judge,entered may,continuing a stay of removal after denial of a habeas corpus petition filed by haniff mohammed.
we conclude,contrary to the government position,that the heightened standard for a stay of deportation,imposed by section f of the ina,f,is inapplicable to mohammed case because he is seeking a temporary stay pending appeal and not an injunction to prevent the operation of provisions of the ina concerning exclusion or removal.we also conclude,however,that,under the normal standards for a stay pending appeal,he has not shown the requisite likelihood of success to warrant temporary appellate relief.we will therefore vacate the district court stay,thereby denying a stay pending appeal,but will stay our order for days to afford mohammed an opportunity to seek a stay of removal from the supreme court.
background 
mohammed,who was born in trinidad but became a lawful permanent resident of the united states in,committed the state law offense of criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree a class e felony in march and was found guilty in a new york state court in september.in october,he was sentenced to a term of two to four years an immigration judge ordered his removal for commission of an aggravated felony and denied mohammed request for discretionary relief pursuant to former section c because that provision had been repealed by aedpa.the board of immigration appeals affirmed both rulings.
mohammed filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to,contending that he was entitled to be considered for discretionary relief under section c of the ina,as that provision existed at the time of his crime.the district court stayed removal,without objection by the government,pending disposition of the habeas petition.the district court denied the petition by a judgment entered may,but continued the stay unless it is lifted by the court of appeals.mohammed reno,d.judge gleeson concluded that he was bound by our decision in domond,but then,in a thoughtful,provocative,but entirely respectful opinion,explained why he believed that domond was incorrectly decided in light of the supreme court earlier decision in landgraf usi film products,d,decided seven years before domond,and the court later decision in cyr,decided three months after domond.on august,the government filed a motion in this court to lift the stay of removal 
discussion 
jurisdiction to stay removal pending appeal 
the government initially challenges the district court continuation of the stay on the ground that a strict standard for issuing such a stay is prescribed by section f of the ina,f,and that the standard has not been met in this case.section f provides 
limit on injunctive relief 
in general 
regardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party or parties bringing the action,no court other than the supreme court shall have jurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions of part iv of this subchapter as amended by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,other than with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under such part have been initiated.
particular cases 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,no court shall enjoin the removal of any alien pursuant to a final order under this section unless the alien shows by clear and convincing evidence that the entry or execution of such order is prohibited as a matter of law.
f emphasis added.
mohammed disputes the applicability of section f to a stay pending appeal of the denial of a habeas petition.he contends that the limitation in subsection f on a court authority to enjoin the removal of an alien does not apply to a stay pending appeal.he also contends that reading subsections f and f together indicates that the clear and convincing evidence standard of the latter subdivision applies only to a court enjoining removal procedures,and not to a court ruling only on the merits of an individual alien case.
two circuits have ruled that section f does not apply to a court consideration of a stay pending appeal.maharaj ashcroft,cir stay pending appeal of denial of habeas petition bejjani ins,cir stay pending petition to review ins decision to reinstate order of removal andreiu ashcroft,cir stay pending petition to review ins decision denying asylum claim.the eleventh circuit has ruled to the contrary,weng attorney general,cir,although two judges of that court subsequently expressed disagreement with weng and urged its reconsideration in banc,attorney general,cir barkett,with whom wilson,joins,concurring.
we agree with the ninth and sixth circuits for all of the reasons explained in the ninth circuit in banc decision in andreiu.first,the use of enjoin in subsection f contrasts with the wording enjoin or restrain in subsection f,suggesting that enjoin in f applies to a permanent prohibition and that enjoin or restrain applies to both a permanent and an interim prohibition.even though,as weng points out,courts have often used enjoin and restrain interchangeably,when congress pointedly uses both words in one subsection and then uses only the term enjoin in an adjacent subsection,there is an implication that restrain is used in f to refer to an interim prohibition,and that the omission of restrain in f therefore makes this subsection inapplicable to such a prohibition.reading the coverage of both subsections to be identical renders restrain in f surplusage see andreiu,at.
moreover,when congress wished to legislate concerning a stay pending appeal,it explicitly used the word stay.see b b service of petition for review does not stay removal pending court decision unless court so orders.if congress wanted to apply a heightened standard to a stay pending appeal,it would likely have used the word stay in subsection f instead of enjoin indeed,it would likely have included such a standard in section b.see andreiu,at.
in addition,subsection f provides that a court has jurisdiction to prohibit the operation of the provisions of part iv of this subchapter only with respect to the application of such provisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings under such part have been initiated.the companion subsection f is sensibly understood to mean that it is in such cases that the heightened standard of review is required.the clear concern of section f is limiting the power of courts to enjoin the operation of the immigration laws,not with stays of removal pending appeal in individual asylum cases.andreiu,at.the same reasoning applies to stays pending appeal in individual habeas cases.
finally,reading subsection f to apply to stays pending appeal in individual cases beyond those that seek to enjoin the operation of the immigration laws would lead to the anomalous result that,in cases like the pending one,an alien would have to make a more persuasive showing to obtain a stay than is required to prevail on the merits,thereby permitting the removal of some aliens with meritorious claims against removal.see andreiu,at.
we therefore conclude that the heightened standard of review required by subsection f did not apply to the district court consid
