over the course of the last four years,appellants garfield gayle,neville sukhu,and sheldon francois have been litigating,and the government,defending,a purported class action to challenge the constitutionality of c,the section of the immigration and nationality act that requires the mandatory detention of aliens who have committed specified crimes.the parties significant investment of time and effort culminated in partial grants and partial denials of summary judgment and two thoughtful and thorough opinions of the district court that are now the subject of able briefing by the parties and amici on appeal.it is especially unfortunate,then,that when it ruled on the merits,entered injunctive relief on appellants individual claims,and then denied class certification on the ground that it was not necessary in view of that injunction,the district court put the cart before the horse as to both federal jurisdiction and our class action jurisprudence.that is,once appellants were released from detention,their individual claims became moot so the district court retained jurisdiction only to rule on appellants motion for class certification not to decide the merits issues,much less to order individual relief.so too is our appellate jurisdiction limited to the denial of class certification.
because the district court exceeded its jurisdiction by adjudicating the merits issues and also adopted a doctrine of necessity to deny class certification instead of analyzing the criteria enumerated in rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,we will vacate the judgment and the relevant orders of the district court and will remand for further proceedings.
appellants are foreign nationals and lawful permanent residents of the united states.as a result of various criminal convictions,the united states immigration and customs enforcement ice sought to remove each appellant from the united states.pending their removal proceedings,each was detained pursuant to c,which provides that where ice has reason to believe that an alien is deportable or inadmissible by virtue of having committed one of a number of specified crimes or being involved in activities threatening national security,that alien shall be taken into custody when the alien is released from detention for those crimes,without regard to whether the alien is released on parole,supervised release,or probation,and without regard to whether the alien may be arrested or imprisoned again for the same offense.c in re joseph,see also sylvain att y,cir.the mandatory detention provision of c stands in contrast to the general rule that when the government seeks to detain an alien pending his removal proceedings,he may seek a bond hearing to show that he should not be detained.see a in re guerra,b.each appellant sought relief from his mandatory detention.
at issue on appeal are the district court rulings on appellants third amended petition filed on august,and their third motion to certify a class,filed on may,the third amended petition raised individual claims on behalf of sukhu and two claims on behalf of a putative class of aliens who are being or will be mandatorily detained pursuant to c.the first such claim alleged violations of substantive and procedural due process.mandatory detention of aliens violates substantive due process,appellants contended,when the alien has a substantial challenge to his removal that is,when he challenges whether the crime for which he was convicted renders him removable or when he claims he is entitled to discretionary relief in the form of cancellation of removal or adjustment of status.
appellants procedural due process claim challenged the procedures surrounding joseph hearings,the mechanism by which an alien who is mandatorily detained pending his removal proceedings is provided with the opportunity to offer evidence and legal authority on the question whether the service has properly included him within a category that is subject to mandatory detention.in re joseph,at.specifically,appellants asserted that an alien who is mandatorily detained pursuant to c is allowed to seek a determination by an immigration judge that he is not properly included within c.h ii see also in re joseph,at holding that an alien is entitled to a bond hearing if he can show at a joseph hearing that the government is substantially unlikely to establish,at the merits hearing,the charge or charges that subject the alien to mandatory detention.appellants alleged that aliens do not receive adequate notice of their right to a hearing,that joseph hearing procedures impermissibly place the initial burden of proof on the alien,and that a contemporaneous verbatim record should be made of each joseph hearing.
in connection with their request for relief,appellants also sought to certify a class consisting of all individuals in new jersey who are or will be detained pursuant to c.first mot.to certify.dkt.appellants relied on federal rule of civil procedure b,which allows plaintiffs to bring a class action when the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.fed.civ.b.the district court ruled on the merits of the claims brought on behalf of the class in two stages.in an order and opinion dated march,gayle i,the district court partially granted the government motion to dismiss and held that c did not violate substantive due process with respect to aliens who assert a substantial challenge to their removability.the district court thus dismissed appellants petition to the extent that appellants are requesting that a joseph hearing be provided to any mandatorily detained alien who has a substantial challenge to his or her removal on grounds other than whether the alien falls within the c categories requiring mandatory detention.gayle johnson,d,
in an order dated january,gayle ii,the district court resolved the remaining claims,the adequacy of joseph hearing procedures on for summary judgment,and also ruled on appellants motion to certify a class.as to the merits,the court held that the form giving aliens notice of their right to seek a joseph hearing form i does not provide constitutionally adequate notice and that the government was required to revise the form that joseph hearing procedures violate due process by not placing the initial burden on the government,but that once the government shows probable cause to believe that the alien is subject to mandatory detention,the burden shifts to the alien to show that the government is substantially unlikely to prevail in proving the alleged charges and that due process does not require a contemporaneous recording of a joseph hearing.see gayle johnson,d.
the district court judge then addressed the third motion to certify a class,having denied the first motion in may without prejudice pending an expanded record discovery,gayle warden,cv,ecf,at may,and having terminated the second motion in connection with her march,opinion by instructing appellants to refile a motion limited to those individuals who are entitled to a joseph hearing consistent with this opinion,see gayle i,d at.appellants did so,redefining the class as all individuals who are or will be detained within the state of new jersey pursuant to c,and who have a substantial challenge to threshold deportability or inadmissibility on one of the statutory grounds that trigger mandatory detention.third mot.to certify.dkt.the district court then denied the third motion to certify on the grounds that certification was unnecessary because its rulings on the merits of the claims meant that all aliens who are subjected to mandatory detention would benefit from the injunctive relief and remedies that this court has imposed.gayle ii,d at.appellants now appeal the january,order as to both the district court merits determination and its denial of class certification 
the district court had statutory jurisdiction pursuant to and.we have statutory jurisdiction pursuant to.we review legal determinations de novo,factual findings for clear error,and matters committed to the district court discretion for abuse thereof.united states doe,cir.
on appeal,appellants,joined by numerous amici,challenge the merits of the district court substantive and procedural due process rulings,as well as its denial of their motion to certify a class,and the government has responded point by point.yet,as the parties conceded at oral argument in response to inquiry by the court,oral arg.at,argued,the district court did not have authority to reach the merits.nor do we.the district court judgment therefore must be vacated and the case remanded for consideration of the only issue over which it had jurisdiction the motion for class certification.
we reach this conclusion for three reasons.first,because the claims of the individual class representatives were long ago moot and no mootness exception applies,the district court exceeded its jurisdiction in reaching the merits.second,under the exception to mootness in parole commission geraghty,d,because the motion to certify a class was filed at a point in time when at least one putative representative had a live claim,the district court had jurisdiction to consider that motion even though the putative representatives claims became moot.third,in denying the motion to certify a class,the district court erred by disregarding the rule criteria and instead relying exclusively on the ground that a class action was unnecessary because it would serve no useful purpose given the district court merits rulings rulings it had no jurisdiction to make.
we begin our case where we must begin every case with the question of jurisdiction.article iii of the constitution gives federal courts jurisdiction only over cases and controversies,art.iii.as a federal court,we must assure ourselves that we have article iii jurisdiction in every case that comes before us.friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.a court has jurisdiction only if the claims before it are not moot.see daimlerchrysler cuno,d.the mootness doctrine imposes two requirements that the underlying dispute presents live issues,and that the parties have a legally cognizable interest in the outcome that is,a personal stake in the dispute.chafin chafin,d quoting already,llc nike,d.the parties must have a personal stake in the litigation not only at its inception,but throughout its existence.id.at.therefore,if developments occurring during the course of adjudication eliminate a plaintiff personal stake in the outcome of a suit,then a federal court must dismiss the case as moot.rosetti shalala,cir.
here,we conclude that the district court lacked jurisdiction at least to reach the merits as appellants individual claims were moot long before it issued the relevant orders.each appellant sought a bond hearing in an effort to obtain release from custody.but gayle was granted habeas relief and released on bond in march.see gayle napolitano,cv,wl.sukhu was released on may,after the immigration judge granted his application for adjustment of status.and francois was released on bond on august,after the district court ordered that he be given a bond hearing pursuant to diop security,cir.see francois napolitano,cv,wl.his removal was terminated on september,and the deadline for the government to appeal that determination expired on october,see b and from that point,there was no effective relief the district court could provide.in short,appellants individual claims for relief have been moot for nearly three years 
although not urged by the parties,we have considered whether the exception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition while evading review might apply to salvage appellants individual claims.see turner rogers,d quoting pac.terminal interstate commerce comm n.that exception applies if the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration,and there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subjected to the same action again,id.at.quoting weinstein bradford,d per curiam.we have held that detention pursuant to c may evade review where it is temporary and the underlying removal proceedings justifying detention may very well be nearing a resolution by the time a federal court of appeals is prepared to consider them,diop,at and it is capable of repetition when an alien has been mandatorily detained based on a prior conviction but also has another prior conviction that would justify mandatory detention,id.at see also united states ex rel.forman mccall,cir.finding an inmate challenge to parole procedures not moot even after he was paroled because the parole commission reserved the right to void his parole if the district court order granting relief was reversed or vacated.
none of those circumstances pertain here.sukhu application for status adjustment was granted and his removal proceedings were terminated on april,while francois removal was cancelled on september.thus,unless they commit qualifying crimes in the future,these named representatives have no reasonable prospect of being subjected to removal proceedings,much less mandatory detention pursuant to c.gayle case presents a closer question as his removal proceedings were still ongoing at the time the district court rendered its merits decisions,so there was at least a theoretical possibility that he could have been detained again if he had another prior conviction that triggered mandatory detention.see diop,at.as the parties concede,however,he did not 
in sum,appellants had received the very relief they sought and presented no live individual claim to the district court well before that court issued its opinion and order of march,partially granting the government motion to dismiss and ruling on the merits of appellants substantive due process claim,or its opinion and summary judgment order of january,ruling on the merits of the remaining claims,granting partial relief,and denying class certification on the ground that the relief it granted rendered certification unnecessary.accordingly,the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter those orders and they must be vacated 
had this case involved only appellants individual claims,federal jurisdiction would be absent,as in the district court,and this case would be at an end.but class claims can breathe life into an otherwise moot case for they allow a plaintiff to continue seeking class certification in certain circumstances even though his individual claim for relief has become moot.richardson bledsoe,cir.as relevant here,so long as a plaintiff files a motion to certify a class when he still has a live claim,the mooting of that claim while the motion is pending precludes the court from reaching the merits but does not preclude it from deciding the certification motion.holmes pension plan of bethlehem steel,cir.see also geraghty,at.this is because a plaintiff claim that he should represent the class is one that is presented in a concrete factual setting and with parties vigorously advocating opposing positions,and such a claim remains as a concrete,sharply presented issue even if the plaintiff individual claims expire.geraghty,at.for the same reason,the named plaintiff may appeal the denial of a motion to certify the class,id.at,as long as he had a live claim when he filed for class certification and appellate review may reverse an erroneous denial of class certification that,if correctly decided,would have prevented the action from becoming moot,lusardi xerox,cir.quoting geraghty,at,because the corrected ruling relates back to the date of the original denial,geraghty,at.thus,the critical question is whether a plaintiff had a live claim at the time the operative motion to certify was filed.
in this case,the answer to that question is not as simple as it might seem because appellants technically filed three different motions to certify.while at least one appellant had standing at the time the first was filed in november,each appellant claims had become moot before the filing of the second motion to certify,much less the third motion,which is the one the district court decided on january,and the subject of this appeal.thus,this case requires us to decide how geraghty class mootness rule should apply to sequentially filed motions for class certification.
we considered this issue once before in lusardi.there,the district court had conditionally certified a class under the age discrimination and employment act but later decertified it on the ground that the members of the proposed class were not similarly situated the plaintiffs individual claims then became moot,and after the case was reassigned to another judge,plaintiffs sought a de novo hearing on class certification to recertify the class or to certify four subclasses.at.the district judge agreed with defendants that the dismissal of plaintiffs individual claims deprived the district court of jurisdiction to address the merits of class recertification,id.at,and we affirmed,rejecting plaintiffs argument that their de novo certification motion relates back to and would correct the original judge assertedly erroneous class decertification,decided when they still had live claims,id.at.
the government argues that lusardi compels the same result in this case that is,that appellants third motion to certify was a de novo motion filed after appellants individual claims expired and was therefore unreviewable by the district court.see gov t ltr.br.appellants,on the other hand,urge that lusardi is inapposite because neither appellants first nor second motions for class certification were resolved based on an analysis of the rule factors the district court simply deferred that analysis until the third motion,so that all three should be considered one continuously pending motion.see appellants ltr.br.
appellants have the better of the argument.we acknowledged in lusardi that so long as the named representative has a live claim at the time the motion is filed,geraghty doctrine applies and the representative private dispute,although mooted,essentially carrie s forward for the limited purpose of arguing a reviewable motion through to completion.lusardi,at emphasis added.the plaintiffs in that case,however,had seen their original motion to completion when the class was decertified for failure to comply with the certification requirements those plaintiffs were now seeking to have the reassigned judge decide the question entirely anew in a de novo hearing that would require the creation of an entirely new record and adjudication of complicated class considerations at a time when the interests of putative class representatives may no longer be squarely adverse to defendant or wholly in line with absent class members.id.at that,we concluded,would stretch geraghty doctrine beyond the breaking point b ecause a determination on the merits of the class certification motion could not relate back into a void.id.at quoting tucker phyfer,cir.
there was no such void here,however,in appellants efforts to litigate their original motion to completion or,hence,in the district court jurisdiction.the first motion to certify was not denied for failure to satisfy rule criteria.instead,it was denied solely so that further discovery could be completed without prejudice pending an expanded record discovery.gayle,cv,ecf,at.likewise,the district court terminated the second motion,not as a final adjudication of certification,but with express instruction that appellants refile a motion to certify a class limited to those individuals who are entitled to a joseph hearing consistent the court elimination of certain claims in gayle gayle i,d at.thus,the successive motions were substantially similar and required no additional discovery,and until the district court ruled on the third motion,there was no denial of class certification based on a rule analysis or other intervening event that could be deemed to break the jurisdictional chain.
our holding today that geraghty doctrine encompasses successive,substantially similar motions to certify unless and until certification has been finally resolved on rule grounds comports with the logic of geraghty and the practicalities of litigation a plaintiff who files a motion to certify a class prior to the expiration of his individual claims does not lose his interest in accurate resolution of his legitimate efforts to serve as class representative,lusardi,at,merely because the district court,as a technical matter,denies or terminates the motion without actually deciding it.rather,his stake carrie s forward for the limited purpose of arguing a reviewable motion through to completion,id.and the certification question remains concrete and fit for judicial resolution,see geraghty,at.
moreover,as the drafters of rule recognize,there are many valid reasons that may justify deferring the initial certification decision to a later period in the litigation.richardson,at quoting fed.civ.advisory committee note to the amendment.yet district judges must also manage busy dockets,and one who intends to defer ruling,for example,pending additional discovery relevant to rule criteria,might reasonably decide to deny such a motion without prejudice rather than hold it in abeyance for months on end.see,requiring semiannual public disclosure of the number of motions that have been pending on each district judge docket for more than six months.to hold that a plaintiff certification claim is extinguished by such a denial would enfeeble the flexible character of the mootness doctrine,geraghty,at,and unmoor it from the realities of litigation.
indeed,consider the implications of applying lusardi to the facts of this case.if the district court had jurisdiction only over the first motion to certify,our appellate jurisdiction would extend only to its order on that motion an order denying the motion without prejudice to additional discovery.yet that order is unreviewable it is not a final order within the meaning of,see hagan rogers,cir.a n order dismissing a complaint without prejudice is normally not final within the meaning of,nor is it subject to interlocutory appeal under rule f,see in re football league players concussion,cir.stating that an order conditionally certifying a class under rule e but reserv ing the class certification determination for a later time,and similar order s issued under some other subdivision of rule are not subject to interlocutory review under rule f.that would mean the district court denial without prejudice now unchallangeable in the district court and unreviewable on appeal would preclude the plaintiff from obtaining a review of his right to represent a class.geraghty dictates otherwise.at.explaining that a plaintiff retains the right to seek to represent a class even after his personal claim has become moot.
in short,the district court had jurisdiction to decide appellants third motion to certify,and we now turn to the question of whether its denial of that motion was proper.
the sole ground for the district court denial of class certification in this case was that it d id not find certification of a class necessary.gayle ii,d at.as explained below,that was error,for necessity is not an express requirement of rule,and the criteria the district court was required to consider are wholly absent from its discussion.
to maintain a class action under federal rule of civil procedure,a plaintiff must first show that the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable numerosity that there are questions of law or fact common to the class commonality that the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class typicality and that the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class adequacy.see fed.civ.a.second,the plaintiff must show that the class action falls within one of the three types enumerated in rule b in this case,rule b,which provides that a class action may be maintained if the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class,so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.class certification is proper only if the trial court is satisfied,after a rigorous analysis,that the prerequisites of rule are met.in re hydrogen peroxide antitrust,cir,as amended,quoting.of sw.falcon,d.
here,the district court denied class certification as not necessary because a rule b class is limited to injunctive and declaratory relief and the court declaration as to the unconstitutionality of the government procedures and its grant of injunctive relief on an individual basis would be binding on all of the governmental agencies and would indeed inure to the benefit of all members of the proposed class.see gayle ii,d at.in assuming a necessity requirement,the district court relied on ihrke states power,cir,vacated on other grounds sub,states power ihrke,d,in which the eighth circuit held a court may deny certification of a b class where t he determination of the constitutional question can be made by the court regardless of whether the action is treated as an individual action or a class action.no useful purpose would be served by permitting such a case to proceed as a class action.id.at.
the role of necessity in our own circuit,however,has been an open question.although the government asserts that we adopted a freestanding necessity requirement in carter butz,cir,our opinion in that case and subsequent cases make clear we did no such thing.true,in carter,we affirmed the district court denial of certification as within the range of discretion permitted by rule when one of the rationales offered by the district court was that the precedential value of its decision would render a judgment in favor of the class unnecessary,but the district court also had found a traditional rule factor,commonality,to be lacking.id.moreover,just a few years after carter,we explicitly stated that a plaintiff seeking rule certification need not prove that certification is necessary,but only that there was compliance with the prerequisites of rule.geraghty parole comm n,cir,vacated on other grounds sub,geraghty.
before answering this question,we consider the views of our sister circuits views that turn out to be.the seventh circuit has expressly rejected the contention that a district court can deny certification as unnecessary,see,brown scott,cir,while other circuits have affirmed the denial of class certification on that ground,at least in the rule b context,see,galvan levine,cir.sandford coleman realty,cir.craft memphis light,gas water,cir.james ball,cir,reversed on other grounds,ball james,d.health care ass.dep t of soc.rehab,cir.
the first circuit has staked out a middle ground,observing in light of rule b express requirement that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief be appropriate respecting the class as a whole,fed.civ.b emphasis added,that certification under rule b may be denied where classwide relief is unnecessary because such relief is then a formality or otherwise inappropriate.dionne bouley,cir.at the same time,the court recognized that t here may be situations where a class certification under rule b will arguably be unnecessary,but where other considerations may render a denial of certification improper,such as the risk of mootness,the possibility of a defendant in the court decision,or where class certification would not burden the court.id.at.we find the first circuit approach persuasive.
accordingly,we hold today that necessity is not a freestanding requirement justifying the denial of class certification however,it may be considered to the extent it is relevant to the enumerated rule criteria,including that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief be appropriate respecting the class as a whole.fed.civ.b.that is,there may be circumstances where class certification is not appropriate because in view of the declaratory or injunctive relief ordered on an individual basis,there would be no meaningful additional benefit to prospective class members in ordering classwide relief.see,galvan,at affirming a district court denial of class certification because the defendant has made clear that it understands the judgment to bind it with respect to all claimants indeed even before entry of the judgment,it withdrew the challenged policy even more fully than the court ultimately directed and stated it did not intend to reinstate the policy.
the circumstances in which classwide relief offers no further benefit,however,will be rare,and courts should exercise great caution before denying class certification on that basis.after all,the imposition of individual relief is no guarantee it will be carried over to other class members.see gurmankin costanzo,cir.recognizing in a different context that stare decisis alone will not always cause a defendant to abide by a holding with respect to similarly situated individuals and that,in such circumstances,a district court might need to grant more effective remedial relief.indeed,as the government cautioned in its briefing on appeal,as a matter of practice,the department of justice may choose to acquiesce in a particular district court decision,but such acquiescence is not as a matter of law,gov t ltr.br.at,and that is borne out in practice.for example,even when a court of appeals has struck down a law or regulation,the government has sometimes ceased enforcement only in that circuit and otherwise continued to apply it nationwide,cen att y,cir.
where class certification is denied on the ground of necessity,yet class members continue to be subjected to injury,their only option may be to undertake the expense,burden,and risk of instituting their own litigation barriers that in many cases will be prohibitive.the consequences can be significant for those who would otherwise benefit from the relief afforded by rule b,a rule designed specifically for civil rights cases seeking broad declaratory or injunctive relief for a numerous and often unascertainable or amorphous class of persons.baby neal ex rel.kanter casey,cir.quoting newberg conte,newberg on class actions,at see also fed.civ.advisory committee note explaining that i llustrative of rule b class actions are various actions in the field where a party is charged with discriminating unlawfully against a class,usually one whose members are incapable of specific enumeration.a failure to exercise careful scrutiny before denying certification as unnecessary risks plac ing the defendant in the driver seat,and allowing the defendant to,in essence,unilaterally prevent classwide relief.campbell ewald gomez,d rejecting a defendant gambit to moot a rule b class action by offering a settlement that the named plaintiffs did not accept 
with these concerns in mind,courts must engage in a rigorous analysis of the appropriateness of b relief,as well as the other rule criteria,before denying class certification.see falcon,at.byrd aaron,cir.as our sister circuits have recognized,a court must do more than assume or hypothesize that a ruling on the claims of an individual plaintiff will accrue to the benefit of the class.see,galvan,at.health care ass,at affirming the district court denial of certification in a challenge to a state medicare reimbursement plan as unnecessary because the district court found that we have no reason to doubt that defendants would apply any changes made to the reimbursement formula uniformly to nursing homes in kansas.
rather,courts should scrutinize with care the representation that classwide relief is not necessary and consider,among other things the nature of the claims and of the parties the relief available to an individual plaintiff and the extent to which that relief would benefit putative class members the strength of the evidence that a defendant will abide by a court ruling on an individual plaintiff claim with respect to others who are similarly situated the ease with which putative class members would be able to vindicate their rights following a defendant noncompliance and whether there are other circumstances,such as impending mootness of the individual claims,that nonetheless render classwide relief appropriate,fed.civ.b to facilitate appellate review,courts should make explicit findings before denying class certification on the ground that classwide relief is not appropriate.
here,without the benefit of the guidance we have provided today,the district court
