riad yacoub sad appeals the denial of his application for suspension of deportation,arguing that proper construction of the transitional provisions of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,stat.iirira,forecloses retroactive application of a rule to his application.he also challenges the rule on due process and equal protection grounds.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the board of immigration appeals.
factual and procedural background 
sad,a jordanian national and citizen,entered the united states as a nonimmigrant visitor on march.when his temporary authorization to enter the country expired on september,sad remained in the united states and settled outside detroit.on june,the immigration and naturalization service ins served sad with an order to show cause and notice of hearing ordering sad to appear before an immigration judge ij to show cause why he should not be deported.
claiming extreme hardship for his wife and children,sad sought relief from deportation by applying for suspension of deportation,one condition of which requires continuous physical presence in the united states for seven years.under the law as it then existed,an alien could satisfy this requirement at any point after proceedings before the ins had begun.while petitioner application for suspension of deportation was pending,congress overhauled the nation immigration laws by enacting the iirira.under this regime,congress created a rule pursuant to which an alien must establish continuous physical presence prior to the initiation of deportation or removal proceedings.the iirira transitional rules for handling pending cases incorporate the rule.
applying the iirira transitional rule to sad application for suspension of deportation,an ij sitting in detroit pretermitted sad application on the ground that he had failed to establish physical presence in the united states for seven years prior to being served with the order to show cause.the ij preserved sad challenge to the application of this rule to his case for consideration in an appropriate forum.on the authority of its interpretation of the rule in in re,int,wl bia en banc,the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the ij denial of sad application for suspension of deportation and dismissed his appeal.maintaining that the statute precludes application of the rule to petitions for suspension of deportation pending at the time of the iirira enactment,sad timely appealed.
ii.construction of the iirira transitional rule 
this case presents a question of statutory interpretation,which this court reviews de novo.mustata united states dep t of justice,cir.principles of judicial deference to an agency construction of a statute,however,limit the scope of our inquiry.in ins,d,the supreme court determined that the doctrine of chevron,natural resources defense council,d defining the circumstances under which courts must defer to an agency construction of a statute,applies to the statutory scheme created by the immigration and nationality act ina.the court recognized immigration matters as particularly appropriate for judicial deference because executive officials exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations.id.at.even before the supreme court decided,we applied principles of judicial deference under chevron to interpretation of the ina.hamama ins,cir.although aguirre aguirre and hamama both involved interpretation of a statutory definition not relevant here,they announced a rule of deference applicable to most if not all of the statutory scheme created by congressional delegation to the attorney general and the bia to administer and apply the immigration laws.therefore,chevron principles control our review of the statute at issue here.
the threshold inquiry under chevron is whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.at.if so,the agency and the courts must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.courts may employ traditional tools of statutory construction in determining congressional intent under this threshold inquiry.id.at.if the statute is ambiguous,however,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.under this secondary inquiry,the court need not conclude that the agency construction was the only one it could have adopted or the reading a court would have reached.id.at.if the agency construction is permissible,it controls unless arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.
a.the transitional rule 
prior to enactment of the iirira,aliens facing deportation could apply for suspension of deportation if they satisfied three conditions.ina a,a.one of these conditions required the applicant to demonstrate continuous physical presence in the united states for seven years.id.satisfying all three conditions,however,did not entitle an alien to suspension of deportation.rather,the attorney general in his discretion could grant the relief.deportation proceedings began under the ina when the ins served an alien with an order to show cause.during the pendency of proceedings,aliens continued to accrue time toward the physical presence requirement.therefore,aliens could become eligible for suspension of deportation during the course of administrative proceedings before the ins.
the iirira amendments to the ina altered this framework.congress replaced deportation with a procedure called removal.iirira.in addition,the iirira substituted suspension of deportation with a more limited form of discretionary relief known as cancellation of removal,which contains additional eligibility requirements.iirira a.for purposes of this case,the most significant change effected by the iirira concerns the creation of the rule.rather than allowing aliens to continue accruing time toward the physical presence requirement once administrative proceedings commenced,as happened under the ina,the iirira terminates the accrual of time toward the physical presence requirement when the ins serves an alien with a notice to appear,a document that the iirira created and that operates like an order to show cause under the ina.hence,under the iirira framework,an alien can no longer accumulate time toward satisfaction of the continuous physical presence requirement after the ins initiates removal proceedings.the change from a deportation to a removal system had an effective date,the title effective date,of april.
the iirira contains transitional rules to govern cases pending as of the september,date of the iirira enactment.section of the iirira contains the relevant transitional rules the ins applied in sad case 
c transition for aliens in proceedings.
general rule that new rules do not apply.subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection,in the case of an alien who is in exclusion proceedings as of the title effective date 
a the amendments made by this subtitle shall not apply,and 
b the proceedings including judicial review thereof shall continue to be conducted without regard to such amendments.
transitional rule with regard to suspension of deportation.paragraphs and of section d of the immigration and nationality act relating to continuous residence or physical presence shall apply to notices to appear issued before,on,or after the date of the enactment of this act.
iirira emphasis added.section d of the ina,referenced in this section,contains the new rule and provides 
d special rules relating to continuous residence or physical presence 
termination of continuous period.for purposes of this section,any period of continuous residence or continuous physical presence in the united states shall be deemed to end when the alien is served a notice to appear.
ina d,d emphasis added.therefore,because section c embodies an express exception to the general rule of nonapplicability contained in section c a,this transitional rule attempts to apply the rule to pending applications for suspension of deportation.because notices to appear did not exist prior to the effective date of the iirira,however,section c presents a facial ambiguity either notices to appear encompasses orders to show cause or the reference to notices to appear issued before the effective date of the iirira is an error in drafting.additionally,section employs the terminology of the new removal regime while the transitional rule attempts to apply it to deportation proceedings initiated by orders to show cause.in other words,the transitional rule applies the rule to pending cases initiated by a notice to appear prior to the iirira effective date even though notices to appear did not initiate administrative proceedings until after the iirira effective date.
the bia addressed this interpretative dilemma in in re,int,wl bia en banc,by broadly construing notices to appear in section c to encompass other documents,including orders to show cause,initiating deportation or removal proceedings.under this interpretation,aliens who failed to satisfy the physical presence requirement prior to being served with an order to show cause became ineligible for suspension of deportation.the attorney general vacated and certified the case to herself for review.att y order july.before she could review the decision,however,congress enacted the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act,stat.nacara,as a clarifying amendment to the iirira.the nacara amended the rule by replacing notices to appear in section c with orders to show cause and making this amendment effective as if included in the iirira.nacara a and f.after the amendment,then,the iirira transitional rule regarding suspension of deportation now reads as follows 
transitional rule with regard to suspension of deportation.subject to paragraphs b and c,paragraphs and of section d of the immigration and nationality act relating to continuous residence or physical presence shall apply to orders to show cause including those referred to in section a of the immigration and nationality act as in effect before the title effective date,issued before,on,or after the date of the enactment of this act.
nacara a new language in italics.section of the ina,parenthetically referenced,was codified at and simply contains the provisions regarding the contents of orders to show cause.the initial subject to clause creates two exceptions to the retroactive application of the amended transitional rule.first,congress clarified that if the attorney general chooses to terminate deportation proceedings and reinstate removal proceedings,the rule does not apply.nacara a.this clarification changes the default rule under the general transitional rules for aliens already in proceedings that the rule applies when the attorney general terminates then reinitiates proceedings.iirira c and.in such cases,an alien who had been served with an order to show cause would have an opportunity to apply for cancellation of removal.second,the nacara exempted certain aliens from nicaragua,guatemala,and eastern europe from application of the rule in all circumstances.nacara a.the nacara only amended the iirira transitional rule and did not change the language of the rule itself found in section d.
in in re,int,wl bia en banc,the bia considered whether the iirira transitional rule as amended by the nacara applies the rule to pending applications for suspension of deportation when calculating an alien continuous physical presence in the united states.finding the revised language of the transitional rule to be unambiguous,the majority decided that the rule applies to all pending deportation proceedings unless an alien satisfies one of the express statutory exemptions.id.three of the bia sixteen members concurred separately.agreeing that the majority reading of the statute was reasonable,they noted that its language was not plain on its face and unambiguous because of the incongruity of the terminology employed by the rule in section d of the ina and by the transitional rule in section c of the iirira as amended by the nacara.id.
application of chevron 
the threshold consideration under chevron is whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.at.if so,the agency and the courts must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.respondent argues that the rule as amended unambiguously applies the rule to pending applications for suspension of deportation,obviating the need for further inquiry.recently,panels of this court examined the issue and accepted this argument.ins,cir ashki ins,cir.likewise,other circuits have found the statutory language as amended clear on its face.ins,cir ram ins,cir.ins,cir reno,cir afolayan ins,cir ins,cir per curiam ins,cir appiah ins,cir,cert.denied,d tefel reno,cir,cert denied,d.
no court has addressed the merits of sad proposed interpretation of the transitional rules,the plausibility of which the ins concedes.his reading builds on the observation of the concurring members of the bia in in re that,even as amended,the transitional rules for applying the rule to pending applications for suspension of deportation mediate imperfectly between two different statutory regimes.sad points out that the amended transitional rule in section c by its own terms references the rule in section d,which in turn terminates the accrual of time toward satisfaction of the continuous physical presence requirement only when the ins serves an alien with a notice to appear.ina d,d.the nacara amendment adding orders to show cause to section c did not make a similar change in section d and so the rule can not apply to sad application for suspension of deportation.under this reading,the transitional rule of section c of the iirira embodies the limits of the rule retroactive application.section c offers the attorney general the option of proceeding with pending cases,the processing of which had not commenced as of april,under the new statutory regime.in this case,sad posits,an alien would be ineligible for suspension of deportation because such relief no longer exists under the iirira,but could seek cancellation of removal under section.then,section d requires that the alien period of continuous physical presence stop accruing upon service of the order to show cause that initiated proceedings.in response,the ins accepts sad reading as a potentially valid interpretation of the transitional rules,but asserts that the rule is not limited only to pending cases in which the attorney general elects to apply the new procedures and substantive legal standards of the iirira.because these provisions credibly admit of multiple interpretations,we can not say under chevron threshold inquiry that the transitional rules of the iirira as amended by the nacara are unambiguous.
we next ask whether the agency construction of the statute is permissible.there is no question that the bia interpretation of the statute controls for chevron purposes.prior to the enactment of the iirira,congress had delegated to the attorney general discretionary authority to make determinations regarding applications for suspension of deportation.ina a,a.creation of the new removal regime did not alter this framework.ina a,a the attorney general may cancel removal in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the united states if certain conditions are met.the attorney general has delegated this authority to the bia.d.therefore,for purposes of the chevron analysis,the bia interpretation of the rule in in re merits deference if based on a permissible construction of the statute.the bia should be accorded chevron deference as it gives ambiguous statutory terms concrete meaning through a process of adjudication,at.quoting ins,d.sad has presented no argument that the bia interpretation is impermissible other than that it is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statutory language as he construes it.indeed,that the bia,this court,and several other circuits have accepted a differing reading suggests that the statutory language may not be quite so lucid as sad contends.at most,sad proposed reading of the statute points to and relies on ambiguities in its language.in such circumstances,we must defer to the permissible interpretation offered by the bia.nor has sad argued that th
