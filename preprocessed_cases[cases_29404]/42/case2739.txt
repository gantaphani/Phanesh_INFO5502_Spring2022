shoodley cherichel,a native and citizen of haiti,petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his application for deferral of removal under the convention against torture cat and ordering him removed to haiti.cherichel argues that the bia erred in applying a more onerous definition of specific intent under the cat than was used by the immigration judge ij.for the following reasons,we deny the petition.
factual background 
shoodley cherichel was born in haiti on november.although he does not remember coming to the united states,it appears that he entered the united states without inspection sometime between and.since that time,cherichel has never returned to haiti.he does not speak creole,haiti official language,and understands very little creole when it is spoken to him.his mother,meprisena themistol,is a naturalized citizen,and he believes his siblings are also citizens.to his knowledge,cherichel has no family members currently living in haiti.
on april,cherichel pled guilty to possession of marijuana in a kentucky state court.on january,he was convicted in a minnesota state court of criminal vehicular homicide and criminal vehicular operation resulting in substantial bodily harm,for which he received and served a sentence.the immigration and naturalization service ins served cherichel with a notice to appear nta on september.the nta charged that cherichel was subject to removal for being an alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled,in violation of section a a i of the immigration and nationality act ina,a a i.removal proceedings commenced on november.in,dhs also charged cherichel with removability under ina a a i ii,a a i ii,as being an alien who has been convicted of violating a law relating to a controlled substance,based on his kentucky conviction 
immigration judge decision 
between january,and march,cherichel had various removal hearings before immigration judge kristin olmanson cherichel asserted three arguments before the ij that he should be granted asylum under ina,that he was eligible for withholding of removal under ina b,and that his removal should be deferred under article of the cat.at his final hearing on march,cherichel testified that he was afraid to return to haiti because he has no family there,and that he feared persecution in haiti based on his american physical characteristics and ability.additionally,cherichel submitted extensive evidence concerning country and prison conditions in haiti.
in an opinion dated may,the ij found cherichel removable on two of the three grounds charged.specifically,the ij found that cherichel was not eligible for asylum under ina because he failed to file for asylum within one year of his arrival or within a reasonable period of time after reaching the age of,see ina a b,a b,and that he was not eligible for withholding of removal because his minnesota convictions constituted particularly serious crimes under the ina,see ina b b ii,b b ii.however,the ij granted cherichel application for deferral of removal under the cat,finding that he had met his burden of proving that,as a criminal deportee,it is more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to haiti 
first,the ij noted that cherichel provided extensive reports and country conditions in haiti and the deplorable conditions in haitian prisons and police stations where uncharged detainees are often held.this included a lack of basic hygiene,lack of food and water,a large number of malnourished prisoners,and severe overcrowding in cells with no toilet or sink.second,the ij noted that in the previous five years,prison conditions in haiti had not improved,but in fact had worsened.third,criminal deportees who had not broken any haitian laws were held by authorities despite a haitian court ruling prohibiting such detention.fourth,unless a family member was able to claim responsibility for them,criminal deportees could be detained indefinitely.fifth,the ij noted that cherichel had been in the united states for years and could be identified in haiti as an american because of his physical appearance,mannerisms,and inability to speak creole.based on this evidence,the ij found that it was more likely than not that cherichel would be tortured if removed to haiti,and therefore granted cherichel application for deferral of removal.
bia decisions 
the bia granted dhs appeal from the ij decision,vacated the grant of deferral under the cat,and ordered cherichel removed to haiti.in re shoodley lee cherichel,file no.bia.the bia held that the ij erred in finding that cherichel had met his burden of establishing cat relief.specifically,although it found no clear error in the ij findings regarding abysmal prison conditions in haiti,the bia held that those conditions do not rise to the level of torture because the record does not reflect that haitian authorities specifically intend to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering to criminal deportees such as cherichel.id.at quotation omitted.the bia also held that the circumstances presented here are not significantly distinct from those we considered in in re,bia,overruled on other grounds by azanor ashcroft,cir.id.at.
cherichel appealed the bia decision to this court.in lieu of issuing a formal opinion,we granted the government motion to remand the case back to the bia for reconsideration in light of its scope of review.cherichel mukasey,slip op.at cir.on remand,the bia again ordered cherichel removed to haiti.in re shoodley lee cherichel,file no.bia.after holding that no additional was required,the bia reviewed de novo the ij findings regarding eligibility for relief under the cat.id.at.the bia held that none of the facts found by the ij,including those that differentiated cherichel from the petitioner in in re,show ed that haitian authorities,in their treatment of criminal deportees,specifically intend to inflict torture.id.at.therefore,the bia held that cherichel had failed to meet his burden of proof under the cat and ordered him removed to haiti.
cherichel appeals,arguing that the bia applied an incorrect definition of specific intent to the cat intent requirement.in deciding the correct legal definition to apply,we first review the history and codification of the cat,as well as how the cat and its implementing regulations have been subsequently interpreted.
history of the cat 
the ratification history of the cat and its subsequent enactment into domestic law have been thoroughly examined.see auguste ridge,cir in re,at see generally herman burgers hans danelius,the united nations convention against torture a handbook on the convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.while we see no need to repeat that examination here,some discussion of the history of the cat is necessary to our analysis.
the cat was adopted by the united nations general assembly on december,see convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,treaty doc.it has as its stated purpose to make more effective the struggle against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment throughout the world.id.pmbl.to accomplish this goal,article of the cat requires e ach state party to take effective legislative,administrative,judicial or other measures to prevent such acts of torture in any territory under its jurisdiction.id.additionally,article provides that n o state party shall expel,return refouler or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.id.the cat defines torture as 
any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession,punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed,or intimidating or coercing him or a third person,or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind,whether such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.it does not include pain or suffering arising only from,inherent in or incident to lawful sanctions.
president reagan signed the cat on april,and sent it to the senate for advice and consent on may.id.at iii.importantly,president reagan and later president george bush proposed,and the senate eventually adopted,a number of reservations,understandings,and declarations pertaining to the cat,two of which are relevant to this case.first,with respect to the definition of torture under article,president bush proposed the understanding that in order to constitute torture,an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.exec,at.second,president bush proposed that t he united states understands the phrase where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture as used in article of the convention,to mean if it is more likely than not that he would be tortured.id.at.
although the cat had been signed by the president and ratified by the senate,it was not,which means there is no direct right of action for violation of the treaty,only for violation of any domestic law implementing the treaty.raffington cangemi,cir see also auguste,at citing cases.congress implemented the cat with the passage of the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of farra,div.g,title xxii,stat,codified as note to 
the first section of farra states that i t shall be the policy of the united states not to expel,extradite,or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture.id.to achieve this goal,farra directs the heads of the appropriate agencies to prescribe regulations to implement the obligations of the united states under article of the cat,subject to any reservations,understandings,declarations,and provisos contained in the united states senate resolution of ratification of the convention.id.
pursuant to farra,the department of justice doj promulgated regulations setting forth the procedures under which a person could seek relief under the cat.see regulations concerning the convention against torture,codified at c a.section a defines the terms to be used in applying the united states obligations under the cat,which incorporate the definition of torture contained in article of the cat,subject to the reservations,understandings,declarations,and provisos contained in the united states senate resolution of ratification of the convention.a.instead of enumerating acts that could constitute torture,a combines the senate understandings with article of the cat to formulate a basic,general definition of torture 
torture is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession,punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed,or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person,or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind,when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.
torture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.
torture does not include pain or suffering arising only from,inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions 
in order to constitute torture,an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.an act that results in unanticipated or unintended severity of pain and suffering is not torture.
acquiescence of a public official requires that the public official,prior to the activity constituting torture,have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.
id.emphasis added.the regulations also import the more likely than not standard for proving torture that was contained in both the president and senate understandings of the cat.see c.once a petitioner has met this standard,withholding of removal or deferral of removal is mandatory c,a.
thus,all three important united states understandings of the cat,the law giving the cat domestic effect,and the regulations implementing that effect in the immigration the understandings of the president and the senate that,in order to constitute torture,an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe pain or suffering.
in,the bia considered the issue of whether indefinite detention,inhuman prison conditions,and police mistreatment constitute torturous acts under the cat.in re,at.there,a native and citizen of haiti who had resided in the united states for approximately ten years and had been convicted of the sale of cocaine in florida,was ordered removed to haiti.id.at.at his removal hearing,the petitioner introduced evidence showing that if he were removed to haiti,he would be detained under deplorable conditions id.at.those conditions included prison facilities that are overcrowded and inadequate,where prisoners,many of whom are malnourished,are deprived of adequate food,water,medical care,sanitation,and exercise.id.at the conclusion of the hearing,the ij nevertheless found the petitioner ineligible for cat relief.id.
on appeal,the bia began its analysis with an examination of the ratification history of the cat and its implementing regulations.id.at.after noting that the regulatory definition of torture in a governed its decision,the bia summarized that definition to develop a test for cat claims for an act to constitute torture it must be an act causing severe physical or mental pain or suffering intentionally inflicted for a proscribed purpose by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official and not arising from lawful sanctions.id.at.in discussing the level of intent required,the bia noted that an act that results in unanticipated or unintended severity of pain or suffering does not constitute torture.id.at.
the bia then turned to the question of whether any of the specific state actions alleged by the detention,inhuman prison conditions,and police torture within the meaning of the regulations.id.at.examining first the petitioner claim that he would be indefinitely detained by haitian authorities,the bia found it undisputed that the respondent will be subject to detention of an indeterminate length on his return to haiti.id.this detention of criminal deportees is designed by the haitian government as a deterrent,to prevent the bandits from increasing the level of insecurity and crime in the country.id.at quotation omitted.as such,the bia found that the detention of criminal deportees did not constitute torture,because it is a lawful enforcement sanction designed to protect the populace from criminal acts committed by haitians who are forced to return to the country after having been convicted of crimes abroad.id.
turning next to the petitioner claim that indefinite detention,coupled with inhuman prison conditions,amounted to torture,the bia noted that an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe pain or suffering in order to constitute torture.id.the bia found this to be a specific intent requirement,not a general intent requirement.id.at.citing the legal definition of specific intent the bia found that haitian authorities did not have the specific intent to inflict severe pain or suffering when they imprisoned criminal deportees in harsh conditions because there is no evidence that they are intentionally and deliberately creating and maintaining such prison conditions in order to inflict torture.id.at.instead,the harsh conditions are the result of budgetary and management problems as well as the country severe economic difficulties.id.as such,the detention of criminal deportees did not amount to torture,despite the fact that haitian authorities are intentionally detaining criminal deportees knowing that the detention facilities are substandard.id.
finally,in addressing the petitioner claim that physical mistreatment by haitian authorities would amount to torture the bia held that the evidence showed only isolated instances of mistreatment in haitian prisons that rise to the level of torture.id.at.this was insufficient to meet the petitioner burden of proof of showing that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured.id.at.based on the foregoing findings,the bia dismissed the appeal.id.at.
cherichel argues that the bia erred as a matter of law by applying the incorrect definition of specific intent to the cat intent requirement.according to cherichel,the cat intent requirement is satisfied if severe physical or mental pain or suffering is merely the foreseeable consequence of a deliberate act.cherichel argues that this foreseeability standard was adopted by the ij and is consistent with eighth circuit caselaw.he also argues that the more onerous specific intent standard applied by the bia causes the united states to hold the haitian government to a lower standard than the united states holds its own interrogators.finally,cherichel contends that even under the more onerous specific intent standard adopted by the bia,he is entitled to cat relief because it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to haiti.we address these arguments seriatim.
standard of review 
because cherichel was ordered removed based in part on his kentucky conviction for possession of marijuana,his removal implicates a c,which purports to eliminate from appellate jurisdiction any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense involving controlled substances or crimes of moral turpitude.section a d,however,restores appellate jurisdiction to review such removal orders but limits review to constitutional claims or questions of law.a d.because defining the correct legal standard of specific intent to apply to the cat intent requirement is a question of law,we retain jurisdiction over cherichel appeal pursuant to a d.
we review questions of law de novo and accord substantial deference to the bia interpretation of immigration law and agency regulations.kim holder,cir,cert.denied,d quoting gonzales,cir.thus,because the regulations implementing the cat are immigration regulations within the purview of the bia,the bia interpretation of those regulations should generally be accorded substantial deference.see malonga mukasey,cir see also pierre gonzales,cir as to the cat regulations where the bia interprets a regulation promulgated by the attorney general under the ina,we afford substantial deference to the bia interpretation,unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,or inconsistent with the agency previous interpretation.quotations omitted.this deference may be qualified to the extent that the bia reading of the regulation is a reading of terms that have application outside the context of immigration.pierre,at factual determinations made by the ij are outside the scope of our review unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.
the specific issue before the court concerns the degree of intent cherichel future captors must have in order for cherichel to be able to obtain cat relief.in in re,the bia held that,in the context of criminal deportees being return to haiti,petitioners must prove that haitian authorities specifically intend to torture that is,that they intentionally and deliberately creat e and maintain abysmal prison conditions in order to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.at.this decision has commanded deference from several circuits.see,elien ashcroft,cir pierre,at second circuit pierre att y,cir en banc auguste,at third circuit villegas mukasey,cir cadet bulger,cir.indeed,n o federal circuit court considering the case of a haitian criminal deportee has declined to follow in re.pierre,at see also villegas,at every other circuit to consider the question has concluded that torture under the cat requires specific intent to inflict harm.
in its thorough opinion in auguste,the third circuit rejected a haitian national argument that indefinite detention under deplorable conditions amounted to torture.at.relying on the cat ratification history,the court found that the cat contained a specific intent requirement,and that this requirement was carried into domestic law by the cat implementing regulations.id.at.the court went on to affirm the bia adoption of a definition of specific intent that was in accord with the term ordinary meaning in american law.id.at.the court noted that the supreme court has held that,in order to act with specific intent,an actor must expressly intend to achieve the forbidden act.id.citing carter united states,d.in the context of the cat,this means a prospective torturer must have the intent to commit the torturous act as well as the intent to achieve the consequences of the act,namely the infliction of the severe pain and suffering.id.at.a showing that severe pain and suffering is foreseeable,but not intended,was held to be insufficient to establish specific intent.id.at.
this formulation of the cat specific intent requirement was affirmed en banc by the third circuit in pierre.at.there,the petitioner did not dispute that the cat contained a specific intent requirement.id.rather,the petitioner argued that the requirement was satisfied by a showing that the haitian officials have knowledge that severe pain or suffering is the practically certain outcome of his imprisonment.id.the court disagreed,and affirmed the auguste court definition of specific intent as including the intent to commit the act as well as the intent to achieve the consequences of the act.id.quoting auguste,at.the court elaborated 
specific intent requires not simply the general intent to accomplish an act with no particular end in mind,but the additional deliberate and conscious purpose of accomplishing a specific and prohibited result.mere knowledge that a result is substantially certain to follow from one actions is not sufficient to form the specific intent to torture.knowledge that pain and suffering will be the certain outcome of conduct may be sufficient for a finding of general intent but it is not enough for a finding of specific intent.
similarly,the second circuit has rejected an argument that haiti indefinite detention of criminal deportees amounts to torture in light of the prevailing prison conditions,pierre,at,holding that the cat specific intent requirement incorporates a criminal specific intent standard,id.at.this standard requires that the actor intend the actual consequences of his conduct as distinguished from the act that causes these consequences.id.the court declined to hold that specific intent can be established through willful blindness or deliberate indifference,noting that those concepts,which may bear on knowledge to the extent they establish conscious avoidance,can not without more demonstrate specific intent.id.in distinguishing the cat specific intent requirement from a general intent requirement,the court noted that t he president and senate knew full well that they were construing a treaty designed to stop criminal conduct.we can not ignore the word specifically in the ratification understanding and the regulations,and we decline to give it a spin.id.footnote omitted.
our own analysis begins with the language of the cat itself.article defines torture as any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person for a proscribed purpose,treaty doc.emphasis added.the understandings of this definition,articulated by both the president and the senate,make clear that the intentionally inflicted requirement means an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering to qualify as torture.exec,at,emphasis added.thus,we are presented with a situation where both the president and the senate,the two institutions of the federal government with constitutional roles in the process,agreed during the ratification stage that their understanding of the definition of torture contained in article of the cat included a specific intent requirement.auguste,at.these understandings were carried into the domestic realm through farra and a,which incorporate the cat definition of torture subject to the reservations,understandings,declarations,and provisos contained in the united states senate resolution of ratification of the convention.see farra a.given such clear evidence,we find it beyond dispute that the cat and its implementing regulations include a specific intent requirement.see also restatement third of the foreign relations law of the united states cmt.d a treaty that is ratified or acceded to by the united states with a statement of understanding becomes effective in domestic law subject to that understanding.
we next turn to the substantive question of what this specific intent requirement means in the cat context,and whether the bia erred in defining specific intent with reference to its ordinary meaning in american law.cherichel acknowledges that the cat contains a specific intent requirement,but argues that it is satisfied if severe physical or mental pain or suffering is the foreseeable consequence of a deliberate act.
specific intent is a term of art in american jurisprudence,well known to practitioners and law students alike.see auguste,at united states sawyer,cir.although the term is not always defined or applied consistently,see joshua dressler,understanding criminal law ed wayne lafave,substantive criminal law e ed,under its usual definition,specific intent is t he intent to accomplish the precise criminal act that one is later charged with,black law dictionary ed.this definition is used throughout criminal law.see,carter,at.noting that specific intent requires an intent to achieve the prohibited act vacco quill,d t he law distinguishes actions taken because of a given end from actions taken in spite of their unintended but foreseen consequences.quoting pers.adm r of feeney,d united states bartlett,cir quoting jury instructions that t o establish specific intent the government must prove that the defendant knowingly did an act which the law forbids,purposefully intending to violate the law d criminal law providing that specific intent requires not simply the general intent to do the immediate act with no particular end in mind,but the additional deliberate and conscious purpose or design of accomplishing a very specific and more remote result mere knowledge that a result is substantially certain to follow from one actions is not the same as the specific intent or desire to achieve that result.this definition has been adopted by every circuit to address the issue of specific intent in the context of haitian criminal deportees seeking cat relief.see villegas,at.
in contrast,general intent is intent to perform an act even though the actor does not desire the consequences that result,and often takes the form of recklessness or negligence.black law dictionary,supra,at see also lafave,supra,e,at g eneral intent is only the intention to make the bodily movement which constitutes the act which the crime requires.quotation omitted d criminal law.the two forms of intent are often contrasted against one another.for example,the supreme court has noted that purpose corresponds loosely with the concept of specific intent,while knowledge corresponds loosely with the concept of general intent.united states bailey,d.the carter court used an example to help distinguish between general and specific intent 
a person entered a bank and took money from a teller at gunpoint,but deliberately failed to make a quick getaway from the bank in the hope of being arrested so that he would be returned to prison and treated for alcoholism.though this defendant knowingly engaged in the acts of using force and taking money satisfying general intent,he did not intend permanently to deprive the bank of its possession of the money failing to satisfy specific intent.
carter,at.citing united states lewis,cir.
it is this definition of specific the actor must intend both the prohibited act and its prohibited the bia properly applied both in this case and in in re.specific intent is a term of art with a,legal definition.the circuit has eloquently noted that w here congress borrows a term of art in which is accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice,it presumably knows and adopts the meaning its uses conveys to the judicial mind,and in such a case,in the absence of a contrary direction,its use may be taken as satisfaction with widely accepted definitions and not a departure from them.united states bailey,rev on other grounds,d citing morissette united states.see also refling burnet,cir where words have acquired a meaning by judicial interpretation,it is to be presumed that they are used in that sense in a subsequent statute,unless the contrary clearly appears.quoting united states freight ass n,cir.we believe the same principle applies when interpreting regulations that incorporate the understandings of both the president and the senate.
therefore,we hold that the phrase specifically intended contains a specific intent standard,as that standard is used in american criminal law.this means that a petitioner may not obtain relief under the cat unless he can show that his prospective torturer has the goal or intent of inflicting severe physical or mental pain or suffering upon him we reject the argument that a showing that pain or suffering is practically certain to occur can establish specific intent that is not the law.as the pierre court noted we can not ignore the word specifically in the ratification understanding and the regulations,and we decline to give it a spin.at.we also can not ignore the phrase specifically intended in the cat implementing regulations,and we give it its ordinary meaning in american law.
our reading of the plain language of the cat and its implementing regulations is not based on,but is confirmed by,the bia interpretation in in re.see pierre,at the deference we owe to the bia analysis in in re simply confirms the understanding we derive from plain meaning.in in re,the bia engaged in the same analysis in which we have engaged here and simply applied the traditional meaning of specific intent to the cat context.see at.because we derive our holding from the plain language of the regulations,we express no opinion on cherichel argument that the bia interpretation of specific intent is not entitled to deference 
cherichel relies heavily upon our decision in habtemicael ashcroft,cir,for the proposition that,in the cat context,the specific intent element is satisfied by a showing that severe physical or mental pain or suffering is the foreseeable consequence of a deliberate act.in habtemicael,an ethiopian national who had been conscripted for service in the eritrean liberation movement sought asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.id.at.habtemicael cat claim was based on his fear that if returned to eritrea,the government would persecute or torture him because of his ideological opposition to the eritrean people liberation front,his escape from an eplf camp in during which two eplf soldiers were killed,and his failure to make the payments required for expatriates to have an eritrean identity card.id.at.following a hearing,the ij found that any punishment habtemicael received if returned to eritrea,including the death penalty,would be incidental to lawful sanctions and thus not torture under the cat because a government has authority to punish and even execute individuals who avoid conscription or desert military forces during wartime.id.at.the bia affirmed without opinion,and habtemicael appealed.id.
on appeal,we reversed the ij ruling on habtemicael cat claim and remand ed for further findings as to whether habtemicael is more likely than not to suffer torture within the meaning of the convention if returned to eritrea.id.at.we based this reversal on the ij failure to make findings as to whether the eplf had
