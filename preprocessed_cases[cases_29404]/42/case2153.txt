background 
akhtar is a twenty nine year old native and citizen of pakistan.he and his family are mohajirs,muslims who migrated from india to pakistan during and after the partition of british india in.the mohajirs are concentrated in the sindh province of pakistan,which includes the city of karachi,where akhtar lived with his family.due to their generally superior education and abilities,the mohajirs have been able to secure desirable positions in local government and business.nonetheless,they have been subjected to a certain degree of institutional discrimination through quota systems that limit their access to education and employment opportunities.
in the early,akhtar father joined the mohajir qaumi movement mqm,a political party representing the collective interests of the mohajirs.the mqm eventually split into two factions,the mqm altaf mqm a and the mqm haqiqi mqm h.hostility among the two groups and government authorities has led to continuing civil unrest and violence in the sindh province and in the city of karachi.responding to the resulting conflict,the federal government called in the military in the early to eliminate terrorist political groups.members of mqm a were allegedly abducted,tortured,and killed by members of mqm h and law enforcement officials.the military was withdrawn in,but the raids,abductions,and fighting between the two factions have apparently continued.
in july,akhtar,then eighteen years old,entered the united states on a visitor visa because his parents wanted him to escape the political violence of karachi.a few months later,akhtar father was murdered and his mother wounded in front of their house in karachi due to their involvement in the mqm a.after a period of mourning,akhtar mother and his three siblings came to the united states,where they joined akhtar in june.
in the asylum application submitted by akhtar mother to the immigration and naturalization service in,akhtar and his siblings were included as derivative beneficiaries.although his mother was eventually granted asylum in,akhtar had aged out in the interim by reaching his birthday,and thus no longer qualified as a derivative beneficiary.in october,the ins served akhtar with a notice to appear,alleging that he was subject to removal because he had overstayed his visitor visa.at the initial master calendar hearing before the immigration court,akhtar,through his attorney,conceded that he was removable as charged,but renewed his applications for asylum and withholding of removal.akhtar also filed a claim for protection under the united nations convention against torture.
on november,a hearing was conducted regarding akhtar applications for relief from removal.at the hearing,akhtar testified that he had never been politically active in pakistan and had not participated in any mqm a activities.he stated that,although he was persistently recruited by several political parties while in college,he had no interest in joining them and his father had urged him not to become involved.in an oral decision,the ij acknowledged the tragic murder of akhtar father and the violent conditions in karachi,but was unconvinced that akhtar had suffered past persecution or harbored a fear of future persecution so as to exempt him from removal for overstaying his visa.in particular,the ij determined that akhtar,unlike his father,was apolitical and could not establish that he would be persecuted as a mohajir or as a member of his own immediate family upon his return to pakistan.because akhtar did not qualify for asylum,the ij concluded akhtar could not meet the more stringent requirements for withholding of removal and relief under the united nations convention against torture.
akhtar filed a timely notice of appeal to the board.in april,while his appeal was still pending,akhtar married regina field,a united states citizen.in may,akhtar new spouse filed with the ins a visa petition on behalf of akhtar,together with various supporting documents.on september,akhtar filed a motion to stay proceedings with the board so that the visa petition could be adjudicated.
on october,the board issued its order affirming the ij decision to deny akhtar applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.the board stated that it agreed with the ij finding that akhtar failed to establish eligibility for the various forms of relief he was seeking,and that he had presented no arguments on appeal mandating reversal.in addition,the board,sua sponte,construed akhtar motion to stay proceedings as a motion to reopen and remand to the ij so that akhtar could adjust his status to permanent resident based on his marriage to a united states citizen.but because akhtar had not submitted a copy of an application for adjustment of status as required by c,the board denied the motion.
in november,akhtar filed a timely petition for review of the board october,decision.shortly thereafter,akhtar filed with the board a motion styled as a motion to reopen and motion for stay of deportation and reinstatement of voluntary departure.among other things,akhtar claimed he had complied with matter of lozada,bia,a decision in which the board specified certain evidentiary requirements an alien must satisfy to support a motion to reopen based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.
on april,the board entered an order denying akhtar motion to reopen.the order stated that the motion was barred by numerical limitations because the board had already considered and rejected akhtar motion to stay proceedings,which the board had construed as a motion to reopen and remand.the order also stated that akhtar had not complied with matter of lozada and had not demonstrated that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.akhtar then filed a timely petition in this court for review of the board order.
ii.analysis 
the attorney general may grant asylum to an alien if the attorney general determines that the alien is a refugee.b.a refugee is any person who is outside of the country of such person nationality or last habitual residence and who is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of past persecution or a fear of future persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.a fear of future persecution must be both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.abay ashcroft,cir.
the subjective fear component turns largely upon the applicant own testimony and credibility.but the objective component requires the applicant to prove that either a there is a reasonable probability that he or she will be singled out individually for persecution,b i or that b there is a pattern or practice of persecution of an identifiable group,to which the alien demonstrates he belongs,such that the alien fear is reasonable,b iii.

resolution of a request for asylum involves a inquiry whether the applicant qualifies as a refugee as defined in a a,and whether the applicant merits a favorable exercise of discretion by the attorney general.ouda ins,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.regarding the first step,the united states supreme court has held that an ij determination whether an alien qualifies as a refugee must be upheld if supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d quoting a repealed and replaced by b b.the supreme court explained that to reverse such a finding,the evidence must not only support the opposite conclusion,but compel it.id.at.in articulating the substantial evidence standard,the supreme court quoted directly from a,which has subsequently been repealed and replaced by b b.section b b provides that administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.although articulated differently,b b basically codifies the supreme court substantial evidence standard.yu ashcroft,cir.regarding the second step in the asylum the applicant merits a favorable exercise of the attorney general ij discretionary judgment,on behalf of the attorney general,whether to grant asylum to an alien is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.b d yu,at.to the extent that the board adopts the reasoning of the ij,this court reviews the ij decision rather than the board decision.see denko ins,cir.
akhtar argues that the ij decision to deny his application for asylum is not supported by substantial evidence.he contends he has a fear of future persecution on account of his membership in two particular social group s the mohajirs and his own family.a a.the ij determined that there did not appear to be any linkage between the mohajirs and active persecution,and that akhtar family persecution,even if based on political opinion,could not be imputed to akhtar.
the mohajirs 
to support his argument that he is entitled to asylum based on his identity as a mohajir,akhtar submitted numerous newspaper accounts,country condition reports,and other documents detailing the tumultuous conditions that exist in karachi and the surrounding sindh province.akhtar,however,has not presented any evidence that he will be singled out for persecution as a mohajir,nor does the evidence in the record compel the conclusion that there is a pattern or practice of persecution against the mohajirs as an identifiable group.the record does establish that there is some institutional discrimination suffered by the mohajirs,but,as the ninth circuit has said,albeit in an unpublished opinion 
the imposition of economic disadvantage on mohajirs in pakistan such as a limited number of spots for mohajirs at universities and a difficulty advancing to high levels in not the type of economic deprivation that rises to the level of persecution.
mujtaba ashcroft,wl,at cir.may,unpublished disposition internal quotation marks and citation omitted.moreover,the record evidence establishes that many mohajirs suffer abuse due to their political involvement in the mqm,and not due to their mohajir identity as such.akhtar testified that he was not a member of the mqm and did not participate in any political activities,except to listen to a few political speakers while he was a college student.akhtar nevertheless contends that the killing and harassment of innocent and apparently apolitical citizens has created a unique situation for all mohajir s,not just those politically active.but as this court has said in an unpublished opinion rejecting an essentially identical asylum claim based on a petitioner mohajir identity 
the petitioner allegations,if true,describe general social strife in pakistan,which relate to,but are not necessarily the result of any of the grounds listed in the statute congress did not intend to confer eligibility for asylum on all persons who suffer harm from civil that necessarily have political implications.
ahmad ins,wl,at cir.july,unpublished table disposition quoting ins,cir.accordingly,the evidence in the record does not compel the conclusion that akhtar has a fear of persecution due to his identity as a mohajir.
akhtar family 
akhtar also argues that he has a fear of persecution based on his membership in his own immediate family.the ij found that akhtar father had been murdered and his mother wounded as a consequence of their involvement with the mqm a,but concluded akhtar connection with the mqm a and politics was too tangential.although this court has never directly addressed the issue,other circuit courts have held that the family is a cognizable particular social group within the meaning of a a.see ashcroft,cir collecting cases.the question here is whether akhtar has a fear of persecution on account of such family membership.a a.
although acts of violence against an alien family members may demonstrate a fear of persecution,absent a pattern of persecution tied to the asylum applicant himself or herself,acts of violence against family members do not necessarily demonstrate a fear of persecution.
gebremaria ashcroft,cir.in nyonzele ins,cir,a panel of the eighth circuit determined that an alien did not have a fear of future persecution even though his father had been murdered by government officials for his political beliefs.the court noted that there was no evidence that the government was interested in persecuting the alien for his father political opinions.id.
similar considerations are germane here.unlike his father,akhtar is apolitical,is not a member of the mqm a,and does not maintain the same political affiliations that led to his father murder.he has not presented evidence that he will be targeted due to his familial ties even though he remains politically inactive.although certainly relevant to assessing his status as a refugee,akhtar can not rely solely on the persecution of his family members to qualify for asylum.ciorba ashcroft,cir.further,akhtar has failed to show that his family political opinions have been imputed to him and that he has suffered or will suffer persecution as a result.id.accordingly,the ij finding that akhtar does not harbor a fear of persecution based on his family membership is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence in the record.
akhtar also argues he should be granted asylum in light of matter of chen,bia,a case in which the board held t hat victims of past persecution should in some cases be treated as refugees or asylees even when the likelihood of future persecution may not be great matter of chen is not helpful here because akhtar has not suffered any past persecution.similarly,akhtar reliance on a recently promulgated regulation,b iii b,is misplaced because he has not established the predicate showing of past persecution that the regulation requires.see mirditaj ashcroft,wl,at cir,unpublished disposition.because akhtar has not established that he is eligible for asylum,it necessarily follows that he can not meet the more stringent requirements to be eligible for withholding of deportation or protection under the united nations convention against torture.see yu,at.
akhtar also contends the ij violated his equal protection and substantive due process rights by not granting him asylum along with the other members of his family.in,akhtar mother filed a single application for asylum in her own name without filing individual applications for her children.under b a west supp,a child accompanying,or following to join,a parent who is granted asylum may be granted derivative asylum by virtue of his or her parent status as a refugee.the definition of a child is limited to otherwise qualified individuals who are unmarried and under twenty one years of age.b west supp.at the time of her application,akhtar mother listed all four of her children in her application,all of whom were then unmarried and under twenty one years of age.during the course of her immigration proceedings,however,two of her sons,akhtar and his brother,samir,aged out by reaching their birthdays.as a result,akhtar could not benefit from the grant of asylum given to his mother and her qualifying children in august,and he was compelled to file his own application for asylum.
it is true that,in order to prevent the loss of derivative asylum eligibility due to aging out,congress enacted the child status protection act,stat.the act,which,among other things,broadened eligibility for derivative asylum status.pursuant to an amendment codified at immigration and nationality act ina b b,b b west supp,an unmarried alien seeking derivative asylum status who turns years old while his or her parent application for asylum is pending continues to be classified as a child for purposes of b.however,akhtar
