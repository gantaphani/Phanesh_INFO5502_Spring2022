the issue before us is whether a noncitizen,who is admitted to the united states on a visitor visa and later adjusts her status to a lawfully admitted permanent resident without leaving the united states,qualifies under h as an alien who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,and,therefore,is ineligible to apply for a h waiver.
we have jurisdiction under a d to review the legal question of whether negrete ramirez is statutorily eligible to apply for a h waiver.de novo review of a statutory construction begins with the text of the statute.see,hing sum holder,cir.in the context of an unambiguous statute,we need not contemplate deferring to the agency interpretation.barnhart sigmon coal,citing chevron,natural res.def.council.
if congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,the court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at sum,at.review of the relevant statutory text and employ ment of traditional tools of statutory construction,chevron,at,leads to the conclusion that the text is unambiguous and that the bar to seeking a h waiver of inadmissibility does not apply to persons who adjusted to lawful permanent resident status after having entered into the united states by inspection.to date,our sister circuits have without exception held that h precludes a waiver only for those persons who,at the time they lawfully entered into the united states,had attained the status of lawful permanent residents.papazoglou,at citing hanif,at bracamontes,at lanier,at martinez,at.we ultimately agree with the third,fourth,fifth,seventh,and eleventh circuits.
the relevant text governing the h waiver is as follows 
n o waiver shall be granted under this subsection in the case of an alien who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if since the date of such admission the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony 
ina h,h emphasis added.as the ninth circuit observed in its analysis of this exact text,it is divisible into two distinct phrases namely,an alien who has previously been admitted to the united states and as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.sum,at quoting h the definitions section of the ina sets forth separate definitions for admitted,as used in the first phrase,a,and lawfully admitted for permanent residence,id.a,as used in the second phrase.an analysis of the statutory language requires an assessment of the effect of these terms on the meaning of the provision as a whole.resolving the issue before the court turns primarily on whether admitted as understood in h includes negrete ramirez adjustment of status.
a a admitted and admission 
the statute defines admitted and admission as the lawful entry of the alien into the united states after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.a a emphasis added.applying the ordinary,contemporary,common meaning of this definition terms reveals that it is limited and does not encompass a adjustment of status.pioneer inv.servs.brunswick assocs,see also papazoglou,at leiba,at hanif,at bracamontes,at lanier,at martinez,at.the definition refers expressly to entry into the united states,denoting by its plain terms passage into the country from abroad at a port of entry.
the government urges the court to adopt a definition of admitted that includes adjustment of status to an lpr.in support of its argument,the government cites three ninth circuit cases that interpret admission and admitted as used in specific sections of the ina to include adjustment of status.none of the cases involve a departure from the statute plain language definition of admitted as used in h.and none of the cases involve statutory language that is divisible into two distinct phrases,each with its own term of art,like that in h.
the first case,cuevas gaspar gonzales,cir,can not be relied on as binding precedent for the principle that adjustment of status to an lpr is an admission because the issue was neither before the court nor addressed by it.in cuevas gaspar,the court held that a parent status may be imputed to their minor unemancipated child for purposes of cancellation of removal under a.id.at.the court analysis was premised on the assumption that the petitioner would satisfy the cancellation of removal requirement of years of continuous residence after having been admitted in any status if his mother adjustment of status to lpr was imputed to him.id.at.the threshold issue of whether a adjustment of status to lpr is an admi ssion in any status was not mentioned by the court.accordingly,although cuevas gaspar might imply a broader definition of admitted than that in a,the court did not hold that adjustment of status is an admission in any context,let alone the one presently before the court.in any case,the supreme court subsequently overruled cuevas gaspar.see holder martinez gutierrez.
the other two cases cited by the government fare only slightly better.in ocampo duran ashcroft,cir,the petitioner had entered the united states,but was not admitted as defined by a,like negrete ramirez was,before adjusting his status to an lpr.the petitioner argued that he was not removable under a a iii,which states a ny ali
