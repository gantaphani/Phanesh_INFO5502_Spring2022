moises eduardo morales petitions for review of a final order of removal based on the immigration judge ij and board of immigration appeals bia determination that his conviction under california penal code a is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude cimt,precluding cancellation of removal under b of the immigration and nationality act ina,b.we have jurisdiction under a providing for judicial review of a final order of removal and a d providing for judicial review of constitutional and legal questions raised by individuals found removable based on criminal activity.see gonzales,cir.because we hold that a is not categorically a cimt,we grant the petition for review and remand the case to the bia for further proceedings.
background 
morales,a native and citizen of mexico,entered the united states without inspection near san ysidro,california,in september.in,the department of homeland security dhs served a notice to appear nta on morales,alleging that he was subject to removal on two grounds first,for being an alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled,see a a i,and second,for having been convicted of a cimt,see id.a a i i.the nta alleged that on april,morales was convicted in california superior court for the offense of corporal injury to spouse parent,a felony,in violation of section a of the california penal code for which the term of imprisonment was two years 
at his hearing before the ij,morales conceded removability however,he denied the fact of his conviction under code.the government adduced a certified copy of an abstract of judgment and prison commitment order,showing both that morales was convicted of the offense and that he was sentenced to two years imprisonment.according to those documents,morales pleaded guilty to a violation of a,and the court imposed a low term of years,doubled to years,under california habitual offender statute,code b i the record also contains a copy of the criminal complaint,which alleges 
on or about the day of march,in the county of el dorado,the crime of corporal injury to parent,in violation of penal code section a,a felony,was committed by moises eduardo morales,who did willfully and unlawfully inflict corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition upon martha adriana salazar,who was cohabiting with defendant.
the ij sustained the factual allegations in the nta and,based on that determination,the ij also sustained the charge of removability on the ground that morales had been convicted of a cimt.
at the hearing,morales also raised the possibility that he was eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under ina h,h.instead of simply requesting a h waiver,however,morales asserted that the waiver,if granted,would make him eligible for cancellation of removal under b.the ij clarified this argument for the government in the following exchange 
dhs well,i not sure where the respondent counsel is going with this in regards to the conviction under code.
ij that why i assume it was,that why i assumed you would like to brief concurrently.what he saying is he can tender cancellation with a h waiver 
following briefing on the issue by both parties,the ij denied morales request for cancellation of removal based on a waiver of inadmissibility.the ij then entered an order of removal.
morales timely appealed to the bia,which dismissed the appeal in a per curiam order.on the issue of whether a qualified as a cimt,the bia affirmed the ij reliance on grageda ins,cir,in which we held that spousal abuse under a was a cimt.although the bia recognized that grageda limited its holding to spousal abuse,it held that grageda reasoning applied with equal force to abuse of a cohabitant who is in a relationship of trust,and may be dependent upon the perpetrator.the bia also affirmed the ij determination that a waiver of inadmissibility under ina h would not render morales eligible for cancellation of removal.morales filed a timely petition for review of the bia decision.
standard of review 
w e review de novo the bia determination of questions of law,except to the extent that deference is owed to its interpretation of the governing statutes and regulations.gonzales,cir see also ashcroft,cir.we recently clarified that the bia determination that the petitioner has committed a cimt is comprised of two separate inquiries.see holder,cir en banc.first,the bia must determine what offense the petitioner has been convicted of committing.id.because t he bia has no special expertise by virtue of its statutory responsibilities in construing state or federal criminal statutes we review the bia finding regarding the specific act for which the petitioner was convicted de novo.and s econd,once the bia has identified the petitioner offense,it must determine whether such conduct is a crime involving moral turpitude as defined in the applicable section of the ina requir ing the bia to apply the definition of the term moral turpitude and to determine whether the petitioner conduct meets such definition.id.but t he board answer to the second question requires a different standard of review.id.at.if the bia has determined that the applicable conduct is morally turpitudinous in a precedential decision,we apply chevron deference regardless of whether the order under review is the precedential decision itself or a subsequent unpublished order that relies upon it.id.at.citation omitted.where,however,the bia resolves an appeal in an unpublished decision,as in this case,we defer to its interpretations of the ina not resolved by prior precedential decisions only to the extent of its thoroughness and overall persuasiveness.id.at.see also,at noting that the court owes skidmore deference to a bia opinion interpretation of the ina or its regulations citing skidmore swift.
discussion 
morales contends that the bia erred in affirming the ij determination that his conviction under code a qualifies as a cimt,both for purposes of determining his inadmissibility,see a a i i,and his ineligibility for cancellation of removal,see id.b c.an alien convicted of a cimt is ineligible for cancellation of removal by virtue of the conviction itself,see id.b c,and because such a conviction precludes a finding of good moral character required by b b.see,at noting that a n alien can not establish good moral character as required by b b if he has,among other things,been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude citing f,a a i i.a finding of error in morales favor would therefore remove the statutory bar to the relief he seeks.to determine whether a conviction is for a crime involving moral turpitude,we apply the categorical and modified categorical approaches established by the supreme court in taylor united states gonzales,cir en banc citing taylor united states,d.
categorical approach 
definition of crimes involving moral turpitude 
whether a crime involves moral turpitude is determined by the statutory definition or by the nature of the crime and not by the specific conduct that resulted in the conviction.id.at citation and quotation marks omitted.the categorical approach requires that we compare the elements of the statute of conviction to the generic definition of moral turpitude,and decide whether the conduct proscribed is broader than,and so does not categorically fall within,this generic definition.gonzales,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.we have observed that there are no statutorily established elements for a crime involving moral turpitude,at.its meaning left to the bia and courts to develop through adjudication.see mukasey,cir,overruled on other grounds by.we have defined moral turpitude as involving conduct that is inherently base,vile,or depraved,and contrary to the private and social duties man owes to his fellow men or to society in general,at see also in re sejas,bia applying a similar definition.the bia has added that t he essence of moral turpitude is an evil or malicious intent,and,therefore,t he test to determine if a crime involves moral turpitude is whether the act is accompanied by a vicious motive or a corrupt mind.in re tran,bia.under the categorical approach,the question is not whether some of the conduct
