petitioner maria matilde carrillo de palacios carrillo de palacios petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia.the bia determined that carrillo de palacios is ineligible for adjustment of status under section i of the immigration and nationality act ina,i,because she is inadmissible under ina section a c i.a c i,and is not eligible for the exception to inadmissibility in ina section a c ii,a c ii.
we deny the petition,as the bia correctly concluded that carrillo de palacios returned to the united states after having been unlawfully present in the united states for an aggregate period of more than year,which renders her inadmissible under a c i i.we reject her argument that the a c i i period of unlawful presence must occur after the april,effective date of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,div.c,a,stat,reprinted in note,at effective date of amendments.the bia also correctly concluded that she does not satisfy the requirements of a c ii exception to inadmissibility.we hold that in order to be eligible under a c ii,an alien must remain outside the united states for more than ten years before returning to the united states.
factual and procedural background 
carrillo de palacios is a native and citizen of mexico.the government instituted removal proceedings against her in,alleging that she had entered the united states without being admitted or paroled,and therefore was subject to removal under a a i.she conceded removability and sought to adjust her status to that of a lawful permanent resident under.i.the government opposed the application on the ground that she had been deported in december and subsequently reentered the country without permission in and.
the immigration judge granted the application,concluding that cases such as acosta gonzales,cir,provided the judge authority to cure the prior deportation and subsequent illegal return.the bia then reversed in an unpublished decision,holding in relevant part that carrillo de palacios was inadmissible under a c i,that she did not qualify for the exception to inadmissibility under a c ii,and that,as a result,she was not eligible for adjustment of status under i.the bia accordingly ordered her removed.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
because the bia decision was issued in,our review is governed by the real id act of,div.b,stat.when addressing issues contained in final orders of removal,we have jurisdiction to review questions of law under a d.morales izquierdo dep t of homeland,cir.we review those questions of law de novo.id.at.
discussion 
statutory framework 
to obtain adjustment of status under ina section i,an alien must be admissible to the united states for permanent residence.i a.aliens who are inadmissible under ina section a c,a c,are ineligible for adjustment of status.that provision,entitled aliens unlawfully present after previous immigration violations,states 
i in general 
any alien who 
i has been unlawfully present in the united states for an aggregate period of more than year,or 
ii has been ordered removed under section b of this title,section of this title,or any other provision of law,
and who enters or attempts to reenter the united states without being admitted is inadmissible.
ii exception 
clause i shall not apply to an alien seeking admission more than years after the date of the alien last departure from the united states if,prior to the alien reembarkation at a place outside the united states or attempt to be readmitted from a foreign contiguous territory,the secretary of homeland security secretary has consented to the alien reapplying for admission.
although our construction of these provisions might be viewed as occasionally inconsistent,the law of our circuit is now settled according chevron deference to the bia interpretation of the relevant statutes,we have held that aliens who are inadmissible under a c i i ii are ineligible for adjustment of status under i.see chevron natural res.def.council,aliens who are otherwise inadmissible under a c i are deemed admissible only if they qualify for the exceptions to inadmissibility stated in a c ii iii.the exception at issue in this case,a c ii,requir es that the alien obtain permission to apply for readmission from outside the united states after ten years have lapsed from the date of his last departure.gonzales,at.
ii.inadmissibility under a c 
the bia concluded that carrillo de palacios is inadmissible under both a c i i and a c i ii,and thus is ineligible for adjustment of status under i.we agree with the bia conclusion regarding a c i i.we need not address the arguments regarding a c i ii,and we express no opinion regarding the bia analysis of that provision.
the statutory text is straightforward an alien is inadmissible if she has been unlawfully present in the united states for an aggregate period of more than year and subsequently enters the united states without being admitted.a c i i.the parties agree that carrillo de palacios was unlawfully present for more than one year between and,and that she returned without being admitted in september.these facts establish that she satisfies both elements of a c i i she enter ed the united states without being admitted in after having been unlawfully present for an aggregate period of more than year between and.see also garfias rodriguez,wl,at,garfias unlawfully entered the united states in and departed the country,once in and once in garfias is inadmissible under a c i i.the bia therefore correctly concluded that she is inadmissible under a c i i.
in response,carrillo de palacios argues that a c i i is impermissibly retroactive as applied to her case.she explains that her accrual of unlawful presence prior to her most recent entry into the united states in september,does not cause her to be inadmissible because her unlawful presence accrued before april,the effective date of a c i i.
the supreme court addressed a similar argument about iirira retroactivity in fernandez vargas gonzales.the court began by describing the retroactivity analysis set forth in landgraf usi film products,and later cases 
we first look to whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach,and in the absence of language as helpful as that we try to draw a comparably firm conclusion about the temporal reach specifically intended by applying our normal rules of construction.if that effort fails,we ask whether applying the statute to the person objecting would have a retroactive consequence in the disfavored sense of affecting substantive rights,liabilities,or duties on the basis of conduct arising before its enactment.if the answer is yes,we then apply the presumption against retroactivity by construing the statute as inapplicable to the event or act in question owing to the absence of a clear indication from congress that it intended such a result.
fernandez vargas,at alterations,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted.
the court applied this analysis to reject fernandez vargas retroactivity challenge to iirira provision,a.the statute provided that if an alien has reentered the united states illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily,under an order of removal,the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.fernandez vargas,at quoting a.fernandez vargas argued that the statute did not apply to him because he reentered the country in,long before the provision went into effect,and his petition accordingly should have been decided under the more favorable legal regime.id.at.
the court rejected fernandez vargas arguments in light of landgraf.under the first step of landgraf,it noted that congress had not explicitly directed that a was to be applied either prospectively or retroactively,and held that the standard tools of statutory interpretation failed to resolve the question.id.at.it then applied the second step of landgraf,and emphasized that retroactivity generally involves the imposition of a new disability consequent to a completed act.id.at.under this approach,the reinstatement statute was not impermissibly retroactive 
i t is the conduct of remaining in the country after entry that is the predicate action the statute applies to stop an indefinitely continuing violation that the alien himself could end at any time by voluntarily leaving the country.it is therefore the alien choice to continue his illegal presence,after illegal reentry and after the effective date of the new law,that subjects him to the new and less generous legal regime,not a past act that he is helpless to undo up to the moment the government finds him out.
id.at.thus,the statute was not retroactive.id.at.
the court explained that its conclusion was consistent with the policy rationales underlying retroactivity,id.at,which had been described in an earlier case as fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations,ins cyr,internal quotation marks omitted.these policies were not implicated with respect to fernandez vargas,because he could not only have chosen to end his continuing violation and his exposure to the less favorable law,he even had an ample warning that the new law could be applied to him and ample opportunity to avoid that very possibility fernandez vargas,at.
the conclusions in fernandez vargas apply with equal force to carrillo de palacios retroactivity argument.the first step of the analysis whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach,or whether the normal rules of construction reveal a firm conclusion about the temporal reach specifically intended by congress,id.at internal quotation marks omitted is inconclusive with respect to a c i i.carrillo de palacios emphasizes iirira effective date provision,which states that the statute is effective on april.see iirira a providing that certain amendments,including the addition of a c,shall take effect on the first day of the first month beginning more than days after the date of the enactment of this act.on one hand,her argument carries some persuasive force a statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.landgraf,at.but on the other hand,her argument is not conclusive the instruction that the provisions are to take effect upon enactment mean s that courts should evaluate each provision of the act in light of ordinary judicial principles concerning the application of new rules to pending cases and preenactment conduct.id.at.thus,the statute effective date provision,taken in isolation,does not conclusively determine whether it applies only to future conduct,or to prior conduct as well.
in an attempt to invoke ordinary judicial principles of statutory construction,the government notes that iirira explicitly states that the period of unlawful presence under an analogous neighboring subsection,a b begins to accrue upon the effective date of iirira.that effective date provision states in applying section a b of the immigration and nationality act,a b,no period before the iirira title iii a effective date,april,shall be included in a period of unlawful presence in the united states.iirira b.in contrast,the subsection at issue here,a c,contains no such effective date provision.instead,a c is governed by iirira general effective date provision,which states that many of iirira provisions,including a c,shall take effect on april.iirira a.unlike the specific effective date provision governing the accrual of unlawful presence under a b,this generic effective date provision makes no reference to the accrual of unlawful presence under a c i i.see id.
according to the government,these contrasting effective date provisions reveal congress intent that a c i i applies retroactively to unlawful presence that accrued prior to april.see mackey lanier collection agency,w e are hesitant to adopt an interpretation of a congressional enactment which renders superfluous another portion of that same law.we agree with the government that a b is relevant to our analysis,but we disagree that it is conclusive.section a b effective date provision persuades us that congress did not specifically intend for a c provision to operate prospectively.fernandez vargas,at.given that a b is explicitly limited to prospective applications,congress obviously knew how to reach the same result with respect to a c,and apparently declined to do so.
while the contrast between a b and a c persuades us that congress did not clearly intend a c i i to have an exclusively prospective effect,we do not view this as a sufficiently clear statement that congress intended a c i i to operate retroactively.in the first step of the landgraf analysis,we must determine whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.landgraf,at emphasis added.at this stage of the analysis,a mere inference of intent to apply a provision retroactively is insufficient,because we require a clear statement for that.fernandez vargas,at.no such clear statement of retroactivity exists with respect to a c i i,so we must proceed to the second step of landgraf.see,valencia alvarez gonzales,cir w e must proceed to the second step of the landgraf approach unless congress intent that the statute be given retroactive application is clear.
under the second step of the analysis,we ask whether applying the statute to the person objecting would have a retroactive consequence in the disfavored sense of affecting substantive rights,liabilities,or duties on the basis of conduct arising before its enactment.fernandez vargas,at alterations omitted quoting landgraf,at.it is important to define the conduct that the statute addresses.the conclusion that a particular rule operates retroactively concern s the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.landgraf,at emphasis added.a statute is retroactive if it creates a new disability consequent to a completed act.fernandez vargas,at emphasis added.a statute is not made retroactive merely because it draws upon antecedent facts for its operation.landgraf,at quoting cox hart.a law that applies to conduct occurring after the effective date of the new law may look back to a past act without being impermissibly retroactive.fernandez vargas,at see also mcandrews fleet bank of,cir a statute may modify the legal effect of a present status or alter a preexisting relationship without running up against the retroactivity hurdle so long as a neoteric law determines status solely for the purpose of future matters,its application is deemed prospective.
under this line of analysis,carrillo de palacios retroactivity argument fails.section a c i i regulates the conduct of reentering the united states without being admitted,not the conduct of being unlawfully present for more than one year.the statute uses the present tense enters or attempts to reenter when referring to the alien reentry,but uses the participle has been unlawfully present when referring to the alien unlawful presence.a c i i see also words used in the present tense include the future as well as the present united states cook,cir ely,dissenting noting that past or perfect participle refers to conduct that is complete rather than in progress.as a result,it is the alien present or future reentry that triggers a c i i,not her past unlawful presence.see cox,at the language in terms applies to one who at the time of the enactment occupied a particular status,viz.the status of a person who has done the things enumerated.a statute is not made retroactive merely because it draws upon antecedent facts for its operation.
here,the legal disability inadmissibility arises from the alien act of unlawfully entering the country,not the alien accrual of unlawful presence.fernandez vargas,at.the alien prior unlawful presence is merely an antecedent fact that limits the scope of a c i i application.landgraf,at internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,a c i i applies on account of the alien choice to reenter the country after the effective date of the new law,not on account of a past act,such as prior unlawful presence,that he is helpless to undo up
