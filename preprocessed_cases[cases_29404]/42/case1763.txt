antonio pleaded guilty without a plea agreement to attempted illegal reentry into the united states after having been removed,in violation of.report psr,which relied on the version of the sentencing guidelines manual,assigned him a total offense level of,consisting of a base offense level of eight pursuant to united states sentencing guidelines manual a a increase because he was removed after his california conviction for kidnapping,a conviction the psr considered a crime of violence cov under b a ii and a decrease pursuant to a and b for acceptance of responsibility.criminal history score of nine placed him in a criminal history category of iv,which,combined with his total offense level,yielded a guidelines range of to months of imprisonment.
objected to the psr concerning its scoring of three past criminal convictions,but he did not object with respect to his california kidnapping conviction or the cov enhancement.at sentencing,indicated that his objection had been resolved.the district court sentenced within the guidelines range to months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release.timely appealed.
argues that his california kidnapping conviction was not a cov for purposes for b a ii.we agree.thus,we will vacate sentence and remand for resentencing.
standard of review 
because raises this argument for the first time on appeal,the standard of review applies.united states,cir.under review,a defendant must establish error that is plain and affects substantial rights.id.if these conditions are met,an appellate court may exercise its discretion to notice the forfeited error only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at quotations omitted alteration in original.the relevant inquiry is whether the error is plain at the time of appellate consideration,not at the time of trial.united states,cir.
crime of violence enhancement 
section b a ii 
section b a ii provides for a increase to a defendant base offense level if he was previously deported after being convicted of a felony that is a cov.united states,cir.the guidelines manual commentary defines a cov as any of a list of enumerated offenses,including kidnapping,or any offense under federal,state,or local law that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.id.at quoting,cmt.b iii.this court uses different tests when analyzing whether a particular offense amounts to a cov,and the test used depends on whether the offense is an enumerated one or has physical force as an element.united states,cir.
in determining whether the california crime at issue here is the enumerated offense of kidnapping,we look to the generic,contemporary meaning of kidnapping,employing a common sense approach that looks to the model penal code,the lafave and scott treatises,modern state codes,and dictionary definitions.united states,cir.labels do not control this inquiry because the cov enhancement incorporates crimes with certain elements,not crimes that happen to be labeled kidnapping under state law,at.
in determining whether an offense has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,this court uses the categorical approach set forth in taylor united states,d,and examines the elements of the offense,rather than the facts underlying the conviction,at.
under either approach,if the statute of conviction contains a series of disjunctive elements,this court may look beyond the statute to certain records made or used in adjudicating guilt to determine which subpart of the statute formed the basis of the conviction.united states,cir,cert.denied,d united states,cir see,at.these records are generally limited to the charging document,written plea agreement,transcript of the plea colloquy,and any explicit factual findings by the trial judge to which the defendant assented,at quotations omitted accord,at.if the statute of conviction can not be narrowed,we consider whether the least culpable act constituting a violation of that statute constitutes kidnapping for purposes of,at.
in this case,the parties agree that kidnapping conviction occurred pursuant to code a as reflected in the indictment and abstract of judgment pertaining to the conviction section a states,every person who forcibly,or by any other means of instilling fear,steals or takes,or holds,detains,or arrests any person in this state,and carries the person into another country,state,or county,or into another part of the same county,is guilty of kidnapping.the parties do not cite,and research did not reveal,any cases from this circuit or another circuit addressing the issue whether a conviction under a is a cov,as the term is currently defined for b a ii purposes 
use of physical force as an element 
with respect to whether a constitutes a crime of violence under the categorical approach because it has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,argues that the use of physical force is not a necessary element of a because a makes it unlawful for the offender to act forcibly,or by any other means of instilling fear.count one of indictment,the count underlying his kidnapping conviction,tracks this provision of a,charging that acted wilfully,unlawfully,forcibly and by other means of instilling fear.the government does not dispute that the use of force is not a necessary element of a.see people majors,cal th,d,holding that the force used against the victim need not be physical in order to sustain a conviction for kidnapping under a.
the government argues that record of conviction establishes that his kidnapping offense involved injury to the victim based on the use of physical force.the government relies on the fact that abstract of judgment reflects that he pleaded guilty not only to count one of his indictment,kidnapping in violation of a,but also to count three of his indictment,willfully inflicting corporal injury in violation of code a.the government argues that the use of physical force is a necessary element of a,such that the record of conviction establishes that used physical force with respect to his kidnapping conviction.see people jackson,th,d,see also code c defining the term traumatic condition.
while the indictment reflects that the kidnapping and corporal injury offenses were committed on the same day with jane doe as the victim,it does not establish that the conduct involved in the corporal injury offense was necessarily involved in the kidnapping offense.according to the language found in the indictment,could have kidnapped jane doe by other means of instilling fear,and then later used physical force to inflict corporal injury upon her.because we do not have a written plea agreement,transcript of the plea colloquy,or explicit factual findings by the trial judge to which the defendant assented,we can not narrow the statute of conviction to determine which disjunctive elements of a formed the basis of conviction.
in determining whether a state guilty plea conviction qualifies as a drug trafficking offense under b a i,we have previously considered under the categorical approach the extent to which a guilty plea serves to admit the factual averments in the indictment.see united states,cir.in,we looked to the law of the state of conviction,georgia,to determine the effect of guilty plea to trafficking in methamphetamine the plea constituted an admission of all averments of facts in the indictment.id.at.because the indictment made a factual averment that both sold and possessed methamphetamine,we determined that his guilty plea served to admit that he both sold and possessed the drug,rendering his conviction a drug trafficking offense.id.at.
like,the indictment in this case charged the kidnapping offense in the conjunctive,despite the fact that the statute creating the offense,a,is phrased in the disjunctive.see id.at.the similarities to end there,however,because california has not adopted georgia rule that a guilty plea constitutes an admission of all averments of facts in the indictment.
in california,a guilty plea admits every element of the crime charged.people wallace,cal th,d,quotations omitted.based on wallace,one might argue that guilty plea admitted every conjunctive element alleged in the indictment.this argument is misplaced,however,because i t is well settled in california that where the statute enumerates several acts disjunctively,which separately or together shall constitute the criminal offense,the indictment,if it charges more than one of them in the same count,should do so in the conjunctive.people turner,d,citing people,cal,accord in re bushman,cal d.furthermore,if the indictment alleges elements in the conjunctive,the defendant can be convicted if the evidence establishes any set of disjunctive elements that together constitute the criminal offense.see turner.at see also bushman,merely because the complaint is phrased in the conjunctive,however,does not prevent a trier of fact from convicting a defendant if the evidence proves only one of the alleged acts.guilty plea,when viewed in conjunction with the language of the indictment,does not narrow the statute of conviction for purposes of the categorical approach.
a guilty plea is the legal equivalent of a verdict of guilty reached by a jury.see people valladoli,cal th,d.if a jury could have convicted of kidnapping under a without finding that he used physical force,then a judge could have found a factual basis for his guilty plea without finding that he used physical force.see wallace,d,at noting that a guilty plea in california ordinarily includes an admission that there is a factual basis for the plea.guilty plea to the kidnapping count in his indictment,standing alone,does not compel a finding that he used physical force to perpetrate that crime.
the statute of conviction can not be narrowed through reference to the guilty plea and the abstract of judgment,so we must consider whether the least culpable act constituting a violation of that statute constitutes kidnapping for purposes of,at.because kidnapping under a can be accomplished without the use of physical force,we decline to uphold sentence under the categorical approach.see,at.
enumerated offense of kidnapping 
we have recently considered whether kidnapping statutes from three states qualify as the enumerated offense of kidnapping for purposes of b a ii.see,determining that.ann.did not qualify,determining that penal law qualified,determining that ann.qualified see also united states,cir,cert.denied,d determining that.penal code a qualified.
in,at,we considered the definition of kidnapping in the model penal code mpc and kidnapping statutes of other states,and we determined that ann.did not sweep more broadly than the enumerated offense of kidnapping based on the statute elements 
knowing removal or confinement 
substantial interference with the victim liberty 
a force,threat,or fraud,or b if the victim is incompetent or under age thirteen,lack of consent from the person responsible for the general supervision of the victim welfare and 
a circumstances exposing the victim to substantial risk of bodily injury,or b confinement as a condition of involuntary servitude 
id.at.although the mpc definition of kidnapping required that removal or confinement occur due to a specified purpose,such as ransom or the infliction of bodily injury,we determined that qualified as the enumerated offense of kidnapping under without a specified purpose element id.at.we found it significant that tennessee requires the use of force,threat,or fraud along with the additional aggravating elements of substantial risk of injury or confinement as a condition of involuntary servitude.id.at.
in,at,we determined that penal law qualified as the enumerated offense of kidnapping even though it included only the first three of the four elements present in,lacking the element of risk of injury or confinement as a condition of involuntary servitude.we noted that our decision was consistent with.at,an unpublished case which held that the enumerated offense of kidnapping included a texas statute that was nearly identical to the new york statute and likewise lacked the requirement of risk of injury or involuntary servitude,at.
in,at,we determined that.did not qualify as the enumerated offense of kidnapping,reasoning that it lacked the second and fourth elements present in,did not explicitly require force or fraud as required under the third element of,and lacked either the specified purpose elements contained in the mpc definition or any other additional aggravating elements.we summarized our analysis as follows 
the question therefore becomes whether a statute that contains only the first element,knowing removal or confinement,and possibly the third element,a force,threat,or fraud,or b if the victim is incompetent or under age thirteen,lack of consent from the person responsible for the general supervision of the victim welfare,and lacks any additional aggravating elements,such as the specified purpose requirements of the mpc definition,qualifies as the enumerated offense of kidnapping.we conclude that it does not.while did not hold that any particular elements are essential,the court did emphasize that where the specified purposes of the mpc kidnapping definition are lacking,some aggravating elements are necessary to bring a statute closer to the mpc definition of kidnapping.
id.at italics in original.we concluded that a kidnapping statute which lacks the specified purposes of the mpc definition and other aggravating elements identified in and,and also lacks an explicit force or fraud requirement,does not qualify as the enumerated offense of kidnapping.id.at.
relying on these three cases,argues that code a lacks the elements necessary to qualify it as the enumerated offense of kidnapping.he argues that,similar to the colorado statute considered in,a lacks the second and fourth elements present in.that is,he argues that a does not require substantial interference with the victim liberty and a circumstances exposing the victim to substantial risk of bodily injury,or b confinement as a condition of involuntary servitude.he also argues that a lacks the specified purpose requirements contained in the mpc definition.the government points out that,unlike,a explicitly contains the third element of,the force or fraud requirement.
which does not qualify as the enumerated offense of kidnapping,states the following any person who knowingly seizes and carries any person from one place to another,without his consent and without lawful justification,commits second degree kidnapping.code a,which is the subject of this appeal,uses language similar to the colorado statute every person who forcibly,or by any other means of instilling fear,steals or takes,or holds,detains,or arrests any person in this state,and carries the person into another country,state,or county,or into another part of the same county,is guilty of kidnapping.
we must first determine whether the colorado statute is distinguishable from the california statute because the california statute contains an explicit force or fraud element.in other words,if the presence of two explicit elements identified in is sufficient to qualify a as the enumerated offense of kidnapping,then a is a cov and our analysis ends.it is undisputed that a contains the first and third elements identified in knowing removal and confinement and force,threat,or fraud.
the presence of these two explicit elements,standing alone,is not sufficient to qualify a as a cov.if these two elements were deemed sufficient to constitute the enumerated offense of kidnapping,then dissimilar state kidnapping offenses would be treated identically for purposes of the cov enhancement.see,at.this would be inconsistent with the sentencing guideline goals of uniformity and predictability.see united states ashburn,cir.a definition of kidnapping would sweep more broadly than the generic,contemporary meaning of the crime.see,at.additional aggravating elements,such as the second and forth elements identified in,or the specified purpose requirements of the mpc definition,are necessary to qualify a as the enumerated offense of kidnapping.see,at concluding that the firs
