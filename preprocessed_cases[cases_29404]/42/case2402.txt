in,congress amended the violence against women act vawa to make it easier for victims of domestic abuse who face removal from the united states to file motions to reopen their immigration proceedings.see,stat.ordinarily,strict time limitations apply to these motions.see c.for persons qualifying under vawa,however,congress has lengthened the period within which a motion to reopen may be filed,has altered the numerical limit that applies to ordinary motions,and has provided for a stay of removal upon the filing of the motion.see c c iv iii time,c a c iv numerical limit,c iv stay.when ana sanchez tried to take advantage of this law,however,she was rebuffed by the board of immigration appeals.the bia found that her motion to reopen was barred by the time limitation set forth in c it rejected her effort to invoke the special rules for battered spouses,finding that she should have raised this point before the immigration judge ij and further finding that her counsel failure to do so did not prejudice her.the bia ruled,in the alternative,that it would deny even a proper motion to reopen from sanchez in the exercise of its discretion.
we conclude that the bia first two reasons for denying the motion to reopen were based on legal error vawa permits the filing of a motion to reopen such as sanchez,and the board has the independent power to accept such a motion,whether or not an attorney mentioned this law before the ij.ordinarily,the fact that the bia ruled in the alternative that sanchez case did not merit relief as a matter of discretion would be enough to doom her petition independently.here,however,there was a prior question that the bia resolved sanchez attorney rendered ineffective assistance.we conclude,on this record,that he did.the record on which the bia would have assessed its discretionary ruling would have been quite different had the lawyer performed adequately.we thus grant the petition for review and return this case to the bia for a of the merits of sanchez motion.
ana sanchez entered the united states on august,without inspection,as immigration specialists would say.with the exception of a brief trip to visit her mother in mexico in,which was short enough not to amount to a legal interruption of her residency,she has remained in the united states ever since.in,sanchez married francisco mendez,a legal permanent resident.the couple had a daughter,adanely mendez,on december,but mendez never petitioned to adjust sanchez status.sanchez alleges that she suffered physical,emotional,and psychological abuse at mendez hands.sanchez and mendez divorced on may.
five years later,in february,sanchez met robert bozynski,who was a manager at a car dealership at which sanchez and her sister purchased a vehicle.after a number of calls from bozynski,sanchez agreed to go out with him for dinner.the two began dating,and bozynski proposed marriage to sanchez on several occasions.she declined initially.in february,the two went out for dinner.sanchez had two drinks over the course of the evening,but they had a powerful effect on her.she lost consciousness and woke up later in bozynski bed,with him on top of her.she had trouble opening her eyes and could not defend herself later,she concluded that the drinks must have been drugged.when she tried to discuss this incident with bozynski,he insisted that the sexual encounter was consensual.
a few weeks later,sanchez went to los angeles with adanely and her sister to visit her sick father.during that trip,she learned that she was pregnant.she informed bozynski of this fact as soon as she returned to chicago.he became upset and accused her of lying he also accused her of cheating on him and having sex with another man.nonetheless,the discovery of the pregnancy prompted sanchez to agree to marry bozynski they were married right away,on april.
problems with the marriage surfaced quickly.right after the wedding,sanchez,bozynski,and adanely took a trip to north and south carolina.during this time,bozynski became rude and accusatory.he began to denigrate sanchez because she was a mexican immigrant he became angry when she spoke spanish to adanely because he could not understand what she was saying he demanded that she return the wedding ring and he threatened to have her deported to mexico by reporting her to the immigration authorities.she believed that he was angry because she was feeling ill as a result of the pregnancy and thus did not want to have sex during the trip,but she complied with his request to return the ring.
when they returned to the chicago area,sanchez and adanely returned to their home in maywood,illinois,and bozynski stayed at his home in crystal lake.before the marriage,they had agreed that this would be their temporary arrangement,so that adanely could finish the school semester before moving to crystal lake.bozynski refused to provide medical coverage for sanchez during her pregnancy,because he took the position that the baby was not his.sanchez therefore applied for and received public assistance in her own name.at the time,sanchez did have health insurance through her employer,but it was under an assumed name.on november,valerie sanchez was born dna testing later confirmed that valerie is bozynski daughter.
relations remained bad between sanchez and bozynksi.on april,bozynski made good on his threat to report sanchez to the immigration and naturalization service.he told the ins that sanchez claimed to have requested the marriage for the sole purpose of obtaining lawful status in the united states.she informed the complainant bozynski that since she was now married to him a united states citizen and pregnant with a child to be born in the united states,there was nothing anyone could do to remove her from the united states.bozynski also told the ins that sanchez was working under an assumed name.the next day,april,sanchez was arrested by the ins and served with a notice to appear nta she was released the same day on her own recognizance.bozynski and sanchez were divorced effective january.
the nta included four factual allegations 
you are not a citizen or national of the united states 
you are a native of mexico and a citizen of mexico 
you entered the united states at or near el paso,texas on august,
you were not then admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer.
on the basis of those allegations,the ins charged that sanchez was subject to removal pursuant to a a i of the immigration and nationality act ina,a a i.
on july,sanchez attended an initial master calendar hearing,at which she was represented by attorney ralph schelly.on her behalf,attorney schelly admitted the factual allegations in the initial nta and notified the ij that sanchez was going to apply for cancellation of removal as a battered spouse.the ij ordered the attorney to prepare the proper application and to obtain the records of any criminal convictions she had.the ij scheduled another hearing for october.on july,the ins added two more allegations to the nta first,that sanchez had been convicted of battery on august,in violation of ilcs,and second,that she had been convicted of battery on december,in violation of the same statute.these two convictions,ins asserted,made her removable under a a i i,a a i i,which covers inadmissibility for committing a crime of moral turpitude.sanchez denied that she had committed such a crime.later,on august,sanchez was convicted in illinois of possession of a fake identification card,for which she was sentenced to six months court supervision and community service and had her driver license suspended.it appears that these charges were not formally added to the nta,but evidence of them was eventually introduced into the administrative record.
on july,sanchez filed applications for cancellation of removal under both b covering ordinary cancellation and b covering vawa cancellation.at the october,hearing,the ij explained to sanchez the difference between requesting cancellation generally and requesting cancellation under the vawa rules.the general rules require continuous physical presence within the united states for years,good moral character,lack of convictions of certain offenses,and a showing of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the citizen or permanent resident spouse,parent,or child.b.the vawa rules are more lenient.they require as applied to sanchez case the applicant to establish that she was battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by a spouse or parent who is a citizen or lawful permanent resident,b a i,and that she had resided continuously in the united states for a period of three years,that she is a person of good moral character,and that her removal would result in extreme hardship to herself or her child.b a ii iii.at the end of the october hearing,the judge continued the proceedings to see if sanchez could qualify for either type of cancellation.
her hearing was not reconvened until august.at that time,attorney schelly first attempted to present documents relating to adanely treatment for scoliosis at a local hospital,despite the fact that he had failed to comply with a local rule requiring days notice of this type of proffer.the ij then asked whether sanchez intended to pursue vawa cancellation.inexplicably,schelly said no and indicated that she was going to apply only for ordinary cancellation.schelly offered no reason why his client would voluntarily forgo the more lenient vawa approach.
at the hearing,sanchez testified about her presence in the united states and about adanely schooling and health including her scoliosis.she gave a brief statement about her two battery arrests and convictions in and and admitted that she had been charged and convicted for possession of a false identification card.in response to questions from the ij about her marriage to bozynski,she explained that she married him because she was pregnant with his child.she also noted that she had gone to court to establish paternity.the ij found that bozynski was valerie father.sanchez also testified that bozynski had paid a detective to follow her for seven months,and that she was arrested when she went to work one day.she also explained that she had applied for public assistance while she was pregnant because she wanted to use her true name,and to have her true name appear on valerie birth certificate.it was her insurance through her employer that reflected the pseudonym maria morato.through a proffer at the hearing,the attorney from the department of homeland security which by then had succeeded to the ins responsibilities presented bozynski testimony.bozynski claimed that he had been duped about the marriage,that sanchez lost interest in him immediately after it took place,that he had offered to pay for valerie birth expenses,and that he had witnessed sanchez driving after she lost her license.
the ij did not place significant weight on bozynski version of the events.he found that sanchez had met the exceptional and extremely unusual hardship standard and that there was no evidence that the marriage had been a sham.he also found that sanchez was not removable as an alien convicted of a crime of moral turpitude,because she was convicted only of simple battery.nonetheless,as a matter of discretion he denied sanchez application for ordinary cancellation and granted sanchez days in which to depart voluntarily.attorney schelly filed an appeal to the bia from that order on sanchez behalf,but the board affirmed the ij decision without opinion on september.later,schelly filed a petition for review with this court,but it was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction,based on a b i,on january.
since the hearing before the ij,sanchez has apparently turned her life around.she continues to reside with her two daughters in maywood,she has had no more arrests or convictions,and she has a legitimate job.adanely continues to receive treatment for her scoliosis.she is a citizen she has never been to mexico and speaks very little spanish.she visits her father regularly,and he has been paying child support to sanchez.unfortunately,in adanely was the victim of unwanted sexual conduct by a male when she was visiting her father house.sanchez took steps to have the offender prosecuted,and he was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in september.although valerie lives with her mother,the divorce decree awarded joint legal custody to sanchez and bozynski the court order forbids sanchez from removing valerie from the united states.bozynski has sought to obtain sole legal custody over her,based on sanchez immigration status.both adanely and valerie suffer from anxiety.sanchez is worse off she has dysthymia and stress disorder.she has also received counseling at sarah inn,a domestic violence agency,since april,and at turning point,another agency for survivors of domestic violence.
this petition comes to us,as we noted earlier,primarily from the bia decision of june,denying her motion to reopen her case.sanchez filed her petition for review on june,within days of that decision,which was docketed as case.on august,the board denied a motion to reconsider its june order.sanchez filed a petition for review from that decision on september,that case was docketed here under.we focus here on the june order,as the bia later order simply reaffirmed it.
in our view,this petition requires us to decide the following issues,in this order was sanchez entitled to present her argument that her lawyer performance was prejudicial and below the standards recognized by the board itself in the motion to reopen if so,does substantial evidence support the bia evaluation of that argument was sanchez prejudiced by the lawyer waiver of her vawa claim and must her petition be denied in any event because of the board statement that it was denying her motion to reopen in the alternative as an exercise of its discretion.
at the outset of these proceedings,sanchez attorney indicated that he was going to request both ordinary cancellation of removal and vawa cancellation.at this point,however,at least one thing is clear it is too late for sanchez to file her motion to reopen insofar as she wishes to challenge the denial of ordinary cancellation under b.the regulations require that a motion to reopen for this type of claim must be filed within days of the board decision.see c.because sanchez motion was filed long after that period elapsed,the bia properly concluded that her motion was untimely.sanchez made no argument for equitable tolling of that period,and thus we have no need to consider whether she might have qualified under that line of cases.see,patel gonzales,cir.although the board in its discretion might have decided to accept the late motion,we have no jurisdiction over any discretionary decision on its part not to do so.see pilch ashcroft,cir ali gonzales,cir citing cases.
the more difficult question is whether the bia properly concluded,in effect,that sanchez had waived the right to seek vawa cancellation when her attorney failed to pursue that relief at the hearing held on august.the bia regarded this decision as a strategic one and thus as not a ground for reopening.it also noted that the relief that she was seeking in her motion was primarily based on alleged abuse by her that occurred before august,even though it acknowledged that she was also attempting to rely on events that postdated that hearing.
it is important,at the outset,to recall the functions played by motions to reopen and motions to reconsider.we recently reviewed both of these devices 
motions to reopen and motions to reconsider serve distinct functions motions to reopen ask the bia to reconsider its earlier decision based on facts or evidence not available at the time of the original decision,they do not challenge the correctness of an earlier decision based on the existing record,by contrast,the basis of a motion to reconsider is a contention that the original decision was defective in some regard.motions to reconsider ask the bia to reexamine its earlier decision in light of additional legal arguments,a change of law,or an argument that was overlooked.therefore,in considering such motions,the board places itself back in time and consider s the case as though a decision in the case on the record before it had never been entered.
