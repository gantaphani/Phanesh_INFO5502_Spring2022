petitioner was ordered removed from the united states under a a iii of the immigration and nationality act of ina,codified at a a iii,as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony based upon his new york state felony conviction for operating a vehicle while intoxicated dwi petitioner claims that his conviction does not amount to a crime of violence under b,as is required by the definition of aggravated felony provided in a f.
the principal question on appeal is whether a felony dwi conviction under new york state law constitutes a crime of violence under b.we conclude that it does not and accordingly vacate the deportation order.
background 
factual background 
thomas anthony dalton,a native and citizen of canada,has been living continuously in the united states as a lawful permanent resident since,before he was one year old.his parents and siblings reside in the united states as well.dalton has been convicted several times under new york vehicle and traffic law nyvtl for operating a vehicle while intoxicated.he pleaded guilty to his most recent dwi offense on january,and due to two previous convictions within ten years preceding the third,his crime and sentence were enhanced under nyvtl c ii to become a class d felony with an accompanying to years imprisonment term.
ii.statutory background 
under a a iii,a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.an aggravated felony is defined in a f as a crime of violence as defined in section of title for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.a crime of violence,in turn,is a term of art defined in as 
a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,or 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
iii.procedural background 
in april,while dalton was serving his prison sentence,the immigration and naturalization service ins initiated removal proceedings against him,charging that he was removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony resulting from a felony dwi conviction in violation of nyvtl.
during two telephonic removal hearings,dalton admitted that he was convicted under nyvtl,but denied the ground for removal,namely,that he had committed an aggravated felony as defined under a f or a crime of violence as defined under b.
in december,the immigration judge ij rejected dalton argument and ordered him removed to canada without the opportunity to request relief dalton appealed the ij decision to the board of immigration appeals bia.basing its reasoning on bia precedent regarding texas and arizona dwi statutes as well as a fifth circuit opinion that has since been withdrawn the bia concluded on may,that a violation of nyvtl constitutes a crime of violence and affirmed the ij removal order.
discussion 
as an initial matter,we note that the scope of our review in this case is limited jurisdictionally under a c,which precludes judicial review of final orders of removal against aliens who are removable by reason of having committed,inter alia,an aggravated felony.we do retain jurisdiction,however,to review the question whether,as a matter of law,dalton committed an aggravated felony under a f,as defined by.see bell reno,cir.
we also note that while we apply chevron deference,see chevron,natural res.def.council,d,to the bia interpretation of the ina,we review de novo its interpretation of federal or state criminal statutes.see sutherland reno,cir citing michel ins,cir.accordingly,because the ina defines an aggravated felony in a f by reference to a crime of violence in,we review de novo the question whether nyvtl constitutes a crime of violence that,in turn,constitutes a deportable aggravated felony under the ina.
application of categorical analysis to crime of violence 
under the language of the statute,a b crime of violence is analyzed by its nature.we believe that this language compels an analysis that is focused on the intrinsic nature of the offense rather than on the factual circumstances surrounding any particular violation.see united states,cir citing taylor united states,d united states aragon,cir united states rodriguez,cir.under this approach,commonly referred to as the categorical approach to criminal statutory interpretation,the singular circumstances of an individual petitioner crimes should not be considered,and only the minimum criminal conduct necessary to sustain a conviction under a given statute is relevant.michel ins,at calabresi,dissenting see also tapia garcia ins,cir citations omitted.
in this circuit,we have long endorsed categorical analyses of criminal statutes in the context of deportation orders for crimes of moral turpitude.see united states ex rel.guarino uhl,cir.our decisions in this area stand for the proposition that the offense,judged from an abstracted perspective,must inherently involve moral turpitude in other words,any conduct falling within the purview of the statute must by its nature entail moral turpitude.see id.holding that because defendant could be convicted under relevant statute for crimes not involving moral turpitude,statute could not form basis for order of deportation based upon commission of crime of moral turpitude see also united states ex rel.zaffarano corsi,cir finding that conviction for second degree assault did not inherent ly involve moral turpitude because statute could encompass crimes that both did and did not involve moral turpitude united states ex rel.robinson day,cir when by its definition a statute does not necessarily involve moral turpitude,the alien can not be deported because in the particular instance his conduct was immoral.more recently,we have reaffirmed this approach in michel ins,where we stated that a s a general rule,if a statute encompasses both acts that do and do not involve moral turpitude,the bia can not sustain a deportability finding predicated on moral turpitude,based on that statute.at quoting hamdan ins,cir.
based upon the language of the statute requiring analysis of the nature of the crime,as well as by analogy to this circuit law regarding moral turpitude,we believe that the categorical approach is appropriate for determining whether an offense is a crime of violence under b in the context of deportation proceedings furthermore,the categorical approach is especially appropriate in the current context where the relevant facts may be up to ten years old and may never have been developed in a trial court 
ii.categorical analysis of nyvtl 
in the instant case,upon a de novo review of the relevant criminal statute,we conclude that not all violations of nyvtl are by their nature crimes of violence because risk of physical force is not a requisite element of the new york dwi offense.
nyvtl provides,in its entirety,that n o person shall operate a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated condition.recently,in people prescott,the new york court of appeals clarified the nature of the state dwi offense and the breadth of the statute.the prescott court held that attempted dwi was not a legally cognizable offense distinct from the substantive crime because the crime of attempt is already encompassed within nyvtl.see id.at.the court stressed that 
t he breadth of conduct prohibited by vehicle and traffic law,as interpreted by our courts,is sweeping.our courts have long recognized that the definition of operation is broader than that of driving and that a person operates a motor vehicle within the meaning of the statute when,in the vehicle,he intentionally does any act or makes use of any mechanical or electrical agency which alone or in sequence will set in motion the motive power of the vehicle.
id.quoting people alamo,quoting matter of prudhomme hults.
thus,in new york,a defendant can be found guilty of driving while intoxicated even if he or she is asleep at the wheel of a car whose engine is not running and evidence is adduced at trial that the vehicle never moved.see people marriott,dep t.a person can also be found
