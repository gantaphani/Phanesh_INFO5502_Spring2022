qiao hua li,a citizen of the people republic of china,petitions for review of a final order of the board of immigration appeals bia denying her application for asylum and withholding of removal.li maintains that she is entitled to refugee status because she was persecuted for her resistance to china coercive population control program.specifically,li argues that she was persecuted for having an unauthorized child because she was fined renminbi rmb and she was required to have an intrauterine contraceptive device iud implanted against her will.li also alleges that she has a fear of being persecuted in the future if she returns to china.the bia concluded that the fine and the iud requirement did not rise to the level of persecution and that any fear li had of future persecution was not well founded.because the bia decision was not manifestly contrary to law or an abuse of discretion,we affirm.
li was born on march,in fuzhou,fujian province,china.in january,li married jing cai yang,in a traditional marriage ceremony despite the denial of their application for a marriage certificate because li was underage four months later,li became pregnant even though she and yang lacked a marriage certificate.fearing that the chinese government would force her to abort the unauthorized pregnancy,li and her husband fled into the mountains,and her child was born on january.li and her husband returned home eight months after the child was born.upon returning,they were fined rmb for the unauthorized birth.they did not pay the fine and were harassed by authorities.in her brief,li contends that this fine was more money than she and her husband earned in a year.
in addition,after li returned home,chinese officials forced her to submit to an iud insertion against her will.at,supp.at.li initially experienced abnormal menstruation from the iud,but the effects lessened over time and now li can tolerate it.at supp.at.she was checked every few months by chinese doctors to ensure that the iud was still in place and that she was not pregnant.li testified that the officials came to her home in china to collect the fine every year and that her husband did not live at home in order to avoid being harassed by the officials.li son lives with her parents.li testified that she repeatedly asked to remove the iud while in china,but the chinese officials refused those requests.although li has been in the united states since,she has not had the iud removed.she testified that she dare not have it removed because she fears the repercussions if she is returned to china and it has been removed.supp.at.
li incurred a debt to smugglers of more than for help to flee china through hong kong and japan.she arrived in the united states,at the los angeles international airport,on july,and was detained by officials because she failed to present proper travel documents.because li told the officials that she feared returning to her native china,she was referred to an asylum officer for an interview.see b a west.following this interview,the asylum officer determined that li had a credible fear of persecution and that further proceedings were necessary.see b b ii.
the government charged li with removability and began removal procedures against her.li conceded removability,but requested asylum and withholding of removal.li proceedings initially commenced in california,but were transferred to new york,where li moved upon arrival in the united states.in november,a status hearing was conducted in new york.during that hearing,li immigration case was transferred again,to virginia,where li apparently now resides.
on november,the immigration judge ij conducted the merits hearing in li case.li was not accompanied by counsel to the courtroom.when the ij asked li where counsel was,li responded that she was not expecting him,and that he was not coming b ecause the fee wa s too high and she could afford it.supp.at.after the ij conferred with counsel by telephone to confirm that he was no longer representing li,the hearing continued.
the ij concluded that li had not been persecuted and did not have a fear of persecution because neither the fine nor the iud insertion were severe enough to amount to persecution the ij also noted that li had not had the iud removed while she was in the united states,and that her husband and child were still living in china.the ij ordered that li be removed to china 
li filed a notice of appeal with the bia.on november,the bia adopted the ij ruling and denied li asylum claim.the bia found that li ha d not been persecuted in the past by being forcibly sterilized or forced to have an abortion.rather,li was required to use an intrauterine birth control device,which she continues to use in the united states of her own volition,and to pay a fine.at.the bia concluded that li had failed to establish that either the iud or the fine constitute d harm rising to the level of persecution.at.the bia also noted that the father of li child,with whom she entered into a traditional marriage,remains in china unharmed despite the of the fine.at.thus,concluded the bia,li failed to establish an objectively reasonable fear that,if returned to china,she would suffer greater harm,rising to the level of persecution.at.li then filed the instant petition for review,which we have jurisdiction to entertain under a west.
on petition for review,the bia determination that an alien is not eligible for asylum must be upheld unless that determination is manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.b d west.a dministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b west.thus,we may reverse the denial of li asylum application only if the evidence was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.rusu ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also blanco de belbruno ashcroft,cir.
under the immigration and nationality act,the attorney general may confer asylum to anyone who is a refugee.prior to,circuit courts and the bia had uniformly held that victims of china one child policy had not been persecuted on a protected basis,and had denied asylum requests based on this ground.see,chen ins,cir chen zhou chai carroll,cir.to change this result,congress,in the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,created a b.that section provides,in relevant part 
for purposes of determinations under this chapter,a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization,or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program,shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion,and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure,refusal,or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.
in chen ins,cir,we interpreted this section as follows 
in amending the immigration and nationality act,congress included three additional classes of individuals in the definition of refugee persons who had been forced to undergo an involuntary sterilization or abortion persons who had been persecuted for refusing to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program and persons who have a fear of being subjected to a forced abortion or sterilization,or persecuted for resistance to a coercive population control program.see a.by including applicants with a well founded fear of persecution as a distinct category,congress directed that an individual in fear of a population control program would be able to qualify for refugee status even in the absence of a showing of past persecution.
in order to establish a fear of persecution,a petitioner must make both a subjective and an objective showing.ins,d.the subjective component can be met through the presentation of candid,credible,and sincere testimony demonstrating a genuine fear of persecution.chen,at internal quotation marks omitted.the subjective fear must have some basis in the reality of the circumstances and be validated with specific,concrete facts,bia,cir internal quotation marks omitted,and it can not be mere irrational apprehension,ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the objective element requires the asylum petitioner to show,with specific,concrete facts,that a reasonable person in like circumstances would fear persecution.chen,at see also b i b.
if an alien can establish past persecution based on a protected factor,the alien is presumed to have a fear of future persecution.gonahasa ins,cir.in contrast,if an alien has been mistreated in the past on the basis of a protected factor,but the mistreatment did not rise to the level of persecution,the alien can not prove a fear of future persecution merely by relying on the past mistreatment.zalega ins,cir instead,the alien must prove that she has reason to believe she will be treated worse,persecuted,upon return to her native country.id.
persecution involves the infliction or threat of death,torture,or injury to one person or freedom,on account of one of the enumerated grounds in the refugee definition.kondakova ashcroft,cir cert.denied,d internal quotation marks omitted accord gormley ashcroft,cir liu ashcroft,cir see also ins stevic,d.although the term persecution includes actions less severe than threats to life or freedom,actions must rise above the level of mere harassment to constitute persecution.dandan ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks omitted accord gormley,at see dandan at holding that detention which included interrogations,beatings,and deprivation of food and water did not compel a conclusion of past persecution kubon ins,cir finding that brief confinement for political opposition to a totalitarian regime did not constitute persecution ins,cir holding that a detention did not amount to persecution.persecution is an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment that our society regards as offensive.gormley,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.for example,brief detentions and repeated interrogations by governmental officials over a substantial period of time do not rise to the level of persecution.see,zalega,at upholding bia determination that alien had not been persecuted despite four years of intermittent searches,arrests,and detainments.similarly,economic penalties rise to the level of persecution only if such sanctions are sufficiently harsh to constitute a threat to life or freedom.ahmed ashcroft,cir see also stevic,at.persecution has also been construed to encompass economic sanctions sufficiently harsh to constitute a threat to life or freedom.
courts,thus,have been reluctant to categorize detentions unaccompanied by severe physical abuse or torture as persecution.see dandan at borca ins,cir upholding determination that illegal searches,interrogations and threatening phone calls did not amount to persecution skalak ins,cir upholding determination that two detentions and interrogations did not amount to persecution zalega,at upholding determination that repeated interrogations did not amount to persecution.even m inor beatings and detentions lasting two or three days,do not amount to persecution.kondakova,at internal quotation marks omitted.in contrast,when one who seeks asylum demonstrates that he has been severely physically abused or tortured,courts have not hesitated to characterize such treatment as persecution.bace ashcroft,cir finding persecution when petitioner was beaten successively by multiple assailants,was attacked and cut with a razor,his home was broken into,his father beaten,and his wife raped in front of him and his family asani ins,cir stating that it was likely that the events described by the petitioner being beaten resulting in the loss of two teeth,deprived of food and water,detained in a cell with no room to sit,and chained to a radiator we re sufficiently serious to rise beyond the level of mere harassment vaduva ins,cir upholding determination that a petitioner was persecuted when he was severely beaten and suffered a broken finger.
in this case,li argues that she has suffered past persecution for her resistance to china coercive population control program and that she has a fear that the persecution will recur if she returns to china.specifically,li contends that both the rmb fine and the required insertion of the iud were persecution for having had an unauthorized child.for the reasons that follow,we hold that the bia decision that neither the fine nor the iud insertion amounted to persecution was not manifestly contrary to law or an abuse of discretion.
we first consider whether the bia was compelled to conclude that the rmb fine amounted to persecution.as we have noted,economic penalties rise to the level of persecution only if they are so harsh as to constitute a threat to life or liberty.according to li,rmb,an amount equivalent to approximately,is more than one year wages for her family in china.although we acknowledge that li fine is a harsh one,we do not believe that it is so large as to compel a finding that it threatens li life or freedom.the state department report on china,which was adopted by the ij,notes that i n quanzhou,fujian province,the fine for violating birth quotas is to be paid over a to year period.department of state country reports on human rights practices for china available at http released.thus,li and her husband were given a substantial period of time to repay the fine,mitigating any risk that the magnitude of the fine posed to li life or freedom.our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that li was willing to incur a debt of more than to the smugglers who brought her to this country.given that li was willing to undertake such a sizeable obligation voluntarily,we can not reasonably say that the bia was compelled to conclude that the much smaller fine threatened li life or freedom.
we next consider whether the bia was compelled to conclude that li was persecuted when she was required to submit to the insertion of an iud.here,because li has not alleged that she was or will be subject to,or has refused to undergo,a forced abortion or forced sterilization,we must consider only whether she has been persecuted for other resistance to a coercive population control program or has a fear of such persecution.a.moreover,because neither the board nor the ij addressed the issue of whether the mistreatment li alleges was imposed for other resistance to a coercive population control program,we would be required to remand to the board for an initial determination on that issue if it were necessary to dispose of this case.see ins ventura,d per curiam.therefore,we address only the narrow issue of whether the penalties of which li complains constituted persecution within the meaning of a.
of these penalties,we have already determined that the fine did not rise to the level of economic persecution.thus,we have only to consider whether the iud requirement constituted persecution.moreover,because li challenges only the insertion of the iud as mistreatment constituting persecution,our holding is correspondingly narrow.in particular,li does not argue that the harms and injuries associated with compelled iud as the continuing invasion of her most intimate bodily privacy and the potentially indefinite disabling of her reproductive taken together with the flagrant violation of personal privacy involved in the actual insertion of the iud,might collectively rise to the level of persecution.instead,apparently because she has voluntarily chosen to leave the iud in place during her residence in the united states,supp,li challenges on appeal,as the treatment constituting persecution,only the act of inserting the iud.see pet.br.at supp.at the iud,as an instrument,in the victim body,is not itself a persecution the process of forceful insertion of the iud into the body of an unwilling recipient is a persecution.
therefore,on this issue,the sole question presented to us is whether the single event of insertion of the iud constituted persecution.moreover,even as to this single act,li does not allege force,physical abuse,or other equivalent circumstances,and thus she does not challenge the manner or means of the insertion.contrast li ashcroft,cir holding that a compelled gynecological examination,conducted by means of force and physical restraint while the victim resisted by kicking and screaming,constituted persecution.rather,li claims only that she was required to submit to what we are left by the bareness of the record and her arguments to believe was a medically routine insertion.that is,but for the fact that the procedure was required,the record contains no evidence that the procedure differed from a voluntary iud insertion,which typically does not cause substantial pain or lasting side effects.see novak textbook on gynecology howard jones iii et,ed williams obstetrics gary cunningham et,ed danforth obstetrics and gynecology james scott et,ed.on these specific and bare allegations,we can not conclude that the bia holding that insertion of the iud alone did not constitute persecution was manifestly contrary to law.b d.if our review here were de novo,or if the record contained evidence of forcible mistreatment or physical abuse of li during the iud insertion,or if li argument on appeal were not so narrowly limited to the single act of insertion,we might well be prepared to hold that the compulsory insertion and required usage of an iud constitutes persecution within the meaning of a.in any event,we would certainly not treat any such claim as dismissively as the ij and bia evidently treated li claim.but,as we are constrained by the standard of review,the bareness of the record,and the issue as deliberately limited by the petitioner,we can not conclude that the bia determination that li was not persecuted was manifestly contrary to law 
finally,given that we have upheld the bia conclusion that li did not suffer past persecution,we must also uphold the bia conclusion that she has not demonstrated a fear of future persecution.li presented no evidence suggesting that she will be treated any worse upon her return to china than she has been in the past.zalega,at.therefore,the bia was not compelled to conclude that li had an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution for resistance to china coercive population control program 
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the bia did not abuse its discretion when it determined that li was not persecuted for resistance to china coercive population control program.we also conclude that the bia did not abuse its discretion when it determined that li had not established a fear of future persecution.accordingly,we deny li petition for review.
petition denied 
even assuming,as the majority finds,that the insertion of li iud was a medically routine insertion,this insertion was still persecution because li was compelled coercively to submit to a procedure that caused her harm,that she found offensive,and that was done in violation of her personal bodily privacy.moreover,li resisted china coercive population control program by voicing her opposition to the iud insertion and its continued required use.however,i would remand this case to the bia to consider whether,per a b,li persecution was on account of any such resistance.therefore,i respectfully dissent.
prior to,the bia consistently held that persecution under china one child family planning policy was not persecution on account of political opinion,and that victims of these policies were therefore not entitled to asylum.in response to this interpretation,congress amended the definition of refugee to include those who had been persecuted under a coercive family planning program,or who legitimately feared such persecution.see a.
since this amendment some jurisprudence on what qualifies as past persecution or a fear of future persecution has emerged.notably,courts have interpreted the plain language of the statute to provide that forced abortions and sterilizations are per se persecution and trigger asylum eligibility.li ashcroft,cir wang ashcroft,cir.spouses of those subject to abortions and sterilizations have also been granted asylum.he ashcroft,cir qiu ashcroft,cir in re,bia.a fear of future persecution has been established in cases in which the chinese government forbade a woman to have a child based on her violation of the policy,zheng ashcroft,cir,and in which a woman,who had also experienced past persecution,feared she would have to undergo sterilization and imprisonment for removing an iud if she returned to china,wang ashcroft,cir.
less defined are cases in which an applicant seeks asylum based on other resistance to a coercive population program.a.the first and only extensive discussion of this category of is the ninth circuit decision in li ashcroft,cir.in li,the court confronted the issue of whether a young woman who announced her opposition to government population control policies and is thereafter subjected to a forced gynecological exam and threatened with future abortion,sterilization of her boyfriend,and arrest satisfies this category.at.
in concluding that she did qualify for asylum,the court analyzed each component of persecution on account of resistance to a coercive population program.under its discussion of persecution,the court concluded that li suffered a forced pregnancy examination in which she was held down after she announced her opposition to china policy and that this qualified as past persecution.id.at.it also found that li had a fear of future persecution because she was threatened with future abortion sterilization as well as imprisonment.id.at.
the ninth circuit then looked at whether a coercive population control program existed in li city.it found ample evidence that china program was in effect in li city and that it applied to li because it set a minimum age for marriage that li had not met,and limited family size to one child per couple.id.at.next,the court considered li resistance and found that she resisted in two ways she vocally resisted the marriageage restriction when she publicly announced her decision to marry after being denied a marriage license and told an official that she planned to have many babies,and she physically resisted by struggling during the forced gynecological examination.id.at.finally,the court considered whether li persecution was on account of her resistance.in finding that it was,the court explained that li clearly would not have been forcibly examined for pregnancy but for her resistance to china population control program.id.
no court has ruled on whether an involuntary iud insertion can qualify as persecution on account of other resistance to china population control program.indeed,the only circuit courts to consider this issue have remanded the question for further consideration thus,our decision in this case is of great import.
for li to be eligible for asylum under a other resistance provision,she must demonstrate that she was subject to persecution on account of resistance to a coercive population control program 
looking first to persecution,the majority seeks to cast the issue of whether an involuntary iud can qualify as persecution under the facts of this case narrowly by asserting that li only challenges the single event of the insertion of the iud and not its continued required usage.ante at.it then notes that li does not allege force,physical abuse,or other equivalent circumstances,but rather that she was only required to have a medically routine insertion of an iud.id.however,neither the record nor common sense supports such a narrow framing of the issue.
first,a full and fair reading of the record and briefs in this case clearly indicates that both the iud insertion and its continued required usage are components of li allegations of persecution.specifically,li states that she experienced abnormal menstruation after the iud was inserted,that it has caused her pain,and that she has been subject to quarterly gynecological exams to make sure that the iud was still inserted,petitioner br.at.such statements clearly indicate that li is challenging the continued required usage of the iud as well as its insertion.
second,common sense dictates that the majority attempt to separate the insertion of th
