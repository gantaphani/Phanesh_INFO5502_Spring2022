discussion 
petitioner is removable as an aggravated felon 
as indicated,conviction of an aggravated felony is a ground for removal under a a iii.a defines aggravated felony to include 
g a theft offense including receipt of stolen property or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year 
this presents two legal issues is at least one of the crimes for which petitioner was convicted a theft offense within the meaning of a g and does petitioner sentence to house arrest remove his crime from the covered theft category because house arrest is not imprisonment.
we address each issue in turn.
petitioner was convicted of a theft offense 
the state law crime of which petitioner was convicted,reads in pertinent part as follows 
theft of services 
b diversion of person is guilty of theft if,having control over the disposition of services of others to which he is not entitled,he knowingly diverts such services to his own benefit or to the benefit of another not entitled thereto.
nugent ashcroft,cir,resolved many of the preliminary issues before us.in nugent we observed that because the immigration and nationality act ina does not define a theft offense,and because congress did not otherwise supply a definition,the court could not find that a theft offense was free from ambiguity,and thus had to determine whether the offense at issue was a theft offense by the formal categorical approach.id.at no one has argued before us that the common law definition of theft incorporated the type of theft crime set forth in the pennsylvania statute before us.we stated in nugent,however,that where a traditional definition of a crime was not in tune with modern meaning,a generic or contemporary definition,such as one found in state statutes,may apply.id.at citing drakes zimski,cir citing taylor united states,d.we agreed in nugent with our sister circuits that it was congress intent for a theft offense to be more broadly defined than the common law definition of larceny,and that by using that phrase,rather than merely the term theft,congress signaled that it was not presenting an exhaustive list of offenses,but rather,a definition with broad meaning.nugent,at citing ins,cir united states,cir en banc superseded on other grounds as recognized in united states vidal,cir.we noted that the and courts defined a theft offense as a taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent.nugent,at citing,at.we relied on pennsylvania consolidated theft statute,which was taken from section of the model penal code,and which defines property in pertinent part as anything of value.nugent,at citing.west 
as to the facts now before us,it is clear that ambulance calls are not valueless.private ambulance companies were alleged in the state criminal proceeding to charge in the range of to for transporting a patient to a hospital.even assuming that this valuation may not be completely accurate,it is apparent that the reason the calls at issue were diverted was because they had value.further,conviction under.b requires the perpetrator to have had control over the disposition of services of others.services are defined at.h to include transportation services.also,the perpetrator must not have been entitled to dispose of those services,and must have had knowing criminal intent,defined by pennsylvania law as awareness of the fact that it was practically certain that his conduct will cause such a result.b ii west williams ins,fed.appx,cir finding conviction for possession of stolen property in the fifth degree,a class a misdemeanor under new york law requiring knowing possess ion of stolen property,an aggravated felony under g.in this case,the term knowingly requires proof that petitioner was aware of the practical certainty that his acceptance of the ambulance call would result in diversion of its benefits to someone not entitled to them.thus,we conclude that the modern sense of the term theft offense under a g includes the crime described in,because it requires the taking or exercise of control over something of value knowing that its owner has not consented.
