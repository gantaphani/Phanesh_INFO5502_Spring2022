opinion of the court 
khalid mahmood butt petitions for review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat the immigration judge ij presiding over butt case denied these claims based on his determination that butt was not credible,and that decision was affirmed without opinion by the bia.because the ij credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence in the record,we grant the petition.
factual background procedural history 
butt is a native and citizen of pakistan.from to,he worked full time in his father dry cleaning business.subsequently,he worked there only so that he could also work for the pakistan people party ppp,a political party.his involvement in that organization increased over time,and in he began working for the ppp full time.butt testified before the ij that he did not receive compensation from the ppp,but his family was sufficiently well off to allow him to continue to work only for the party.butt was the general secretary of his local ppp ward from to.from to,he was also a counselor,which appears to be an elected position within the ppp.
butt testified that,as general secretary,he collected dues for the ppp and held party meetings at his home.he stated that the ppp existed to help local people solve their problems and that it wanted everyone to have a right to speak.butt attempted to assist people within his ward with issues such as obtaining water facilities and health care.he also helped people who had problems with the police.
in the,pakistan was under military rule,and butt testified that he was arrested twice during this charged with being a troublemaker.according to butt,the police told him on both occasions that they did not like the ppp and that he should stop his activities on behalf of the party.each time butt was released after a couple hours.
elections were held in pakistan in,after the governing general died,and the ppp gained power in the country.however,its government dissolved on august.butt testified that he was again arrested on august,and detained until september.he stated that he was not given food or water for two days and that he was beaten at least twice a day,sometimes with a leather strap.butt related his treatment while detained as follows they hung me upside down and beat me.they stripped me and beat me and they beat me up so brutally that my leg and my back were so hurt and still my leg and my back do not function properly.butt stated that he could not walk for some time after he was released.
butt and his wife testified that butt was treated by a doctor sasjad from september,to october,for his injuries and that his treatment took place at home.at his hearing,butt introduced a doctor note regarding this time period that reads certified that i have examined and treated khalid mahmood butt he reported at my clinic with multiple bruises on both legs and back.he remained under my treatment to.when asked about this note,butt testified that he did not remember going to the clinic,but because he was unconscious when he was brought home after his release from detention,he may have been taken to the clinic for treatment at that time without having been aware of it.
butt testified that,after this incident,his friends,family,and the ppp advised him that his life was in danger and that he and his family should leave the country.he stated that he and his family went into hiding at a friend house until they left pakistan for the united states in november.according to butt,the ppp arranged for their visas and passports.
butt also testified that he was being framed for another criminal case right before he left pakistan.a criminal information naming butt,among others,as a member of the ppp was introduced as documentary evidence at his hearing before the ij.butt stated that he had not seen the actual document before he left pakistan but that he knew about it at that time.according to his testimony,some of the other people named in the document were arrested and eventually released.
butt and his family arrived in the united states in november on visitor visas that authorized them to stay in this country until may.he applied for asylum on may,claiming that he feared persecution if returned to pakistan on account of his work with the ppp.butt wife and children filed derivative asylum applications.the immigration naturalization service ins in issued the family notices to appear for staying in the united states beyond the period authorized by their visas and the butt family conceded removability.at this time,butt renewed his application for asylum and withholding of removal.
butt appeared at a hearing before the ij on his asylum,withholding of removal,and cat claims in july,and the ij issued a written decision denying those claims in october.the discrepancies between the testimony of butt and his wife and the documentary evidence that had been submitted caused the ij to conclude that the respondents have deliberately lied to the court.specifically,the ij identified the crucial part of the butts testimony as their statements regarding the events leading to butt incarceration and mistreatment and his examination and care by a physician afterwards.he found that the butts testimony on these issues could not be reconciled with the letter from butt doctor.
the bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion in october.butt petition for review of that decision is now before us

butt principal argument before us is that the ij adverse credibility finding was not supported by the record specifically,he contends that the finding was based solely on the ij erroneous interpretation of the doctor note regarding his treatment and that,if the note is interpreted correctly,the finding can not be upheld butt further argues that,if the ij credibility determination is overturned,the record compels the conclusion that he is eligible for asylum.
a.the ij interpretation of the doctor note 
we must afford the ij adverse credibility finding substantial deference so long as the findings are supported by sufficient cogent reasons.ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted senathirajah ins,cir an immigration judge who rejects a witness positive testimony because in his or her judgment it lacks credibility should offer a specific,cogent reason for his or her disbelief.internal quotation marks,brackets,and citation omitted.in this case,the determination that butt was not credible was based on what the ij perceived as a contradiction between butt testimony and the doctor note that he submitted as corroborating evidence.the ij stated 
if the oral testimony is accurate and butt,after being mistreated seriously,received medical attention at home only,why,the court must ask itself,does the doctor letter explain that treatment was given to butt for a period of days at the doctor clinic.not only does the doctor record state the period,by specifically pointing out the days of his admission and discharge,but it also provides a feeling of seriousness with respect to both the condition butt was in before admission and the type of diagnosis and treatment given plain language interpretation conveys a message that butt was examined and treated by the writer,at the clinic for days assuming a reasonable explanation had been given,and assuming the court would believe the seriousness of these injuries,i could probably understand his forgetting that he was treated at the clinic rather than at home but how does one explain that his wife also forgot such an important fact and distinction 
the ij decision thus makes clear that he read the doctor note to mean that butt had been treated at the clinic itself for days.however,we believe that the plain language of the note does not support that conclusion.as stated earlier,the note states that butt reported at my the doctor clinic with multiple bruises on both legs and back.he remained under my treatment to.
a commonsense interpretation of this statement is that butt went to the doctor clinic for treatment of his injuries and then received further treatment from the same doctor for a period of days.just because butt remained under his doctor treatment after reporting at the clinic does not,in everyday usage,mean that he remained under his doctor treatment at the clinic.people often say that they have remained under a particular doctor care for a certain period of time.if these types of statements actually had the meaning the ij attributed to the doctor similar statement here,a pediatrician who commented that a newborn had been brought for treatment at his or her office and remained under his or her care until age eighteen would be stating that the child continuously received care at the pediatrician office for eighteen years.this interpretation of the pediatrician comment is nonsensical and is certainly not how the statement would be understood if made during the course of a normal conversation.
our example is extreme,but it illustrates our critical concern with the ij interpretation of the note.although the ij characterized his reading of the note as based on its plain language,he did not consider the everyday usage of the phrase remained under his doctor care.instead,the ij read into the note an additional statement that butt remained under the doctor care at the clinic.the ij stated that,if the doctor note could not be reconciled with the crucial part of butt and his wife testimony regarding his treatment,butt case would collapse as a pyramid of cards.not only does this simile stretch to excess,it risks a turnaround is fair play response.see dia ashcroft,cir en banc stating that an ij reasoning process appear ed to break down as the ij,repeatedly,drew an unreasonable conclusion from a fact susceptible to differing interpretations and that such an aggregation of empty rationales devolve d into an unsupported finding of adverse credibility.
the ij saw the contradiction he perceived between the text of the note and butt testimony as evidence that butt had made a deliberate effort to mislead th e court.this conclusion can not stand once we use the straightforward meaning of the butt was treated for bruises on his legs and back at the clinic and then generally remained under the care of the same doctor for over a month not necessarily at the clinic.that reading is consistent with butt testimony that he was beaten so that his leg and his back were hurt and did not function properly he was under the care of sajsad,the author of the note,from september,to october,and his treatment took place at home,but that there could be one possibility that i was almost unconscious when they brought be home.probably they took me to his clinic and then he treated me.butt did not remember the details because his situation was extremely worse at that time.accordingly,contrary to the ij conclusion,the note can be reconciled with butt testimony.and,as there is no contradiction between that testimony and the plain language of the note,there is correspondingly no support for the ij conclusion that butt lied to the immigration court.
the ij also determined that t he doctor letter or note was crucial to the reliability he could attribute to butt other documents and that,apparently because of the purported contradiction between the note and the testimony,t he cloud that hangs over butt evidence has not been dissipated.again,when the commonsense reading of the doctor note is used,it is consistent with butt testimony and therefore can not be viewed as casting or contributing to a cloud over the other evidence submitted by him in support of his asylum application thus,the alleged contradiction between the note and the testimony,based as it is on the strained inferences of the ij rather than on commonly understood usage,does not provide a sound basis for his adverse credibility determination.see dia,at holding that adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence when,inter alia,the conclusions of the ij were more puzzling than plausible,more curious than commonsense.
b.other reasons for the adverse credibility determination 
once the ij conclusions regarding the relationship between the doctor note and butt testimony are unraveled,we are left with only two other reasons advanced by the ij in support of the adverse credibility determination his generic critique of the proffered testimony,which he described as thin and extremely vague and his view of the other documents submitted by butt as equally flimsy in that neither is verified or authenticated.as stated earlier,we afford an ij adverse credibility determination substantial deference if it is supported by specific,cogent reasons,at internal quotations marks and citation omitted.these statements,which were secondary to the ij determination that the note and testimony conflicted as a basis for the adverse credibility determination,are simply too general and conclusory to provide a basis for us to uphold his determination.they do not give any insight into why the ij thought the testimony was vague or why there was reason to question the authenticity of the documents butt submitted.without such an explanation,we are unable to ascertain whether the ij adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence see,dia,at stating that a bsent a reason such as implausibility or inconsistency based in the record,the ij should not have summarily dismissed the petitioner testimony on a particular point mulanga,at holding that an ij disbelief of an alien testimony was unsound when the only foundation the ij articulated for that belief was that the testimony lacked common sense.
in this context,we are compelled to conclude that the ij adverse credibility determination was erroneous.we also note that,once the doctor note is given its plain language meaning,it is,as stated above,reconcilable with butt testimony,removing the only inconsistency the ij pointed to in his decision.the ij himself stated that,without the contradiction he perceived,t he testimony presented was thin but it would have survived a certain degree of consistency if consistency is crucial to credibility,as we think it is,we do not see how the record in this case can support an adverse credibility determination.however,in keeping with supreme court and our precedent,we give the ij an opportunity to revisit the credibility issue on remand without regard to his prior adverse credibility determination see ins ventura,d per curiam appellate courts should,upon reversing a decision of the bia,remand the case to the agency
