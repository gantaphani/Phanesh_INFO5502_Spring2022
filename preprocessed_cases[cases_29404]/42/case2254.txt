this is the consolidated appeal of two defendants who were convicted of participating in large document forgery operation known as the organization the organization.this group provided false green cards,driver licenses,and social security numbers to illegal immigrants.elias marquez was accused of being an office manager of sorts for the organization and producing fraudulent documents himself.elias munoz was accused of being a photographer for the organization.both defendants pleaded guilty and challenge only their sentences.marquez,who received an sentence of months of imprisonment,argues that he should have received a reduction for a minor role in the offense and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.he also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.munoz,who received an sentence of months of imprisonment,challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence and the district court order that he use his earnings from the inmate financial responsibility program to pay his fine.we affirm both sentences,but modify munoz judgment to make clear that participation in the inmate financial responsibility program is voluntary.
background 
the organization was a large conspiracy dealing in fraudulent documents that operated for over fifteen years in the little village area of chicago,along street between albany and louis.the organization produced and sold fraudulent documents including resident alien cards,social security cards,driver licenses,and state identification cards.the organization also smuggled illegal aliens to chicago to serve as street vendors known as miqueros.scattered throughout the parking lot at the discount mall at albany and street,these miqueros would sell false identification documents to passing pedestrians and motorists.
when a miquero found a paying customer,he took that customer to munoz photo shop.munoz owned and operated the photo shop since.munoz would provide the customer with a blank form printed in both english and spanish on which the miquero would record the name,address,date of birth,and other identifying information the customer wished to have appear on the fraudulent document.munoz then created identification photographs of the customer with a background suitable for the type of identification document the customer was purchasing.the government estimates the revenue derived by munoz from these sold for to at least per year.
once a miquero accumulated enough orders from customers,he would use a runner to send the orders to the office where the false documents were made.from at least april,marquez worked in the office,where he manufactured false documents,resolved payment disputes,and directed the miquero daily operations at trial,the government introduced recorded telephone conversations of marquez engaging in these activities for example,inquiring about the status of a miquero who had been arrested by the police,directing a different miquero to get current on money he owed the organization,and explaining which miqueros would work which shifts on a given day.
munoz,marquez,and other individuals were indicted on july.on july,munoz pleaded guilty to conspiracy to produce false identification and immigration documents,in violation of u.on september,the government filed a superseding information against marquez,charging him with one count of conspiracy to unlawfully produce identification and immigration documents in violation of,and one count of producing identification documents in violation of a and.marquez pleaded guilty to the superseding information the next day.
following a january,sentencing hearing,the district court sentenced munoz to months of imprisonment,to be followed by two years of supervised release,and imposed a fine.marquez sentencing hearing was held on april,the district court sentenced him to two terms of imprisonment,to be served concurrently,followed by three years of supervised release,and imposed a fine of.
ii.analysis 
we begin with the issues presented by marquez.marquez first argues that the district court erred in denying him a reduction for a mitigating role in the offense.we review a district court interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines de novo and its for clear error.see united states haynes,cir.because it rests on a finding of fact by the district court,we review the district court denial of a mitigating role reduction for clear error,and will reverse only if our review of the evidence leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.at quoting united states,cir.
the sentencing guidelines provide a detailed system for weighing a conspirator role in the offense.if a defendant was a minimal participant,he is entitled to receive a decrease.if he was a minor participant,he is entitled to a decrease.for those whose role fell between minimal and minor participation,a decrease is appropriate.see.
marquez claims that he fell between a minimal and minor participant because his job was simply to follow the orders of the leaders of the organization and,specifically,an individual by the name of bonaficio.marquez argued at sentencing that the recorded phone calls do not show him directing the miqueros and negotiating with them over debts owed to the organization on his own authority,but instead show him relaying the commands of bonaficio.
at sentencing,the government argued that marquez should have received a enhancement for his role in the conspiracy.the government maintained that the wiretapped conversations showed that marquez was a middle manager for the conspiracy.the government also relied on the fact that more than of the conspiracy cash was found in marquez closet.
the district court concluded that marquez telephone conversations were inconclusive as to his responsibility and noted that marquez had not recruited anyone into the conspiracy.on the other hand,it found that marquez was more involved in the conspiracy than the miqueros he supervised.the district court therefore rejected both parties arguments for a adjustment.
we find no error in the district court decision not to give marquez a reduction.indeed,he appears to have received the benefit of the doubt at sentencing,as the district court found the evidence inconclusive as to whether he was in fact a middle manager.even if marquez was not an autonomous,he was still entrusted with significant administrative duties and a large quantity of the organization cash was found in his home.these two factors alone suggest that his role was at least as significant as that of a typical member of the conspiracy.finally,we note that in calculating his guideline range,the district court relied only on the quantity of false documents for which marquez was personally responsible.thus,marquez is not being unfairly punished for conduct that was unforeseeable to him based on his role in the conspiracy.
marquez raises another challenge to his guidelines calculation.he argues that he should have received a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.marquez pleaded guilty.however,a defendant is not entitled to an acceptance of responsibility reduction merely because he pleaded guilty.see united states krasinski,cir.the district court declined to find that marquez accepted responsibility because it found that marquez untruthfully minimized his participation in the conspiracy,was at his plea hearing,and falsely denied knowing that his conduct was a crime.we have previously affirmed district courts who denied a defendant an acceptance of responsibility reduction after the defendant attempted to minimize his level of involvement in an offense.see,united states.fiore,cir united states jones,cir.marquez argues that he can not lose acceptance of responsibility for making legal arguments challenging his sentence.see united states purchess,cir.but marquez made factual claims the district court found untruthful,rather than legal arguments based on admitted facts.marquez has not pointed to any evidence that casts doubt on the district court factual findings indeed,his previous deportation for distributing false documents makes his claim that he did not know he was committing a crime i
