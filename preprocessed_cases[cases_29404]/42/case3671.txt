guillermo petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia denial of his motion to reconsider its rejection of his appeal of an immigration judge ij decision as being untimely filed.sought to excuse the late filing as having been caused by an overnight delivery service failure to deliver the notice until the day after the bia deadline.he argues that the bia determination that it lacks jurisdiction to extend the appeal filing deadline conflicts with this court decision in oh gonzales,cir,which held on similar facts that the deadline is subject to exceptions in rare circumstances.in response,the attorney general asserts that the bia subsequent decision in in re liadov,i n bia,which expressly addressed and rejected the holding in oh,is the governing authority.because b is ambiguous regarding the bia jurisdiction to consider late filings,and because the bia interpretation in liadov is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the language of the regulation,we hold that supreme court precedent requires us to give deference to the bia construction of b,and we affirm the bia denial of motion to reconsider its rejection of his appeal of the ij decision as being untimely filed.
factual and procedural background 
removability charges and ij proceedings 
a native and citizen of mexico,entered the united states illegally in.in november,united states immigration and customs enforcement commenced proceedings against him by filing a notice to appear nta,charging him with removability as an alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled,pursuant to a a i.
at a hearing before an ij in december,admitted the allegations in the nta and conceded removability.in october,he filed an application for cancellation of removal or,in the alternative,for voluntary departure.the ij denied these requests in december.
bia proceedings 
initial appeal 
on january,counsel filed a notice of appeal noa with the bia.the bia dismissed the appeal as untimely because,pursuant to b,the noa was due one day earlier,on january.the bia observed that in light of the jurisdictional dismissal,if either party wish ed to file a motion to reconsider challenging the finding that the appeal was untimely,it had to file the motion with the board.however,if either party was challenging any other finding or seek ing to reopen the case,it had to file the motion with the immigration court.
motion for reconsideration 
in march,filed a motion for reconsideration or,in the alternative,for the bia to certify the appeal to itself.he argued that the bia had jurisdiction over his untimely appeal in light of the rare circumstances exception explained in oh gonzales,and zhong guang sun department of justice,cir.
in a supporting declaration,counsel stated that after he retained her on january,she made an appointment with the immigration court on january,to listen to the tape recordings of the ij proceedings.upon opening the envelope containing the tapes,she was surprised to find that there were at least five tapes,which included a rather long oral decision by the ij,and needed to research a few legal issues before she could write the notice of appeal with enough specificity so that it would not be summarily dismissed.she completed this additional research and prepared the noa by the end of january,and was aware that there would be no mail service on january or,because the was a sunday and the was martin luther king.day.
counsel declaration further states that,on january,she mailed the noa via the united states postal service usps express mail delivery service,which guaranteed delivery of the noa to the bia on the due date of january.she notes that although the time for a delivery to the bia was,she delivered the noa to the usps station at to ensure that there was ample time for the delivery,and that in her over ten years of experience using usps for overnight deliveries,she had never before had a document delivered late.she also states that usps,through its agent with whom she spoke by telephone,admits that it failed in delivering the express mail package as guaranteed and indicates that they will provide a refund upon request at any post office.
in denying motion for reconsideration,the bia first observed that rather than establishing an error of fact or law in the board prior decision,he instead argued that the board should make an exception to the filing deadline,or at the very least,accept the appeal on certification.next,the bia noted counsel argument that unlike the respondent in in re liadov,i n bia,she did not wait until the last possible moment to prepare the brief,but worked diligently for several days to prepare it,even traveling to the immigration court in san francisco to listen to the tape of the immigration judge decision.the bia then concluded 
the board does not observe the mailbox rule accepting the mailing date as the filing date.a notice of appeal from the decision of an immigration judge must be filed at the board no later than calendar days after the immigration judge renders an oral decision or mails a written decision.receipt by any other it the postal service,commercial courier,or institution of not suffice.the regulations set strict deadlines for the filing of an appeal,and the board does not have the authority to extend the time in which to file a notice of appeal.see b.short delays in delivery are to be expected,and they do not warrant consideration of an untimely appeal on certification.see in re liadov.
this petition for review followed.

discussion 
argues that the bia determination that it lacks authority to extend an appeal filing deadline under b contravenes this court decision in oh gonzales,thereby requiring remand to allow the agency to exercise its discretion whether to accept his noa as a rare circumstance.
in oh,the petitioner similarly appealed the bia denial of her motion to reconsider its prior decision dismissing her appeal of an ij order as untimely filed,arguing that the bia should have excuse d the late filing as having been caused by an overnight delivery service failure to deliver the notice until well past the bia filing deadline.at.the ij had issued his decision,and thereby triggered the deadline,on january,and the petitioner had mailed her noa by overnight mail on february.id.the carrier,however,failed to deliver the noa until february.id.in denying the petitioner motion for reconsideration,the bia,as in the present case,ruled that it does not have the authority to extend the time in which to file a notice of appeal under b.id.at.
the oh court disagreed with the bia conclusion and remanded.id.at.in doing so,the court noted the attorney general argument,also advanced here,that the bia lacks authority to extend the time in which to file an appeal based on da cruz ins,cir,which held that t he time limit for filing an appeal to the bia is mandatory and jurisdictional.the oh court distinguished this precedent,observing that as the authority da cruz cites for this proposition states,d espite the note of finality sounded by this principle,it is not inflexible.oh,at quoting ins,cir the oh court also found it significant that the bia own practice manual explicitly encourages aliens to use overnight delivery services to ensure prompt delivery.although warning that delivery delays do not affect existing deadlines,nor does the board excuse untimeliness due to such delays,the manual itself expressly acknowledges that in rare circumstances the bia may excuse late filings.id.quoting bia practice manual,ch.b.
based on this reasoning,the oh court held that t he bia deadline is thus subject to exceptions in rare circumstances,even when the notice of appeal does not actually arrive before the deadline.id.citing ins,cir en banc,for the proposition that i f a time limit is jurisdictional,it is not subject to the defenses of waiver,equitable tolling,or equitable estoppel,although there may still be exceptions based on unique circumstances emphasis added citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the court then applied this holding,stating 
on its face,oh use of one of the overnight delivery services the bia recommends airborne express is identified by name would appear to qualify her for relief from late filing as a unique or rare at least to be considered for such relief,with some reasoned explanation should the bia reject her proffered excuse.as the case comes to us,oh has a colorable claim that she was misled into relying on the recommended overnight delivery service,and on the rare circumstance exception to remedy what appears to be an extraordinary lapse on airborne part.the bia refusal to reconsider her claim in these circumstances,based on its erroneous assumption that it lacked authority to do so,was an abuse of discretion.
id.accordingly,the court remand ed to allow the bia to exercise its discretion as to whether to accept oh notice of appeal as a rare circumstance.id.at.
b.in re liadov 
a year after the oh decision,the bia expressly addressed and disagreed with it in in re liadov,i n bia.specifically,the bia stated 
the regulations governing appeals to the board,the statute governing administrative appeals in asylum cases,and the authority of the supreme court all require that filing deadlines be strictly enforced and thus that appeals be timely filed.neither the statute nor the regulations grant us the authority to extend the time for filing appeals.we therefore do not agree with the court suggestion in oh gonzales that we have the authority to extend the appeal time.
liadov,i n at.importantly,however,the bia also held that w here a case presents exceptional circumstances,the board may certify a case to itself under c.id.
c.the bia reasonable interpretation of its regulations in liadov is entitled to deference 
although asserts that the bia reading of b in liadov is foreclosed by this court conflicting construction in oh,supreme court precedent requires us to give deference to the bia interpretation in this instance.under auer robbins,d,an agency interpretation of its own regulation may be entitled to substantial deference from a reviewing court.see gonzales oregon,d.to determine whether auer deference applies,we conduct a inquiry.first,auer deference is warranted only when the language of the regulation is ambiguous otherwise,t o defer to the agency position would be to permit the agency,under the guise of interpreting a regulation,to create de facto a new regulation.christensen harris county,d.second,if the regulation is ambiguous,then the agency interpretation of it is controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.under this standard,we defer to the agency interpretation of its regulation unless an alternative reading is compelled by the regulation plain language or by other indications of the agency intent at the time of the regulation promulgation.bassiri xerox,cir quoting thomas jefferson shalala,d emphasis added alteration in original.
applying these principles here,we hold that the plain language of b is ambiguous as to whether the bia may extend the filing deadline.the provision states,in relevant part 
the notice of appeal to the board of immigration appeals of decision of immigration judge shall be filed directly with the board of immigration appeals within calendar days after the stating of an immigration judge oral decision or the mailing of an immigration judge written decision.if the final date for filing falls on a saturday,sunday,or legal holiday,this appeal time shall be extended to the next business day.
b.as the oh court noted,this language says nothing about the bia jurisdiction to consider late filings.at.nor,however,does it say anything about the bia authority to review such filings in rare circumstances.given the regulation silence on the issue,neither construction is clearly foreclosed.
for the following reasons,we also hold that the bia interpretation of b in liadov is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.see auer,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.first,the bia interpretation conforms to the wording of the relevant regulations.the word shall in b indicates a mandatory time frame,and the rest of the provision further indicates only one exception for extensions if the final date for filing falls on a saturday,sunday,or legal holiday,this appeal time shall be extended to the next business day.id.at the same time,related provision c states that t he date of filing of the notice of appeal shall be the date the notice is received by the board.emphasis added.based on the plain language of the regulations,therefore,the bia in liadov reasonably concluded that neither a mailbox,accepting the mailing date as the filing a rare circumstances exception for late filings,applies.
second,as explained in liadov,the bia interpretation conforms to the wording of the bia own practice manual 
the board of immigration appeals practice manual practice manual,which also addresses the issue of filing appeals,emphasizes the importance of timely filings.it clearly states that an appeal or motion is not deemed filed until it is received by the board and that the board does not observe the mailbox rule.see practice manual a i,at july,
moreover,in two places the practice manual specifically cautions that use of an overnight delivery service does not mean that failing to meet filing deadlines will be excused.according to a iv,the failure of a courier or overnight delivery service does not excuse parties from meeting filing deadlines.practice manual a iv,at.in addition,b iv provides,in pertinent part,as follows 
delays in or delivery delays do not affect existing deadlines,nor does the board excuse untimeliness due to such delays,except in rare circumstances.parties should anticipate all post office and courier delays,whether the filing is made through first class mail,priority mail,or any overnight or other guaranteed delivery service.
liadov,i n at.it is true,as the oh court noted,that the practice manual acknowledges that in rare circumstances the bia may excuse late filings.at.however,given that this acknowledgment is consistent with the bia conclusion in liadov that it may still take untimely cases in rare or extraordinary circumstances pursuant to its discretionary certification authority under c,i n at,it does not compel an alternative reading of b or indicate that the bia interpretation is plainly erroneous.
third,the bia construction sensibly conforms to the purpose of the regulations.as noted in liadov,m eaningful filing deadlines are as critical to the smooth and fair administration of the board as they are to the courts,particularly given the extraordinary volume of appeals,motions,and other filings that must be efficiently processed,tracked,and adjudicated.i n at.indeed,in,recognizing the importance of both enforcing such deadlines and simultaneously allowing the parties sufficient time in which to file appeals,the board by regulation lengthened the period for filing administrative appeals from ten days to thirty days.id.citing executive office for immigration review motions and appeals in immigration proceedings,codified at b and subsequently recodified at b.the bia in liadov reasonably found that this is a fair and generous filing period and one that the parties must take seriously,observing that t he filing time was not extended to simply push the window of filings days forward.id.
fourth,the bia interpretation comports with the supreme court approval of the adoption of strict filing deadlines in other contexts.in united states locke,for example,the court stated 
the notion that a filing deadline can be complied with by filing sometime after the deadline falls due is,to say the least,a surprising notion,and it is a notion without limiting principle.if late filings are acceptable,late filings might be equally acceptable,and so on in a cascade of exceptions that would engulf the rule erected by the filing deadline yet regardless of where the cutoff line is set,some individuals will always fall just on the other side of it.filing deadlines,like statutes of limitations,necessarily operate harshly and arbitrarily with respect to individuals who fall just on the other side of them,but if the concept of a filing deadline is to have any content,the deadline must be enforced.any less rigid standard would risk encouraging a lax attitude toward filing dates.a filing deadline can not be complied with,substantially or otherwise,by filing by one day.
d quoting united states boyle,d.in addition,the court recently clarified that the timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement,and that b ecause th e court has no authority to create equitable exceptions to jurisdictional requirements,use of the unique circumstances doctrine is illegitimate.bowles russell,d.
finally,as the eighth circuit noted in similarly deferring to the bia interpretation in liadov as a permissible interpretation of b,t he bia has declared for more than fifty years that the regulation prescribing the time within which an administrative appeal must be filed is mandatory and may not be extended by the bia.liadov mukasey,cir see,in re dirphys,i n,bia there is no provision in the pertinent regulation which gives this board power to extend time within which an appeal must be filed.in re,i n,bia we rule that under the applicable regulations,there is no authority to extend the time for filing an appeal.in re escobar,i n,bia acknowledging that failure to timely file an appeal results in the decision becoming administratively final such that the bia lacks jurisdiction to hear the appeal.indeed,c onfirming this longstanding agency rule,the attorney general ruled in that t his deadline is mandatory and jurisdictional.liadov mukasey,at quoting in re jean,i n,bia alterations in original.
accordingly,because b is ambiguous regarding the bia jurisdiction to consider late filings,and because the bia interpretation in liadov is not plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the language of the regulation,we must give auer deference to the bia construction that the agency lacks authority to extend the appeal time under b,but may certify a case to itself where it presents rare and exceptional circumstances under c see liadov,i n at.we also hold that,under auer and its progeny,to the extent oh was grounded in the ambiguous language of b,the bia reasonable discretionary interpretation of b in liadov has effectively overruled the prior,contrary holding in oh.see miller gammie,cir en banc stating that although a panel is usually bound by the opinion of a prior panel,this court has recognized an exception where the reasoning or theory of this court prior circuit authority is clearly irreconcilable with the reasoning or theory of intervening higher authority,such that the prior panel decision has been effectively overruled gonzales dep t of homeland,cir citing miller,at,for the proposition that t he supreme court opinions in chevron,nrdc,d,and cable telecomm.ass brand x internet,d,together hold that to the extent that ashcroft,cir was grounded in the ambiguous language of a provision of the immigration and nationality act,the bia reasonable discretionary construction of the statute in in re,i n bia has effectively overruled contrary holdings in.
conclusion 
we conclude that,based on supreme court precedent,we must defer to the bia reasonable interpretation in liadov that the agency lacks authority to extend the deadline for filing an appeal.as a result,the bia did not abuse its discretion in denying motion to reconsider its rejection of his appeal of the ij decision as being untimely filed.
i respectfully dissent.i am filing the same dissent in holder,wl and turcios holder,wl,because these two cases raise identical legal issues,in materially similar factual and legal contexts.the issue in both cases is whether the board of immigration appeals ought to have considered an appeal that was sent in time to arrive before the deadline,and was guaranteed by the shipper to arrive in time,but got stamped in at board headquarters the day after the due date.the merits are not at issue before us,just lateness.the issue of lateness affects innumerable cases,and it is a matter of chance whether an alien attempting to appeal falls into this pit.
in turcios,the alien lawyer attached to his motion for reconsideration a letter from fedex express.fedex says that although the shipment was due for delivery by on december severe weather conditions caused an extensive and lengthy disruption of our transportation system,and thus the parcel did not reach its destination on the anticipated date.delivery was completed on december at 
in,the alien lawyer personally brought the notice of appeal to the post office first thing in the morning for guaranteed express mail delivery the next day,which would have been timely.however,for the first time in over ten years,attorney was let down by late express mail delivery.a clerk told her that some sort of error appeared to have been made by the post office at the airport in virginia.the post office error caused the notice of appeal to get to the bia a day late 
although the bia interprets the statutes and regulations as requiring that filing deadlines be strictly enforced,the bia also acknowledges that it has the authority to relieve litigants from the consequences of late filing for exceptional circumstances.the bia,in both cases,followed its own panel decision in in re liadov which held that short delays by overnight delivery services are not extraordinary,so appellants must take such possibilities into account and act accordingly.the only place notices of appeal can be filed is falls church,virginia so evidently act accordingly means fly to one of the area airports or send the notice at some unknown and unpredictable time prior to the deadline so that the bia would think the delivery service delay extraordinary.the board holds that even though it lacks authority to extend the thirty day deadline,it does have authority to certify a case to itself under c where a case presents exceptional circumstances.
oddly,the bia does not provide for any means of filing notices of appeal other than showing up in falls church,a trip most aliens could afford to pay their lawyers to make from outside the sending the papers by post office or private delivery service.federal courts,no seekers of novelty themselves,generally provide for electronic case filing the federal rules of civil procedure expressly address electronic filing doubtless electronic filing saves attorneys in places like alaska,or for that matter most of the rest of the country,a great deal of money on ulcer medicine,and more important,saves their clients from the risk of arbitrary horrendous consequences due to chance post office and delivery delays.it was an act of god that weather prevented timely delivery of turcios fedex package,but the consequence of that late delivery was easily avoidable by people at the agency.just as we have for many decades assumed the availability of telephones,automobiles,and airplanes,we ought to be able to assume the availability of email over the internet.
the board has tossed a couple of red herrings across the path to justice.first,it says that the thirty day deadline is jurisdictional and it lacks authority to extend it.but as the board says in liadov,it nevertheless retains authority to grant relief from late filing in exceptional or extraordinary circumstances.second,the board says it does not have a mailbox rule.this argument is irrelevant,because no one argues that it does.a mailbox rule means that an act is deemed accomplished when the required submission is mailed as opposed to when it is received or fi
