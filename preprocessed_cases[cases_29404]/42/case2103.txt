blaise mapouya petitions for judicial review of an order rendered by the board of immigration appeals bia denying his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman,or degrading treatment of punishment the convention or convention.for the reasons set forth below,we vacate and remand this case to the bia for further proceedings.
background 
blaise mapouya is an ethnic mbochi born in brazzaville,congo on january.he fled congo on march,and eventually entered the united states illegally through new york city on august,using a borrowed passport.mapouya made his way to memphis,tennessee,and in october,he filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention on the application,mapouya claimed asylum based on political opinion.after recounting that mapouya was subjected to violence and torture in the days of the congolese civil war,the application included mapouya assertion that he would not return to congo as long as denis is president,because i do not want to put my life in danger.
in april,the ins charged that mapouya was removable from the united states because he entered the country illegally.at the initial hearing before the immigration judge ij in july,mapouya,through counsel,admitted the ins charge and conceded his removable status.on may and,the ij conducted a hearing on mapouya requests for relief.mapouya produced evidence in support of his application including the department of state country report on human rights practices for the congo several amnesty international reports or documents a united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr attestation letter issued in gabon his birth certificate and two letters from individuals still living in congo.mapouya presented one witness,ibrahima viong,and mapouya also testified on his own behalf.
a recounting of recent events is necessary to better understand the details of mapouya testimony.in the second half of,violence and civil war returned to the republic of congo hereinafter congo when,the country former military strongman,ousted the country first democratically elected president,pascal lissouba,who had ruled congo previously from after a coup,once again seized power militarily in october after several months of vicious fighting between government and militia troops loyal to lissouba on one side,and forces on the other angolan troops also crossed the southern border and intervened at different places on behalf,including in the capital city of brazzaville,which is located in the southeast region of the country.
strong ethnic overtones are present in congolese politics,and the civil war was no different.generally,the conflict can be characterized as pitting northerners,who supported and his congolese labour party pct,against southerners,who supported former president lissouba and former prime minister bernard kolelas.the mbochi,which are one of the larger bantu ethnic groups,are located primarily in the northern regions of congo.accordingly,the mbochi are traditionally strong supporters,especially because is mbochi as well.conversely,supporters of lissouba and his union for social development party the translated acronym for which is upads are primarily southern congolese tribes,which are mainly lari ethnic groups.any divergence from these affiliations,while not unheard of,is rare.mapouya appears to be one of these few exceptions.
with this background in mind,mapouya testimony is as follows.
in october of,mapouya was living in brazzaville and working as a housekeeper in the home of albert yangari,a lari tribe member.while yangari official position is unknown,he was apparently a prominent lissouba supporter a upads party official who worked directly under lissouba.on october,approximately fifty armed soldiers in green uniforms broke into yangari house while mapouya was there working.the intruders arrested yangari and then summarily executed him.the men also shot and killed yangari wife and children.the soldiers arrested mapouya as well,but when they learned he was mbochi they did not kill mapouya.instead,the were also him into custody and transported him to the central jail in brazzaville.mapouya wife and child were not in brazzaville at the time mapouya had previously requested yangari help to get his family out of the country in light of the surging violence a few months earlier.
the cell in which mapouya was detained and held without counsel was extremely overcrowded and contained no furniture or bathroom facilities aside from two tin cans which were to be used as toilets.mapouya only left this cramped and crowded cell when soldiers came to take him into the basement for interrogation.the questioning centered around mapouya role with the upads and yangari relationship with lissouba.when mapouya told his captors he was just a regular upads member and knew nothing about his boss activities,he was accused of lying.consequently,the soldiers beat and tortured mapouya with clubs and sticks.the beating lasted about an hour.
mapouya was detained for three months,during which time he was similarly interrogated and beaten every morning.his captors finally released mapouya because they had nothing with which to charge him,but they ordered mapouya to remain within brazzaville.to ensure that mapouya followed their order to stay in the city,the soldiers also ordered him to report to the police station every week.mapouya complied with the soldiers orders initially,but each time he reported back to the police station,the soldiers threatened to kill him if he was not truthful.the soldiers also beat mapouya during these visits to the police station,and after three consecutive weeks of the same treatment,mapouya refused to report any further.
government troops appeared at mapouya home in february of,less than one month after his last report to the police station.they accused mapouya of supporting lissouba,and forcefully took him back into custody.the soldiers beat mapouya when arresting him,and then again after they reached the central prison in brazzaville.mapouya was dumped in a cell without windows or furniture,along with approximately fifteen other detainees.once a week mapouya captors would take him from the cell to a special torture room,where he was interrogated about his former boss relationship with lissouba.although his captors and tormentors were also mbochi,mapouya had a problem because of his boss.
mapouya remained in custody without charge,subject to weekly torture sessions,for eleven months,at which point he was released.the soldiers,before releasing him,confiscated mapouya passport and the documents he held evidencing ownership of his house.mapouya was also ordered to remain in congo,but instead,mapouya decided to flee congo in search of his wife and child.
he headed for gabon,which shares a border with congo and to which mapouya wife and child had fled in.to successfully cross the border in gabon took mapouya nearly eight months.trying to enter gabon undetected,mapouya traveled and hid in the bush with a group of refugees,as the group attempted to find an unsecured stretch of border to cross.gabon was generally opposed to allowing refugees into the country,but mapouya eventually succeeded,and he managed to procure a unhcr document in gabon granting him refugee status until september,a period of one year time 
the gabonese authorities subsequently discovered mapouya residing in the country illegally after the unhcr document expired,and they informed mapouya that he had to leave the country or be remanded into custody and returned to congo.fearing a return to congo,mapouya obtained another man passport with the help of some friends and escaped to the united states 
mapouya also called ibrahima viong to testify during the immigration hearing.viong,who is also congolese but of lari ethnicity,met mapouya in memphis a few days after mapouya arrived in the united states.the two men did not know each other before meeting in memphis.viong testimony consisted of his retelling the same story as recounted above,with the exception that viong testified that mapouya fled to mali from congo.mapouya had previously testified that he fled to gabon.mapouya counsel attempted to question viong to clarify the discrepancy,but counsel for the government objected and the ij sustained the objection.mapouya counsel did not rephrase his question or try to continue his line of questioning.
after considering the oral testimony and record evidence,the ij entered an oral order denying mapouya applications and ordering his removal from the united states.in the order,the ij found mapouya not credible,based on three specific alleged inconsistencies discussed in detail below.the ij then concluded that even if mapouya was credible,he could not meet his burden of proof to sustain his asylum claims.the ij cited two specific reasons for this conclusion first,mapouya provided no corroborating evidence to show what position yangari held with the upads and second,changed country conditions in congo meant that mapouya could not establish a fear of persecution.
the ij also concluded that mapouya was not eligible for withholding of removal.the ij found that mapouya had not shown that it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted on account of one of the five protected grounds if he returned to congo.finally,the ij found that mapouya did not present medical evidence to corroborate his claims that he was beaten for months,and therefore his claim under the convention failed as well.
mapouya appealed to the bia,which affirmed the ij ruling and added further comments on the ij changed country conditions conclusion.mapouya added a due process argument in his bia appeal,citing the ij refusal to hear viong testimony first.he also submitted additional evidence in the form of country reports for congo for and.the bia found no due process violation,reasoning that the ij conducted a full and fair hearing.consequently,the bia dismissed mapouya appeal in an order dated december.this appeal followed.
ii.jurisdiction 
this court has jurisdiction to review the final decision of the bia pursuant to a.
iii.law and analysis 
standard of review 
where the bia adopts the ij reasoning,the court reviews the ij decision directly to determine whether the decision of the bia should be upheld on appeal.gilaj gonzales,cir citing denko ins,cir.in this case,the bia summarily adopted the ij decision while adding a comment on the ij treatment of the rebuttable country conditions question.the bia also made a finding on mapouya due process claim.the court therefore directly reviews the decision of the ij while considering the additional comment made by the bia.id.because the due process claim was not before the ij,the court directly reviews the bia decision on that claim.id.
furthermore,the supreme court recently held that when the ij and,subsequently,the bia does not make the proper inquiry and legal conclusions,supported by legal analysis and reasoning,the proper course,except in rare circumstances,is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.gonzales thomas,d per curiam citing ins ventura,d per curiam.the court noted a court of appeals is generally not empowered to conduct a de novo inquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an inquiry.id.quoting ventura,at.in turn quoting florida power light lorion,d.in one of the two sixth circuit opinions citing thomas,the court explained that where,as here,a reviewing court can not sustain an agency decision because the agency has failed to consider a legal issue central to resolution of the petitioner claims,the appropriate remedy is remand to the agency for further consideration.xin mao wu gonzales,cir.
the supreme court thomas language is especially vexing in light of the review standards previously and,arguably,still applicable.when the court reviews the ij application of legal principles to undisputed facts,rather than its underlying determination of those facts or its interpretation of its governing statutes,the review of both the ij asylum and withholding of deportation determinations is de novo.dorosh ashcroft,cir quoting diallo ins,cir internal quotations omitted.see also,bleta gonzales,cir the immigration judge legal conclusions are reviewed de novo and its factual findings for substantial evidence.citing tapucu gonzales,cir.
by contrast,the court reviews the ij factual findings under the substantial evidence standard.see filipi gonzales,cir.an appellate court will reverse where the evidence in the record not only supports a contrary conclusion,but indeed compels it.mikhailevitch ins,cir quotation marks omitted.in other words,for reviewing the ij factual conclusions,the test is not whether this court might have decided differently but whether this court is compelled to conclude that the ij erred.dorosh,at.
whether the ij actually made a legal conclusion or a factual determination for the court of appeals to review appears to be the critical underlying issue in reconciling the supreme court thomas holding with the other review standards listed above.
finally,claims of due process violations in deportation proceedings are reviewed de novo.gilaj,at citing mikhailevitch,at.
petitioner asylum application 
mapouya requested asylum relief pursuant to b,a section of the immigration and nationality act hereinafter ina.the ij,acting on behalf of the attorney general,has discretionary authority to grant asylum to those applicants who qualify as refugees.ben hamida gonzales,cir.resolution of a request for asylum,therefore,involves a inquiry first,whether the petitioner is a refugee under a a and second,whether the petitioner merits a favorable exercise of discretion by the ij.id.citing ouda ins,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted chen gonzales,cir quoting perkovic ins,cir.
the burden falls on the applicant to show that he or she meets the definition of refugee.see mikhailevitch,at.the testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.see id.citing a see also,cutaj gonzales,cir.accordingly,a credibility determination forms the initial consideration in an ij asylum claims analysis see begu gonzales,cir citing yu ashcroft,cir.here,the government argues that credibility is not an issue before the court because the ij found that even if mapouya were credible,he could not meet his burden of proof.because we believe that the conclusion that mapouya was not credible permeates the ij analysis,we address the ij adverse credibility determination at the outset.
credibility 
contrary to the ij assertion an adverse credibility determination is treated as a finding or conclusion of fact,and is therefore subjected to review under the substantial evidence standard.see,begu.at citing yu,at.the finding,however,must be supported by specific reasons.liti gonzales,cir quoting sylla ins,cir.moreover,those specific reasons must bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.sylla,at.importantly,an adverse credibility finding must be based on issues that go to the heart of the applicant claim,and can not be based on irrelevant inconsistencies.liti,at quoting sylla,at.in other words,if discrepancies can not be viewed as attempts by the applicant to enhance his claims of persecution,they have no bearing on credibility.duan ying chen gonzales,cir citing sylla,at.moreover,speculation and conjecture can not form the basis of an adverse credibility finding,which must instead be based on substantial evidence.liti,at quoting shire ashcroft,cir.the sixth circuit has reversed the credibility determination when it is based on inconsistencies unsupported in the record.id.citing sylla,at ileana ins,cir.
the ij order cited three primary inconsistencies as the basis for his adverse credibility finding based on the analysis that follows,we conclude that the ij focused on irrelevant and arguably nonexistent discrepancies and inconsistencies unsupported by the record as the basis for his adverse credibility finding.
first,the ij clearly placed tremendous importance on a potential inconsistency between mapouya form and mapouya testimony involving why forces detained mapouya.the person translating and transcribing mapouya application wrote that mapouya was detained the second time after the government forces accused him of being a fighter and supporting pascal lissouba.the transcriber also used the same word earlier in the application to describe mapouya arrests.during his at the hearing,however,mapouya testified vehemently that he was not a fighter,and that he was not accused of being a fighter.mapouya testified on redirect that he could neither read nor write english,that he told the transcriber that he had been a lissouba supporter and that lissouba party had worked against the government forces.mapouya also testified that he never said anything to the transcriber about taking up arms against the government or being accused of doing so.additionally,viong testified that mapouya was arrested for supporting the lari people.
notwithstanding mapouya attempts to clarify what was most likely a translation misunderstanding,the ij found this apparent inconsistency very significant.the ij explained that there is quite a difference between being a fighter and being a simple supporter.the ij then made the unsubstantiated assumption that mapouya us ed the word fighter in this context to mean someone who had taken up arms either against sassou nguesso sic or in favor of lissouba.essentially,the ij relied on the general record evidence that civil war was raging in the congo in to assume that mapouya was really accused of being a militia member fighting against.based on this assumption,the ij concluded that t his is not a minor inconsistency but does change very substantially the thrust of mapouya application.
at least two critical problems arise from the ij treatment of this alleged inconsistency,however.first,the ij subsequently offered no reasoned analysis of why the difference in terms changes substantially mapouya application second,and perhaps even more compelling,this alleged inconsistency is unsupported by the record evidence the ij had to impute meaning to a word that was most likely the result of an erroneous translation,and he drew that meaning by speculation and conjecture based on general evidence of warfare in congo at the time.the ij conclusion that mapouya used the word fighter in the militaristic meaning on his application was not based on any specific record evidence that mapouya took up arms against,or that mapouya was ever accused of doing so.indeed,it directly contradicts what the ij described as mapouya vehement denial that he fought militarily the ij unsubstantiated assumptions are not sufficient to support an adverse credibility determination.
whose house was burned 
second,the ij relied on an alleged inconsistency between mapouya testimony and his form involving a house that forces burned down.mapouya stated on his form that he returned home from prison after the second arrest to find that the house i owned was burned.then,during his direct hearing testimony,mapouya testified that the house his parents had lived in was the house that was burned,and that the house in which mapouya,his wife,and child formerly lived was unharmed.the ij cited this alleged inconsistency as one of the three grounds for finding mapouya incredible,despite mapouya subsequent clarification on and redirect.the ij reliance on this alleged inconsistency is erroneous,however,for two reasons.
first and most importantly,the alleged inconsistency does not go to the heart of mapouya asylum application because it is irrelevant to mapouya fear of persecution and torture in the future if he returns to congo.therefore,the alleged inconsistency is an insufficient ground upon which to base an adverse credibility finding under liti and sylla,as outlined previously.
second,a closer reading of the form juxtaposed with mapouya testimony reveals that there was no inconsistency at all,merely the ij frustrated misunderstanding and likely another translation problem.mapouya tried to explain during the that he owned by inheritance the house in which his parents formerly lived,and that it was this house the military forces burned down,not the house in which mapouya himself lived.mapouya attempted explanation,however,only further confuse d the ij.on redirect mapouya testimony further clarified the ownership situation such that an objective observer should have been confused no longer.mapouya explained that his father died in,that his mother died in,and that after his parents died,he became the owner of the house in which his parents had lived while they were alive,he took legal title to the property.according to mapouya testimony,this was the house that was burned.
clearly,in light of the fact that mapouya owned two houses,one of which was burned,there was great potential for translation problems on his form the english language provides myriad ways to state the possessive,all of which may not translate directly from another language but which have dramatically different connotations once translated,ours,theirs,mine,his,hers.the same problem applies to the numerous ways in which the english language can connote ownership of a dwelling,own,have,possess,live,legal ownership,equitable ownership.but even if translator error can plausibly lie at the heart of the supposed inconsistency,the plain language on the form does not create an inconsistency with mapouya testimony at all the uncontroverted evidence is that mapouya did,in fact,legally own the house that was burned,even if the house formerly belonged to his parents.
moreover,specific testimony later in the hearing reveals the ij misunderstanding of the ownership situation.after mapouya testified on direct,the government attorney pounced on and successfully framed any difference between mapouya testimony and his form contents as a major discrepancy.the ij readily adopted the government position,even taking over the at one point.unfortunately,the ij only further contributed to the confusion by misquoting the statements on the form during his questions to mapouya.specifically,the ij exclaimed sir,listen.listen i quoting from your application.your application does say anything about your parents house being burned.it says i was released from prison to find that my house,the house that i owned,was burned.is that true the wording of the ij obviously frustrated questioning is illustrative the ij conflated the descriptive phrases my house which was not the language in the form and the house that i owned the language actually used.the ij treated the phrases as having exactly the same meaning,despite the obviously critical differences between the two.mapouya used the second phrase on his form,but not the first.considering the full context of mapouya testimony,there is no inconsistency,material or otherwise.accordingly,the ij adverse credibility determination,to the extent that conclusion was based on the alleged burned house inconsistency,is not supported by substantial evidence.
viong testimony 
third,the ij cited a single discrepancy between mapouya testimony on direct and the testimony given by his witness,ibrahima viong,to support the adverse credibility determination.the ij found it significant that mapouya testified that he left the congo for gabon,whereas viong testified that mapouya had told viong that he mapouya went to mali notwithstanding this inconsequential detail irrelevance to the heart of mapouya asylum claim,the ij relied on the discrepancy as the third basis for finding mapouya incredible.
curiously,we note that the ij himself characterized his third basis as not quite as serious as the previous two bases discussed above.moreover,the ij even noted the very evidence that undermines his acceptance of viong testimony as the truthful version the unhcr refugee document.the ij,however,did not just note the evidence that corroborated mapouya testimony rather,he flatly ignored it.
the corroborating evidence mapouya offered compels the conclusion that viong simply confused the location of mapouya wife and child mali with the country to which mapouya fled gabon.the unhcr document definitively supports mapouya story he testified that he finally entered gabon successfully in september of,and the unhcr document states that the attestation was issued in gabon on september,expiring on september.accordingly,the ij erred in basing his adverse credibility determination,in part,on the discrepancy between mapouya testimony and viong testimony 
in sum,because the alleged discrepancies advanced by the ij can not be viewed as attempts by mapouya to enhance his claims of persecution,they have no bearing on credibility.begu.at citing sylla,at.the ij provided no legal analysis or reasoning to explain why the alleged inconsistencies he cited are material to mapouya asylum claim.furthermore,the alleged discrepancies cited by the ij do not constitute substantial evidentiary support for a negative credibility finding.
d.the result of the erroneous adverse credibility determination 
consequently,we must analyze the effects of the ij erroneous adverse credibility determination.as explained previously,the first step in an ij evaluation of an asylum application is the credibility determination.begu.at citing yu,at.we conclude that the ij erroneous adverse credibility determination permeated and infected the ij subsequent factual findings and legal conclusions as to whether mapouya could meet his burden on the question of persecution for the asylum and withholding of removal claims,as well as his claim under the convention 
for example,the letters mapouya presented strongly corroborated his fear of future persecution and torture,but the ij failed to acknowledge the letters in his final order.one letter attests to the fact that the rival factions of and lissouba continue to persecute their political opposition,especially on ethnic grounds.the other letter chillingly states that forces are still looking for you in the congo and that mapouya name is on the wanted list at the ministry of the interior as witnessed personally by the letter author.during the hearing,the ij focused only on trying to understand how mapouya could refer to one of the letter writers as his brother when the men are not blood relatives.what should have been a simple concept to understand using my brother as a salutation conveying great affection rather than blood relation became the issue,based on the ij distrust of mapouya,not the letters contents and implications.we decline,however,to make an affirmative credibility finding of our own,because immigration cases are,by nature,so.instead,the court instructs that the case be remanded,and we urge that a different ij to make his or her own credibility determination about mapouya relief requests.we note that even if we were to make a favorable credibility determination on the instant review,we would still be precluded,under ventura and thomas,from ultimately deciding whether to grant mapouya asylum claim the ij ultimate conclusion on the asylum question reached only the first prong of the asylum analysis.see,ben hamida,at chen,at.the ij found that mapouya was not eligible for asylum,but neither analyzed nor answered the second question of whether mapouya deserved asylum.the latter question is,therefore,a matter of first instance appropriately decided by the ij and bia.the ij must make the proper legal inquiries and conclusions on mapouya asylum request after additional investigation or explanation,thomas.at,and,accordingly,his or her own credibility determination.
the fear of persecution and changed country conditions 
after making his adverse credibility determination,the ij found that even if mapouya was credible,he has not shown that he has a fear of persecution in light of the changed circumstances in his country.the bia,addressing only the rebuttable presumption evidence elaborated on the ij conclusion.the bia reasoned that even if the respondent testified credibly and established past persecution,the record contains evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption that the respondent life or freedom would be threatened in the future.specifically,the bia cited specific passages from the country reports that allegedly demonstrated that mapouya no longer has a fear of future persecution.
the bia decision is in error,however.the reasoning in the ij and bia respective opinions fails to consider the additional,corroborating evidence mapouya provided that tends to show he still faces an individualized threat of future persecution,notwithstanding the changed country conditions described in the country reports.
an applicant can establish the persecution element in an asylum application by two alternative methods prove that he or she has suffered past persecution,or show that he or she has a fear of future persecution.gilaj,at.see also mikhailevitch,at citing a b filipi.at the applicant has two options in trying to show persecution.under the first option,an applicant may prove that he or she has suffered persecution in the past,at which point there is a presumption of a fear of future persecution.filipi.at quoting b emphasis added.under the other option,the applicant may show that he or she has a fear of future persecution,b,which must be both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.id.quoting mikhailevitch,at emphasis added.the sixth circuit has held that an applicant can not rely on speculative conclusions or mere assertions of fear of possible persecution,but instead must offer reasonably specific information showing a real threat of individual persecution.mateo gonzales,cir citing harchenko ins,cir citations omitted.
if past persecution raises the rebuttable presumption,the government may rebut that presumption by showing that conditions in the applicant country have changed so that the applicant no longer has a fear of persecution.filipi.at quoting b i a.however,t he ins must do more than show that circumstances in the country have fundamentally changed the ins must also show that such change negates the particular applicant fear of future persecution.mateo.at citing ouda ins,cir.if the government rebuts the presumption,the applicant must demonstrate a fear of future persecution notwithstanding the changed country conditions.liti,at.
for guidance in this case,the liti opinion is instructive.in liti,the majority ultimately concluded that the bia erred in affirming the ij adverse credibility determination.liti,at.it then turned to the issue of changed country conditions,noting that to establish their asylum claim,the litis must demonstrate a fear of future persecution notwithstanding the political change which has occurred in albania since they left in.id.at.this the litis failed to do because the only evidence they provided to rebut the changed country conditions was their own which the majority stated that even if the applicant is credible,the absence of reasonably available corroborating evidence can lead to a finding that an applicant has failed to meet her burden of proof.id.at quotation marks and brackets omitted.the majority indicated that the result would have been different had the litis provided corroborating evidence to refute the country reports in their individual case.id.without such evidence,we agree with the bia that in light of the fundamentally changed conditions in albania,the litis failed to satisfy their burden of demonstrating a fear of future persecution if they were to return.emphasis added.
similar reasoning can be found in other sixth circuit cases.see,daneshvar ashcroft,cir denying asylum based on evidence of changed country conditions in iran when petitioner has presented no credible evidence that he will be singled out for different treatment if he is deported back to iran.cacani gonzales,cir denying review of asylum petition because generalized evidence offered to rebut changed country conditions evidence did not demonstrate that petitioner would face the requisite individualized threat of harm.
here,the situation is somewhat different than liti,because mapouya presented corroborating evidence not from his own mouth,but from two independent sources in africa,and that corroborating evidence shows an individualized threat of harm to mapouya.indeed,in liti,the majority faulted petitioners for not getting corroborating evidence from family members still living in albania,liti,at,who presumably could have provided affidavits of on the ground conditions in albania to refute state department reports of changed country conditions.in mapouya case,perhaps the letters were properly discredited for some reason,but this does not appear anywhere in either the ij or bia discussion of changed country conditions.even if the government can prove that country conditions in congo have changed since,the government must also show by a preponderance of the evidence that such change negates mapouya individualized fear of persecution.the letters,which specifically inform that violence continues notwithstanding the country reports generalized description,and that mapouya is a wanted man in the government eyes,needed to be carefully weighed against the country reports in order for a proper decision to have been made.therefore the bia decision is not supported by substantial evidence,and the bia or ij on remand must carefully weigh mapouya corroborating evidence against the country reports.
petitioner withholding of removal application 
mapouya also requested withholding of removal pursuant to b of the ina,b unlike a discretionary asylum grant,withholding of removal is mandatory if the applicant can establish a clear probability of future persecution.khora gonzales,cir citing b ins stevic,d.a clear probability has been defined as more than a percent likelihood of persecution.stevic,at.the administrative findings of fact on a withholding application are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.
here,the ij concluded that mapouya was not entitled to withholding of removal,but provided no legal analysis or reasoning for his conclusion although an applicant who fails to meet the statutory eligibility requirements for asylum must necessarily fail to meet the requirements for withholding of removal,ben hamida,at citing allabani gonzales,cir,the ij failed to cite even this proposition to support his withholding conclusion.as a corollary,the ij erroneous adverse credibility finding also underlies his withholding of removal denial.therefore the bia or ij hearing the case on remand must also analyze mapouya withholding of removal claim after making a proper credibility determination.
petitioner application for relief pursuant to the conventions against torture 
mapouya also petitions for review of the denial of his convention relief claim.to establish entitlement to such relief,an applicant must prove that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.singh ashcroft,cir citing pilica ashcroft,cir in turn quoting c.a claim under the convention involves a separate question of the threat of torture without regard to the enumerated ground for asylum.karomi gonzales,cir.see also ben hamida,at an applicant seeking relief under the convention does not need to show that torture will occur on account of one of the five statutory grounds listed in the ina.it is possible,therefore,for an applicant for asylum to succeed on a convention claim even though a withholding of removal claim under the ina is denied.karomi.at citing singh,at in turn citing ins,cir explaining that an application for withholding of removal under the ina differs from one filed under the convention because the latter focuses on a particularized threat of torture without requiring a linkage to one of the five protected grounds.
to assess the risk of torture,the adjudicator must consider the possibility of future torture,including evidence of past torture inflicted upon the applicant evidence that the applicant can relocate to a part of the country of removal where he is not likely to be tortured evidence of gross,flagrant,or mass violations of human rights within the country of removal and other relevant information regarding conditions in the country of removal.ali reno,cir.see also singh,at karomi.at.
in mapouya case,the ij only briefly addressed his claim under the convention,stating simply that the evidence falls well short of a grant under that section of law.the ij based this conclusion on the fact that mapouya testified that he was repeatedly beaten for months on end but brings forward no medical evidence and does not corroborate his claim in any meaningful way.we find the ij scant legal analysis and reasoning inadequate,however.
first,the ij adverse credibility determination on the asylum question erroneously infected his analysis of mapouya convention claim.see ndiaye gonzales,cir reversing and remanding on petitioner claim under the convention when ij denial of convention relief was based entirely on his adverse credibility determination on petitioner asylum and withholding of removal claims citing,inter alia,kamalthas ins,cir mansour ins,cir both stating w e are not comfortable with allowing a negative credibility determination in the asylum context to wash over the torture claim.zubeda ashcroft,cir finding error in the ij allowing rulings on petitioner asylum and withholding of deportation claim to control her claim under the convention.
second,and to the extent that the ij order constitutes an additional adverse credibility finding,that second negative credibility determination is similarly unsupported by substantial evidence.critically,an alien allegations of torture are not automatically incredible simply for failure to produce corroborating documentary evidence.singh,at citing c.see also begu.at,the court specifically notes that petitioner failure to provide medical records related to the beatings during her detention does not constitute a reasonable basis for a finding of incredibility not all beatings leave physical marks,and the inability of lay persons to identify such evidence alone is not sufficient to determine that the alleged acts never occurred.
third,the ij did not analyze mapouya convention claim through the lens of the four factors enumerated in ali and outlined above.
accordingly we also remand mapouya claim pursuant to the convention as a matter of first instance under ventura and thomas.
petitioner due process claim 
mapouya claims that he suffered a due process violation because the ij refused to allow him to call viong first.according to mapouya argument,the ij decision was prejudicial to his case because the ij based the adverse credibility determination on the basis of a perceived inconsistency in this case the testimony of mapouya witness.mapouya argues that the discrepancy on whether he fled to mali or gabon could have been rectified had the ij allowed mapouya to call viong first.we find mapouya arguments unavailing.
aliens are entitled to due process of law in deportation proceedings.gilaj,at citing denko,at in turn citing reno flores,d.due process requires that an alien be afforded a full and fair hearing.gilaj,at citing,at in turn citing mikhailevitch,at.to prevail on a due process claim,a petitioner must demonstrate actual prejudice,and that the alleged prejudice materially affected the outcome of his or her case.see matter of sibrun,bia.
while mapouya may be able to establish prejudice from the ij decision the discrepancy in testimonies was one factor the ij cited for his adverse credibility finding,which in turn affected the ij ultimate holdings,mapouya has not demonstrated that the outcome of his case would have been different if the ij had allowed viong to testify first.importantly,the ij hinged his adverse credibility determination on two additional factors unrelated to viong testimony and the discrepancy,as noted previously.the bia determined that mapouya failed to establish that the ij preferred order of witness testimony constituted a violation of his due process rights.we agree and affirm the bia decision on the due process claim.our ultimate conclusion,however,renders mapouya due process claim moot.
iv.conclusion 
upon review,we conclude that the ij made an erroneous adverse credibility finding on the asylum question,and that this negative credibility determination permeates and infuses the ij subsequent findings and conclusions on mapouya additional requests for relief.consequently,the ij order lacks adequate legal analysis and reasoning to support the ultimate conclusions contained therein.on remand,the agency whether the bia or an ij must rehear the case in its entirety and make the proper inquiries and legal conclusions to reach a credibility determination of its own,and then conduct the asylum analysis.similarly,the agency must make the proper inquiry and legal conclusions,supported by legal analysis and reasoning,on mapouya withholding of removal and convention claims.
we urge that,on remand,a different immigration judge be assigned to any further proceedings.see cham gonzales,cir citing sukwanputra gonzales,cir w hile we recognize that the assignment of an immigration judge is within the province of the attorney general,if on remand an immigration judge services are needed,we believe the parties would be far better served by the assignment to those proceedings of a different immigration judge.quoting korytnyuk ashcroft,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.see also,chen gonzales,cir we remand this matter to the bia with directions to return the case to the immigration court,preferably before a different judge,for reconsideration and for any further proceedings that may be considered necessary and consistent with this opinion.guchshenkov ashcroft,cir we urge that these two cases be reassigned to other immigration judges.
accordingly,we hereby grant the petition for review,vacate the decisions and orders below,and remand to the bia for reconsideration and for any further proceedings that may be considered necessary and consistent with this opinion.
the board of immigration appeals bia held that changed country conditions in the republic of congo rebutted any presumption of a fear of persecution on the part of petitioner.this conclusion is supported by substantial evidence and should be upheld.nevertheless,in order to find in favor of petitioner,the majority unreasonably reads our precedents on changed country conditions,ignores the deferential standard of review,and embraces a theory of the evidence not argued by petitioner or supported by the record.while i am not without sympathy for petitioner,my review of the record prevents me from joining the majority.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
the material facts of this case are simple and straightforward.the bia affirmed the judgment of the immigration judge ij on a single ground e ven if petitioner testified credibly and established past persecution,the record contains evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption that petitioner life or freedom would be threatened in the future.at citing b i and b i.the bia reached this conclusion by relying on a report issued by the united states department of state.see dep t of state,country reports on human rights practices for the republic of congo,available at.gov g drl rls hrrpt.htm state department report.the bia reasoned that,in the time since petitioner had left the republic of congo,his political party had become a major political party.furthermore,the bia stated that opposition party officials willing to cooperate with the ruling congolese government or oppose it nonviolently have remained in the country.additionally,the bia noted that members of groups that opposed the government during the war have been permitted to return to their former government jobs.at citing state department report.the bia therefore concluded that petitioner did not demonstrate error in the ij conclusion that country conditions for members of petitioner political party had changed to the extent that any presumption of a fear of persecution stemming from past persecution was rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.
petitioner did produce some evidence on the issue of changed country conditions,which can,be briefly summarized.before the ij,petitioner submitted the state department report several articles published by amnesty international and two letters from persons who reside in the congo.the first letter,written on august,was signed by petitioner friend mavoungou alain.at.alain urge d petitioner not to come back to the congo because sassou group is still looking for you y our name is on the wanted list at the ministry of the interior,i saw it with my own eyes.at.the letter continues that sassou cobras goes sic into people homes,they imprison people,and with no judgment,others are condemned and killed t here is no peace in the congo.at.the second letter,written on june,from petitioner brother van loye,states that rival fractions sic of sassou and those of the former president pascal lissouba,up to now keep going into houses to arrest people especially the ethnics of larry sic which are like us.at.
the sole question that this court must resolve is whether,on this record,substantial evidence supports the bia conclusion that changed country conditions rebutted petitioner presumption of a fear of persecution petitioner conceded removability before the ij,but applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.in order for an applicant to be granted asylum,the applicant must qualify as a refugee as defined in the immigration and nationality act,a a,and demonstrate that he merits a favorable exercise of discretion by the attorney general.ouda ins,cir quoting mikhailevitch ins,cir.the act defines refugee as 
a ny person who is outside any country of such person nationality and who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.
a a see mikhailevitch,at.the applicant initially bears the burden of establishing that he qualifies as a refugee under the act.ramaj gonzales,cir.if the applicant establishes that he suffered past persecution,as the bia assumed in this case,that finding raises a rebuttable presumption that the applicant has a fear of future persecution.id.this presumption can be rebutted only though establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that since the persecution occurred,conditions in the applicant country have changed to such an extent that the applicant no longer has a fear of being persecuted if he were to return.id.internal quotation marks omitted quoting mikhailevitch,at.it is not enough for the government to merely demonstrate that conditions in the applicant country of origin have changed instead,the changes must be such that the applicant no longer has a fear of persecution.b i a.
whether the government has rebutted the presumption of a fear of persecution by demonstrating changed country conditions is a question of fact that this court reviews for substantial evidence supporting the bia decision.see liti gonzales,cir.under the deferential substantial evidence standard,administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.yu ashcroft,cir quoting b b.in this case,the bia factual finding of changed country conditions should be upheld unless petitioner can show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find that the government did not demonstrate changed country conditions by a preponderance of the evidence.see ins,d.the bia decision should be affirmed if,considering the record as a whole,its decision is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence.id.at.
turning to the evidence in the record,it is clear that the bia decision is supported by substantial evidence.petitioner claim for asylum was based solely on political persecution.petitioner claims that he was persecuted for supporting the minority union for social development party upads.the most fundamental change in country conditions was perhaps so obvious that the bia neglected to specifically mention it in the period prior to the time petitioner fled the republic of congo,the country became engulfed in a civil war,which has now ended.according to the state department report,politically motivated killings have stopped.see state department report there were no reports of political killings by the government or its agents.moreover,t here were no reports of politically motivated disappearances during the year.id.additionally,there were no reports that security forces regularly harassed and extorted refugee returnees and residents in outlying areas.id.finally,the state department report supports the three findings relied upon by the bia that upads is a major political party,that opposition party officials willing to cooperate with the ruling congolese government or oppose it nonviolently have remained in the country,and that members of groups that opposed the government during the war have been permitted to return to their former government jobs.id.these facts,taken together,provide substantial evidence supporting the bia finding that changed country conditions rebutted the presumption that petitioner had a fear of persecution.
petitioner makes several arguments that,notwithstanding this evidence,the government has nevertheless failed to rebut the presumption of a fear of future persecution.petitioner argues that the leader who was in power when petitioner left the congo remains in power,and that the judicial branch continues to be subjected to political influence,bribery,and corruption.petitioner br.at.petitioner also argues that there are still reports of unlawful killings by government security forces,as well as documentation of their ability to beat and torture their own civilians with total impunity.petitioner br.at.petitioner contends that the republic of congo still has a poor human rights record that security forces killed civilians in the southern pool region that the government committed various human rights abuses in the same region and that prison conditions continued to be harsh due to overcrowding.petitioner also asserts that the government frequently arrested and detained its citizens and that supporters of the government included mostly people from northern ethnic groups.
none of these facts undercut the bia finding,supported by the state department report,that conditions have changed in the republic of congo such that a fear of political persecution is no longer reasonable.the bia factual findings support the conclusion that political persecution in the republic of congo has subsided.although remains in power,the republic of congo experienced elections in which,while not free of problems,were determined by independent monitors not to contradict the will of the people.at.the mere fact that has been elected to power does not imply that the government of the republic of congo will persecute its citizens on account of their political beliefs.the state department report suggests that such persecution is no longer taking place with any appreciable frequency.while petitioner points to a multitude of unsavory facts about life in the congo,these facts are insufficient to compel a rejection of the bia factual findings,absent a compelling showing that the government continues to subject its citizens to persecution because of their political beliefs.see daneshvar ashcroft,cir we understand that many iranian citizens may live in fear of persecution by the islamic regime.however,the statute requires them to either be members of a particular race,religion,nationality,or social group,or to have the fear based on a political opinion.while petitioner has produced some evidence of poor country is,evidence of corrupt courts,abuses of power by the government security forces,and violations of human has failed to produce compelling evidence that these abuses have been employed to persecute persons on account of their political beliefs.
this case is similar to mayela gonzales,cir unpublished,where this court held that the petitioner,mayela,a citizen of the republic of congo,did not qualify for asylum because she could not establish a fear of persecution.the court reasoned that mayela political party was a major political party according to the united states department of state country report,that opposition parties had been able to campaign openly,hold rallies,and monitor elections,and that many senior political officials from the former government had returned to the republic of congo and resumed political activities without incident.id.the court concluded that,even though soldiers had allegedly done terrible things to mayela,she could not show that the alleged abuses were a political reprisal rather than wanton violence during a civil war.id.the evidence relied upon by the bia here is strikingly similar to the evidence that the mayela court found persuasive,and it likewise rebuts any fear of political persecution on the part of petitioner.
the majority does not rely upon petitioner arguments,but instead crafts a new theory of the theory not relied upon by to why the evidence cited by the bia was insufficient to demonstrate that changed country conditions rebutted the presumption that petitioner had a fear of persecution.in the majority view,the case must be remanded because the bia failed to specifically consider the letters sent to petitioner from persons living in the republic of congo.according to the majority,the letters specifically inform that violence continues notwithstanding the country reports generalized description,and that petitioner is a wanted man in the government eyes.majority op.at.the majority therefore concludes that a remand is necessary so that the letters can be carefully weighed against the country reports in order for a proper decision to be made.majority op.at.
there are several problems with the majority theory.the first problem is that the majority simply assumes that the bia failed to consider the letters.the majority most likely makes this assumption because the bia opinion does not specifically mention the letters of course,the majority does not and can not point to any legal requirement that the bia explicitly consider and reject on the record every piece of evidence adverse to its conclusion.moreover,petitioner did not mention the letters in his closing argument before the ij,and he makes only passing reference to them in his brief before this court while the record on appeal does not contain petitioner brief to the bia,his failure to highlight the letters throughout the course of these proceedings strongly suggests that petitioner did not argue before the bia that the letters were his key evidence.in light of these facts,the bia failure to analyze their significance on the record is wholly unremarkable.
the second problem with the majority theory is that,as evidence,the letters are not terribly persuasive.between the two letters,the only statement which arguably supports an individualized fear on the part of petitioner on account of his political beliefs is alain statement that sassou group is still looking for you your name is on the wanted list at the ministry of the interior,i saw it with my own eyes.at.this statement is devoid of any corroborating detail,how it is that alain saw the wanted list,or what the people on the wanted list are wanted for,it was written several months after removal proceedings were initiated against petitioner,and it does not state that petitioner was wanted for his political beliefs.moreover,alain statement is undercut by the state department report unrebutted assertion that t here were no reports of politically motivated disappearances in the previous year.while these statements are not logically inconsistent,if political supporters such as petitioner were in fact on a wanted list,it would be reasonable to expect that some politically motivated disappearances would have occurred and would have been reported.the fact that such disappearances reportedly have not occurred undermines petitioner evidence.in short,even reading the letters for all they are worth,the record at most contains evidence that points in opposite directions.w e may not reverse the board simply because we disagree with its understanding of the facts.hana gonzales,cir citing koliada ins,cir.petitioner challenge to the bia factual finding of changed country conditions is particularly unpersuasive because the letters conflict with a state department report,which is generally the best source of information on conditions in a foreign nation.sterkaj gonzales,cir quoting mullai ashcroft,cir holding that the
