edgar leal leal petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia dismissal of his appeal of a final order of removal.the bia held that leal had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude cimt and was thus ineligible for cancellation of removal.we hold that the bia reasonably determined that felony endangerment in arizona is a cimt and thus deny the petition for review.
background 
leal is a native and citizen of mexico,born in culiacan,mexico,on october,who entered the united states on january,without being admitted or paroled.leal has four citizen children,and his and parents are lawful permanent residents of the united states who reside in arizona.
on march,leal pled guilty to,and was subsequently convicted of,felony endangerment under arizona revised statute and misdemeanor driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor dui under arizona revised statute a.the department of homeland security dhs thereafter initiated removal proceedings against leal,charging him with removability as a person who is present in the united states without having been admitted or paroled under a a i.once in removal proceedings,leal admitted he had entered the united states without inspection and conceded removability,but he indicated that he would seek cancellation of removal under b.
prior to a hearing on the merits of his request for cancellation of removal,leal filed a brief on the issue,to which dhs responded by filing a motion to pretermit leal application for cancellation of removal.in june,the immigration judge ij granted dhs motion to pretermit based on leal conviction for felony endangerment in arizona,finding the crime was a cimt that rendered leal ineligible for cancellation of removal.the ij also ordered that leal be removed from the united states to mexico.
leal timely appealed the ij decision to the bia.the bia dismissed leal appeal in a published opinion,holding felony endangerment under arizona revised statute to be a cimt.specifically,the bia relied on the attorney general opinion in matter of silva trevino,attorney,in determining that felony endangerment in arizona requires some form of scienter and reprehensible conduct.the bia rejected leal contention that felony endangerment lacked the requisite scienter based on recklessness in arizona encompassing unawareness of risk due to voluntary intoxication and that the conduct was not sufficiently reprehensible based on the lack of actual harm.following the bia opinion,leal filed his timely petition for review with this court.
ii.standard of review 
while a c precludes judicial review of a final order of removal against a person who is removable for committing a criminal offense,we have jurisdiction to review questions of law.latter singh holder,cir.whether a conviction is for a cimt is a question of law.olivas motta holder,cir.
the determination whether a conviction under a criminal statute is categorically a crime of moral turpitude involves two steps,to which different standards of review apply.castrijon garcia holder,cir internal quotation marks,bracket and citation omitted.first,we determine the elements of the underlying crime,reviewing de novo the bia conclusions.vinh tan nguyen holder,cir.second,we compare the elements of the statute of conviction to the generic definition of a crime of moral turpitude and decide whether the conviction meets that definition.ceron holder,cir en banc internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we defer to the bia conclusion on this second issue following the chevron framework if the decision is published or directly controlled by a published decision.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d.however,if the bia errs at step one in determining the elements of the underlying crime,we owe its cimt analysis at step two no deference.hernandez cruz holder,cir.
iii.discussion 
felony endangerment in arizona 
we turn to the first step of our analysis determining the elements of the statute of conviction.leal was convicted of felony endangerment under arizona revised statute,which provided as follows 
a.a person commits endangerment by recklessly endangering another person with a substantial risk of imminent death or physical injury.
endangerment involving a substantial risk of imminent death is a class felony.in all other cases,it is a class misdemeanor.
based on the clear language of the statute,felony endangerment requires the perpetrator to endanger another person recklessly with a substantial risk of imminent death further,the arizona supreme court has made clear that substantial risk for purposes of felony endangerment requires that the victim be placed in actual substantial risk of imminent death.state carreon,en banc internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
arizona has also statutorily defined the mens rea of recklessness as follows 
recklessly means,with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense,that a person is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result will occur or that the circumstance exists.the risk must be of such nature and degree that disregard of such risk constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation.a person who creates such a risk but who is unaware of such risk solely by reason of voluntary intoxication also acts recklessly with respect to such risk.
c the statute contemplates two possible mental states for establishing a reckless mens rea conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk,which constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct of a reasonable person,or unawareness of such risk solely by reason of voluntary intoxication.state gallegos,en banc explaining the statute expressly provides that voluntary intoxication will not negate a reckless culpable mental state.
accordingly,the elements of felony endangerment in arizona are relatively straightforward the perpetrator must act recklessly so as to put another person in substantial,actual risk of imminent death.while not laid out quite so directly,the bia correctly identified these elements,and we must therefore determine whether its cimt analysis of felony endangerment warrants deference under chevron.
crime involving moral turpitude analysis 
in order to determine whether a crime is categorically a cimt,we must compare the elements of the crime to the generic definition of moral turpitude and decide whether the conduct proscribed in the statute is broader than,and so does not categorically fall within,this generic definition.turijan holder,cir quoting nunez holder,cir.to find that the statute of conviction is broader than the generic definition of a cimt,there must be a realistic possibility that the state would apply its statute to conduct.id.quoting nunez,at.this realistic possibility can be established based on factual evidence of actual convictions,on unpublished and nonprecedential opinions,on statutory language and the logic of published opinions,or some combination thereof.nicanor romero mukasey,cir,overruled on other grounds by marmolejo campos holder,cir en banc.
as our court has repeatedly recognized,the term moral turpitude is perhaps the quintessential example of an ambiguous phrase.turijan,at quoting marmolejo campos,at.thus,where the bia decision is a precedential,published opinion as it is here we must accept the bia interpretation of the ina,so long as it is a permissible construction of the ina.marmolejo campos,at.
in this case,the bia looked to the general definition of a cimt set forth by the attorney general in silva trevino,at.in that case,the attorney general explained that a finding of moral turpitude under the ina requires that a perpetrator have committed a reprehensible act with some form of scienter.id.based on that general definition,the bia held that felony endangerment required both reprehensible conduct and some form of scienter.
while we have described the attorney general attempt to clarify the definition of the term moral turpitude as a welcome effort,marmolejo campos,at,and a clarification of the substantive definition of the term,olivas motta,a
