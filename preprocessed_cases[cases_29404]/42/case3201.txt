at a later hearing on november,dhs argued that almanza arenas conviction disqualified him from cancellation of removal because a conviction under california vehicle code a is for a crime involving moral turpitude.to commit a crime of moral turpitude a person must have behaved in a way that is inherently base,vile,or depraved.castillo cruz holder,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.at the same hearing,dhs also placed into evidence three state court documents a felony complaint charging almanza arenas with a violation of california vehicle code a,a copy of almanza arenas september,plea of nolo contendere pursuant to people west to a misdemeanor violation of california vehicle code a,and a judgment showing that almanza arenas received a sentence of days time served.dhs did not place into evidence the transcript of almanza arenas plea colloquy for this conviction.

ii.analysis 
whether a conviction is for a crime involving moral turpitude is a question of law that we review de novo.olivas motta holder,cir.because almanza arenas filed his application for relief on january,the real id act and our cases that address that act apply.see real id act of,h,stat,codified in scattered sections of provisions of the real id act apply to applications for relief from removal made on or after may.the real id act places the burden on the applicant to show eligibility for cancellation of removal.
almanza arenas state statute of conviction 
california vehicle code a criminalizes the act of driving or taking a vehicle not one own,with intent either to permanently or temporarily deprive the owner thereof of title to or possession of her property.hence,an individual may be convicted under the statute whether he takes a vehicle temporarily or permanently.people allen,cal th,d,cal 
b.the categorical approach 
to determine whether a past conviction qualifies as a generic offense,such as a generic offense described in an immigration statute,courts use the categorical approach they compare the elements of the statute forming the basis of the defendant conviction with the elements of the generic crime.descamps united states,d.the prior conviction qualifies as the generic offense only if the statute elements are the same as,or narrower than,those of the generic offense.id.
here,we compare whether a conviction under california vehicle code a categorically qualifies as the generic offense of a crime involving moral turpitude.this court acknowledged that the bia has held that is a categorical theft offense even though,in some circumstances,it criminalizes taking a vehicle temporarily,as distinct from permanently.duenas alvarez holder,cir citing in re v z s,en banc.but a theft offense is not categorically a crime of moral turpitude if the statute of conviction is broad enough to criminalize a taking with intent to deprive the owner of his property only temporarily.castillo cruz,at.
almanza arenas statute of conviction proscribes both conduct that does not amount to a crime of moral turpitude temporary taking and conduct that would constitute a crime of moral turpitude permanent taking.the elements of his statute of conviction are neither the same as,or narrower than,those of the generic offense.descamps.at.thus,his conviction under california vehicle code a is not categorically a crime of moral turpitude.
in descamps,the court analyzed california penal code,which provides that a person who enters certain locations with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.id.at.at issue was whether a conviction under california penal code qualified as a generic burglary and so as a violent felony under the armed career criminal act,e.generic burglary required that an entry be unlawful,but did not.descamps.at.the court found that a conviction under did not qualify as a generic burglary because california,to get a conviction,need not prove an essential element of the generic offense unlawful entry.id.at.
california vehicle code a is,in significant ways,analogous to california penal code.to secure a conviction under california vehicle code a,the state need not prove that a defendant permanently took a vehicle.yet only a permanent taking is a crime of moral turpitude.see castillo cruz,at.in t
