petitioner zlata petitions this court for review of two board of immigration appeals bia decisions that a affirmed the immigration judge ij denial of petitioner motion for continuance,b vacated the ij denial of petitioner motion to reopen,and c denied petitioner direct motion to reopen.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the decisions of the bia and deny the petitions for review.
background 
petitioner zlata is a serbian citizen.on september,she entered the united states pursuant to a nonimmigrant visa with permission to remain until march.
on july,married a united states citizen.on october,her husband filed a form petition for alien relative on her behalf.on or about december,filed a form application to register permanent residence or adjust status.on may,the department of homeland security dhs requested that husband submit an amended marriage certificate to reflect the correct number of marriages,two rather than one.when husband failed to respond,dhs denied the petition on october,that same day,dhs issued a notice to appear that charged with having overstayed her visa and being subject to removal.in november,she filed a motion to reopen the petition with dhs.
appeared and admitted the charges in a july,immigration court hearing wherein she requested adjustment of status and voluntary departure.she also requested a continuance to allow dhs to act on the motion to reopen that she filed.the ij denied her request for a continuance,but nonetheless scheduled a future hearing for to submit all of her applications for relief.
at the january,hearing,the ij denied both renewed request for a continuance and an adjustment of status,but granted her days in which to voluntarily depart.she filed an appeal of the ij denial of her motion for continuance with the bia.she also filed a motion to reopen with the ij.on february,the ij denied her motion to reopen.appealed that decision to the bia.on march,the bia denied appeal of the ij denial of her motion for continuance and vacated the ij denial of her motion to reopen for lack of jurisdiction.she petitioned this court for review of the bia decision.on or about june,filed a second motion to reopen,this one directly to the bia.the bia subsequently denied her motion to reopen on july.she petitioned this court for review of the bia denial of her motion to reopen.we subsequently consolidated the two appeals.
ii.analysis 
motion for continuance.
we review the bia affirmance of the ij denial of petitioner motion for continuance under an standard.gonzales,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs if the denial was made without a rational explanation,inexplicably departed from established policies,or rested on an impermissible basis such as invidious discrimination.id.citing balani ins,cir.because the bia did not summarily affirm or adopt the ij reasoning and provided an explanation for its decision,we review the bia decision as the final agency determination.see nikis ashcroft,cir see also denko ins,cir.
an ij may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.emphasis added.here,the bia reason for its affirmance of the ij denial of the continuance motion was that i t is not good cause to request a continuance to await the results of a collateral event,such as the filing of a motion to reopen visa petition proceedings,which may or may not result in an outcome favorable to the respondent at some uncertain,indefinite date in the future.at.the bia noted that original petition was denied in october for failure to provide evidence and a motion to reopen filed with dhs in november had been pending without apparent action,for over months.at.
in el harake gonzales,el harake requested a continuance from the ij to allow time for the dhs to adjudicate his separate petition,cir.the court found that the ij denial of the motion for continuance was not irrational because el harake presented no evidence to show that the petition would be successful id.at.
in so holding,the el harake court distinguished two recent seventh circuit cases that held an ij denial of a continuance was an abuse of discretion.id.the el harake court stated 
it can not be the case that anytime an alien files an petition or has an petition filed on his behalf,the ij is required to grant a continuance.such a view would conflict with the discretion that the regulations explicitly provide to the ij.see the immigration judge may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown.emphasis added.
in subhan ashcroft,an alien requested a continuance from the ij so that he could obtain labor certificates that would have permitted him to remain in the united states,cir.the seventh circuit held that the ij denial of the continuance was an abuse of discretion because the ij statement that petitioner may be able to eventually acquire lawful permanent resident status by virtue of his employment,but he was not eligible for this form of relief at this time was not a reason for denying the motion,but merely a statement of the obvious that the labor departments had yet acted.id.the seventh circuit again held that an ij denial of a continuance to await adjudication of and petitions was an abuse of discretion when the ij decision was based on the failure of the alien attorney to submit a copy of the to the ij and the had been otherwise filed.benslimane gonzales,cir.
the el harake court explained w hereas in subhan,the ij gave no reason for denying the continuance,and in benslimane,the ij gave an arbitrary reason,here,the ij gave a rational reason el harake did not provide any evidence that suggested that he had any likelihood of success in adjudicating his petition.el harake.at.
this case is analogous to el harake.here,the administrative record contained the following reasons for denying the motion 
in the absence of evidence,establishing the assertions,the failure to timely file a motion for continuance and,given the fact that the respondent has already been granted seven months in this matter as a continuance during which time she could have submitted the appropriate documentation,that the respondent has failed to act in a timely manner to request the continuance and that there is nothing of record to establish that the respondent merits the exercise of this court discretion nor is there anything of record to establish a basis for the continuance.
at.unlike the dissent,we find no evidence in the record to suggest that filed new documentary evidence to support her request for a continuance.for example,she did not submit the motion to reopen the petition she claimed she filed with dhs nor did she submit a copy of the second petition she claimed her husband filed on the same day as the ij decision.in fact,the only evidence in the administrative record,at the time of the hearing,was that was not eligible for any relief,no application for relief was pending,the filed on her behalf had been denied,and her also had been denied.
the present case is also distinguishable from a recent decision by this court that found an ij denial of a continuance was an abuse of discretion.see badwan gonzales,cir.first,badwan motion for a continuance was unopposed by the government while motion was opposed.see cordova gonzales,wl,at cir.august,unpublished finding badwan distinguishable and holding that the bia affirmance of ij denial of a continuance was not an abuse of discretion.second,badwan was requesting his first continuance had considerable time to gather the relevant evidence see id.third,the ij had little reason to believe badwan would not be able to obtain an adjustment of status whereas the ij in case knew that she had already been denied once and she provided no evidence that an application was even pending let alone likely to be approved despite the passage of a considerable amount of time between dhs request for evidence,the subsequent denial,the first hearing,and the second hearing see id.
under the circumstances here,it was not an abuse of discretion for the bia to affirm the ij denial of petitioner motion for continuance 
motion to reopen with ij.
we review de novo the bia decisions on questions of law.see denko,at see also patel ashcroft,cir.an immigration judge may upon his or he
