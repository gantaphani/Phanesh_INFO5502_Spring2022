facts and procedural history 
background 
caushi is a young man who is a native and citizen of albania.he arrived in this country on september,and admitted to an immigration inspector that he was using a fake passport.in october the immigration and naturalization service ins served him with a notice to appear for removal proceedings.caushi conceded removability on the basis of not having a valid entry document but applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat.
in his asylum application,caushi asserted that he had been a member of the youth movement of the democratic party of albania dp,a political party that opposed the governing communist,and later socialist,parties.he alleged that he had been persecuted in albania because of his political beliefs.specifically,he contended that he and his,dritan azune,were arrested in may at a dp rally,and although caushi was released after a few hours,azune was detained for three days.shortly after azune was released from police custody,he was shot to death by unknown assailants in front of the police station.caushi also alleged that on september,he was severely beaten by police officers at a demonstration in tirana,albania capital,while protesting the assassination of a dp leader,during which he broke a tooth and sustained other injuries.caushi stated that he went into hiding after this incident.he further stated that the police came to his family house looking for him and pointed a gun at his father when they learned he was not there.caushi also stated that he feared being tortured or killed in albania on account of his political activities.
proceedings before the immigration judge 
caushi appeared before an ij in april.he testified that he was released from police custody in may because the police could not verify that he was a member of the dp,but that they knew his was a dp member.with respect to the incident in september,caushi testified that police started shooting at demonstrators with machine guns and then beat him with a rubber club.he stated he suffered numerous injuries as a result of this beating,including a dislocated disc in his spine and several lacerations on his body and arms that required stitches.caushi went into hiding in the northern town of bajram curri after police officers came to his parents house,pointed a gun at his father,hit his father on the head with a gun,and threatened to kill the family if they did not say where caushi was.he further stated that,although his albanian passport contains two visas indicating travel to macedonia and bulgaria during the time he was allegedly in bajram curri,those visas are fraudulent and were obtained by his father to show the police that i had left the country and come back.
caushi next called his sister,loreta caushi,to testify.loreta,who also had an asylum application pending before the immigration court,testified that caushi and their father were members of the dp,and that she was familiar with the entire story of why her brother left albania,beginning with his arrest in may.loreta stated that their was murdered a few days after caushi was released from custody.to her knowledge,caushi fled to bajram curri after the may incident and attended a dp rally in tirana in july.she also testified that t he police came several times at our home to look for my brother,and on one occasion they put the machine gun on top of my father head.she stated that the police said that,if they did not find caushi,they would kill the family like they killed her.regarding the september rally,loreta asserted that she was at the rally with her brother but did not see him beaten by police.she did state,however,that someone from the dp came to their house and told them that her brother was hurt,that he had cuts in his body and his hand,and he had broken a tooth.she testified that the next time she saw her brother was when she came to the united states.
caushi also submitted a hospital report from albania that indicated he had been treated for contusions on the day of the september demonstration and an affidavit from josephine kerr,a licensed pediatrician and volunteer for doctors of the world,who stated that she examined caushi and noted several scars on his chest,elbow,knees,and shoulder,as well as tenderness in his back.she also noted that caushi became tearful and agitated when describing the beatings he allegedly suffered at the hands of the albanian police.in addition to clinical observations of caushi condition,kerr report contained a lengthy account of his past history,apparently based solely on his statements,and concluded with an assessment that caushi has a real and valid fear of danger to himself if he returns to albania under the present government rule.caushi also submitted photographs showing numerous scars on his arms and chest.
upon the close of evidence,the ij proceeded to question caushi regarding the contents of two news articles the ij obtained from the internet.the from cnn and another from the the violence surrounding the september,demonstration of which caushi was a part,including a riot by the protesters and counterattacks by the albanian police and military.the ij read portions of these articles to caushi and asked him if they adequately reflected the events of that day,and caushi responded yes.the ij did not,however,place the articles in the record.
on april,the ij decided orally that caushi was not eligible for asylum,withholding of removal,or relief under the cat.the ij found that,while caushi belonged to the dp youth movement,he was not a member and held no leadership position.the ij believed caushi testimony that he was arrested and briefly detained following the dp demonstration in may,and that he was injured during the extremely violent dp demonstration in september during which,the ij found,both albanian police and demonstrators used force and the government lost control of the capital city of tirana for at least a few days.the ij noted,however,that the hospital report submitted by caushi said nothing about him having suffered cuts.the ij also largely discounted kerr report because,although the doctor appear ed to be well intentioned,her affidavit was mostly a recitation of the respondent claim,and even a plea for the truth of the facts concerning the claim,and her ultimate medical evaluation of the respondent appear ed less credible because of the seven pages of previous statement s by kerr concerning the respondent asylum claim,compared to pages of evaluation of the respondent medical condition.the ij therefore concluded that,although caushi had scars on his chest,elbow,and knees,kerr was in no position to explain where they came from.the ij also faulted kerr for reporting that the demonstration occurred on september,when in fact it occurred on september.
as for loreta caushi testimony,the ij found her not at all credible.the ij commented that she appeared to have a selective memory because when she thought the answers to certain questions would be helpful,she gave specific answers,and other times,she did not answer questions accurately.the ij did not give any examples in support of this conclusion.the ij further found that caushi testimony that he had gone into hiding in bajram curri was not credible because his albanian passport indicated trips to macedonia and bulgaria during that time,and although caushi testified that his father falsely placed the visa stamps in his passport,he did not provide any indication why his father would have done so.finally,the ij found that caushi father,who had been a member of the democratic party for many years,remained in albania and there was no evidence that he suffered persecution as a result.the ij concluded that the isolated incidents of violence caushi suffered did not amount to past persecution,and there was no indication that he would be persecuted if he returned to albania.the ij therefore denied his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat.
proceedings before the bia 
caushi appealed to the bia.he contended that the ij ignored the evidence that his and fellow dp member,dritan azune,was murdered,and that t he present country conditions in albania are dangerous and unstable because the socialist party remained in power.caushi also asserted that substantial evidence did not support the ij conclusion that his testimony regarding his injuries was exaggerated,and that the ij erred in concluding that the beatings he sustained at the hands of police were simply a result of aggressive policing in a riot situation and not persecution.caushi also faulted the ij for relying on news reports from the internet that were not part of the record.
while his appeal was pending before the bia,caushi filed a motion to reopen seeking a remand to the ij in light of newly uncovered wit,that his sister loreta had been granted asylum in a separate proceeding after his application was denied.caushi contended that loreta success in obtaining asylum undercut the ij determination that loreta testimony in his case was not credible.
the bia denied petitioner motion to reopen on november,and affirmed the ij decision.the bia concluded that caushi had not provided any evidence regarding the basis on which loreta was granted asylum,and therefore there was no evidence that the facts in her claim were similar to his.the bia also held that the ij underlying determination that caushi had failed to establish evidence of persecution was supported by the record,stating that the detention and mistreatment of caushi in the course of civil disturbances in does not constitute past persecution on account of political opinion.caushi petitioned our court for review of the bia decision.
while his petition for review was pending,caushi filed another motion to reopen with the bia.he contended that,although there was no transcript of the ij decision in loreta case,her asylum application revealed that her claims stem directly from my activities.caushi indicated that his sister had been raped by the police who came to their home looking for him,an incident loreta had not revealed prior to his hearing because she was ashamed and suffered from stress disorder.caushi contended that loreta was granted asylum due to her being beaten and raped because the authorities were unable to locate me at their home.had i been home,she would most likely have been left alone and i would have been harmed or killed.caushi thus argued that the rape and stress disorder,coupled with the fact that another ij found loreta credible,constituted newly available evidence that significantly undercut the ij conclusion in his case that loreta had a selective memory and therefore was not credible.
on june,the bia denied as well this motion to reopen.it stated that loreta asylum application gave no indication of the actual reasons why she was granted asylum.in the absence of the ij oral decision or any other objective evidence regarding the specifics of the basis of the immigration judge grant of his sister asylum claim,the bia concluded that it was unable to determine whether there is a sufficient nexus between the facts in caushi case and the facts upon which the immigration judge granted his sister asylum.moreover,the bia determined that the evidence of loreta rape and stress disorder was available to caushi at the time of his hearing because loreta had been seeing a psychotherapist for nearly four months and had disclosed the relevant information to her doctor.it therefore concluded that loreta could have raised the alleged fact that she was raped,ashamed of her rape,and suffered from stress disorder either before the immigration judge in her brother case or in his notice of appeal to the bia.caushi petitioned our court for review of the bia denial of this motion to reopen.we consolidated caushi petitions pursuant to b.
petitions for review 
caushi petitions for review allege error on five grounds.his first petition alleges that the bia erred in finding that substantial evidence supported the ij determination that he had not been persecuted or had a fear of persecution,and that the bia erred in not remanding his case to the ij in light of his sister subsequent success in gaining asylum.his second petition which largely subsumes the second claim of error in his first petition contends that the bia conclusion that he did not prove that loreta asylum claim was factually related to his own was error that the bia further erred in holding that the evidence of loreta rape was available to caushi prior to his hearing and that,in any event,the grant of asylum to loreta and her stress disorder are newly available evidence that contradict the ij conclusion that she was not credible.for the reasons stated below,we grant the first petition and deny the second 
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over caushi petitions under,which grants federal courts of appeals jurisdiction to review final orders of the bia.we review the bia affirmance of an ij factual findings,including its determination of whether an alien was subject to persecution or has a fear of persecution,under a substantial evidence standard.see,shardar ashcroft,cir.the bia affirmance of the ij credibility determinations is also reviewed under this standard.see cao att y,cir the credibility determination,like all ij factual findings,is subject to substantial evidence review.in conducting this analysis we consider the record as a whole and shall reverse only if a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.shardar,at quoting b b.we review the bia denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion,lu ashcroft,cir,and review its underlying factual conclusions related to the motion for substantial evidence.sevoian ashcroft,cir.the bia denial of a motion to reopen may only be reversed if it is arbitrary,irrational,or contrary to law.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
iii.first petition for review 
we begin with caushi first petition for review in deciding an alien asylum application,an ij must consider the complete record,analyzing the evidence both pro and con.see gao ashcroft,cir.although our review of an ij credibility determinations is deferential,that deference is expressly conditioned on support in the record,and d eference is not due where findings and conclusions are based on inferences or presumptions that are not reasonably grounded in the record.dia ashcroft,cir en banc citation and internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.an ij must support his factual determinations with specific,cogent reasons such that his conclusions flow in a reasoned way from the evidence of record and are not arbitrary and conjectural in nature.id.at.failure to do so does not pass muster under the substantial evidence rubric.id.at citing mulanga ashcroft,cir.
ij factual conclusions related to persecution 
we have several problems with the ij factual conclusions in this case.first,he found that the adverse treatment caushi claimed to have suffered did not amount to past persecution and did not create a fear of future persecution.in reaching this conclusion,the ij did not even mention the testimony that caushi,with whom caushi was arrested at a dp rally in may,was shot to death in front of the police station minutes after being released from custody,and the further testimony of caushi and his sister that police officers essentially claimed responsibility for the murder when they raided the caushis house looking for him.the ij also believed that caushi had been beaten at the september demonstration,but rejected his testimony that he was also slashed because,despite the fact that caushi arms and torso are covered with scars,the report from the hospital in albania where he was taken following the beating did not mention any cuts.the ij did not address caushi explanation for this omission,that medical documents in albania are not very clear in what they state or his testimony that,in any event,his cuts were treated by a private doctor at his sister home and not at the hospital.see,ins,cir requiring the bia to consider an alien explanations for any perceived inconsistencies in his testimony before deciding upon the alien credibility.the ij also did not address the fact that kerr noted that caushi had several well healed scars on his body and prosthetic front teeth,even though both observations are consistent with caushi description of his injuries 
we are also puzzled by the ij finding that caushi did nothing that would bring himself to the attention of the authorities.the ij supported this conclusion by noting that caushi was a member of the youth branch of the democratic party,and was not a member.the ij finding is at odds with his determination that caushi father was an active member of the dp and that caushi was arrested in may because of his affiliation with that party.moreover,the conclusion is belied by the fact unmentioned by the ij that caushi was a dp member who was murdered immediately after he was released from police custody,and the unrebutted testimony of caushi and his sister that the police came to their house looking for him and assaulted his family shortly after his participation in the september demonstration at which he was beaten.in short,the ij conclusion that caushi was somehow unknown to the police despite the fact his family was well known and caushi himself had been arrested is unsupported by the record.
we believe these omissions from the ij factual discussion are significant because the omitted evidence tends to establish past persecution.we have defined persecution as threats to life,confinement,torture,and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom.see li att y,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the conduct caushi murder of his,the beating and alleged slashing at the hands of police,the threats against his family,and the violence,intimidation,and assassinations directed at the to establish a threat to life and freedom.the ij failure to give specific,cogent reasons for rejecting these allegations in light of all of the record evidence falls significantly short of the requirement that his factual findings be supported by substantial evidence.
ij determination that loreta caushi was not credible 
next,we consider the ij determination that caushi sister loreta was not at all credible when she testified in support of her brother allegations of persecution.the ij entire analysis of her testimony is as follows i did not find her testimony at all credible.i thought that she had a selective memory.when she thought the answers to certain questions would be helpful,she gave specific answers,and other times,she did not answer questions accurately.the ij did not point to any specific instances in which loreta gave inaccurate or selective testimony indeed,he did not provide any explanation of how he arrived at this conclusion.as we stated above,it is well established that an ij must support his credibility determinations with record evidence and provide specific,cogent reasons for his conclusions sufficient to demonstrate that they are not arbitrary and conjectural in nature.dia,at.by not citing a single instance in which loreta testimony was inaccurate or selective,the ij did not satisfy this standard.
moreover,our review of loreta testimony reveals very few instances in which her statements were demonstrably inaccurate,vague,or nonresponsive.for the most part,her testimony was clear and consistent,and corroborated her brother account.we note only three instances where the judge expressed dissatisfaction with loreta responsiveness 
ij,regarding the may demonstration did you see robert and your being arrested 
ij when robert was released,he told you he had been arrested caushi,i sorry,i just want you to answer the questions as directly as possible.when robert was released,did he tell you he had been arrested 
loreta yes.
ij how long did he tell you he had been detained 
loreta he told me he was detained for like three hours.
loreta,regarding another demonstration in july i remember that on the of july,my brother participated i n a rally of the democratic party,and there was an assassination from the socialist party that day.
ij what year 
loreta.about bullets were shot,and azem hajdari a dp leader was there,and the police shot over the people.
ij what was,what was the date again 
loreta it was of july.
ij july,caushi,you have to try to just answer the question as directly as possible.the incident you talking about occurred on july,yes or no 
loreta yes.
ij was your brother hurt on july,or arrested,your brother,robert 
loreta no,nothing happened.
ij,regarding the police search for caushi at his family house did the police say why they wanted to talk to your brother,robert yes or no.
loreta yes.
ij what did they say why did they say they wanted to talk to robert 
loreta because the police in albania,they knew that my brother was a member of the youth forum for the democratic party,and he support ed azem hajdari in the democratic party,so they tried the best they could to stop this,this wave of new democrats.
ij is that what the police said is that what they said when they came to your house several times 
loreta no,they did say that,but they said to my father that we want your son.
ij did they say,did they to my words.did they say why they wanted to talk to your brother 
loreta they never would tell us the reason why they wanted to talk to my brother,but i remember them telling to my father in front of me and my mother that if you do tell us where your son is,then we will find him and we will kill him the same way we killed your.
with respect to the exchanges related to the may and july demonstrations,we are perplexed by the ij apparent displeasure with loreta responses because the transcript reveals that loreta directly answered all of the ij questions.as for the exchange regarding the police officers search for caushi,we agree that loreta did not directly answer the ij question,why did the police say they wanted to talk to robert,but rather gave her view of why the police were interested in her brother.when the ij repeated his question,however,loreta directly answered it and stated that the police never said why they were looking for her brother.especially since loreta was testifying via an interpreter,and therefore it is unsurprising that some questions may have been misunderstood and repetitions may have been necessary,we do not believe loreta failure to answer directly the ij question on the first try is sufficient for a reasonable adjudicator to conclude that she was not credible.
the government places particular reliance on another exchange that occurred during as evidence that loreta testimony was evasive and inaccurate 
government do,do you have an albanian passport 
loreta yes.that the one i traveled with.
government okay.when did you get it 
loreta it my passport.
government when did you get it 
loreta my,my father obtained the passport for me and some,some relatives of my sister managed to get the visa.
government one more time.when did you get the passport 
loreta the date i came here,in the morning,was the day that i obtained the passport.
government how did you get it 
loreta on june,june.
government,to the ij i do know how to ask these questions any more simply.
ij,to loreta did you get the albanian passport while you were here in the united states 
loreta in albania.
ij do you remember the date that you got your albanian passport,what year 
loreta i do remember.i sorry,i do remember.
ij you do remember 
loreta it a passport.it a passport.i do know when it expires.
ij i asking you when it was issued,what year it was issued to you,what year was the passport issued to you 
loreta it difficult to
