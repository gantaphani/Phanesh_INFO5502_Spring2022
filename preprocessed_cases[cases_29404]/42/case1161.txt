some two years after his deportation hearing,petitioner stanislav iavorski discovered that his attorney had not appealed the immigration judge ij denial of his applications for political asylum and withholding of deportation as that attorney allegedly had promised to do.iavorski now attempts to reopen his deportation proceedings after missing the deadlines both to file his appeal and,later,to reopen his proceedings.this case presents the issue of whether the filing deadline for motions to reopen deportation proceedings may be equitably tolled when ineffective assistance of counsel has both violated an alien constitutional right to due process of law by eliminating the right to appeal,and has caused the alien to miss the filing deadline for a motion to reopen that normally could serve as the vehicle to cure that due process violation 
because there is no evidence that congress intended to enact a jurisdictional bar to untimely motions to reopen,we hold that the filing deadline for motions to reopen may be equitably tolled.although equitable tolling is available,iavorski failure to exhibit due diligence in pursuing his claim precludes the equitable tolling of the filing deadline in this case as a matter of law.we,therefore,affirm the bia denial of iavorski motions to reopen.
background 
iavorski is a russian citizen who entered the united states on march,on a tourist visa.he failed to leave when his visa expired six months later and instead applied to the immigration and naturalization service ins for political asylum and withholding of deportation.the ins placed him in deportation proceedings for having overstayed his tourist visa.at his deportation hearing on march,the ij denied his applications for political asylum and withholding of deportation,but granted him the privilege of voluntary departure,allowing him one year to leave the united states voluntarily in lieu of actual deportation.iavorski was given notice that if he remained in the united states beyond one year for reasons other than because of exceptional circumstances beyond his control,he would become ineligible for certain forms of relief including his adjustment of status to that of a permanent resident.
at the conclusion of his deportation hearing,iavorski attorney reserved the right to appeal,and the ij ordered that a written notice of appeal be filed by march.although iavorski claims that his attorney promised to file his appeal,the attorney failed to do so.iavorski did not leave the united states within a year,rendering him deportable,even though the ins apparently never actually attempted to deport him.
iavorski later applied for the annual diversity visa program and,on april,the department of state notified him that he had been selected at random to begin the process of becoming a permanent resident.soon thereafter,on june,the ins received a freedom of information act request from iavorski seeking information on the status of his deportation case.the ins informed him that no appeal had ever been filed.on july,iavorski,having retained a new attorney,moved the ij to reopen his case,stating that his prior counsel had i nform ed him that the notice of appeal has been filed,and that his case was proceeding properly.
on september,the ij denied iavorski motion to reopen,finding,inter alia,that the motion was filed well beyond the day deadline established under b,and that any reopening would be fruitless since iavorski was barred from adjustment to permanent resident status because he had not voluntarily left the united states as he had promised.
iavorski appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia from the ij denial of his motion to reopen.with his appeal,he submitted an affidavit recounting that,after his deportation hearing,his former attorney had 
informed me that he will appeal the decision and it will cost me.i agreed and had called him on and left a massage sic,asking him to call me back and arrange a meeting.after,i had tried to call him again but his office had moved.i tried to get in contact with him but was not successful.throughout this time,i was sure that he had filed an appeal in my case.
while the bia was still considering iavorski appeal from the denial of his motion to reopen,iavorski married a united states citizen.his wife petitioned the ins to grant iavorski permanent resident status and the ins approved the first stage of the petition.iavorski now faced the same problem with his wife petition for his residency as he did with his visa lottery approval he was barred from adjusting his status to that of a permanent resident because the ij still had jurisdiction over his case,had found him deportable,and would not reopen his deportation proceedings.at this point,iavorski new attorney sent a second motion directly to the bia asking that it reconsider iavorski case.the bia took this motion to be a request to reopen and remand the case to the ij.
in dismissing iavorski appeal and denying his motions as untimely,the bia rejected his contention that his proceedings should be reopened based upon his assertion that he was the victim of ineffective assistance of counsel.the bia explained that the only exception to the filing deadline for motions to reopen exists for motions to apply or reapply for asylum or withholding of deportation based on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or to which deportation has been ordered.see b i.because this exception was inapplicable in iavorski case,the bia dismissed the appeal.the bia likewise found iavorski second motion to be.see b i.iavorski now petitions this court to review the bia decision

we review the bia conclusions of law de novo.see mardones mcelroy,cir.when the bia has applied the correct law,its decision to deny a motion to reopen deportation proceedings is reviewed to determine whether the decision was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law.ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
ineffective assistance of counsel in immigration proceedings 
in a deportation hearing,the liberty of an individual is at stake even though it is not technically a criminal proceeding.see bridges wixon.for this reason,i t is well established that the fifth amendment entitles aliens to due process of law in deportation proceedings.reno flores,d citing the japanese immigrant case.
during deportation proceedings,aliens have a statutory right to be represented by counsel at their own expense.this right is an integral part of the procedural due process to which the alien is entitled.batanic ins,th cir internal quotation marks omitted.ineffective assistance of counsel in moving to reopen or reconsider a deportation case occurs when counsel performance impinged upon the fundamental fairness of the hearing in violation of the fifth amendment due process clause.rabiu ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.such a deprivation of fundamental fairness is established when competent counsel would have acted otherwise,and the alien was prejudiced by counsel performance.rabiu,at quoting esposito ins,cir per curiam 
if these conditions are met,the vehicle commonly used to redress claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in deportation proceedings has been an administrative motion to reopen proceedings.see,rabiu,motion to reopen to permit filing of waiver of deportability based on claim of ineffective assistance of counsel esposito,motion to reopen to permit filing of appeal based on claim of ineffective assistance of counsel ins,th cir motion to reopen to permit filing of applications for asylum and withholding of deportation based on claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.claims of ineffective assistance of counsel satisfy the general requirement that motions to reopen present new facts that are material and were not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.b.
in,congress amended the immigration and nationality act ina to provide that the attorney general issue regulations establishing,for the first time,a filing deadline for motions to reopen.in,the department of justice issued these regulations which imposed a day filing deadline and limited an alien to only one such motion.see,b.the question presented is whether equitable tolling applies to this limitations period and,if it does,whether iavorski claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is sufficient to justify tolling the filing deadline in his case.
c.the applicability of equitable tolling to the limitations on motions to reopen 
a statute of limitations may be tolled as necessary to avoid inequitable circumstances.see bowers transportacion maritima mexicana,cir.equitable tolling applies as a matter of fairness where a party has been prevented in some extraordinary way from exercising his rights.johnson nyack,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
not all time limitations are subject to equitable tolling.if congress enacts a jurisdictional bar to untimely claims,equitable tolling will not apply.see zipes trans world airlines,indep.fed of flight attendants,d.if the time limit is contained in an ordinary statute of limitations,however,it is assumed that it is subject to equitable tolling.see irwin department of veterans affairs,d.the basic question to be answered in determining whether a statute of limitations is to be tolled,is one of legislative intent.burnett new york cent,d internal quotation marks omitted.
because congress ordinarily does not explicitly state whether a limitations period is jurisdictional,the nature of a limitations period is a matter of statutory construction.see united states brockamp,d.this inquiry begins by asking,is there good reason to believe that congress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to apply id.at.here,as in other situations,the silence of congress may express a clear legislative intent.landgraf usi film products,d noting the traditional presumption that statutes will not be held to have retroactive effect absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.
in brockamp,for example,the supreme court found that a tax statute setting forth a limitation in unusually emphatic form,expressly stating that actions shall be considered erroneous,did not permit equitable tolling.id.at.the court noted that the statute detail,its technical language,the iteration of the limitations in both procedural and substantive forms,and the explicit listing of exceptions,taken together,indicate that congress did not intend courts to read other unmentioned,equitable exceptions into the statute that it wrote.id.at.see also united states robinson,d finding former federal rules of criminal procedure governing appeals were mandatory and jurisdictional when,in addition to imposing time limits,the rules stated that the court may not enlarge the period for taking an appeal internal quotation marks omitted.
thus,to determine whether the limitations imposed on motions to reopen in deportation proceedings are jurisdictional and therefore not subject to equitable tolling,we examine the text,structure,legislative history,and purpose of congress amendment to the ina there we find no indication,either explicit or implicit,that congress intended that this limitations period not be equitably tolled.our conclusion is supported by the department of justice own interpretation of its rule making mandate from congress,and the bia view of the rules that were promulgated.in the only other case to rule on this issue,the ninth circuit arrived at the same result.varela ins,th cir permitting tolling of filing deadline for motions to reopen after legal assistant incorrectly assured alien he did not have to leave the united states before voluntary departure deadline 
the availability of motions to reopen under prior law 
before the promulgation of the regulations,an alien in deportation proceedings could submit an unlimited number of motions to reopen or reconsider at any time after a decision by an ij or the bia.see.in practice,this generous policy permitted an alien who had clearly disobeyed a deportation or voluntary departure order of the immigration court thereafter to remain in the united states illegally,and later to reopen proceedings to take advantage of some form of relief for which the alien had not previously been eligible.see,stephen legomsky,immigration law and policy stating that motions to reopen had been viewed by the ins and bia as procedural devices calculated primarily to buy aliens additional time in the united states richard steel,steel on immigration law at noting the prior availability of motions to reopen after the entry of an initial or subsequent order of deportation involv ing a request for relief that was not previously relevant or available.
the amendment to the ina and the regulations 
in,in amending the ina,congress instructed the attorney general to issue regulations with respect to the period of time in which motions to reopen and to reconsider may be offered in deportation proceedings,which regulations shall include a limitation on the number of such motions that may be filed and a maximum time period for the filing of such motions.immigration act of,d,stat.this change appeared to be aimed at eliminating the prior practice under which an alien could ignore a deportation or voluntary departure order,and years later,attempt to reopen the proceedings without any adverse consequences.stone ins,d noting that the immigration act of took steps to reduce the abuses of successive and frivolous administrative appeals and motions.
the legislative history of this provision indicates,however,that while congress sought to impose general limits on motions to reopen,these limits were not intended to be inflexible.in explaining these new limitations,the house conference committee directed that,t he attorney general shall consider exceptions in the interest of justice.conf,at.the committee explicitly mentioned one such exception,for asylum claims which arise due to a change in circumstances in the country of the alien nationality after the initiation of the deportation proceedings.id.
the department of justice responded to this congressional mandate by issuing rules that,while clearly establishing that only one motion to reopen would be permitted and that it must be filed within days,also offered mechanisms whereby otherwise untimely motions could still be considered when the circumstances so required.under the new regulations,the time and numerical limits for motions to reopen do not apply to a motion to reopen agreed upon by the parties,the ins and the alien and jointly filed.b iv.moreover,an ij or the bia are permitted to reopen a proceeding,upon their own motions,at any time.see b an immigration judge may upon his or her own motion at any time reopen any case in which he or she has made a decision a the bia may at any time reopen on its own motion any case in which it has rendered a decision.in explaining the exercise of this authority,the bia has stated that,t he regulations governing motions give the board clear authority to reopen and remand cases without regard to other regulatory provisions it would therefore appear that this board has the ability to reopen or remand proceedings when appropriate,such as for good cause,fairness,or reasons of administrative economy,and that technical deficiencies alone would not preclude such action.in re yewondwosen,interim bia,en banc.
these exceptions to the time and numerical limitations on motions to reopen imposed by the new rule appear to respond precisely to congress desire to provide for certain cases,in the interest of justice,conf,at,that would otherwise be excluded by such limits.the department of justice highlighted the availability of such exceptions by stating,in response to criticism of the unbending nature of the new rule,that 
t he department does not agree with commenters suggestions that a good cause exception would be an appropriate procedural mechanism for addressing exceptional cases that fall beyond this rule time and number limitations.instead,section a of the rule provides a mechanism that allows the board to reopen or reconsider sua sponte and provides the procedural vehicle for the consideration of cases with exceptional circumstances.
this kind of accommodation for exceptional cases is irreconcilab
