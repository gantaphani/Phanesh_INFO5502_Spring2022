in the spring of officers from the cedar rapids police department crpd contacted immigration and customs enforcement ice to report that they had discovered evidence of gang activity in the course of investigating a possible burglary at the cambridge apartment complex complex.several people interviewed during the investigation had what appeared to be gang related tattoos,and the number,a tag associated with mexican gangs,had been carved into one of the walls of the complex.the crpd also reported seeing blood in one of the apartments,which the officers believed to have resulted from a gang initiation rite.
several ice agents began working with the crpd to investigate further.among them was special agent chris cantrell who had worked as an immigration officer for years including five years as a border patrol agent.he was also trained in investigating ethnic gangs and in interviewing undocumented aliens and other foreign nationals.ice agents worked with the landlord of the complex to obtain documents provided by tenants when they first rented their apartments.some of these documents proved to be counterfeit.ice agents also learned that one of the tenants interviewed as part of the burglary investigation had falsely claimed united states citizenship.
ice agents obtained federal search warrants to search various apartments in the complex based on probable cause that tenants there had possessed and used counterfeit immigration and social security documents.agents executed search warrants at three apartments and obtained consent to search two additional apartments.six undocumented aliens from mexico were identified and arrested during these searches.ice agents also found numerous counterfeit social security and immigration documents which did not match the aliens who had been arrested.most of the seized documents appeared to belong to hispanic males in their teens or mid.during the searches agent cantrell interviewed an unidentified man who admitted to calling several of the hispanic residents at the complex to warn them about the presence of immigration officials.
special agents cantrell and eric spaulding returned to the complex on may to search for individuals who matched the fraudulent documents seized the day before.they were also looking for fresh signs of gang activity.when they arrived at the complex they noticed new graffiti in the parking lot which read,sur,fuck you.sur is a gang tag identified with the surenos gang.
the agents spotted,a hispanic male in his early twenties,walking nearby.he was wearing baggy pants,a large cubic zirconium earring,a brown bandana,and a cocked flatbilled cap based on his experience,agent cantrell regarded clothing and accessories as consistent with gang attire.the agents initially left the complex without interviewing him,but they decided to return in light of his attire and the appearance of new gang graffiti at the complex.agents found talking to the same man who the day before had warned residents about the agents presence.when they asked to speak with,he came over immediately.the agents asked him where he was born,and responded that he was born in mexico.agent cantrell then asked if he had any immigration documents.he replied that he did not.at that point the agents took him into custody.
one of the ice agents searched and located his wallet.inside the wallet the agents found what appeared to be a valid social security card bearing the name daniel torres.the final four digits of the number on the card were,and the card was not signed.agent cantrell testified at a suppression hearing that an illegal alien could have a valid social security card if he had been lawfully admitted into the united states and then deported or if he had had some previous immigration encounter.he also testified that the fact that the card was unsigned might indicate that it belonged to a child or that appellant had obtained it as a child and was not aware of his own immigration status.agent cantrell decided to do a further investigation into immigration status.
agent cantrell asked if the social security card belonged to him.cantrell did not give a miranda warning before asking the question,and he testified at the suppression hearing that ice agents generally do not administer such a warning when an illegal alien is being processed administratively rather than criminally.responded that the card belonged to him and was valid.cantrell then asked him whether he was employed.said that he had been working through sedona staffing,an employment agency located several blocks from the complex.he claimed to have been employed under the name daniel torres.the questions cantrell asked were part of a series of questions found on form that ice agents use to process suspected illegal aliens.
before taking to the ice office,the agents drove him to the nearby office of sedona staffing to retrieve additional documents that might help verify his immigration status and indicate how he should be processed.the agents hoped to find a document containing an alien registration number.agent cantrell went into the office first and asked a staff member there whether daniel torres had ever worked for sedona staffing.she could not find any employee under that name or under the social security number ending in which appeared on the card in appellant wallet.cantrell then asked agent spaulding to bring into the office.the staff member immediately recognized him and said that he had last worked for sedona staffing in.she was still unable to locate his employee file using the name daniel torres and the social security number ending in.
the agents then drove to the ice office,asking him more questions on the way about his work at sedona staffing.during this exchange,agent cantrell told that he thought he was not being truthful and that there were penalties for giving false information to federal law enforcement officers.according to cantrell testimony at the suppression hearing,it was at this point that he first thought that might be charged with a crime.
upon arrival at the ice office,the agents placed in the administrative processing area.agent cantrell advised appellant of his miranda rights in spanish and gave him a waiver form containing a spanish version of the miranda warning.signed the waiver form.he then asked cantrell how much time he would serve if he had lied,and cantrell explained that this was a decision for a judge to make.then admitted that he had lied previously about his employment with sedona staffing.he stated that he had been employed using the social security number on the card found in his wallet,but that he had used the name manuel torres rather than daniel torres.
agent cantrell attempted to verify this new information.the employee at sedona staffing was able to locate file under the name manuel torres,but she informed cantrell that the social security number the agency had on file for him ended in.this was not the same number that appeared on the card found in wallet or that he claimed to have used to obtain employment.when confronted with this information,admitted he had purchased a counterfeit social security card and counterfeit resident card in in order to be able to obtain work
