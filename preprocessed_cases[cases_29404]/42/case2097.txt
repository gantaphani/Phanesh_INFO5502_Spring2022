we reheard this case en banc to resolve the narrow question of whether the practice of tolling a period of supervised release for a deported offender is authorized by the sentencing statutes.carlos alberto appealed his sentence arguing,inter alia,that the district court did not have the authority to toll the period of supervised release while he was outside the jurisdiction of the united states as the result of deportation.
a panel of this court,constrained by our earlier opinion in united states isong,cir,cert.denied,d,was obliged to affirm the district court decision to toll the period of supervised release.united states,cir citing salmi sec y of health human,cir a panel of this c ourt can not overrule the decision of another panel.the prior decision remains controlling authority unless an inconsistent decision of the united states supreme court requires modification of the decision or this c ourt sitting en banc overrules the prior decision.
for the reasons set forth in parts and of the panel opinion written by judge gilman attached at appendix a,we conclude that there was no constitutional error with respect to the district court classification of prior felony as violent,and that the district court sentence was procedurally and substantively reasonable,at.however,because we overrule isong,and hold both that tolling is not a condition under d,and that the statutory scheme evidences congress intent that the period of supervised release would not be tolled while the defendant is outside the united states as the result of deportation,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case for resentencing with instructions that the remand be limited to setting forth lawful conditions of supervised release.

on appeal to a panel of this court,challenged the district court authority to toll the period of supervised release while he remained outside the jurisdiction of the united states.while acknowledging that the panel was bound by our earlier precedent in united states isong,cir,urged us to reconsider our previous position via en banc review,at.citing isong,the panel affirmed the district court decision to toll supervised release,and we subsequently vacated the panel opinion and granted en banc review.like the original panel,we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to both and a.
ii.analysis 
we review de novo this pure legal question regarding sentencing.united states graham,cir.an examination of the language and structure of the sentencing statutes leads us to conclude that district courts are not authorized to toll the period of supervised release while the defendant is deported and outside the united states.first,tolling is not a condition of supervised release under d.second,the statutory scheme evidences congress intent that the period of supervised release not be tolled while the defendant is deported and outside the united states.
tolling is not a condition of supervised release under d.
congress has authorized district courts to include supervised release as part of a defendant sentence,even in the case where the statute violated does not mandate a term of supervised release.a.in addition to specific,enumerated conditions that the district court must impose as part of supervised release,d provides that t he court may order,as a further condition of supervised release any other condition it considers to be appropriate,if the condition is reasonably related to the factors set forth in a and a b d involves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth in a b d,and is consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the sentencing commission pursuant to a.d.
because d only authorizes district courts to order conditions of supervised release,the crux of our inquiry is whether tolling is properly understood as a condition of supervised release.if tolling is not a condition,then district courts have no authority to issue tolling orders under d.as all parties agree that d is the only provision under which the district courts may claim the authority to issue such orders,if district courts do not have authority under d,then they have no authority to issue tolling orders.
isong never addressed this question,but rather,the majority in isong implicitly presumed tolling was a condition and then analyzed whether tolling was reasonably related to the a factors.isong,at.the term condition is not defined in the statute itself,but two canons of construction assist us in our endeavor first,the meaning of an undefined term may be deduced from nearby words under noscitur a sociis and second,undefined terms are construed in accordance with their ordinary and natural meanings.limited,comm r,cir.
noscitur a sociis 
most of the enumerated conditions in d refer to mandatory conditions of supervised release.the district court must order the following that the defendant not commit another federal,state,or local crime during the term of supervision that the defendant comply with requests for dna collection when authorized by law that the defendant not unlawfully possess or use a controlled substance and that the defendant submit to drug testing within fifteen days of commencing supervised release and to at least two drug tests thereafter.d.however,the court may ameliorate or suspend this last condition if testing is not available within a radius of the defendant residence.see id.referring to a.
certain mandatory conditions are also required under d when the defendant has committed a particular crime.if the defendant is a offender,the court must order that the defendant attend an program if such a program exists within a radius of the defendant residence.d.if the defendant crime requires compliance with the sex offender registration and notification act,then the court must order,as a condition of supervised release,that the defendant comply with the act requirements.id.
several discretionary conditions are listed under d.district courts may add these conditions to a defendant sentence so long as they are reasonably related to the factors set forth in a and a b d,do not deprive the defendant of any more liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes of a b d,and are consistent with pertinent policy statements.d.most of these enumerated,discretionary conditions are incorporated by reference to the statute governing conditions of probation.b b,and b b.all of these potential conditions involve deeds which the defendant must perform or refrain from performing,such as participating in community service or refraining from associating with specific persons.b,b.in addition,d enumerates two other discretionary conditions.first,if the defendant is an alien and subject to deportation,the court may order,as a condition of supervised release,that he or she be deported and remain outside the united states,and may order that he or she be delivered to a duly authorized immigration official for such deportation.id.second,the court is permitted to order that a defendant who is required to register under the sex offender registration and notification act must submit to multiple types of searches by law enforcement and probation officers.id.
the court must revoke supervised release and sentence the defendant to imprisonment if a defendant violates certain conditions of supervised release which are listed in g.if the defendant violates a condition that is not enumerated in g,the district court still has discretion to revoke supervised release and sentence the defendant to imprisonment.e.therefore,violating any term of supervised release could result in revocation of supervised release and in imprisonment.
definitions of condition and tolling 
condition has several dictionary definitions,one of which is pertinent to our inquiry a circumstance indispensable to some result prerequisite that on which something else is contingent conditions of acceptance.random house webster unabridged dictionary ed.id.turning to the conditions enumerated in d,we believe that congress clearly utilized this or conditions of referring to the conditions of supervised release.the right to supervised release is contingent upon the defendant compliance with the enumerated conditions.if the defendant violates certain conditions,revocation of supervised release is automatic violation of other conditions only triggers the court power to exercise discretion to revoke supervised release.but all of these conditions are contingencies upon which the right to continue on supervised release depends 
w e presume that congress does not employ the same word to convey different meanings within the same statute.united states,cir quoting united states balogun,cir.because we conclude that congress meant that on which something else is contingent when it enumerated conditions in d,we likewise conclude that congress meant that on which something else is contingent when it authorized district courts under d to order any other condition they consider appropriate.
in contrast to the conditions enumerated in d,tolling is not a contingency of supervised release.black law dictionary defines toll as to stop the running of to abate.black law dictionary ed.with respect to the statute,tolling is best understood as relat ing to the timing of the supervised release.united states okoko,cir.we believe that the continuation of supervised release is not contingent on tolling rather,tolling describes the existing state of supervised is,whether or not the period of supervised release is running.
tolling is not a condition in the sense in which the term is used in d,and therefore,courts do not have authority under d to issue special conditions of supervised release which toll the period for which deported aliens are subject to supervised release.because d is the only statute from which district courts could conceivably claim their authority to issue orders tolling the period of supervised release while defendants are outside the united states pursuant to deportation,our holding today means that district courts have no authority to issue such orders 
concerns were raised at oral argument about the impact of this conclusion.if a district court may not toll the period of supervised release,then a term of supervised release continues while the alien is living abroad.the worry is that many conditions of supervised release may be difficult or impossible for the deported defendant to comply with while the defendant is living abroad.if the defendant is unable to comply with these conditions while abroad,the defendant violates the terms of supervised release for something which is outside his or her control.this,of course,offends basic notions of fairness.fortunately,the statute is structured so that such a problem is avoidable.none of the mandatory conditions of supervised release enumerated in d necessarily requires physical presence in the united states.for example,a defendant need not be present in the united states in order to comply with the requirement that he or she refrain from using or possessing controlled substances.of those mandatory conditions which could require presence in the united states,such as participation in drug testing,the district court is required to order participation only if such testing exists within a radius of the defendant residence.d.thus,there is nothing inherent in the mandatory conditions listed in d which would force defendants to violate supervised release simply by virtue of the fact that they live abroad.as to the discretionary conditions of supervised release,we expect that district courts will use common sense in crafting discretionary conditions so that a defendant facing deportation is reasonably able to comply with the conditions while residing outside the united states.
b.the statutory scheme evidences congress intent that the period of supervised release would not be tolled while the defendant was deported and residing outside the united states 
our holding today is also based on the statutory structure.to start,the law is clear that t he term of supervised release commences on the day the person is released from imprisonment e the only instance where congress has explicitly provided for tolling the period of supervised release is when the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a federal,state,or local crime unless the imprisonment is for a period of less than consecutive days.id.
as the isong dissent pointed out,in keeping with the canon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another,the fact that congress explicitly allows for tolling only when a defendant is imprisoned indicates that congress does not intend for district courts to toll the period of supervised release under any other circumstance.isong,at moore,dissenting.see also leatherman tarrant county narcotics intelligence coordination unit,d relying on the canon.
the panel majority in isong recognized this canon and its applicability in the case before it,but determined that because an unserved period of supervised release does not defer deportation,supervised release would be meaningless when the defendant is not within the united states.isong,at.the tolling order,according to the isong panel majority,was an appropriate way to make supervised release meaningful for defendants who are going to be deported and reside outside the united states.id.we infer from the panel majority reasoning that it was attempting to make sense of an idea which,to it,sounded nonsensical the idea that a deportee is on supervised release while outside the jurisdiction of the united states.
language in d,however,evidences that congress was not uncomfortable with such an arrangement.the statute provides that a district court may impose a special condition of supervised release deporting the alien defendant and requiring the defendant to remain outside the united states.id.when a defendant is ordered to leave and remain outside the united states as a condition of his or her supervised release,it stretches reason to conclude that a district court could suspend the term of supervised release during this time.isong,at moore,dissenting.this would create an incoherent situation where time would stand still while various conditions of supervised release continue to operate upon a defendant.id.see also united states,at congress could not have intended to allow a defendant to be excluded from the united states as a condition of supervised release while,at the same time,allow all conditions of supervised release to be suspended for the duration of that exclusion.okoko,at adopting this reasoning.
we recognize that another statute already prohibits a deported alien convicted of a felony from reentering the united states without permission of the attorney general,so that a district court need not include this special condition authorized by d in order to provide that a deported alien must remain outside the united states.see a.but the fact that d makes the special condition of supervised release available to district courts indicates that congress envisioned the period of supervised release to be running during the period for which the deported defendant is outside the jurisdiction of the united states.
because the panel majority in isong rejected the canon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius in order to reconcile a situation which we now conclude was in no need of reconciliation,we return to the question of whether congress explicit reference to tolling in only one instance evidences its intent that this was the sole instance when tolling the period of supervised release is authorized.since the isong decision,every other circuit court examining this question has adopted the reasoning articulated in the isong dissent.okoko,at,at balogun,at.the position decline s to infer that the difference in treatment of the continuity of the term with respect to reincarceration and was simply an oversight.okoko,at quoting balogun,at.upon reconsideration of this point,we join the prevailing position we conclude that if congress had wanted to authorize tolling the period of supervised release while a defendant was outside the jurisdiction of the united states as the result of deportation,it would have expressly indicated this in the statute.because congress did not so indicate,we conclude that it is impermissible under d for district courts to toll the period of supervised release on the basis of a defendant absence from the united states.
the parties raised a number of arguments in support of their respective positions.these arguments centered around whether the goals of supervised release are better realized through tolling and whether tolling provides an unjustified administrative burden on the united states probation office.we think it best to leave the resolution of these policy questions to congress.if congress determines that the goals of supervised release are better realized by giving district courts discretion to issue these types of tolling orders,then congress is free to amend the legislation to provide district courts this authority.
iii.conclusion 
we acknowledge that d gives district courts latitude in creating additional conditions of supervised release beyond those enumerated in the statute.however,because tolling is not a condition,and because tolling is inconsistent with the overall statutory scheme providing for supervised release,we conclude that a district court may not issue an order tolling the period of supervised release as a special condition of supervised release pursuant to d.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand the case for resentencing with instructions that the remand be limited to setting forth lawful conditions of supervised release consistent with this opinion.

carlos alberto,a foreign national,pled guilty to a indictment that charged him with illegally reentering the united states after having been previously removed because he had committed an aggravated felony.the district court sentenced to months of imprisonment and two years of supervised release.on appeal,objects to the district court finding that his prior aggravated felony was violent in nature,the alleged unreasonableness of his sentence,and the holding that the period of supervised release should be tolled while he remains outside of the united states.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
a citizen of colombia,was charged in with unlawfully,intentionally,and knowingly caus ing the penetration of his nephew.he pled guilty to a reduced charge of sexual assault under texas law and was sentenced to two years of imprisonment.in august of,was removed to mexico,his designated country of removal.
unlawfully returned to the united states in.he sought employment,obtained a driver license using his actual name,and paid his federal income taxes.in march of,his wife,and his daughter were walking in a residential neighborhood placing advertisements for his lawn business into mailboxes.a concerned neighbor called the police,which led to arrest for being a previously deported alien.asserts that he did not intend to break the law when he opened the mailboxes,but was simply trying to attract customers for his business.
in december of,pled guilty to a indictment that charged him with illegal reentry after having been previously deported for committing an aggravated felony,a violation of b.was sentenced after the sentencing guidelines were declared no longer mandatory by the supreme court in united states booker,d.he admitted that his prior conviction constituted an aggravated felony,but made no other admissions about the nature of that conviction.the district court concluded that the conviction constitutes a crime of violence within the meaning of b a of the guidelines,and therefore added levels to offense level in computing his guidelines sentencing range.on appeal,does not challenge the district court interpretation of the guidelines in enhancing his sentence he instead challenges the district court authority to engage in factfinding regarding the nature of his prior aggravated felony.
the district court permitted a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.although the guidelines range applicable to his offense was to months after the reduction,was further granted a downward departure based on the aberrational nature of his prior crime in comparison with his conduct since returning to the united states.moreover,had not intended to break the law when he advertised his lawn business,and the district court found that he was unlikely to commit another crime.
in addition,the district court examined statistics regarding the average sentence of aliens convicted of illegal reentry in other parts of the country that employ procedures to process such convictions.special approval must be given by the united states attorney general for a state to participate in a program,so not every defendant is afforded this opportunity.the sentences in jurisdictions tend to be lower because,in exchange for an alien agreeing to waive his or her right to appeal,collaterally attack the conviction,or file certain motions,a reduction may be applied to the guidelines sentence.the district court reduction that resulted in a sentence was partially based on its concerns about the equality of justice when sentences vary for people based on where they are sentenced.
on appeal,argues that the district court enhancement violated his sixth amendment rights because he did not admit to any facts that would establish that his felony constitutes a crime of violence for purposes of the enhancement.without this enhancement,guidelines sentencing range would have been to months.also contends that his sentence was unreasonable in light of the factors set forth a,and that the district court erred in tolling his term of supervised release during the time that he remains outside of the united states.

classification of prior felony as violent 
first argues that the district court exceeded its constitutional authority under the sixth amendment when it imposed an enhancement based on facts not admitted by him and not found by a jury.he acknowledges,however,that the line of cases beginning with united states,d,permits factfinding by the court regarding the nature of a prior conviction.but he wishes to preserve the issue in the event that the supreme court reconsiders.by own admission,the district court classification of his prior conviction as violent does not violate his rights under the current state of the l
