in this appeal,we consider whether our decision in united states grisel has retroactive effect.we conclude that it does,and we reverse the judgment of the district court.
hector reina rodriguez appeals the district court denial of his motion to correct a federal sentencing enhancement imposed on account of his utah conviction for burglarizing a dwelling.reina rodriguez was indicted in federal district court for illegal after deportation,in violation of and he pled guilty without a plea agreement.
under the sentencing guidelines,a violation of has a base offense level of eight.the district court applied a level enhancement because reina rodriguez had previously been convicted of felony burglary in utah specifically,burglary of a dwelling under utah code ann.which the court concluded was a felony crime of violence under the guidelines.see b a ii b iii.taking into account other adjustments and mitigating factors,the district court sentenced reina rodriguez to months,followed by months of supervised release,and a special assessment.
at his sentencing,reina rodriguez objected to the level enhancement.he conceded that he had been convicted of burglarizing a dwelling under utah law.but he claimed the enhancement did not apply because dwelling was defined more broadly under utah law,see utah code annotated than under the guidelines and the record did not establish that the building he burglarized was a dwelling under the guidelines.as a result,he argued,his utah burglary conviction did not qualify as burglary of a dwelling under the guidelines.
the district court disagreed.the judge told reina rodriguez at sentencing that he had conducted a sua sponte investigation and had taken judicial notice of public property records in weber county,utah,which showed that the burglarized building was a building and,hence,a dwelling under the guidelines.thus,the court concluded,reina rodriguez conviction matched the guidelines definition of burglary.
after being sentenced,reina rodriguez filed a rule motion to modify his sentence.see.a.he argued that the district court erred by not providing him notice of its sua sponte investigation or its reliance on the public property records.the district court denied the motion,concluding that any error was harmless.
reina rodriguez filed a direct appeal,challenging the level enhancement.a panel of our court affirmed the district court.united states reina rodriguez,cir.the panel concluded that it did not need to address the question of whether the district court correctly relied on the public property records.id.at.instead,the panel applied the categorical and modified categorical analysis first articulated in taylor united states,and determined that burglary of a dwelling under utah law categorically fits the guidelines definition of burglary of a dwelling.reina rodriguez,at.as part of its analysis,the panel reasoned that structures adapted for sleeping or lodging,which are dwellings under utah law,categorically qualify as dwellings under the guidelines.see id.at.thus,the panel concluded,the district court correctly applied the level enhancement.
after the panel affirmed the district court in reina rodriguez,our court issued an en banc opinion in united states grisel,cir en banc.in grisel,we overruled reina rodriguez and other decisions to the extent that they suggest ed that state statutes satisfy taylor categorical inquiry when they define burglary to include adapted for overnight accommodation at.after grisel,courts must utilize the modified categorical approach to determine whether a dwelling in utah meets the guidelines definition of dwelling.see id.a adapted for accommodation,a vehicle or boat may still qualify as a dwelling under the guidelines,but it does not do so categorically.id.
in light of grisel,reina rodriguez filed a motion with the district court under,asking it to vacate,set aside,and correct his sentence.he argued that grisel should be applied retroactively and that his conviction should be set aside because the grisel court specifically overruled the previous reina rodriguez panel opinion.the district court denied the motion because reina rodriguez did not establish that the decision in grisel should operate retroactively or that grisel provides him any relief.
reina rodriguez moved for reconsideration,but the district court denied that motion,as well.the district court acknowledged that grisel overruled reina rodriguez,at least in part a fter grisel,a modified categorical analysis must be utilized in the ninth circuit to determine if there has been a crime of violence that involved a dwelling as defined by grisel.but,the court reasoned,both it and we had met the dictates of the new rule by applying a modified categorical approach.
reina rodriguez requested a certificate of appealability,but the district court denied the request.among other reasons,it concluded that the issues raised in the coa have previously been addressed to,seriously considered by,and resolved against this court and the ninth circuit court of appeals.we,however,granted reina rodriguez request for a certificate of appealability with respect to the question of whether appellant sentence is unlawful based on his sentencing enhancement for a prior crime of violence based on a utah burglary conviction.
we have jurisdiction,under,to review the district court denial of reina rodriguez motion and his motion for reconsideration.we review de novo the district court denial of a motion,united states gamba,cir the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines,united states salazar mojica,cir and all other questions of law,united states millis,cir.
generally speaking,new constitutional rules of criminal procedure do not operate retroactively for cases filed by state seeking collateral federal habeas relief.teague.lane.the primary question in this case is whether teague precludes retroactive application of grisel.we conclude that it does not.
the threshold questions for teague application are whether the articulated rule is a new constitutional rule and procedural or substantive.if the threshold qualifications for teague applicability are satisfied,there are two identified additional exceptions to the doctrine.beard banks,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the first teague exception that the supreme court has described is for rules forbidding punishment of certain primary conduct or to rules prohibiting a certain category of punishment for a class of defendants because of their status or offense.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.however,as the supreme court has noted,rules falling under this exception are more accurately characterized as substantive rules not subject to the bar.schriro summerlin.in other words,what has been categorized traditionally as an exception is a restatement of the threshold requirement that the new rule be procedural rather than substantive.see beard,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
under the second exception,teague does not apply to watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
there are several reasons why teague does not apply to grisel.
first,teague applies only to new constitutional rules of criminal procedure.danforth minnesota,quoting teague,at emphasis added.if the new rule is not founded on constitutional concerns,it does not implicate teague.see,united states talk,cir concluding that retroactive application of a decision was not teague barred because the decision was neither new nor constitutional the prescriptions of the decision are not constitutional,abrogated on other grounds as recognized in united states harms,cir oliver united states,cir teague stands for the proposition that new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be announced or applied on collateral review quotation marks and citation omitted.
here,reina rodriguez seeks to avail himself of a rule from grisel that limits the definition of burglary under the armed career criminal act.grisel is a new rule.see whorton bockting,the explicit of an earlier holding no doubt creates a new rule.quoting saffle parks.but it is not a new constitutional rule,since it does not implicate constitutional rights.the rule simply delimits the conduct that qualifies as burglary under taylor analysis.as a result,teague retroactivity bar does not apply.
second,as we have previously explained,a threshold question in a teague analysis is whether the rule that the petitioner seeks to apply is a substantive rule or a procedural rule,because teague by its terms applies only to procedural rules.bousley united states.hayes brown,cir.new substantive rules generally apply retroactively.summerlin,at.
for teague purposes,a new rule is one of procedure if it affects the operation of the criminal trial process,and a new rule is one of substance if it alters the scope or modifies the applicability of a substantive criminal statute.hayes,at citing bousley,at.substantive rules include decisions that narrow the scope of a criminal statute by interpreting its terms summerlin,at.
in grisel,we considered the scope of a state criminal statute,in the context of ascertaining the scope of a federal criminal statute,e.see at.in doing so,we carefully examined the statutory history,congressional intent,and supreme court construction of the federal statute.id.at.we concluded that burglary under oregon law is not a categorical burglary for purposes of the armed career criminal act id.at.one could hardly have a clearer example of a decision that narrow s the scope of a criminal statute by interpreting its terms summerlin,at see also united states shipp,cir holding that the supreme court construction of the scope of the armed career criminal act was a decision of substance,entitled to retroactive effect in federal habeas proceedings.
grisel was grounded in substantive law,not criminal procedure.in short,as the supreme court has instructed,teague principle is inapplicable to the situation in which this court decides the meaning of a criminal statute enacted by congress.bousley,at.as such,teague does not apply here.
the government arguments to the contrary are not persuasive.the government first remarks that grisel did not alter the range of conduct or the class of persons that utah law may punish for second degree burglary.of course it did not,but that is quite beside the point.grisel altered the punishment that can be imposed on federal defendants under the armed career criminal act.under grisel,federal courts can no longer categorically enhance a sentence for such defendants if the underlying state statute defines burglary to include adapted for overnight accommodation.at.
second,the government argues,t he new rule only altered the permissible methods for determining whether a sentencing enhancement can be imposed on account of a state burglary conviction.not so.grisel did not alter the procedural dimensions of taylor categorical approach.rather,it altered the conduct that substantively qualifies as burglary under the categorical approach.
because grisel announced a substantive rule,rather than a procedural one,teague does not bar retroactive application of grisel.
although we need not,and do not,reach this question,we must note before leaving our discussion of teague that there is some doubt under current supreme court jurisprudence whether teague applies to federal prisoners,such as reina rodriguez,who seek federal habeas relief.as chief justice rehnquist noted,the teague rule was motivated by a respect for the states strong interest in the finality of criminal convictions,and the recognition that a state should not be penalized for relying on the constitutional standards that prevailed at the time the original proceedings took place.lockhart fretwell,quoting teague,at.
recently,in danforth,justice stevens discussed teague at length and further amplified that the text and reasoning of justice opinion also illustrate that the rule was meant to apply only to federal courts considering habeas corpus petitions challenging criminal convictions.at.to be sure,danforth did not directly consider whether teague applied to federal prisoners seeking federal habeas relief it concerned a different question.however,as the sixth circuit has noted,there is now some doubt as to whether teague applies to petitioners.see duncan united states,cir it is not entirely clear that teague framework is appropriate for federal habeas petitions under because many of the comity and federalism concerns animating teague are lacking but it has been this court practice to apply teague to petitions,and we adhere to it today.
after lockhart,but prior to danforth,we squarely held that teague applied to federal prisoner petitioners.united states sanchez cervantes,cir see also united states montalvo,cir we have already held that teague applies equally to sections and habeas cases.citing sanchez cervantes.we need not consider in this case whether that holding requires in light of danforth construction of teague a question that we highlight,but leave for another day.
for the reasons we have discussed,grisel applies to this case,and the district court erred in concluding otherwise.grisel was a,substantive decision concerning the reach of a federal statute.grisel overruled the prior holding in this case that the utah conviction categorically qualified as a predicate offense under the armed career criminal act.that conclusion applies to this habeas proceeding,and the district court erred in concluding that it did not.
having decided that the utah burglary does not categorically qualify as a predicate offense,we must now decide whether the district court erred in concluding that it qualified under a modified categorical analysis.under that familiar examination,if the statute criminalizes conduct that would not constitute an aggravated felony under federal sentencing law,as is the case here,then the conviction may not be used for sentence enhancement unless the record includes documentation or judicially noticeable facts that clearly establish that the conviction is a predicate conviction for enhancement purposes.united states rivera sanchez,cir en banc quoting united states casarez bravo,cir,superseded on other grounds by cmt,as recognized in united states narvaez gomez,cir.i f the statute and the judicially noticeable facts would allow the defendant to be convicted of an offense other than that defined as a qualifying offense by the guidelines,then the conviction does not qualify as a predicate offense.rivera sanchez,at quoting casarez bravo,at.
thus,the relevant inquiry is whether the judicially noticeable documents establish that the conviction necessarily includes all of the elements of the qualifying offense.rosas castaneda holder,cir.judicially noticeable documents under the modified categorical approach include the charging document,written plea agreement,transcript of plea colloquy,and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented,as well as other documents with sufficient indicia of reliability.shepard united states,see also united states snellenberger,cir en banc per curiam.
with these considerations in mind,we must examine the judicially noticeable documents in this case and determine whether they establish that the defendant committed the crime of burglary of a dwelling,as that crime has been generically defined.the generic definition of burglary of a dwelling under the guidelines is the unlawful or unprivileged entry into,or remaining in,a building or other structure that is a dwelling,with intent to commit a crime.united states rodriguez rodriguez,cir quoting taylor,at.
the salient question for us is whether the judicially noticeable documents in this case establish that the burglary was of a dwelling.after grisel,the modified categorical analysis requires courts to analyze the nature of the structure to determine whether it is a dwelling under the guidelines.we have held that a person residential house qualifies.see reina rodriguez,at united states guerrero velasquez,cir united states matthews,cir united states wenner,cir.
however,after grisel and contrary to our reasoning in this case on direct appeal a adapted for overnight accom
