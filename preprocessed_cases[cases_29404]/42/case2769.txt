josephine kemunto manani,a native and citizen of kenya,petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under article of the convention against torture cat.to the extent that we have jurisdiction,we deny manani petition.
background 
manani entered the united states on or about october,as a nonimmigrant visitor with authorization to stay in this country until november.on may,manani filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under article of the cat.manani sought relief based on her membership in two social groups widowed mkisii women subjected to wife inheritance and kenyans who are.
manani stated in her application that she is a member of the mkisii ethnic or tribal group and that she lived in kisii,kenya,before coming to the united states.manani alleged that after her husband death on august,her husband three brothers began to harass her.according to manani,her husband brothers sought to inherit her in accordance with the traditions of mkisii culture.this inheritance custom entails a forced marriage between the widow and one of her deceased husband brothers.the widow new husband exercises control over her and her children and assumes ownership of the widow property.although manani refused to be inherited,her allegedly stole property from her home and attempted to intimidate her.eventually,her deceased husband family began demanding that manani daughters undergo female genital mutilation fgm.manani responded by sending her daughters away to boarding school.manani and her sons later left their home to move in with manani parents in matutu,kenya.
in october,more than two years after her husband died,manani came to the united states to attend a religious conference,leaving her sons behind in kenya.manani asserted that she received an extension of her nonimmigrant status that authorized her to stay in this country until march.manani claimed that a few days before this extension was set to expire she broke her back and one of her legs in a fall down a flight of stairs.while recovering from surgery after this accident,manani allegedly suffered a massive heart attack.manani stated that she then had two additional surgical procedures and completed a lengthy rehabilitation program.manani submitted a letter to corroborate her account of these catastrophic events,purportedly written by the director of the cardiovascular division at the hospital of the university of pennsylvania.
manani reported that she filed another application for an extension of her nonimmigrant status in august,which was denied in january.later that january,manani was diagnosed with hiv.manani wrote in her may application for asylum that she feared discrimination on account of her status if she were forced to return to kenya.
the department of homeland security chicago asylum office asylum office declined to grant manani application for asylum because manani failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that she filed her application within one year after her arrival in the united states.see a b providing that an alien may not apply for asylum unless she demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within year after the date of the alien arrival in the united states.the asylum office found that manani showed changed circumstances materially affecting her eligibility for asylum,or extraordinary circumstances directly related to her delay in filing,but nevertheless decided that manani failed to file her application within a reasonable period of time given those circumstances.see a d providing that an untimely application may be considered if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the attorney general either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period specified in a b.the asylum office referred manani application to an immigration judge ij to commence removal proceedings.
on november,manani made her initial appearance before the ij.manani conceded that she was removable under a b for remaining in the united states after november,without authorization.the ij continued the proceedings until january.on that date,manani reiterated many of the factual allegations set forth in her written application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.manani admitted,however,that her narrative about falling down a flight of stairs and suffering a heart attack was a fabrication.manani also confessed that the letter she submitted to corroborate her fantastic account of those events was a forgery.on april,the ij heard testimony from manani sons,who joined their mother in the united states in august,and from manani clinical psychologist.the ij then issued her oral decision.
the ij found that manani testimony was partly credible and partly exaggerated.the ij credited manani testimony that her husband died in,that her desired to inherit her and subject her daughters to fgm,and that she subjectively feared returning to kenya because of her status.on the other hand,the ij discredited manani inconsistent testimony about whether her had physically harmed her after her husband death.moreover,the ij decided that manani exaggerated her claims about the threat of future harm to her and her daughters from her and their family.the ij noted in this regard that manani avoided wife inheritance during the roughly period between her husband death and her arrival in the united states and that her daughters avoided fgm despite remaining in kenya without their mother.the ij also registered concerns regarding manani credibility in light of her fabricated narrative about suffering injuries and her submission of a forged letter.
while the ij stated that manani failed to meet her burden of proof on the merits of her asylum claim,the ij later held that manani was statutorily ineligible for asylum because she did not file her application within one year after her arrival in the united states.the ij further held that manani may application for asylum was not filed within a reasonable time after learning that she was in january.the ij added that she would,in any event,deny manani application for asylum as a matter of discretion because of manani submission of a fraudulent document.finally,the ij determined that manani failure to meet the lower burden of proof associated with her asylum claim meant that she necessarily failed to meet the higher burden of proof required to establish her eligibility for withholding of removal or protection under the cat.
manani appealed to the bia,arguing,among other things,that the evidence conclusively showed that she suffered past persecution in kenya and that she had a fear of future persecution if she were forced to return there.manani continued to describe herself as a member of the social group composed of kenyans who are,but she both broadened and narrowed her description of the other social group to which she claimed membership that is,manani now described herself as a kenyan rather than mkisii widow opposed rather than subjected to wife inheritance and to the performance of fgm on her daughters a new category.
on february,the bia dismissed manani appeal in its entirety.first,the bia affirmed the ij decision insofar as it found manani statutorily ineligible for asylum because she did not file her application within either one year after she entered the united states in october or a reasonable time after she learned that she was in january.the bia rejected manani argument that the ij ignored testimony from manani psychologist indicating that manani experienced symptoms of severe depression before she was diagnosed with hiv.the bia noted that manani was able to start working as a caregiver in april,more than a full year before filing her application for asylum on may.thus,the bia held that even considering manani depression,she nonetheless failed to file her application within a reasonable period.
turning to manani remaining claims,the bia foun
