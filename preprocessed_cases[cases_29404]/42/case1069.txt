arturo rafael brought a petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to challenging a final administrative order of removal by the board of immigration appeals bia,and he now appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york naomi reice buchwald,judge denying his petition in an unpublished memorandum and order.is a lawful permanent resident whose removal order was based on a february,conviction for attempted rape in the second degree in violation of new york state law.before the district court and on appeal,has argued that he is eligible for a discretionary waiver of deportation based on extreme family hardship under section h of the immigration and nationality act of ina,codified as amended at h.
it is uncontested that,under the law at the time of conviction,he is ineligible for a section h waiver because of two provisions of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,div,title iii,stat,enacted september,section a of iirira amended section h to preclude family hardship waivers for lawful permanent residents convicted of an aggravated felony,and section a of iirira simultaneously expanded the definition of aggravated felony in a way that encompasses offense,however,contends that these provisions should not apply to him because his crime was committed prior to iirira enactment.under the law when the offense was committed,his conviction would not have been classified an aggravated felony,and section h relief would have been available.
in making this argument,relies primarily on beharry reno,d weinstein,rev on jurisdictional grounds sub nom.beharry ashcroft,cir,which held that it would violate united states treaty obligations and customary international law to apply iirira restrictions on section h relief to an alien whose disqualifying criminal conduct occurred prior to iirira enactment.to avoid the perceived violation of international law,beharry ruled that section h should be interpreted to allow waivers for aliens who have been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined after they committed their crime,but which was not so categorized when they committed the crime.beharry,d at.on appeal,we reversed beharry for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.see beharry ashcroft,at explaining that petitioner never sought relief under section h before the bia.but we did not reach the merits of beharry international law rationale,see id.at,and we have not done so in any subsequent case.
the facts of case fall squarely within the parameters of beharry and require us to confront that decision directly.in doing so,we now find that the beharry decision,while commendable for its efforts and concern for human interests,can not support the remedy it attempted to provide.in its most doctrinally sound form,beharry urges that where a statute is ambiguous,we should construe the statute to conform to the principles of international law.congress,however,plainly provided that iirira restriction on h relief and expanded definition of an aggravated felony should apply retroactively.because congress intent is clear,it displaces any inconsistent norms of customary international law or prior treaty obligations.for this reason,we need not reach a number of controversial issues underlying the beharry decision,including whether the international law sources cited by beharry actually rise to the level of customary international law the extent to which international law,in general,can influence the construction and application of even ambiguous statutes and whether domestic law actually is in conflict with the cited principles of international law.our holding is thus a limited one even if we were to accept several controversial premises in the beharry decision as true,the result in this case is controlled by congress plainly stated intent that iirira restrictions on section h relief apply retroactively.
we thus find that is not eligible for section h relief,and we further find additional it is an impermissible ex post facto application of the law to classify him as an aggravated be unavailing.the judgment of the district court is thus affirmed.
background 
statutory context 
the benchmark for modern immigration law is the immigration and nationality act of,stat,codified as amended at et.in pertinent part,section a of the ina,codified as amended at a,lists grounds rendering an alien inadmissible to the united states,including prior criminal activity section h of the ina provides that the attorney general may,in his discretion,waive the application of certain grounds for inadmissibility 
in the case of an immigrant who is the spouse,parent,son,or daughter of a citizen of the united states or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if it is established to the satisfaction of the attorney general that the alien denial of admission would result in extreme hardship to the united states citizen or lawfully resident spouse,parent,son,or daughter of such alien 
h b.section h thus allows both lawful permanent residents and unlawful aliens to obtain discretionary waivers from exclusion or deportation based on such extreme family hardship 
prior to iirira,such waivers were available where the exclusion or deportation was based on any of a broad range of criminal acts,but with iirira enactment on september,congress substantially limited the availability of section h relief by providing 
no waiver shall be granted under this subsection in the case of an alien who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if either since the date of such admission the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony or the alien has not lawfully resided continuously in the united states for a period of not less than years immediately preceding the date of initiation of proceedings to remove the alien from the united states.
iirira a,stat.at amending h section a of iirira,as interpreted by the bia and as applied by the immigration and naturalization service ins thus precludes lawful permanent residents who commit aggravated felonies from obtaining section h relief,even though unlawful aliens who commit the same offenses are still eligible for such relief.see ins,cir upholding section a of iirira against a challenge under the equal protection clause.
iirira heightened the impact of section h new aggravated felony limitation by simultaneously broadening the ina definition of aggravated felony.see iirira a,stat.amending a.the term aggravated felony had been introduced in as section a of the ina and was initially defined to include only murder,drug trafficking,and illicit trafficking in a firearm or destructive device as well as any attempt or conspiracy to commit such crimes.see abuse act of.title vii,subtitle j,stat,codified at a.congress had expanded the definition on multiple occasions thereafter but,prior to iirira,several as crimes of violence or theft qualified as aggravated felonies if the sentence imposed involved at least five years imprisonment.see,a f,g.iirira,however,provided that those crimes would constitute aggravated felonies if they resulted in imprisonment of as little as one year or more.see iirira a,stat.at amending a f,g.iirira also defined aggravated felonies to include rape or sexual abuse of a minor regardless of the term of imprisonment imposed.see iirira a,stat.at amending a a.
facts and procedural history 
was born on march,and is a native and citizen of ecuador.he was admitted to the united states on january,as a lawful permanent resident and has lived in the united states since that time.he is married to a united states citizen and has children who are also united states citizens.on december,pleaded guilty to one count of attempted rape in the second degree in violation of new york penal law,which makes it illegal to engage in sexual intercourse with a person less than fifteen years old when one is eighteen years old or more.the charge arose out of acts occurring between september,and september.on february,he was sentenced to a term of five years probation and his conviction was entered.
the ins served with a notice to appear on august,alleging that he is removable from the united states pursuant to ina section a a iii,codified at a a iii,as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.the aggravated felony designation is based on a a,as amended by section a of iirira,which expanded the definition of an aggravated felony to include rape or sexual abuse of a minor.see iirira a,stat.at amending a a see also a u defining aggravated felony to include an attempt to commit any offense described in subsection a.prior to iirira and at the time of the commission of the offense,the attempted rape likely would have been deemed a crime of violence but would have qualified as an aggravated felony only if it resulted in five years imprisonment or more.see a f.because was sentenced to five years probation,he would not have been deemed an aggravated felon under the law prior to iirira.
in opposing his deportation,argued that he is eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility and deportation under sections c and h the ij rejected these claims and ordered that be removed.the bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion on september.on june,filed his habeas petition with the district court,arguing that he is eligible for relief under section c as it existed prior to aedpa and under h as construed by the united states district court for the eastern district of new york in beharry reno,d.
the district court stayed the petition while the beharry decision was being appealed.after beharry was vacated for lack of jurisdiction,filed a motion to reopen to exhaust his administrative remedies as to his request for section c relief and for section h relief under beharry.on november,the bia denied the motion to reopen,declining to follow beharry as to the request under section h.then amended his habeas petition to reflect the bia denial of the motion to reopen and its rejection of beharry.
the district court denied the amended petition for writ of habeas corpus.first,the district court found ineligible for c relief because he pleaded guilty after the april,effective date of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa.see aedpa d,stat.at precluding aliens convicted of aggravated felonies from receiving section c relief where their convictions were entered on or after the effective date of aedpa ins cyr,d holding that c relief remains available for aliens whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who,notwithstanding those convictions,would have been eligible for c relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.the district court also found that is ineligible for h relief,as amended by section of iirira,which precludes such relief for permanent resident aliens convicted of an aggravated felony.the district court found that congress was perfectly clear in its intent to apply section of iirira retroactively.the court further explained that iirira expanded definition of an aggravated felony clearly applies retroactively and covers offense even though it would not have been an aggravated felony under the law at the time of its commission.
turning to the beharry argument,the district court recognized that fits into the narrow class of individuals subject to deportation for an act that was not deemed an aggravated felony at the time of commission.the court wrote,however,that with all respect we disagree with the international law rationale advanced inbeharry,and it concluded that based on the clear intent of congress in its amendment of h,petitioner,as an aggravated felon,is not entitled to a compassionate hearing.
ii.discussion 
timely appealed from the judgment denying his habeas petition,but,on appeal,he only contends that he is eligible for relief under section h of the ina and does not contend that he is eligible for relief under section c.in reviewing a district court decision to deny a petition for writ of habeas corpus,we review the court legal conclusions de novo and review factual findings supporting the decision for clear error.see marrero pichardo ashcroft,cir.in this case,there is no dispute as to any factual finding.
instead,the issues raised in this appeal solely concern whether the relevant provisions of iirira may be applied to restrict relief under section h in the case of an alien,like,who was convicted of an offense after iirira enactment but whose crime was committed prior to iirira passage.our decision today marks an addition to the line of cases in this circuit on the retroactive effect of certain provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,title iv,stat,enacted april,and iirira,enacted september,collectively,the acts.this case,however,raises unique issues in two respects.first,prior decisions in this circuit have focused primarily on the acts effect on section c of the ina we have not addressed the retroactivity issue with respect to section h.second,this appeal requires us to confront directly the argument presented in beharry reno that iirira retroactive application to aliens seeking section h relief should be limited to avoid an alleged conflict with international law.
ultimately,our decision today is controlled by congress unambiguous intent that the relevant amendments to the ina enacted by iirira shall apply retroactively.this intent is the dispositive factor both for our traditional analysis employed in the section c context and for our determination that beharry,with its international law rationale,can not support relief for.
analyzing the retroactivity issue under second circuit precedent 
in this circuit,we have yet to address the retroactivity of iirira restrictions on relief under section h,but we have developed a significant line of case law with respect to aedpa and iirira retroactive application to ina section c a provision that,similar to section h,allowed for discretionary relief from exclusion or deportation beginning with cyr ins cyr i,cir,aff,ins cyr cyr ii,d,we have primarily addressed these retroactivity issues using the framework provided by landgraf usi film products,d.landgraf provides a mechanism for implementing the deeply rooted presumption that legislation should not have a retroactive effect unless congress speaks plainly to the contrary.see cyr i,at quoting landgraf,at.under this framework,a court must first determine whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach,whether congress clearly intended a retroactive application.see id.at quoting landgraf,at.if congress has spoken clearly,the inquiry is over and the court must implement congress intent unless doing so would be unconstitutional.restrepo mcelroy,cir.but if congress intent is ambiguous,a court proceeds to the second step determining whether applying a statute to prior conduct would have a retroactive effect,whether it would change the legal consequences of past events.see cyr i,at citing landgraf,at.such an effect triggers the presumption against retroactivity,requiring a court to construe the statute to avoid upsetting settled expectations and producing unfair results.see id.at.
in cyr i,we applied this framework to find that section of restricted the availability of section c relief for aggravated section of eliminated section c relief not apply to aliens who pleaded guilty prior to the enactment of the acts.we found,first,that congress did not unambiguously provide for the relevant provisions retroactive application.see cyr i,at.in particular,with respect to iirira repeal of section c,we noted that the provision governing the temporal reach of the repeal simply provided for an effective date,and we found that provision insufficiently clear for the purposes of the first landgraf step.see id.at discussing impact of effective date provided in section a of iirira see also cyr ii,at.declaring that the mere promulgation of an effective date for a statute does not provide sufficient assurance that congress specifically considered the potential unfairness that retroactive application would produce.proceeding to the second step of the landgraf analysis,we found that,prior to the acts,aliens often pleaded guilty to crimes in reliance on the possibility of obtaining a waiver of deportation under section c.see cyr i,at.thus we found that eliminating section c relief for such aliens changed the legal consequences of relevant prior guilty that disturbing those aliens settled expectations triggered the landgraf presumption against retroactivity.see id.at.in affirming our decision,the supreme court similarly focused on the act of pleading guilty in reliance on section c as the key conduct triggering the fairness concerns underlying landgraf.see cyr ii,at.
following cyr i,we held in domond ins,cir,that aedpa restriction on section c relief can apply to criminal conduct the statutes where the conviction occurred after the relevant statutory enactment.we explained that such an application of aedpa or iirira had no retroactive effect because it did not change the legal consequences of criminal conduct it is the conviction,not the underlying criminal act,that bars relief under section c.see id.at.citing dicta in cyr i,we further found that,in contrast to aliens who may have pleaded guilty in reliance on section c,it can not reasonably be argued that aliens committed crimes in reliance on a hearing that might possibly waive their deportation.id.at citing cyr i,at.domond was decided before the supreme court decision in cyr ii,but we have reaffirmed that domond is controlling and that the mere fact that criminal conduct aedpa or iirira does not trigger any retroactivity concerns under the second landgraf step.see khan ashcroft,cir see also restrepo,at.in other cases,we have further held that aliens choosing to go to trial prior to the acts,as opposed to those pleading guilty,were not detrimentally relying on the availability of c relief and thus can not succeed under a landgraf analysis.see rankine reno,cir,cert.denied sub nom.lawrence ashcroft,d see also thom ashcroft,cir,petition for cert.filed.
applying the landgraf framework to appeal,we first address whether congress unambiguously prescribed the reach of section and section of iirira,which combine to deprive of section h relief under the law as it is currently enforced.in addressing this question,we agree with the district court that congress unambiguously directed that these provisions shall apply retroactively.
section a of iirira eliminates section h relief for lawful permanent residents convicted of aggravated felonies,and section b expressly provides that the restriction in section a shall be effective on the date of the enactment of this act september,and shall apply in the case of any alien who is in exclusion or deportation proceedings as of such date unless a final administrative order in such proceedings has been entered as of such date.iirira b,stat.at.unlike the provisions at issue in cyr i ii,section b of iirira not only promulgates an effective date it also directs that section h relief should be restricted in the case of aliens already in exclusion or deportation proceedings in which no final administrative order has been entered.the obvious effect of the latter clause is to cover aliens whose relevant criminal conduct and convictions occurred prior to iirira enactment.thus,we find that congress clearly intended that an alien placed in deportation proceedings after iirira enactment is subject to the restrictions on section h regardless of when the underlying criminal activity occurred.indeed,the supreme court in cyr ii cited section b of iirira as an example of an unambiguous expression of retroactivity.see cyr ii,at.
moreover,as the district court observed,congress was clear in providing that the expanded definition of an aggravated felony in section a of iirira should apply retroactively.section b of iirira states that the amended definition of aggravated felony shall apply regardless of whether the conviction was entered before,on,or after the date of enactment,september.see iirira b,stat.at amending ina section a,codified at a.in kuhali reno,cir,we found that section b of iirira clearly provides for a retroactive application,and thus we held,under the first landgraf step,that the expanded definition of an aggravated felony applied to an alien placed in deportation proceedings based on a conviction.id.at see also cyr ii,at.under the plain language of iirira and kuhali,we must conclude that congress intended the amended definition of an aggravated felony to apply to aliens,like,who committed crimes prior to iirira.
we thus find that congress clearly intended section a and section a of iirira to preclude aliens like from obtaining section h relief.because of this finding,we do not proceed to the second landgraf step,and may not rely on the presumption against retroactivity in seeking a favorable construction of the statute.
in addition,to the extent that contends that it would violate the ex post facto clause of the constitution to apply the expanded definition of an aggravated felony to him,this argument is unavailing.in both domond and kuhali,we declared that there can be no constitutional violation in applying aedpa or iirira to criminal conduct the statutes because the ex post facto clause only applies to penal legislation and deportation proceedings have consistently been characterized as civil in nature.see kuhali,at a long and constant line of precedent establishes that statutes retroactively setting criteria for deportation do not violate the ex post facto clause.domond,at 
argument based on beharry and international law 
having rejected argument under the traditional landgraf framework,we now turn to his reliance on beharry.similar to the facts in this appeal,beharry involved a permanent lawful resident who was convicted,upon a plea of guilty,in november after iirira enactment for a theft committed in july prior to iirira,and whose conviction resulted in less than five years imprisonment.see beharry reno,d,rev on jurisdictional grounds sub nom.beharry ashcroft,cir.under section h as amended by iirira,beharry was ineligible for discretionary relief because he was classified as an aggravated felon,but,under the law when the crime was committed,beharry offense would not have been classified an aggravated felony.on a petition for writ of habeas corpus,beharry sought various forms of relief,including the right to a hearing under section c.while the beharry court found the requested relief unavailable,it found that beharry was entitled to a hearing for compassionate relief under section h,read in light of international law,because beharry would not have been deemed an aggravated felon under the law when the offense was committed.beharry,d at.
the district court reviewing petition correctly observed that the facts of the case fall squarely within the holding in beharry.in addressing argument under beharry,we first examine the beharry opinion itself before explaining why we now hold that the reasoning of the decision can not support the relief it attempted to provide.
the beharry decision 
the international law argument in beharry is premised largely on the charming betsy principle that statutes,whenever possible,should be construed to conform with international law.see beharry,d at citing murray v.the schooner charming betsy,cranch.marshall,a n act of congress ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations,if any other possible construction remains.this argument arose in the context of our decisions in domond and kuhali,which precluded a claim that applying iirira would be impermissibly retroactive under the second landgraf step and also precluded any contention that a retrospective application of iirira would risk violating due process or the ex post facto clause.the beharry court noted,however,that neither kuhali nor domond ruled on the international law questions presented in the instant case,see id.at,and it declared that v iewed from the perspective of the international law reviewed in this memorandum beginning with charming betsy,the rationales of domond and kuhali fail to account for the full necessary interpretive statutory background,see id.at.the beharry court thus presented the argument that an application of iirira in beharry case would violate international law and that,notwithstanding second circuit precedent,section h should be construed to avoid such a violation.
in laying out the applicable international law,beharry reviewed the international covenant on civil and political rights iccpr,the united nations universal declaration of human rights udhr,res.iii a,doc,and the convention on the rights of the child crc,reprinted in.beharry explained that those international law sources provide,for example,that an alien lawfully residing in a territory be allowed to submit the reasons against his expulsion and that n o one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his family.see id.at ellipsis in original quoting iccpr,see also id.noting that udhr prohibits the imposition of arbitrary exile id.at citing provisions of crc that provide,in essence,that the best interests of the the right to be cared for by be a primary consideration and should be protected.beharry declared that separating an alien from his family without allowing him to submit family hardship reasons against deportation would violate various provisions of the cited documents.see id.at.
as beharry noted,however,none of the above sources of international law have the effect of domestic law.the iccpr is a signed and ratified treaty,but it came with attached reservations,understandings,and declarations ruds declaring that it is not.see id.at see also cong.rec,exec,sess.declarations,reprinted in.treaties generally have the force of domestic law and can be directly enforced by courts.see beharry,d at see also cheung united states,cir.but when a treaty is not,the treaty does not provide independent,privately enforceable rights.see beharry,d at see also flores peru copper,cir explaining that iccpr does not create private,directly enforceable rights because the senate declared that it is not.beharry similarly acknowledged that the udhr is not a treaty and that the crc has been signed but never ratified by the united states.beharry,d at.
despite their not having the effect of domestic law,beharry contended that the iccpr,udhr,and crc could play a role in statutory construction.in particular,beharry discussed the nature and impact of customary international law in light of the charming betsy principle that courts should interpret legislation in harmony with international law and norms wherever possible.see id.at.the beharry court acknowledged that congress may override provisions of customary international law.id.at citing the paquete habana.but beharry contended that in order to overrule customary international law,congress must enact domestic legislation which both postdates the development of a customary international law norm,and which clearly has the intent of repealing that norm.beharry,d at see also id.at where a statute appears to contradict international law,an appropriate remedy is to construe the statute so as to resolve the contradiction.customary international law is legally enforceable unless superceded by a clear statement from congress.such a statement must be unequivocal.mere silence is insufficient to meet this standard.citation omitted.the beharry court further found that congress has not expressed a clear intent to overrule customary international law as expressed in the crc,in particular.id.at.
the beharry court determined that,as interpreted and implemented against beharry,iirira would conflict with and customary international law,and the court contended that such violations raised a potential constitutional issue since both statutes and international law are enforceable under the constitution supremacy clause,the statute should be construed in conformity with international law to avoid a constitutional issue if fairly possible.id.at internal quotation omitted.the beharry court thus sought to make the minimal changes necessary to bring the statute into compliance with international law and crafted a narrowly targeted remedy of limiting iirira applicability to prior criminal conduct 
it would be a violation of international law to categorically deny to all aliens otherwise eligible under section h who have been denominated after their crime was committed as aggravated felons,relief under the provision.the statutory provision no waiver shall be provided if the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony should be narrowly construed so as to accord with international law.that can be done by ruling that section h waivers are available for aliens,including petitioner,who meet its stringent requirements of seven years residence and extreme hardship to these aliens have been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined after they committed their crime,but which was not so categorized when they committed the crime.
id.at.beharry concluded by calling on this court to reconsider domond and kuhali and to redefine the operative time from which to define retroactivity under the statute as the moment the crime was committed,rather than the date of conviction.id.at.doing so,the beharry court stated,would obviously be a more comfortable rationale than one such as in beharry depending upon international law ex proprio vigore.id.
before addressing the merits of beharry,we note that judge weinstein in beharry is not the only judge to express doubts about our decision in domond and there is no question that the principles of international law cited in beharry reflect high and noble aspirations for the united states and the nations of the world.but the precise role of international law in the beharry analysis is not entirely clear.in one sense,beharry can be read as offering a relatively not of statutory construction that a court should interpret statutes,when ambiguous,to conform to international law.alternatively,some portions of beharry can be read to expound a more radical view that treaties even if and emerging customary international law can override domestic law unless and until congress expressly repudiates the international norms.while beharry found that congress did not express a specific intent to override principles of customary international law,it apparently assumed,without discussion,that congress intent was not clear on whether iirira restriction on section h relief applies to prior criminal conduct.as will be explained,the clarity of congress intent as to iirira and section h is ultimately dispositive in this case.
moreover,there are number of premises underlying the beharry decision that are highly controversial.for example,it is not clear that the international law documents cited in beharry rise to the level of customary international law.and courts ability to look to international law when interpreting even ambiguous statutes is,of course,a hotly contested issue.beyond those issues is the question of whether a retroactive application of iirira actually conflicts with the provisions of the iccpr and crc at all.but,for the reasons explained below,we need not resolve these issues because congress intent is this case is clear.even accepting,arguendo,that several of these controversial premises could be resolved favorably to the beharry rationale,it is congress clear intent that controls in this case 
disposition of the beharry issue 
in its most doctrinally sound form,beharry can be read as applying the charming betsy principle that,where legislation is ambiguous,it should be interpreted to conform to international law.indeed,we recently recognized the charming betsy principle in united states yousef,cir.per curiam,cert.denied,d,where we stated while it is permissible for united states law to conflict with customary international law,where legislation is susceptible to multiple interpretations,the interpretation that does not conflict with the law of nations is preferred.id.at citing charming betsy,cranch at.as we explained in yousef,however,the charming betsy canon comes into play only where congress intent is ambiguous.id.if a statute makes plain congress intent then article iii courts,which can overrule congressional enactments only when such enactments conflict with the constitution,must enforce the intent of congress irrespective of whether the statute conforms to customary international law.id.at citation omitted see also comm.of citizens living
