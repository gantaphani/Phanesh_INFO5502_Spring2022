israel,a previously deported mexican citizen,appeals his sentence after pleading guilty to violating a,unlawful reentry into the united states of a removed alien,because of an alleged miscalculation in his criminal history.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
was deported to mexico in february,after pleading guilty to the aggravated felony of possessing a firearm by a convicted felon.in march,reentered the united states and was found in the central district of california without having applied for admission to the united states following his removal.under a plea agreement,pled guilty to a information for violating a,which subjected him to a potential imprisonment term of years.b.the plea agreement provided that would be sentenced at the low end of the sentencing guidelines range,determined by a total offense level of and his calculated criminal history.
the probation office calculated criminal history at points,including in the calculation his pleading guilty to charges for burglary in and importing controlled substances,methamphetamine,in for sale and distribution.among those points were points allotted for each of arrests or citations for driving with a suspended license on november,and november.on the condition that he serve days in the county jail for both traffic violations,was sentenced to concurrent sentences of months of probation for the traffic violations.in accordance with the plea agreement,the district court calculated the imprisonment sentence at the low end of the sentencing guidelines range of to months,with an offense level of and criminal history category vi,and sentenced to months of imprisonment.
discussion 
we review a district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo.united states,cir,cert.denied.the only issue on appeal is whether a citation for a traffic violation is an arrest countable for criminal history under the sentencing guidelines.argues that,because he was cited but not arrested for the november,traffic violation,the two violations were not separated by an intervening arrest under a,and the points added for the november,traffic violation should not have been counted.the difference to would be that the subtraction of the points would put him in criminal history category v,where the imprisonment term would be months instead of months under criminal history category vi,or months of imprisonment.
on similar facts,concerning whether two violations of driving after the defendant license had been revoked that occurred days apart should have been counted separately under a,the only circuit court to address this issue is the seventh circuit.united states morgan,cir easterbrook.the morgan court recognized that c alling the traffic stop an arrest implements the sentencing commission goal and that a traffic stop is an arrest in federal parlance,as opposed to state law.id.at,citing whren united states,united states childs,cir en banc california hodari.the seventh circuit also noted that morgan was halted and prevented from leaving until the officer released him,although he could have been taken to the stationhouse,converting a street arrest to a full custodial arrest.id.at emphasis added.
since the seventh circuit analysis in morgan,the sentencing commission amended in.rather than the related or recidivism reasoning of the guideline in morgan,a provides that p rior sentences always are counted separately if the sentences were imposed for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest,the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to committing the second offense.a emphasis added see united states rooks,cir.excepting the reasoning of morgan,the arrest analysis still holds.
implicit in a street arrest is that it can turn quickly into a full custodial arrest,depending on the conduct of the defendant.this was true of both of street arrests for traffic violations.moreover,he was sentenced to a concurrent sentence of days in the county jail for these offenses,or days per traffic violation.imprisonment for his traffic violations shows that,for guidelines purposes,they represent more than mere citations that asserts should be disregarded in calculating his criminal history.under criminal history category,b,a sentencing court must a dd points for each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days.b.because there were prison sentences for each of prior traffic violations,the court properly calculated points for each conviction under b.
conclusion 
the district court correctly calculated criminal history.we agree with the seventh circuit in morgan that treatment of traffic violations as arrests comports with the sentencing guidelines.
with all due respect,because whether a citation is an arrest within the meaning of a is an issue of second impression across the breadth of the federal courts,it deserves more serious analysis than the judicial sleight of hand performed by the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit in morgan and adopted by this court today.like the classic street shell game,thimblerig which used three thimbles or walnut shells and a short con,because it was quick and easy to pull palmed the pea,so that plain meaning,a common sense and legally correct view of the word arrest,and fundamental fairness are no longer under the shells.surprisingly,morgan managed to pull off this trick with a single paragraph.i respectfully dissent from falling for the con.
more specifically,i do not find the decision of the seventh circuit court of appeals in morgan to be persuasive on the question of whether a citation is an arrest within the meaning of a,on either a recidivism rationale or the majority what might have happened rationale.moreover,the fact that b requires a sentencing court to a dd points for each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days simply does nothing to question of whether had an intervening arrest within the meaning of a,as the answer to that question determines whether or not had one or two prior sentences to count pursuant to b.the majority analysis would make the sentences received on prior offenses the determining factor in the calculation of a defendant criminal history,not whether a defendant had an intervening arrest,essentially writing a out of the sentencing guidelines.in contrast,i find that excluding citations from arrests in a comports with ordinary meaning,common sense,and the purposes of the sentencing guidelines.
i.the decision in morgan 
i agree with the majority that the only other federal court to decide this question,the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit,held that the word arrest in a includes a citation.united states morgan,cir finding that a traffic stop for continuing to drive with a revoked license,which resulted in the issuance of a citation,but not a trip to jail,was an arrest.however,unlike the majority,i do not find morgan in the least persuasive.
in concluding that arrest within the meaning of a includes citations,judge easterbrook,now chief judge,writing for the seventh circuit court of appeals,began his analysis by concluding,without reasoning or citation to authority,that c alling the traffic stop an arrest implements the sentencing commission goal.morgan,at.the court then stated that a defendant who commits a crime,is arrested for that offense,and then commits another crime,is a recidivist whose criminal record should be tallied in full.morgan,at citing to united states coleman,cir.the court determined that the same is true of one who only receives a citation.
next,the court in morgan stated that a t all events,there is no ambiguity.a traffic stop is an arrest in federal parlance.id.at.citing whren united states,u.this conclusory statement is troubling,because i do not believe that whren stands for that proposition at all.i understand whren to stand for the unremarkable proposition that t emporary detention of individuals during the stop of an automobile by the police,even if only for a brief period and for a limited purpose,constitutes a seizure of persons within the meaning of the fourth amendment.id.at citing delaware.prouse.whren does cite to united states robinson,stating that we held in robinson that a arrest of the sort here would not be rendered invalid by the fact that it was a mere pretext for a narcotics search.whren,at emphasis added.however,the traffic stop in robinson involved a full custody arrest,not a brief stop,citation,and release.robinson,at.further,the court in morgan did not fully reconcile its ruling with the earlier pronouncement of the seventh circuit court of appeals in united states joseph,cir,that the court would not rewrite the guidelines by interpreting arrest to mean arrest or charge in the absence of a compelling reason for believing that the choice of words was a slip of the pen.id.at.
the persuasiveness of morgan is further undermined by the fact that the entire analysis of the issue of whether an arrest includes a citation is limited to a single paragraph of the opinion.two points,in particular,that the court emphasized are perplexing and troubling.first,the court emphasized that morgan was caught driving after his license revocation.morgan,at.second,the court observed that morgan could have been taken to the.id.at.while both points are no doubt true,i do not think that either the weight of the evidence against morgan nor a hypothetical trip to the stationhouse is remotely relevant to the issue of the meaning of arrest as that term is used in this guideline.indeed,judge easterbrook agreed with this latter proposition in his prior decision in united states childs,cir en banc,in which he pointedly stated,the reasonableness of a seizure depends on what the police do,not on what they might have done.childs,at emphasis in the original.why should what officers might have done have any more significance in the context of the sentencing guidelines than it does in the context of the fourth amendment 
this case should not turn on either what might have,but did not happen,or on the sentence imposed at a later time,but instead should turn on whether there was as intervening arrest within the meaning of a when received a citation.
ii.the majority decision 
while i agree with the majority that the amendment to a did remove considerations of relatedness,i do not believe that it eliminated the likelihood of recidivism as a consideration in the calculation of a defendant criminal history,as discussed in more detail below.see chapter four,part a,introductory commentary noting that the purpose of the guidelines sections addressing a defendant criminal history,generally,is to address the likelihood of recidivism,taking into account the notion that r epeated criminal behavior is an indicator of a limited likelihood of successful rehabilitation.however,if the amendment did render the relatedness and recidivism reasoning of morgan irrelevant,then in relying on morgan,the majority must rely on two unsupportable rationales.the first is that arrest includes citations because it does so in federal parlance,an assertion that relies on nothing more than a bare assertion in whren that this is so,see morgan,f d at,which,in turn,relies on whren misreading of the circumstances in robinson,as explained above.the second is that the defendant could have been taken to the stationhouse,morgan,at,but again,for the reasons explained above,why should what officers might have done have any significance to the determination of whether a citation is an arrest within the meaning of the sentencing guidelines rather than adding any clarity to the question of whether a citation is an intervening arrest within the meaning of a,the apparently relying on two new,undefined concepts into the mix,a street arrest and a mere citation.the majority suggests,as did the court in morgan,at,that a street arrest,whatever that may be,counts as an intervening arrest,because it can turn quickly into a full custodial arrest,depending on the conduct of the defendant.does street arrest extend to any stop by the police for any reason,as any stop has the potential to turn into a full custodial arrest,depending on the conduct of the defendant the majority also suggests that the length of sentences shows that,for guidelines purposes,they represent more than mere citations that asserts should be disregarded in calculating his criminal history.emphasis added.are there then mere citations that do not count as intervening arrests for criminal history purposes,and citations that do count as intervening arrests for criminal history purposes,and is the sentence ultimately imposed what determines whether or not a citation is a citation or a mere citation 
what we do seem to know from the majority opinion is that,if a defendant receives a prison sentence in excess of sixty days for each offense,the court properly calculate s points for each conviction under b.however,whether a defendant had an intervening arrest within the meaning of a is supposedly what determines whether a defendant had one or two prior sentences to count pursuant to b.the majority analysis would make the sentences received on prior offenses the determining factor in the calculation of a defendant criminal history,not whether a defendant had an intervening arrest,essentially writing a out of the sentencing guidelines.
the majority opinion not only fails to answer the question presented,that is,whether a citation is an arrest within the meaning of a,but introduces new unanswered questions about the calculation of a defendant criminal history,including whether a has any significance at all.david copperfield spectacular illusion of making the statue of liberty disappear has nothing over the majority wave of its judicial magic wand,which makes a and its plain meaning vanish 
iii.plain and ordinary meaning 
rules of interpretation and construction 
in order to determine whether criminal history points were correctly more specifically,whether his intervening citations were intervening arrests within the meaning of a it is necessary,in my view,to determine the meaning of the term arrest as it appears in a.when interpreting the sentencing guidelines,a court applies the general rules of statutory construction.united states,cir.
very recently,the united states supreme court reiterated that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.when the statutory language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.carr united states.similarly,this court has observed,o ur inquiry begins with the statutory text,and ends there as well if the text is unambiguous.satterfield simon schuster,cir.this court has expressly applied this rule to the interpretation of sentencing guidelines.see united states treadwell,cir if the text of a guideline is unambiguous,its plain meaning controls.see also united states,cir.
in assessing plain meaning,unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.united states gonzalez,cir see also bailey hill,cir the united states supreme court has declared that where a statute does not define its terms we are to give such a term its ordinary or natural meaning.citing johnson united states,perrin united states.t he structure and purpose of a statute may also provide guidance in determining the plain meaning of its provisions.bailey,at.an omission at the time of enactment,whether careless or calculated,can not be judicially supplied,however much later wisdom may recommend the inclusion.doyon,bristol bay native,cir.
we apply these first principles of statutory construction to the term arrest within the meaning of a below.
arrest plainly does not include citation 
an inquiry into the ordinary,contemporary,common meaning of the word arrest should begin and end with recognition of the way that a thousand ordinary citizens without law degrees would answer the question of whether they had been arrested,if they had been stopped,briefly detained,issued a citation for a traffic or driving offense,and sent on their way.i posit that virtually all would unequivocally answer no.indeed,i am confident that virtually all would believe that the term arrest includes either being told you are under arrest or being physically taken to jail,or both.that is the plain meaning of the term arrest in the united states.
more than two decades ago,the supreme court described the ordinary expectations of a motorist who receives a citation,as follows 
d etention of a motorist pursuant to a traffic stop is presumptively temporary and brief.the vast majority of roadside detentions last only a few minutes.a motorist expectations,when he sees a policeman light flashing behind him,are that he will be obliged to spend a short period of time answering questions and waiting while the officer checks his license and registration,that he may then be given a citation,but that in the end he most likely will be allowed to continue on his way.
berkemer mccarty,footnote omitted.the supreme court then observed,
state laws governing when a motorist detained pursuant to a traffic stop may or must be issued a citation instead of taken into custody vary significantly,but no state requires that a detained motorist be arrested unless he is accused of a specified serious crime,refuses to promise to appear in court,or demands to be taken before a magistrate.
berkemer,at emphasis added.the supreme court in berkemer recognized,as any ordinary citizen would,that being arrested required something more than simply receiving a citation.even if the use of a citation in lieu of arrest has been expanded to encompass more serious offenses since berkemer,release on a promise to appear still reinforces the citation recipient reasonable belief that he or she has not been arrested.
in knowles iowa,the court pointed out,in the first sentence of the opinion,that a n iowa police officer stopped petitioner knowles for speeding,but issued him a citation rather than arresting him.knowles,at emphasis added.the court then observed that a routine traffic stop,for which a citation was issued,was deemed to be a relatively brief encounter and more analogous to a terry stop than to a formal arrest.knowles,at citing berkemer,at.again,the supreme court perceived immediately the difference betien being arrested and receiving a citation.it would be odd for a unanimous supreme court to distinguish so readily between arrest and citation for fourth amendment purposes,but not to do so for purposes of the sentencing guidelines.
this court has also recognized the difference between an arrest and a citation in the perceptions of persons stopped for a traffic or driving offense.in karam city of burbank,cir,this court held that an individual who was charged with a misdemeanor and,in lieu of jail,was allowed to sign an agreement to appear in court and ordered not to leave the state of california without first obtaining court permission,was not seized for fourth amendment purposes.this court reasoned,t hese requirements are no more burdensome than the promise to appear that a motorist makes when issued a traffic citation.id.at.also,somewhat recently,this court held that detention does not become an arrest until a defendant is moved to a locked detention cell.united states bravo,cir being handcuffed and walked to yards to a security office did not turn a detention into an arrest,when the individual was told the handcuffs would be removed when he reached the security office.
the sentencing commission would have been aware of the use of citations in lieu of arrest when a was drafted.as early as,the american bar association aba suggested standards for the pretrial use of the citation procedure,stating,it should be the policy of every law enforcement agency to issue citations in lieu of arrest or continued custody to the maximum extent consistent with the effective enforcement of the law.aba,project on standards for criminal justice,standards relating to pretrial release.in,debra whitcomb published her study for the national institute of justice,finding that the field citation was the speediest arrest alternative for street police officers.debra whitcomb,bonnie lewin margaret levine,citation release,national institute of justice.if the sentencing commission had meant to treat intervening citations the same way that it treated intervening arrests,for purposes of counting multiple sentences,it could simply have said intervening arrests or citations.our task here is to apply the text,not to improve upon it.harbison bell.a decision to use one word over another is material and is a decision that is imbued with legal significance and should not be presumed to be random or devoid of meaning.united states gonzales,cir.reading arrest as not including citations gives effect to the language actually used by the sentencing commission.
again,the united states supreme court has reiterated that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.when the statutory language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.carr.at see also fogerty fantasy,when the text of the statute is clear,our interpretive inquiry ends.treadwell,at if the text of a guideline is unambiguous,its plain meaning controls.united states king,cir unless the plain meaning leads to an absurd or unreasonable result,our judicial inquiry is at an end.i can not find any way in which interpreting the word arrest to exclude citations renders the applicable guideline section absurd or unreasonable.it is our task not to enter the minds of the sentencing commission who need have nothing in mind in order for their votes to be both lawful and rather to give fair and reasonable meaning to the text of the sentencing guidelines pennsylvania union gas,judge scalia,concurring.in justice jackson words,a court should engage in analysis of the guidelines and not be tempted to engage in psychoanalysis of congress or the sentencing commission.united states public utilities commission of cal,jackson,concurring.because it is not a court task to psychoanalyze the sentencing commission,and i find that the plain meaning that i would attribute to the guideline in question does not lead to an absurd result i conclude that arrest within the meaning of a unambiguously does not include citation.morever,i find that this reading of arrest comports with the purpose of a,as explained below.
c.the purpose of a 
interpreting the term arrest as not including citation provides the most continuity between both the purpose of the specific guideline section at issue here,and the overall purpose and structure of the whole guidelines scheme.see united states.lewis,cir particular phrases must be construed in light of the overall purpose and structure of the whole statutory scheme.see also bailey,at t he structure and purpose of a statute may also provide guidance in determining the plain meaning of its provisions.t he purpose of is to reflect the seriousness of a defendant criminal history,while,at the same time,avoiding overstat ing the seriousness of the defendant criminal conduct.united states,cir.the purpose of the guidelines sections addressing a defendant criminal history,generally,is to address the likelihood of recidivism,taking into account the notion that r epeated criminal behavior is an indicator of a limited likelihood of successful rehabilitation.chapter four,part a,introductory commentary.
interpreting the term arrest to exclude a citation comports with the purpose of avoiding overstat ement of the seriousness of the defendant criminal conduct,at.an individual who is taken into custody pursuant to the traditional meaning of arrest,who then subsequently commits another offense,could arguably be said to be likely to in the future regardless of the discomfort of a custodial arrest.the united states supreme court has noted,however,that a traffic stop involves a temporary and relatively nonthreatening detention.maryland shatzer,holding that a miranda warning is not necessary in such a situation.a pattern of receiving citations for minor offenses,thus,may not indicate that there is an increased probability that an individual will commit serious crimes in the future.
interpreting the word arrest as not including citation is also consistent with the scheme of computing criminal history,as demonstrated by application note to the commentary to this section.note specifically recognizes that c ounting multiple prior sentences as a single sentence may result in a criminal history score that the seriousness of the defendant criminal history and the danger that the defendant presents to the public.in such a case,an upward departure may be warranted.if a court determines,that a defendant criminal history is underrepresented,after counting prior sentences as a single sentence rather than separate sentences on the basis that a citation was not an intervening arrest,the court can make an appropriate adjustment.
further,t he sentencing commission has a mandate to establish sentencing practices that impose punishments which are just in relation to the social costs a convict has imposed on society.see united states zakhor,cir i reflects society costs of punishment by requiring the convict to reimburse the federal government for the cost of his own incarceration or supervisory detention.given that there is little cost to society associated with a traffic stop and issuance of a citation,it would arguably be unjust to conclude that citations for traffic stops are intervening arrests which justify the imposition of additional criminal history points.in light of the purpose of a,my reading of arrest as not including citation is not absurd.
d.a split does not create ambiguity 
finally,the mere fact that i disagree with the court in morgan about the meaning of arrest in a does not mean that the term is ambiguous.language in a statute or a guideline does not automatically become ambiguous every time two courts disagree as to its meaning.for example,the supreme court in carr determined the plain meaning of travels in the sex offender registration and notification act,even though there was a division among the circuit courts of appeals as to the meaning of the term.see carr.at.thus,a split in the circuits on the plain meaning of arrest does not mean that the guideline can not simply be enforced according to its terms.see id.at where a statute is plain and unambiguous,the court must enforce it according to its terms.
therefore,i would hold that the plain and ordinary meaning of arrest in a is that an arrest does not include being given a citation.
iv.potential ambiguity 
although i would interpret the word arrest based on its plain and ordinary meaning,as unambiguously not including citation,i,nevertheless,recognize that arrest is a word frequently used by courts,practitioners,and legal scholars in various contexts.indeed,arrest has a chameleon quality in legal usage,depending upon its context.compare kucana holder,the word under is chameleon it has many dictionary definitions and must draw its meaning from its context.although i now explore how arrest has evolved away from its common,plain,ordinary meaning as understood by the average person,even this alternative analysis of the potential ambiguity of the word leads to the conclusion that arrest in a does not include a citation,because the policies and purposes of the guidelines support a finding that arrest does not include citations.
arrest in other contexts 
the following discussion of the word arrest,as used in a legal sense,illustrates that the word has become a chameleon,frequently defined by the context in which it is used.for example,much of the search and seizure jurisprudence is concerned with officer safety and the protection of evidence with arrest interpreted accordingly.see knowles,at observing,the threat to officer safety from issuing a traffic citation,however,is a good deal less than in the case of a custodial arrest,and refusing to extend the search incident to arrest exception to allow searches incident to a citation.in miranda cases,the definition of arrest is influenced by whether or not the action of the law enforcement authorities is sufficient to lead to the threat of coerced statements.see berkemer mccarty,at two features of an ordinary traffic stop mitigate the danger that a person questioned will be induced to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.a few other contexts deserve somewhat more detailed discussion.
dictionary definitions 
d ictionary definitions are cognizable as tools for determining the ordinary meaning of words used in a statute.united states,cir.dictionary definitions of arrest,however,do not lead to one clear meaning of arrest for purposes of interpretation of the sentencing guideline in question.while many dictionary definitions include the taking of an individual into custody,see black law dictionary,ed.arrest means a seizure or forcible restraint or the taking or keeping of a person in custody by legal authority,especially in response to a criminal charge.webster new world law dictionary an arrest is t he intentional deprivation,whether actual or constructive,of a person freedom by legal authorities using forcible restraint,seizure,or otherwise taking the individual into custody,especially in response to a warrant or a suspicion based on probable cause that the person being arrested has committed a crime.the random house dictionary of the english language,arrest is defined as to seize a person by legal authority or warrant take into custody,others do not.see john bouvier,a law dictionary an arrest has been defined as the apprehending or detaining of the person,in order to be forthcoming to answer an alleged or suspected crime.dictionary of american history an arrest occurs when a public officer acting under legal authority detains an individual to answer for a criminal offense.dictionary of law,arrest is the restraining and seizure of a person whether or not by physical force by someone acting under authority in connection with a crime in such a manner that it is reasonable under the circumstances for the person to believe that he or she is not free to leave.these various sources demonstrate that,while most definitions of arrest require restraint,seizure,or detention,not all specify that custody is required,and most are silent as to how lengthy the period of restraint,seizure,or detention must be in order to constitute an arrest.
common law definitions 
there is some support in english common law for the view that arrest includes custody.a constable,having reasonable cause to suspect a person has committed a felony may detain such person until he can be brought before a justice of the peace to have his conduct investigated.horace wilgus,arrest without a warrant,quoting beckwith philby,eng.repr.however,common law commentators have reached divergent conclusions with respect to the definition of an arrest under english common law.see atwater city of lago vista.
neither has traditional american common law developed a consistent definition of the term arrest.the state of maryland,as one of the original colonies,and the first of the colonies to be a proprietary government the proprietor and the freemen are allowed to make laws independent of england.see henry william elson,history of the united states of america chapter iv,the macmillan company,new york,provides a particularly instructive example of the imprecision of a common law definition of arrest.see thomas clancy,what constitutes an arrest within the meaning of the fourth amendment,vill,fn.maryland courts have defined arrest in a variety of ways determined by the context in which the term was used.see little state,concluding that brief stop at sobriety checkpoint was not arrest morton state,arrest occurred when there was manual seizure of suspect and subsequent restraint on his liberty bouldin state,citing several formulations of common law definition of arrest.maryland common law is but one example of a body of american common law that has not developed one consistent definition for arrest.
state statutory definitions 
h ow a state characterizes its own offenses and sentences generally is not relevant to a federal sentence calculation.united states,cir.for example,t his court has ruled that in deciding whether a prior state conviction should be counted for purposes of a federal criminal history calculation,a district court must examine federal law.id.however,a review
