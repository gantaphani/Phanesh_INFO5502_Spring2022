petitioner kar onn lee,a malaysian citizen who has overstayed his nonimmigrant visa in the united states,seeks an adjustment of immigration status.generally,applicants such as lee,who are present in the united states unlawfully,are not eligible for a change of immigration status.see c lee,however,has invoked the grandfathering exception for beneficiaries of applications filed by april.see id.i b ii the attorney general has interpreted that provision as applying only to beneficiaries actually listed on applications as of april,not individuals who were later substituted as beneficiaries.see j an alien who was substituted for the previous beneficiary of the application for the labor certification after april,will not be considered to be a grandfathered alien.id.j same.we hold that j and j are entitled to deference under chevron natural resources defense council,chevron.accordingly,the immigration judge and board of immigration appeals properly determined that lee is ineligible for a change of immigration status because he was not listed as a beneficiary on an application for labor certification until after april.
background 
kar onn lee entered the united states legally as a nonimmigrant visitor in.in march,lee assisted by counsel,as he has been throughout these proceedings filed an application with the united states citizenship and immigration services uscis for an adjustment of immigration status,seeking permanent resident status.he updated that application after uscis approved in july an immigrant petition for alien worker filed by penang malaysian cuisine listing lee as the beneficiary for a malaysian chef position.penang malaysian cuisine had originally filed the application for labor certification in january,listing ji fa cao as the beneficiary.in february,the restaurant replaced cao with lee as the beneficiary for the chef position.
uscis denied lee application for adjustment of status in august,determining that he was ineligible for permanent resident status on the basis of penang malaysian cuisine labor certification lee then filed a motion to reopen and reconsider,which the uscis denied in february.
in july,the uscis initiated removal proceedings because lee had overstayed his visitor visa.in proceedings before an immigration judge ij,lee conceded his removability but renewed his application for an adjustment of status.lee argued that he was a grandfathered alien within the meaning of i,see note,ante,because he was listed as the current beneficiary of an application for labor certification filed prior to april.federal law provides that an immigrant who is unlawfully present in the united states may nonetheless qualify for a change of immigration status as a grandfathered alien if he is the beneficiary of an application for a labor certification that was filed pursuant to the regulations of the secretary of labor on or before april.i b ii see also butt gonzales,cir describing the general structure of i.the government opposed lee adjustment,citing a regulation promulgated by the attorney general stating that a n alien who was substituted for the previous beneficiary of the application for the labor certification after april,will not be considered to be a grandfathered alien.j.
in april,the ij issued an oral decision denying lee adjustment application,but granting him the opportunity to voluntarily depart pursuant to a.joint app x.the ij concluded that lee is not grandfathered because,under j,he did not become a beneficiary of the relevant application until after april.id.at.the ij reasoned that lee was therefore ineligible for a change of status under i b ii.id.
lee appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia,arguing that congress intended to include substituted beneficiaries in the class of aliens eligible for an adjustment of status under i b ii.the bia rejected lee arguments,stating that it was bound by the implementing regulations that correspond to the relevant portions of the statute.joint app x.
lee then filed this petition for review pursuant to b.he asserts that the ij and bia erred by affording chevron deference to the attorney general interpretation of the grandfathering provision in i b ii.in particular,lee argues that the secretary of labor not the attorney general is charged with interpreting the grandfathering provision that the grandfathering provision unambiguously provides that lee is a grandfathered beneficiary and that the attorney general interpretation of the grandfathering provision is unreasonable.
discussion 
unlawful residence in the united states generally renders an immigrant ineligible for an adjustment of status.see c,note,ante.congress has created a limited exception,however,for an alien who is the beneficiary of an application for a labor certification under section a a of this title that was filed pursuant to the regulations of the secretary of labor on or before april.id.i b ii see also suisa holder,cir providing a brief history of i.
the question presented in this appeal is whether i b ii applies when an alien was substituted as a beneficiary after april,on an application for labor certification filed before april.the attorney general has already answered this question an alien who was substituted for the previous beneficiary of an application for labor certification after april,will not be considered to be a grandfathered alien.j emphasis supplied id.j.accordingly,if this interpretation warrants deference,we need proceed no further.
prior to the creation of the department of homeland security in,the supreme court held that federal courts are required to afford deference to the attorney general interpretation of the immigration and nationality act ina using the familiar principles articulated in chevron 
it is clear that principles of chevron deference are applicable to this statutory scheme.the ina provides that t he attorney general shall be charged with the administration and enforcement of the statute and that the determination and ruling by the attorney general with respect to all questions of law shall be controlling.a,supp.iii.
ins aguirre aguirre.in,congress amended a to provide that t he secretary of homeland security shall be charged with the administration and enforcement of this chapter and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens,provided,however,that determination and ruling by the attorney general with respect to all questions of law shall be controlling.homeland security act of,stat,as amended by,a,stat,codified at a emphasis in original.the supreme court has since reiterated that chevron deference applies to the attorney general interpretations of the ina.see negusie holder,lopez davis,even if a statutory scheme requires individualized determinations,the decisionmaker has the authority to rely on rulemaking to resolve certain issues of general applicability unless congress clearly expresses an intent to withhold that authority.quotation marks and alterations omitted.
pursuant to his authority to enforce and interpret the ina,the attorney general on march,promulgated an interim rule stating that a n alien who was substituted for the previous beneficiary of an application for labor certification after april,will not be considered to be a grandfathered alien,effective.this regulation was codified at j.id.at.following the passage of the homeland security act of,which reorganized the enforcement of immigration law,the attorney general promulgated a final rule that,as relevant here,duplicated the text of and codified that regulation at.see,effective.
nonetheless,lee contends that the chevron test does not apply to j and j because the responsibility of determining who is a permissible beneficiary of a labor certification falls within the purview of the secretary of the department of labor dol not the attorney general.see bowen georgetown,it is axiomatic that an administrative agency power to promulgate legislative regulations is limited to the authority delegated by congress.lee points to a regulation promulgated by dol which states that s ubstitution of an alien beneficiary on any application for permanent labor certification is prohibited for any req
