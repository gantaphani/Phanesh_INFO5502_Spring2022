henry,a native and citizen of colombia,brings this petition for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming,without opinion,the decision of the immigration judge ij denying his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture.in this appeal,arising out of the drug wars of colombia,we decide that although the petitioner satisfies the requirement of persecution by the insurrectionist terrorists,his claim for asylum and withholding of removal can not succeed because he has failed to establish a nexus between that persecution and a statutory ground for relief.further,the petitioner claim for relief under the convention against torture likewise fails as there has been insufficient state action as required to demonstrate torture under the convention.consequently,we deny the petition for review.
henry served in the colombian air force,providing mechanical support for helicopters.after leaving the air force,was employed as a helicopter mechanic by dyncorp aerospace as a part of a program of united states assistance to colombian law enforcement in bogota,colombia.as a part of his duties,provided mechanical support for helicopters operated by the colombian national police cnp in their various law enforcement activities.was occasionally required to ride with the cnp on helicopter missions to perform repairs.although a civilian,was required to wear a cnp uniform during these trips.
in july,accompanied the cnp on a helicopter mission into a remote village to recover the bodies of five cnp officers killed by the colombian guerrilla group fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de colombia the revolutionary armed forces of columbia known as farc after landing in the village noticed three men suspiciously filming the cnp crew with two cameras.alerted the cnp who were able to capture one of the men,a farc member.the prisoner turned to and shouted,we know who you are,and,you will suffer retaliation.the other men,presumably farc members,disappeared into the jungle.
approximately one month after the july incident began to receive threatening calls,specifically mentioning the jungle mission.these calls were received on personal cell phone.in time,the actors located,identified his family,and began calling the home threatening both and his family.fearing for his life and the lives of his family members,sought police protection from the cnp,but was informed that the cnp lacked the resources to provide individual security to families.moved his family to another house.however,within weeks the threats of harm resumed.this time,in addition to threatening calls,received demands for money,death threats to her husband,and threats to kidnap her two sons and train them to fight for farc.the actors identified themselves as farc members.removed his sons from school and kept them inside his home as much as possible.
in january,a bicycle bomb exploded in the new neighborhood,killing five none of the victims were members of family.after this incident which felt was aimed at his family,sent his wife and children to miami,florida on visas obtained prior to the farc threats.although he visited his family once in the united states,remained in colombia to work and lived on a military base for protection.although unhappy with the separation,testified that housing on the military base was not available for his entire family.
although the record is not clear on the exact dates,at some point between the time his family went to the united states in march and late summer,learned that farc had tracked down and murdered other participants or the family members of participants in the june cnp mission.believing his life to be in danger,entered the united states on a visitor visa on july.a few weeks after his departure,a vandal broke into the home and spray painted the words sapa regaldo which translated means snitch and the letters farc.
in addition to evidence of the acts aimed directly at him,introduced nearly pages of official reports detailing the brutality of farc in colombia specifically,the reports speak of farc brutality,vandalism,and continued practices of killing,attacking,and threatening police and military personnel,their families,and those who cooperate with them.the state department reports identify a campaign farc refers to as plan pistola,which the state department classifies as a deliberate strategy to kidnap,torture,and kill soldiers,police,and their families.the evidence outlines farc use of wiretapping,monitoring bank accounts,and surveillance of specific individuals to identify and target persons cooperating with the police or military.specific instances of violence including the use of gas explosives in cars,bikes,and canisters appear throughout these reports.
in addition to these acts of violence,the evidence in the record continually speaks of farc forcible recruiting of children as young as twelve years old into their guerilla forces.once captured or recruited these children become essentially the slaves of their commanders,and are subject to extreme physical and sexual abuse.the state department report for mentions that in one year alone it was estimated that farc kidnapped or forcibly recruited as many as minors into their ranks.the report goes on to note that many families have reported having to move repeatedly,withdraw their children from school,leave their community in order to flee farc attempts to take their children.these and other details provided in the reports in the record corroborate the incidents reported by and his family and paint a grim picture of the situation in colombia.additionally the reports mention exactly what and his family experienced inadequate government action and resources to combat paramilitary activity and provide security.
although his visa expired,remained in the united states,and in june he applied for asylum.on august,was charged with overstaying his visa and ordered to appear.sought relief through the three primary avenues of relief available asylum under b withholding of removal under b and the united nations convention against torture which prevents removal to a country where the alien would face torture.the ij denied all relief and the bia affirmed without opinion.we will review each request for relief.
because the bia affirmed the ij without opinion,we treat the ij decision as the final agency determination for purposes of review.see zhang gonzales,cir.administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless a petitioner can show that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.see b b.we have held that this standard essentially codifies the substantial evidence standard established by the supreme court in ins,d.see zhang,at.as such w e use the substantial evidence standard to review the ij factual conclusion that the alien was not eligible for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.id.
asylum is discretionary relief available where a person is unwilling to return to their home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution and the applicant has demonstrated that race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.see a and b.although finding credible and accepting his account of the facts the ij discarded all evidence of persecution the ij noted that never claimed that he nor any member of his family were ever beaten,shot at,kidnaped,or otherwise physically harmed and more significantly that had voluntarily returned to colombia for economic reasons after visiting his family in the united states.consequently,the ij noted that was ineligible for asylum as he had failed to demonstrate past persecution,or a fear of future persecution.reviewing these findings under the substantial evidence standard,we find that the evidence compels a finding to the contrary.
was recognized and confronted in the jungle by a farc member who threatened retaliation for actions.he,and other members of the cnp crew,were photographed by farc members while assisting in a cnp mission.within a short amount o
