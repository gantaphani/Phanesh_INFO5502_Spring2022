petitioners jorge alberto alvarado and irma yolanda cardoza,husband and wife,left their rural guatemalan village and entered the united states illegally through the arizona desert in the mid.they petition for review of the board of immigration appeals bia decision upholding an immigration judge ij denial of their application for cancellation of removal.after careful consideration,we deny their petition in part and otherwise dismiss it for want of jurisdiction.
background 
alvarado and cardoza have lived and worked in rhode island and massachusetts for over fifteen years.they have two sons jorge,born in guatemala in,and brian,born in the united states in.in,the couple applied for asylum,which alerted immigration authorities to their presence.their application was denied,and removal proceedings began shortly thereafter.
in a hearing before an ij,alvarado and cardoza conceded removability but sought cancellation of removal based on the hardship that their departure would cause for their son brian.to be eligible for cancellation of removal,petitioners must show,among other things,that their removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative,such as an child.b d.petitioners testified that brian,who was twelve years old on the day of the hearing,would accompany them to guatemala if they were ordered removed.having been born in the united states and never having visited guatemala,brian,they explained,would face several formidable obstacles in guatemala.
first,as a gifted student,brian would not be able to reach his full potential in guatemala because of the lack of educational opportunities available there.sallie pisaturo,a certified school psychologist with a master degree in mental health counseling,testified on petitioners behalf.after conducting a evaluation of brian,speaking with his parents,and contacting his school,pisaturo concluded that,in terms of academic skill,brian was one grade level or higher than his peers and possessed superior intellectual ability.pisaturo had never been to guatemala,but she had read widely about the guatemalan school system.based on her research,she was concerned that brian would not receive an appropriate education in guatemala due to the lack of quality teachers and enrichment programs for students,particularly in rural regions.she testified that brian needs are as specialized as those of a child with a learning disability or a developmental disorder because he is gifted.she warned that brian could become discouraged and develop behavioral problems if not placed in a program that offers the stimulation he requires.
second,although brian tested very well in some areas,pisaturo found that brian has weaknesses with getting overloaded easily and has some memory difficulties.brian parents worry that he is suffering from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,though it is unclear whether he has ever been diagnosed.they claim his deficiencies require specialized educational interventions that are widely available in the united states but not in guatemala.
third,brian inability to read,write,or fluently speak spanish would further hinder his ability to receive an education in guatemala.although brian parents speak spanish at home,brian resists speaking spanish and has been educated entirely in english.brian poor spanish skills would make it difficult for him to succeed in school,socialize with his peers,and find a good job in guatemala.
fourth,if the family returned to joyabaj,guatemala,the rural area where petitioners were born,brian and his family would have to overcome steep practical hurdles.for example,brian would have to travel at least an hour by bus to reach the nearest school.besides,alvarado testified,he could never afford to pay brian tuition and bus fare with his income as a farmer in guatemala.
finally,and worst of all,alvarado said,he would fear for brian safety in guatemala,where kidnappings,gangs,and violent crime are rampant,especially because brian lacks street smarts and does not speak the language.
taking all this into consideration,the ij nevertheless found that petitioners had not established that brian would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if his parents were removed to guatemala.she acknowledged pisaturo testimony that brian was gifted and might not have access to as good an education in guatemala as he would in the united states.however,she said,simply because brian could receive a higher level of education in the united states did not mean that he had the right to expect a comparable level of education in guatemala.moreover,petitioners had not shown that an appropriate education did not exist for brian in guatemala rather,brian family might have to send him to school far away from their rural village or pay private school tuition to obtain the education to his needs.the fact that a education might be more difficult or more expensive to get in guatemala than in the united states did not trigger exceptional and extremely unusual hardship for brian.
as to the other roadblocks cited by petitioners,the ij concluded that b asically,there is absolutely nothing else,other than the normal difficulties that individual s have to go through when relocating to another country,to base this exceptional and extremely unusual hardship upon.accordingly,she found that brian parents had failed to meet the hardship eligibility requirement for cancellation of removal.she therefore denied their application and ordered them removed to guatemala.
on appeal,the bia dismissed the couple petition for relief because it discerned no clear error in the ij factual findings and agreed with the ij legal and discretionary determinations.hoping to reverse this trend,alvarado and cardoza ask us to review the bia decision.
ii.discussion 
petitioners say the bia committed legal error when it affirmed the ij denial of their application for cancellation of removal.the government counters that we lack jurisdiction to evaluate petitioners claim.
we begin our discussion with a basic overview of the relief petitioners seek.cancellation of removal is a form of discretionary relief which,if granted,permits an otherwise removable alien to remain in the united states.ayeni holder,cir.it is available only if an alien a has resided in the united states for a continuous period of at least ten years immediately preceding his application b has been a person of good moral character during that period c has not been convicted of certain enumerated offenses and d has established that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying family member,such as an child.id.citing b toribio chavez holder,cir.
the first three requirements are not at issue here accordingly,we proceed to the fourth prong whether petitioners have shown that their son brian is likely to suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if his parents are removed to guatemala.see b d.
this is a high bar to clear.it requires petitioners to demonstrate that brian would suffer hardship that is substantially different from,or beyond,that which would normally be expected from the deportation of a close relative,though it need not be unconscionable.see matter of monreal aguinaga,bia see also matter of gonzalez recinas,bia.
statutes narrowly circumscribe our review on this point.courts generally lack jurisdiction to review a judgment concerning discretionary relief sought under the cancellation of removal provision.a b i see ayeni,at toribio chavez,at.constitutional claims and questions of law,however,are excepted from this prohibition.a d see ayeni,at toribio chavez,at.thus,we have jurisdiction to consider this petition only if it raises a question of constitutional or legal dimension.see ayeni,at.
the presence of a constitutional or legal question is a matter of substance,not a function of labeling.id.at.styling a factual claim as constitutional or legal error will not transform an unreviewable issue of fact into a reviewable issue of law.id.at pan gonzales,cir.rather,only a colorable claim of constitutional or legal error,a constitutional or legal argument that is at least potentially v
