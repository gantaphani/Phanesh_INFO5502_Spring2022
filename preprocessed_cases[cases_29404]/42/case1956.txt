ricardo appeals his conviction and sentence,arguing that under the supreme court recent decision in alabama shelton,d,his prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction for illegal entry under a,for which he received a probated sentence,violated his sixth amendment right to counsel and therefore can not form the predicate for the instant felony conviction for illegal entry under a.we affirm.
factual and procedural history 
a.the first offense 
on may,ricardo illegally entered the united states he was arrested the next day.on may,he was charged in federal district court in laredo with a misdemeanor offense of illegal entry in violation of a is a mexican citizen with no legal status in the united states who has entered the united states illegally approximately fifteen times he appeared pro se,entered a plea of guilty,and was sentenced to a term of unsupervised probation and a special assessment.the immigration and naturalization service then allowed to voluntarily return to mexico.
b.the second offense 
less than two weeks later,on may,crossed the rio grande river and again illegally entered the united states.he was arrested by border patrol agents in three rivers,texas,on may.
on june,was indicted in federal district court in corpus christi on one felony count of illegal entry in violation of a and two counts of transporting illegal aliens in violation of a a ii and a b ii.because of this second offense,the magistrate judge who sentenced in the first case began proceedings to revoke probation.the district court in this case sought and received transfer of the probation revocation proceedings to it in order to consolidate the revocation and the sentencing on the second offense.
as part of a plea agreement,agreed to plead guilty to the illegal entry count in exchange for the united states agreement to recommend the maximum credit for acceptance of responsibility and to dismiss the other two counts.the district court accepted guilty plea and considered the appropriate sentence.the district court sentenced for the charged felony illegal entry offense,rather than a misdemeanor offense,because he had previously been convicted of illegal entry.the presentence report psr recommended be sentenced with an offense level of this reflected a base offense level of for a repeat violation of a with two levels subtracted for acceptance of responsibility.see sentencing guidelines manual.the psr also added three points for criminal history one for prior illegal entry conviction and two because he was on probation for that offense when he committed the instant offense.see id.these three criminal history points put in a criminal history category of ii.
objected to the use of his prior uncounseled misdemeanor to enhance his sentence,arguing that under alabama shelton,d,the misdemeanor conviction was obtained in violation of his sixth amendment right to counsel.specifically,objected to the use of his prior conviction to both enhance his offense from misdemeanor illegal entry for which the maximum sentence is six months to felony illegal entry for which the maximum sentence is two years under a and add three criminal history points to place him in a criminal history category of ii under the sentencing guidelines.
the district court agreed with,finding that shelton bars the use of his prior uncounseled misdemeanor because received probation in that case therefore,the district court relieved of the probation sentence in the first case and left only the special assessment the district court then determined that,having vacated the sentence of probation from the misdemeanor conviction,that conviction could permissibly be used to enhance the instant offense from a misdemeanor to a felony.alternatively,the district court held that a felony enhancement provision,which states that a prior commission of an illegal entry offense may be used to enhance a subsequent offense,does not require a conviction,so that even if previous conviction was invalid under shelton,his first offense may still be used to enhance his second offense.after holding that the previous conviction could be used to enhance the offense under a,the district court decided to use the prior conviction,but not the prior and now vacated sentence of probation,to determine criminal history category.the district court thus gave one criminal history point rather than three,but then departed upward to a criminal history category of iii under sentencing guidelines manual because had previously and repeatedly illegally entered the united states.the district court sentenced to eight months in prison,one year of supervised release,and a special assessment.the district court then entered an order dismissing the probation revocation proceedings because it had delet ed the term of probation.
appealed.he now argues that under alabama shelton,his prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction can not be used to enhance his offense from a misdemeanor to a felony and the district court erred in its alternative holding that a requires only commission of an offense and not a conviction.
ii.standard of review 
constitutional questions are reviewed by this court de novo,united states,cir.issues of statutory interpretation are also reviewed de novo,united states hanafy,cir.
iii.discussion 
whether prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction can be used to enhance his current illegal entry offense from a misdemeanor to a felony 
argues that his prior uncounseled misdemeanor can not be used to enhance the offense in this case from a misdemeanor to a felony.specifically,he reads the supreme court recent ruling in alabama shelton,holding that there is a sixth amendment right to counsel in misdemeanor cases where a suspended sentence is imposed,to require counsel or a valid waiver of counsel in misdemeanor cases where only probation is imposed.assuming that his prior conviction was unconstitutional,then,argues it can not be used to enhance his current offense from a misdemeanor to a felony even though the district court vacated the sentence of probation.
the united states argues that prior misdemeanor may be used to enhance his current offense because shelton applies to require counsel only when suspended sentences,and not when sentences of probation,are imposed.the united states argues that a defendant sentenced to probation does not have a sixth amendment right to counsel so long as he never receives a sentence of imprisonment.the united states further argues that even if shelton applies to require counsel before a defendant may be sentenced to imprisonment upon revocation of his probation,because the district court in this case vacated the sentence of probation for the first offense,could never be sentenced to prison for that offense.hence,his previous conviction may be used to enhance his sentence for the current offense.
the district court determined that shelton gave a sixth amendment right to counsel in his first case because he was sentenced to probation.the district court then vacated sentence of probation in the first case and held that the first conviction could permissibly be used to enhance the current offense from a misdemeanor to a felony under a.
the supreme court has explained that a defendant has a sixth amendment right to counsel in a misdemeanor case only under certain circumstances in argersinger hamlin,the supreme court held that absent a knowing and intelligent waiver,no person may be imprisoned for any offense,whether classified as petty,misdemeanor,or felony,unless he was represented by counsel at his trial,d emphasis added.in scott illinois,the court clarified that the right to counsel only applies where the defendant is actually sentenced to imprisonment and not merely where imprisonment is an authorized penalty see,d.in nichols united states,the court went one step further,explaining that an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction that was valid under scott because no term of imprisonment was imposed may be used to enhance the penalty for a subsequent offense.see,d.
