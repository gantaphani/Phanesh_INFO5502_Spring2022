in february,francisco rodriguez illegally entered the united states from mexico and attempted to join his son,carmen,also an illegal alien living in north carolina.initially,francisco was led across the texas border by mexican alien smugglers.once in texas,he was put into the hands of defendants for the journey to north carolina.ten days later,defendants were arrested in providence,rhode island,by immigration and naturalization service ins agents.in exchange for their truthful testimony at defendants trial,francisco and carmen were granted immunity from prosecution,given immigration papers,and allowed to work in this country during the pendency of the trial.
after many difficulties on the mexican side of the border,including carmen payment to a smuggler who left francisco stranded in a hotel room in mexico,francisco entered the united states.he hid for about hours,along with other aliens,before he was taken to a safe house run by luis martinez.martinez asked francisco for the name and number of the person paying for his trip to north carolina.martinez then contacted carmen,who wired for food and clothing for his father.
after two days,francisco and the others were taken to an apartment in houston,where he provided his contact information to another smuggler,uriel cortes gomez.gomez requested a balance of from carmen to take francisco to north carolina.gomez also stated the trip from houston to north carolina would cost an additional if paid or if paid upon delivery.not having the additional,carmen wired gomez and agreed to pay upon his father arrival in north carolina.
two days later,gomez took francisco to a big house operated by flash van tours where they ha d some vans outside.gomez told francisco he was all set and directed him to a room inside the house,where he joined about others.francisco had no money and only a small bag with a shirt and a pair of pants.
after about three hours,defendant called out the names of people,all from mexico,guatemala,or brazil,and ushered them into a van.he gave francisco a ticket which bore his name,but no price.francisco paid nothing for the ticket.assigned the passengers to their seats,four to a bench,directed them not to talk,and took his place in the driver seat.ten minutes later,they picked up defendant cavazos,who shared driving duties for the rest of the trip.
at their first stop in louisiana,and cavazos allowed a woman and her children,but no one else,to exit the van and use the bathroom.explained to the group that the men were not allowed to get out because louisiana was a little bit dangerous and people are somewhat racist and they could say something.at later stops,passengers were allowed bathroom breaks and given the opportunity to purchase food.
throughout the trip,defendants utilized a procedure for dropping passengers at their destinations.or cavazos would call ahead to a person and only those leaving permanently would exit the van at a specific location.to organize this process,defendants carried a passenger manifest,which listed each rider name,destination,contact telephone numbers,and balance owed.
as the van approached north carolina,called carmen,stating that if he had francisco fare,they would drop him off on route next to a mcdonald.carmen,however,told he only had,but asked to have his father dropped off anyway and promised to get the remaining by the weekend.refused,claiming many people had failed to pay them.carmen said he would try to get the extra money within a half hour and took down cell phone number.carmen was not able to obtain the money and again promised to raise money over the weekend.refused,stating they would keep francisco for the trip to boston if carmen had the money by the time they returned to north carolina,they would drop francisco off then.if not,they would return him to houston.
the trip continued.in virginia,and cavazos left the van and brought back hamburgers for the passengers.when they reached boston and dropped off a group of brazilians at a private home,everyone was invited in for dinner.meanwhile,in providence,ins agents received a tip that a group of illegal aliens was headed their way.
after the meal,francisco,two remaining passengers,and defendants headed toward rhode island.upon their arrival in providence on february,defendants were arrested.ins agents seized in cash from the defendants personal possession and a cell phone from.in the van,agents discovered the passenger manifest,an envelope with receipts for fuel,tolls,and food,and a rand mcnally atlas opened to a map of massachusetts.
