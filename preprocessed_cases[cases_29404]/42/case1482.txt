opinion of the court 
in this petition for review of the board of immigration appeal bia denial of kwasi amanfi application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture,we are primarily presented with the question whether the bia improperly deviated from its existing interpretation of the immigration and naturalization act ina definition of a refugee.amanfi,a native and citizen of ghana,was detained by immigration officials upon his arrival in the united states after he presented false travel documents.in testimony before the immigration judge,amanfi stated that he was persecuted by members of a cult and by the ghanian police on account of their view that he was a homosexual,even though amanfi did not identify himself as a homosexual and there was no independent evidence that he was.
the bia recognized the precedents establishing that homosexuals are a protected social group and supporting asylum claims on the basis of imputed political opinion,when the persecutor believes the applicant has a certain political opinion even though the applicant does not.however,the bia was unwilling to extend the concept underlying the theory of imputed political opinion that what matters is the beliefs of the persecutor rather than the persecuted to amanfi theory of imputed membership in a social group homosexuals because it deemed such an extension to be without legal precedent.
the ins maintained this position in its brief,but before oral argument it filed a motion to remand this case to the bia in light of a regulation proposed by the attorney general in december that supports amanfi theory of imputed membership in a social group.amanfi notes that in a letter opinion dated january,the ins general counsel adopted an interpretation of the ina supporting amanfi theory.he nonetheless argues that we should deny the ins motion and file a precedential opinion in this case because proposed regulations are not binding on the bia and the ins has never declared when it will promulgate this rule,indeed suggesting at oral argument that it may be quite a long time,perhaps years,before it does so.
while we might remand to the bia to consider this legal issue in the first instance,we decline to do so here.as we explained in johnson ashcroft,cir,an agency may change its policies,but it can not depart from its established precedents without explanation.in at least two decisions,the bia has held that p ersecution for imputed grounds can satisfy the refugee definition in the ina.in re,bia see also in re,bia.moreover,the attorney general,who is the ultimate authority on interpretations of the ina,ina a,a,explained that the proposed regulation cited by the ins in its motion was not designed to make new law but rather codifies the existing doctrine of imputed political opinion,as well as the existing administrative interpretation that this doctrine also extends to the protected grounds other than political opinion.because amanfi theory of persecution on account of his imputed membership in a social group is supported by these legal precedents,and the bia did not articulate a reason for deviating from them,we will grant the petition of review to that extent and deny the ins remand motion.we will,however,remand amanfi seriously contested asylum claim to the bia for consideration of its validity in deference to the bia expertise in analyzing the merits of asylum applications.
finally,we will deny amanfi petition for review of the bia dismissal of his claim for asylum on the ground of religious persecution,and also his application for protection under the convention against torture.the bia analyzed the evidence supporting these claims and found that amanfi did not satisfy his burden of proof.since we may decline to uphold the bia findings of fact only if the evidence compels us to do so,see ins,d,and amanfi has not identified evidence that would lead us to this conclusion,we will defer to the bia determination that amanfi does not qualify for asylum and withholding of removal on religious persecution grounds or under the convention against torture.
kwasi amanfi is a citizen of ghana who was detained by the ins at jfk airport in new york on december,when he attempted to transit through the united states to canada.he was in possession of a canadian passport in the name of ken oppong.when questioned about his identity by immigration officials,amanfi at first claimed he was a canadian citizen but later admitted his real identity and explained that he acquired the passport in ghana.that same day,the ins served amanfi with a notice to appear charging him with removability under ina a c i,a c i,as an alien who sought to obtain admission to the united states by fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact,and under ina a a i i,a a i i,as an alien seeking admission without a valid document.
in april,amanfi appeared before an immigration judge ij and filed,pro se,an application for asylum and withholding of removal under ina a and b,a and b,and for protection under article of the convention against torture.in an unsigned attachment to his application,amanfi stated that he was seeking asylum because of prior abuse by ghanian authorities on account of his imputed status as a homosexual and alleged torture by a cult that objected to his father preaching against human sacrifice.at a merits hearing where he was represented by counsel,amanfi articulated his justification for asylum in testimony summarized as follows.
amanfi was born in kumansi,ghana,and was a member of the ashanti ethnic group.he had a close relationship with his grandfather who was a chief of the ashanti and who explained to him the group traditional practices,including human sacrifice.according to what his grandfather told him,homosexuals and other individuals who committed sexual acts that were considered taboo would not be suitable for sacrifice.although amanfi grandfather and other relatives practiced ashanti traditions,his father was a teacher and minister of a christian group,as well as a television and radio preacher.amanfi also identified himself as a christian.he testified that his father received threats from macho men and the blood temple cult,which objected to his lectures against human sacrifice,and that his father was assaulted by these groups on at least one occasion.in august,amanfi father disappeared after he left for church and never returned.amanfi filed a police report but,despite repeated complaints,received little assistance from the ghanian authorities in the search for his father.
shortly thereafter,several men claiming to be police came to amanfi house,drove him to an isolated area,and locked him in a room.the men whom amanfi did not actually believe were police,but rather macho men who,according to the department of state country conditions report for ghana,are private security guards hired by individuals to settle disputes told him that his father had been killed because of his preaching.the macho men threatened amanfi with the same.he testified that the room in which he was kept contained a fetish,or idol,that was covered with blood,which he suspected was from his father.his captors brought him food and wine,which amanfi claimed meant they were preparing him for sacrifice.he based this assumption on teachings from his grandfather about the purification process that occurs before an individual may be sacrificed.
another person was brought into the room where amanfi was detained.amanfi informed this man,who was named kojo,that they could save themselves from being sacrificed if they engaged in homosexual behavior because,according to his grandfather,homosexuals were unacceptable for sacrifice.even though amanfi stated that he was not a homosexual,he engaged in a homosexual act with kojo and was discovered by his captors.several of the macho men took him and kojo outside and beat them before bringing them to the police station.at the station,the police informed the public that amanfi and kojo were homosexuals,and amanfi stated that a big crowd came to look at them because they were naked and he feared that he would be attacked.he explained that he knew from witnessing prior public torture of homosexuals that his life was endangered.
amanfi averred that the police beat him and kojo daily until kojo died when he fell and a policeman stepped on his testicles.after more than two months of such treatment in police custody,amanfi managed to escape when the station was largely empty due to the need for police coverage at polling places on an election day.he then hitchhiked to accra,the capital of ghana,where he sought refuge at his cousin home.the cousin refused to let amanfi stay at her home,however,because his reputation as a homosexual had drawn a lot of attention and she was concerned about retribution from local chieftains and her family.instead,amanfi stayed in a hotel.his cousin visited him until she received a correspondence from the police stating that they were looking for him.with her help,amanfi went to the airport where an individual amanfi called an immigration officer provided him with a canadian passport bearing the name ken oppong and placed him on a flight to jfk.amanfi explained that he only sought transit through the united states to canada in order to petition the canadian authorities for asylum.
the ij admitted a number of exhibits into the record,including the department of state country report on ghana and its profile of asylum claims for ghana the united kingdom country report on ghana a notarized document from a woman identifying herself as a cousin of amanfi the and reports from amnesty international and the report from human rights watch on conditions in ghana.following the hearing,the ij found amanfi subject to removal under ina a a i i,for seeking admission without a valid document,but dismissed the charge of fraud under ina a c i for lack of prosecution.
the ij also concluded that amanfi testimony was not credible.noting that amanfi had failed to present corroborating evidence of the practice of human sacrifice in ghana and had initially told a different story to ins officials,the ij concluded that amanfi was actually an illegal resident of canada and had fabricated his current testimony while in detention.for this reason,the ij denied amanfi petition for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture.
amanfi appealed to the bia,arguing that the ij erred in denying his application for withholding of removal and asylum,which was grounded on his fear of persecution as a homosexual if he were returned to ghana.the bia dismissed amanfi petition,reasoning that he could not meet his burden of proof under the ina that he had a fear of persecution in ghana on account of a protected ground.the bia concluded that amanfi treatment by the macho men who kidnaped him was based on a private dispute involving his father ministry.the bia also explained that amanfi can not qualify as a member of a particular social group as a homosexual,a protected social group according to matter of,bia,because he testified that he was not in fact a homosexual.since it determined that amanfi failed to meet his burden of proof for the asylum application,the bia specifically declined to address the ij adverse credibility determination.
amanfi filed a motion for reconsideration in which he raised several arguments first,that the dispute with the macho men was not merely personal because it concerned his and his father religious beliefs second,that the bia should have considered whether the macho men and the ghanian authorities persecuted him because they believed he was a homosexual,even if he was not actually a member of this social group and third,that his past persecution by ghanian authorities indicates that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured upon return to ghana,a requirement for protection under the convention against torture.the bia did not find these arguments persuasive and denied amanfi motion.with regards to the first and last arguments,the bia reiterated its conclusion that amanfi did not present sufficient evidence to qualify for asylum on account of religious persecution or protection under the convention against torture based on the supposed likelihood that he would be tortured if returned to ghana.
the bia also described as being without any legal precedent amanfi argument that his claims should be analyzed from the perspective of his imputed status as a homosexual rather than actual membership in this social group.while the bia acknowledged that some courts have recognized that an imputed political opinion can exist whatever the asylum seeker actual political opinion may be,it opined that these cases do not support a finding that imputed membership in a particular social group supports a grant of asylum relief.
amanfi filed petitions for review of both bia decisions,which were consolidated into this appeal.he also submitted an emergency motion for stay of his removal,which we denied.at oral argument,amanfi counsel stated that amanfi had been removed by the ins to ghana.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a to review final orders of removal our standard of review of the bia findings of facts is quite deferential.while we must ascertain whether the bia factual determinations are supported by substantial evidence,senathirajah ins,cir,only if the evidence compels otherwise may we decline to uphold these findings.ins,d.
ii.convention against torture 
article of the convention against torture,as implemented by ins regulations,prohibits removal of an alien to a country when the alien sustains his burden of proving that it is more likely than not that he will be subject to torture by,at the instigation of,or with the acquiescence of a public official.see c and a matter of,bia.a petition for protection under the convention against torture differs significantly from petitions for asylum or withholding of removal because the alien need not demonstrate that he will be tortured on account of a particular belief or immutable characteristic.matter of,supra.rather,in assessing whether an alien is more likely than not to be tortured in the proposed country of removal,ins regulations identify a list of factors to consider evidence of past torture inflicted on the alien the possibility the alien could relocate to another part of the country where his torture is unlikely evidence of gross,flagrant or mass violations of human rights in the country and any other relevant country conditions information.c.
amanfi contends that the bia erred when it denied his petition for protection under the convention against torture because it allegedly overlooked evidence supporting his claim.without specific citation,amanfi claims that the record shows that ghanian police have a history of inflicting human rights abuses upon individuals in its custody.he also argues that because he was tortured by the police while in their custody,there is a high probability that he would be tortured if returned to ghana.similarly,amanfi contends that the police would acquiesce in any further torture he experienced at the hands of the macho men.
the ins responds that the record does not present any compelling evidence that would undermine the bia finding that amanfi is not likely to be subject to torture should he be returned to ghana.it points to the country condition report compiled by the home office stating that there is religious toleration in ghana,a country whose population is approximately christian.the home office report also notes that while homosexuality is illegal in ghana,the law is not strictly enforced and homosexuality is generally tolerated.further,the reports compiled by the department of state,amnesty international,and human rights watch do not mention torture or mistreatment of homosexuals.while there is evidence in the country condition reports of police brutality and arbitrary detention,there is nothing supporting the claim that ghanaian authorities routinely commit gross,flagrant or mass violations of human rights,a factor militating in favor of protection under the convention against torture.c iii.
the ins further notes that although the bia did not affirm the ij determination that amanfi testimony was not credible,it also did not find any evidence corroborating his story.the ins properly contends that while evidence of past torture inflicted upon the applicant is a factor in determining whether an alien qualifies for protection under the convention against torture,c i,it is not,in and of itself,dispositive of such a claim.amanfi testimony about his past torture therefore can not compel the conclusion that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured again when removed to ghana.
finally,the ins emphasizes the state department explanation that the macho men are private actors not associated with the government of ghana.their actions alone,therefore,can not sustain a petition under the convention against torture.however,a claim is possible if it is more likely than not that a public official will acquiesce in torture by private actors.a.in order to establish that ghanian authorities would acquiesce in torture committed by the macho men,amanfi must prove that the officials would have awareness of this torture but thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to protect such activity.a.amanfi failed to present any evidence to sustain this burden of proof.
we essentially agree with the ins on this issue.because we do not find that the evidence in the record compels the conclusion that amanfi qualifies for protection under the convention against torture,we must deny his petition for review of this claim.
iii.asylum and withholding of removal 
the key element that must support a petition for asylum and withholding of removal is the existence or fear of persecution,committed by either private or state actors,on account of a belief or an immutable characteristic.to qualify for asylum,an alien must show persecution,or a well founded fear of persecution,on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.ina a a and a,a a and a,at.the standard for withholding of removal is slightly different.in order to successfully assert such a petition,an alien must show that if returned to his country,it is more likely than not that the alien life or freedom would be threatened on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.ina b,b ins,d 
amanfi contends that he was persecuted in ghana by the macho men on account of his religion and by both the macho men and the ghanian police because of his imputed status as a homosexual.the bia analyzed these claims separately.on the issue of religious persecution,the bia reviewed the evidence and concluded that amanfi had failed to present evidence suggesting that his treatment by the macho men was motivated by anything more than a personal dispute regarding his father ministry.as to the question of persecution on account of amanfi imputed status as a homosexual,the bia declined to analyze the facts supporting this claim because it determined that there was no legal precedent endorsing this theory of persecution.since we employ different standards of review of the bia findings of fact and interpretation of the ina,we too will address these claims separately.
claim of persecution on account of religion 
amanfi does not dispute the bia finding that his persecution at the hands of the macho men involved a personal dispute with his father ministry.he argues,however,that the bia should have analyzed his petition under the mixed motives framework articulated in in re,bia,which held that an alien need only prove that the persecutor was motivated in significant part by a protected characteristic.the bia recognized its precedent in in re,supra,but specifically stated that the mixed motive analysis was unsupported by the facts in this case because amanfi did not provide any evidence supporting his assertion that he has been persecuted on account of his own religion.
although religion was indeed part of his testimony,amanfi testified that he was persecuted because his father had spoken out against the practices of the macho men,including fetish worshiping and human sacrifice,not due to his own faith.thus,even though religion,or at least the beliefs of the macho men,was a circumstance in amanfi persecution,the record shows that it was retaliation against his father preaching and not amanfi or his father belief in christianity that was the motivating factor behind his persecution.the mention of religion in the fabric of the story is insufficient to establish a persecution claim because,as the supreme court noted in,the mere existence of a generalized motive underlying persecution can not establish the proposition that the alien fears persecution on account of that motive.at.the evidence does not establish that amanfi was persecuted,or has a fear of persecution,on account of his religious faith.
since we have a very deferential standard of review of the bia findings of fact and may only reverse these findings if the evidence compels us to do so,see id.at,we must affirm the bia conclusion that amanfi was not persecuted on account of his religion,but rather because of retaliation in response to a personal dispute involving his father.it is not claimed that this is a ground for asylum and withholding of removal.
claim of persecution on account of imputed status as a homosexual 
did the bia depart from the ins interpretation of the ina 
amanfi contends that his persecution by the macho men and the ghanian police on account of their belief that he was homosexual,even though he is not homosexual,qualifies as persecution on account of membership in a social group within the meaning of ina a a and b.noting that the bia and several courts of appeals have held that an alien may qualify for asylum because of imputed political opinion,amanfi argues that a similar interpretation of the ina should apply for imputed membership in a social group.the bia summarily dismissed amanfi argument,stating that while homosexuals are a protected social group,see matter of,supra,there is no legal precedent supporting the doctrine that asylum may be granted because of imputed membership in a social group.
the ins maintained this position in its brief.however,before oral argument,it moved to remand the case to the bia because of the pendency of a proposed regulation that addressed this issue and adopted amanfi view.the proposed regulation,which has not yet been promulgated,states in relevant part 
an asylum applicant must establish that the persecutor acted,or that there is a reasonable possibility that the persecutor would act,against the applicant on account of the applicant race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,or on account of what the persecutor perceives to be the applicant race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.
proposed rule b emphasis added.the ins argued that in light of this proposed rule,a remand is warranted because the adjudication of the instant case would be facilitated if the bia addressed how the policy expressed in the proposed regulation affects this case.
in response,amanfi agreed that the case should be remanded to the bia,but he also argued that we should issue a precedential opinion because a proposed rule is not binding on the bia the regulation was proposed more than two years ago and has not yet been promulgated the ins has not indicated when this promulgation would occur and this rule is reflective of an opinion letter issued by the ins general counsel office in,see ins general counsel opinion letter,genco op,wl,which is summarized in the margin 
when reviewing the bia interpretation of the ina,we must apply the principles of deference described in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.see ins,d.we have held that a lthough an agency can change or adapt its policies,it acts arbitrarily if it departs from its established precedents without announcing a principled reason for the departure.johnson ashcroft,cir quoting fertilizer inst.browner,cir.we further explained that if the ins departs from an announced rule without explanation or an avowed alteration,such action could be viewed as arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion.id.quoting ins yang,d.
