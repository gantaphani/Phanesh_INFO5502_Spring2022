during the search,was given his miranda warnings a second time and advised that he could tell the agents to stop at any time.allegedly told the agents that he would show them where the fraudulent documents were made.at the end of the search,signed a form and was transported to ins to be processed.later stated at the suppression hearing that he had not wanted to sign this form.
at ins,was processed by a different agent who spent twenty to minutes with him.was given a standard ins notice of rights form written in spanish that advised him of his right to legal representation and right to communicate with a consular officer of his country.initials appear on this notice of rights,next to a box that he checked,admitting that he was in the united states illegally and that he waived his right to a hearing before a judge.his signature also appears on a standard ins processing form.

ii.discussion 
this court reviews a district court interpretation of a treaty de novo.kreimerman casa veerkamp,cir.
the vienna convention is a,multilateral treaty negotiated in and ratified by the united states in.see united states,cir.mexico is a signatory nation.the treaty governs the establishment of consular relations,and defin es a consulate functions in a receiving nation.united states,d.asserts that article of the treaty bestows a private,right on foreign nationals to consult with consular officials.he argues that because this right was violated,his statements and tangible evidence should have been suppressed.these are issues of first impression for this circuit.see flores johnson,cir 
whether the vienna convention confers an enforceable individual right 
ratified treaties become the law of the land on an equal footing with federal statutes.const.art.vi,cl.they are to be construed initially according to their terms.united states,d.treaty construction is a particularly sensitive business because international agreements should be consistently interpreted among the signatories.treaties are contracts between or among independent nations.united states zabaneh,cir.as such,they do not generally create rights that are enforceable in the courts.united states li,cir see also goldstar united states,cir international treaties are not presumed to create rights that are privately enforceable henman,cir it is well established that individuals have no standing to challenge violations of international treaties in the absence of a protest by the sovereigns involved.
for enforcement of its provisions,a treaty depends on the interest and honor of the governments which are parties to it.head money cases.i nfraction becomes the subject of international negotiations and reclamations.id.it is obvious that with all this the judicial courts have nothing to do and can give no redress.see also united states williams,cir r ights under international common law must belong to sovereign nations,not to individuals,just as treaty rights are the rights of the sovereign.
against the backdrop of these general principles,the vienna convention appears to be a standard treaty whose purpose is to facilitate consular activity in receiving states.the preamble states 
believing that an international convention on consular relations,privileges and immunities would also contribute to the development of friendly relations among nations,irrespective of their differing constitutional and social systems,and realizing that the purpose of such privileges and immunities is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of functions by consular posts on behalf of their respective states emphasis added.
this language would appear to preclude any possibility that individuals may benefit from it when they travel abroad,even,perhaps,if they are among the consular corps.moreover,only one article out of in the treaty even arguably protects individual officials.article,titled communication and contact with nationals of receiving state,provides 
with a view to facilitating the exercise of consular functions relating to nationals of the sending state
