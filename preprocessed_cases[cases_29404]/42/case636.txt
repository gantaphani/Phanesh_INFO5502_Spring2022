cesar batista or cesar batista petitions for review of a reinstated final order of removal by the immigration and naturalization service ins.although batista concedes that he is removable based on a drug trafficking conviction,he contends that he is entitled to relief from removal because his father,a naturalized citizen,was his custodial parent,and hence he is a derived united states citizen.we find that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding cesar batista nationality and transfer this case to the district court for a new hearing on the matter.
the following facts are not disputed.cesar batista was born in the dominican republic on september.on october,at the age of six,he was admitted as an immigrant to the united states,where his parents then lived.on may,batista was convicted in rhode island for manufacturing and delivering heroin,an aggravated felony under current immigration law.see a b.on july,the ins instituted removal proceedings against batista based on this aggravated felony conviction.see a a iii and a b i 
on august,batista admitted the charges and conceded that he was removable.in september,batista filed a motion to terminate removal proceedings,claiming that he was a united states citizen.batista said that his father,julio batista,became a naturalized united states citizen on june,that he himself became a legal permanent united states resident in october at the age of six,and that his parents legally separated on january.in support of his motion to terminate,batista submitted an opinion from a lawyer in the dominican republic on the obligations of parents under the country divorce laws,a copy of his father naturalization certificate,and a copy of his mother application for naturalization.however,julio batista naturalization certificate,dated june,indicates his marital status as married,not separated,and similarly,minerva batista naturalization application,dated february,also lists her marital status as married.
batista also submitted a copy and a translation of a dominican marriage certificate stating that his parents were married on august,and a copy and a translation of a document captioned dominican republic certification.this document contains minerva batista declaration that she is separated from her legitimate husband,julio batista,and that at the moment of separation,she gave the custody of her son,cesar armando batista,to his legitimate father,julio cesar batista patricio.the document states that t he present declaration is made under oath in the city of san domingo,national district,capital of the dominican republic,at days of the month of january.the certification itself is dated august,and the translation is dated august.
on november,an immigration judge denied batista motion to terminate removal,found him removable based on his drug trafficking conviction,and ordered that batista be removed to the dominican republic.batista did not appeal the immigration judge decision to the board of immigration appeals bia.on november,the ins deported batista to the dominican republic.
batista subsequently reentered the united states.the ins apprehended and detained him on october,in philadelphia,pennsylvania,and served him with a notice of intent to reinstate the removal order batista declined to make a statement contesting the reinstatement.on october,the ins reinstated the removal order pursuant to a 
on april,batista applied for citizenship to the ins district director in philadelphia,claiming that he had derived citizenship through his father under a.the statute provides,inter alia,that a child of alien parents born outside the united states may become a citizen of the united states if the parent having legal custody of the child when there has been a legal separation of the parents is naturalized s uch naturalization takes place while such child is under the age of eighteen years and s uch child is residing in the united states pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of the naturalization of the parent or thereafter begins to reside permanently in the united states while under the age of eighteen years.in his citizenship application batista did not supplement the evidence that he presented in support of his earlier motion to terminate removal.
on april,the ins acting director in philadelphia denied batista application.the director said that batista presented no evidence in support of his claim that his parents obtained a divorce or a legal separation and noted presumably to undermine such claim that his father naturalization certificate and his mother naturalization application indicated that each was married,and that his mother naturalization application additionally identified her husband as julio batista.
although the director considered the document containing a declaration by batista mother that his father secured legal custody of batista upon their separation,he noted that the document was certified august,and further said that t estimony presented to a notary public and certified in public record does not in itself constitute a legal determination on separation,divorce,and custody of minor children.the director found that the available evidence did not show that batista parents obtained a legal separation,or that his father took legal custody of him before he reached the age of eighteen,as required by a.
batista did not appeal the denial of his citizenship claim to the administrative appeals unit of the ins.on may,he was removed from the united states for the second time.batista again reentered the united states,and on august,the rhode island state police arrested him for driving a car with a counterfeit inspection sticker.on august,the ins served batista with a notice of intent to reinstate the removal order.batista declined to make a statement contesting the reinstatement determination.the ins ordered batista removed.
on september,batista filed a habeas petition in the united states district court for the district of rhode island challenging reinstatement of the removal order on the ground that he was a derived citizen under.batista submitted no documents in support of his petition in addition to those already in the administrative record.on november,the district court transferred batista petition to this court pursuant to.
before us,batista continues to argue that he is a derived united states citizen under because his father became a naturalized citizen before batista was eighteen and took sole legal custody of him after his parents divorce.in support of his citizenship claim,batista submitted to us two documents that were not part of the administrative record upon which the removal order is based a dominican divorce sentence document and an affidavit from his father.in resolving this appeal,we must decide whether we can consider these two documents.
jurisdiction 
although congress recently restricted our authority to review removal orders based on an alien aggravated felony conviction,see a c supp.ii,those restrictions do not apply when the alien makes a claim of citizenship.fierro reno,cir.as the government concedes,when a citizenship claim has been made,we have jurisdiction,pursuant to b a and b supp.ii,to determine whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the citizenship claim requiring transfer to the district court for necessary fact finding.
the same statutory scheme provides that an alien seeking judicial review of a reinstated removal order must file a petition for review in this court within days of the date of the reinstatement of the removal order.see b.rather than following this procedure,however,batista filed a habeas petition with the district court within the permitted time period.the district court then transferred the petition to us pursuant to,which provides that when a civil action is filed in a court and that court finds that there is want of jurisdiction,the court shall,if it is in the interest of justice,transfer such action or appeal to any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed.because batista filed his habeas petition with the district court within the time permitted for filing a petition for review of the removal order in this court,the district court transfer of batista petition to us under was proper.
genuine issue of material fact 
the basis for the determination 
as noted,batista submitted to us two documents in support of his nationality claim that were not part of the administrative record julio batista affidavit and the divorce sentence document.in deciding whether we are authorized to look outside the administrative record in our threshold task of identifying a genuine issue of material fact as to batista citizenship claim,we start with the text of the statute,which provides in relevant part 
scope and standard for review 
except as provided in paragraph b 
a the court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based,
b the administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.
treatment of nationality claims 
a court determination if no issue of fact 
if the petitioner claims to be a national of the united states and the court of appeals finds from the pleadings and affidavits that no genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner nationality is presented,the court shall decide the nationality claim.
b transfer if issue of fact 
if the petitioner claims to be a national of the united states and the court of appeals finds that a genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner nationality is presented,the court shall transfer the proceeding to the district court of the united states for the judicial district in which the petitioner resides for a new hearing on the nationality claim and a decision on that claim 
b emphasis added.
pursuant to this scheme,when an alien challenges an ins removal order on grounds other than a claim of citizenship,we are limited in our review to the administrative record on which the order of removal is based.b a.however,when an alien claims citizenship in the petition for review,we are required to determine on the basis of the pleadings and affidavits whether there is a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to transfer the case to the district court for a new hearing and decision.see b the statute does not limit that threshold inquiry to the administrative record.
this approach is not surprising,given the designed kinship between b and,as noted by the supreme court in agosto ins,d.there,the court reviewed a petitioner claim of nationality under a repealed,the current the court of appeals to determine from the pleadings and affidavits filed by the parties whether a genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner nationality is presented.agosto,at.quoting a b.the court said that the statutory language was virtually identical to the language in federal rule of civil procedure,which governs motions for summary judgment,and concluded we may reasonably assume that,in using the language from rule as the standard for granting de novo district court hearings on citizenship claims,congress intended the language to be interpreted similarly to that in rule.id.at.we also think it is reasonable to assume that congress intended that this language,conspicuously different than the only on the administrative record language of b,embraces a familiar feature of summary judgment practice.in rule proceedings,parties can submit affidavits that are not based on an existing record for the purpose of demonstrating that a genuine issue of material fact exists requiring resolution by a.see,judge young on crucial elements of practice at mcle advising parties moving for summary judgment to assess whether third parties will voluntarily provide the affidavits necessary for a dispositive motion or,instead,whether a deposition or documents subpoena will be required.see also jack friedenthal et,civil procedure at ed noting courts preference for written affidavits in place of oral testimony for rule purposes.
in reviewing the pleadings and affidavits for material facts in dispute sufficient to warrant an evidentiary hearing,we find ourselves in an unusual role,analogous to that of a trial court presented with a rule motion for summary judgment.the supreme court has stated that a court of appeals can not refuse to allow a de novo review of a citizenship claim if the evidence presented in support of the claim would be sufficient to entitle a litigant to trial were such evidence presented in opposition to a motion for summary judgment.agosto,at.given this unusual function and the statutory language,we deem it appropriate under b to look for a genuine issue of material fact as to citizenship in the pleadings and affidavits without regard to whether such materials are part of the administrative record.
case law supports this determination.in a case directly on point,pignatello attorney general of the united states,cir,the second circuit transferred the proceedings to the district court when evidence outside the administrative record presented a genuine issue of material fact as to petitioner nationality claim.specifically,the second circuit considered in its inquiry an affidavit submitted by petitioner from the leader of his military company,an unexecuted naturalization application found in petitioner army record,and a certificate from an ins official attesting to the absence of any record of petitioner of which were part of the administrative record.id.at.see also nguyen ins,cir,aff,d considering parentage court order arguably not part of administrative record to determine no fact issue existed regarding citizenship and noting that the statute does not require that the bia or immigration judge have heard this evidence.
t he right in one of the most precious imaginable.alexander ins,cir.recognizing this fact,congress provided extra article iii procedural protections to safeguard the right to citizenship in removal proceedings by affording in b b a hearing before the district court when a genuine issue of material fact exists as to citizenship.therefore,we will consider whether the divorce sentence document and julio batista affidavit,together with the documents in the administrative record,present a genuine issue of material fact as to his nationality claim 
we add,however,an important caveat.our decision to consider the documents at issue here does not mean that a respondent at a deportation proceeding involving a claim of citizenship has an automatic right to have new evidence considered on appeal,regardless of the reason for failure to proffer it earlier.the statute merely indicates that such evidence may be considered.it does nothing to alter the longstanding policy that reasonably available evidence should be submitted at the initial stage of any proceeding so that it can be tested in an evidentiary forum and unnecessary remands or references avoided.see generally ins abudu,d.
we have no reason in this case to pursue any question of default because the government has not developed such an argument and we have no way of knowing when the evidence became available and whether it was submitted as promptly as possible.however,other petitioners would be well advised to present such evidence in the first instance in the administrative proceeding or,if they fail to do so,to explain in their submission containing new evidence at the court of appeals stage why such evidence was not originally produced.
the documents 
an alien may acquire citizenship by birth only as provided by acts of congress.miller albright,d.here,petitioner nationality claim is based on cesar batista can avail himself of derived citizenship under this statute by demonstrating that julio batista became a naturalized united states citizen before his son cesar batista reached the age of eighteen that cesar batista resided in the united states pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence when his father was naturalized,or began to reside here permanently before reaching the age of eighteen and the critical element for this cesar batista parents legally separated and that julio batista was awarded legal custody of his son.see a.batista offered several pieces of evidence relevan
