opinion of the court 
bredan chima chukwu,a nigerian citizen,petitions for review of the order of the board of immigration appeals denying chukwu application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.the bia adopted the immigration judge finding that chukwu testimony was not credible because of unexplained inconsistencies between chukwu testimony,prior sworn statements,and his supporting documents,and that chukwu failed to prove his case by sufficient credible evidence.we conclude that the ij failed to take into account record evidence that did explain many of the discrepancies on which the ij based his adverse credibility determination.further,the ij did not determine whether it was reasonable to expect chukwu to produce corroboration of the facts which the ij found should have been corroborated.we will therefore grant review,vacate,and remand for further proceedings.
chukwu arrived in this country on october,carrying a false united kingdom passport in the name of george brendon,which he had purchased in togo.at the miami airport,he signed a sworn statement admitting that he was not a british citizen,but stating that he was a resident of ghana.he said that his purpose in coming to the united states was to see somebody.when asked why he left his country,he stated i left,because i am finding life very difficult,and he said he would be harmed if he returned to his country.he stated that he had never been arrested before,at any time or any place.
on august,chukwu filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal in which he stated that he was a nigerian citizen,though born in ghana,and that he feared persecution on the ground of his politics,specifically his membership in the movement for the actualization for the sovereign state of biafra massob.his application stated that he had been arrested and beaten many times because of his membership in massob and that he feared that he would be arrested,tortured or killed by the present government of nigeria because of that membership.he listed five specific dates on which he had been arrested.
at his hearing before the ij,chukwu testified that he had been born in ghana of a nigerian family in and had moved back to nigeria at the age of twelve.he lived in lagos,in the southwest part of the country,and married a wife there in.in,he traveled some eight hours to the eastern part of the country to visit his brother in port harcourt,in the river state.while in port harcourt he joined massob,which he described as an organization devoted to protecting the rights of the ibo sometimes spelled igbo ethnic group.as can be inferred from the name,the group also supports sovereignty for biafra,an area that seceded from nigeria in the,but was absorbed back into nigeria after a costly civil war.chukwu left port harcourt to attend a rally in support of a biafran state on may,in the adjacent state of abia.a biafran flag was raised at the rally.when the police arrived at the rally,the crowd stampeded,and chukwu was arrested,along with about others.because the police found a massob membership card on chukwu,they detained him and beat him.he was forced to sign a statement renouncing his membership in massob before the police would release him.
chukwu returned to lagos,where he attended another rally on august.again,the police arrived,the people panicked,and chukwu was picked up along with others and taken to the police station,where he was detained and beaten.again,he was only released upon signing papers renouncing massob.
in september of the same year,chukwu and his brother were sitting in a bar in ikoyi,lagos.chukwu was complaining loudly about the government arrest of raphael uwazurike,the leader of massob.plainclothes officers of the domestic security forces sss overheard him.they arrested and searched him and found his massob card.the officers then took him to a detention center and beat him until he lost consciousness.they held him for three days without giving him food or drink,except for the bread and water he was able to buy with money he had on him.as before,he was only released upon signing a paper saying he would never be a member of massob again.this time,the police asked for his address.
the next time he was picked up,on february,he was simply walking down the street near his house in lagos.the police asked his name,then took him in to ask him where he was on january,which had been the day of a clash between massob and the police.he was released without mistreatment.a similar incident occurred on may,when police came to his house to collect him.on that occasion,police took him to the police station,but questioned and released him without beating him.
on july,police again came to chukwu house,but he was not home.they told his wife they were looking for him.on hearing this news,chukwu decided to stay away from home.in september,he traveled to togo looking for a trader he knew who could supply him with a british passport.he did not find the man,so he went home to nigeria,but came back to togo on september.this time,he got the passport,and he left for the united states,traveling via europe.
for corroborating evidence,chukwu submitted his nigerian passport,his massob membership card and a letter from the organization confirming his membership,an affidavit from his brother emeka corroborating his story about the arrest in the bar,and a judicial decree granting his wife petition to divorce him.the divorce decree recited his wife testimony that chukwu had 
brought a bad name to the family as he is a member of movement for the sovereign state of biafra mossob.as a member of this group he has times without number been arrested and detained by the state security service.to forestall further arrest,the respondent has to go into hiding and eventually traveled out of the country.
she said her love for chukwu had deteriorated due to this involvement with massob.chukwu also introduced correspondence from his solicitors concerning the divorce.
the state department country report for nigeria was also introduced.it reported that the government security forces committed numerous,serious human rights abuses,and that a rmy,police,and security force officers regularly beat protesters,criminal suspects,detainees,and convicted prisoners.it also reported that police and security forces practiced arbitrary arrest and detention and that they had used lethal force to quell protests or demonstrations that were perceived as becoming violent or disruptive.chukwu also produced newspaper articles about massob,and in particular,one article about the police burning down the massob headquarters in imo state.
the ij found that chukwu was not credible because of inconsistencies,implausibilities,and lack of corroboration for his testimony.in a short,but reasoned opinion,the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision,specifically agreeing with the ij that in light of the inconsistencies between the respondent testimony,his supporting documents,and his sworn statement,and the respondent failure to adequately explain the discrepancies,the respondent failed to meet his burden to establish his eligibility for the request ed forms of relief with sufficient credible evidence.
a grant of asylum allows an alien who is otherwise subject to removal to stay in the united states because he is a refugee.abdulai ashcroft,cir.a refugee is someone who is unable or unwilling to return home because of persecution or a fear of persecution for one of five particular this case,persecution on account of political opinion.a a.to establish a fear of persecution,an applicant must show a subjective fear as well as an objectively reasonable possibility that he would suffer such persecution if he returned to his country.b i.
withholding of removal is a remedy distinct from asylum and confers only the right not to be deported to a particular country,rather than the right to stay in this one.abdulai,at.an applicant can establish the right to withholding of removal by showing a clear probability that his life or freedom would be threatened on account of one of the protected grounds in the proposed country of removal,b chen gonzales,cir.because it is more difficult to prove a clear probability of persecution than a reasonable possibility,an applicant who fails to prove eligibility for asylum perforce fails to show entitlement to withholding of removal.see kibinda att y,cir.
finally,an applicant can be eligible for withholding of removal under the convention against torture if he shows that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured upon return to his country.c.
only the decision by the bia is a final order of removal,abdulai,at,subject to our review,id.we therefore do not review the ij opinion in its own right.id.however,where as here,the bia adopts the findings and reasoning of the ij,the ij opinion forms the substance of the final order and we must review it accordingly.id.at.
where the bia has adopted the ij findings,we review those findings under the substantial evidence standard,upholding them unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b dia ashcroft,cir en banc.in particular,we will uphold the ij adverse credibility determinations if they are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.chen,at.in making an adverse credibility finding,the ij must supply specific,cogent reasons why the applicant is not credible.gabuniya att y,cir.the ij conclusions about what facts are or are not plausible must be based on the record,not on conjecture or unsupported suppositions about conditions in the applicant country.dia,at.

where the administrative decision fails to consider or mention evidence that is on its face relevant and persuasive,the proper course is to remand for further consideration by the ij.see caushi att y,cir gao ashcroft,cir sotto united states,cir.
our review of the inconsistencies cited by the ij leads us to conclude that the ij failed to take into account relevant and persuasive evidence that would not only explain the alleged inconsistencies,but would also support chukwu allegations of political persecution.
the first inconsistency cited by the ij is that chukwu claimed to have lived with his wife and child in lagos until he left nigeria,yet his wife testified in the divorce proceeding that he had abandoned the family in.the record shows that both facts appear to be true,and they are not inconsistent with each other.review of the record shows that the divorce was based on desertion,irresponsib ility,and no more love.the gist of chukwu assertions recited in the decree was that chukwu massob activities were causing the family trouble.since chukwu did not join massob until,the activities chukwu complained of evidently occurred after.the record is certainly consistent with chukwu spending some time away from lagos after,as he was in port harcourt in when he joined massob and he was arrested in abia state in may.he left his job in lagos at the end of,so he was apparently free to travel.he also testified that although he was still living with his wife in,he was having some family trouble at that time and that sometimes i would leave and travel and then come back or go to someplace and come back.yet,he also returned to lagos in,since he was arrested at a bar in lagos in and twice in while he was at or near his house.only when the police came to look for him at his home in july,did he decide not to stay at home anymore.the record contained a letter from chukwu nigerian solicitors advising him that his wife had filed for divorce on the grounds of intermittent and continuous absence 
according to the divorce petition,your wife is asking for the dissolution of the marriage on the grounds that you had intermittently and continuously abandoned her for a period of about years without an exact knowledge of your whereabout sic,and also of the fact that the federal authorities,had on several occasion sic detained,intimidated and harassed her on the grounds of your membership of mossob.
emphasis added.the record supports the conclusion that chukwu was a less than attentive husband for his last two years in nigeria,that he was traveling around the country,and that chukwu was aggrieved by his absences,but it does not support the conclusion that he never came home at all after.moreover,chukwu assertions recited in the divorce decree substantially strengthen chukwu claim to have been involved in massob and to have incurred the wrath of the government on account of that involvement.
the ij remarked that there was no evidence that anyone else in chukwu family had been persecuted,but in fact the letter from the solicitors concerning the divorce proceedings recounts chukwu assertions that she had been detained,harassed,and intimidated because of chukwu massob activities.the fact that chukwu six siblings have not been persecuted is consistent with chukwu testimony that he was the only one in his family who had joined massob.
the ij also found it inconsistent that chukwu said the police were looking for him in july,yet he was able to use his nigerian passport to cross into togo,back to nigeria,then again into togo in september without being arrested or detained.chukwu explained that nigerian police do not have a database that would alert police in one area to the fact that police in another area were searching for a person.the ij did not discuss this explanation or find that it was not adequate.the ij conclusion of inconsistency in this point seems to be based on assumptions about the capabilities of nigerian law enforcement that have no support in the record.see dia,at implausibility must have support in record such as background evidence of country conditions.
the ij also considered it problematic that chukwu massob membership card listed an address in imo state,which is in the east of nigeria,rather than chukwu lagos address,which is in the western part of the country.the ij stated that chukwu had not explained why his massob card had an imo address.in fact,a newspaper article in the record showed that the address in imo state was the headquarters of massob,rather than chukwu address.there is no indication that the ij was aware of this evidence.
finally,while the ij relied on real inconsistencies between chukwu airport statement and his later asylum application and testimony,we do not believe that either the ij or the bia meant for the decision to hinge entirely on such inconsistencies.in his airport statement,chukwu said he was a resident of ghana,that he had never been arrested anytime or anywhere,and that he was coming to the united states to see somebody and because he found life difficult.these statements conflict with his testimony that he lived in nigeria,that he had been arrested repeatedly,and that he came to the united states to flee persecution.it is established in this circuit that inconsistencies between an airport statement and an asylum seeker testimony before an ij is not sufficient,standing alone,to support a bia finding that the petitioner was not credible.fiadjoe att y,cir.we can not conclude that the ij and bia would have reached the same decision based on the airport statement alone,without regard to the other inconsistencies that have been explained by record evidence that went unmentioned in the ij opinion.see dia,at balasubramanrim ins,cir.
because the ij relied on inconsistencies that were explained by evidence in the recor
