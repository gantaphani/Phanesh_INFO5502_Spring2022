in september,an immigration judge ij granted petitioner genet hailemichael asylum application.after the initial proceedings and grant of asylum,the department of homeland security dhs conducted an investigation of hailemichael claim.based upon evidence it discovered during that investigation,dhs asked the ij to reopen removal proceedings against hailemichael and to terminate hailemichael asylum,claiming that hailemichael committed fraud during the initial proceedings.the ij granted dhs motion,terminated the earlier grant of asylum and eventually ordered hailemichael removed.the ij also denied an application for adjustment of status that hailemichael filed after the ij terminated her asylum.the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed both orders,commenting only upon the ij order denying hailemichael application for adjustment of status.
hailemichael petitions for review,claiming that the ij should not have reopened proceedings or terminated her asylum and that,in any event,hailemichael was entitled to adjustment of status.while we lack jurisdiction to entertain hailemichael arguments as to adjustment of status,we grant the petition based upon deficiencies in the ij decisions to reopen proceedings and terminate hailemichael asylum.
background 
order granting asylum 
in her claim for asylum,hailemichael never alleged past persecution.instead,she sought asylum because she feared persecution on account of her political opinion if she returned to ethiopia.hailemichael and her husband had been politically active in support of ethiopia mengistu government,which ethiopia current government overthrew in the early.
among other bases for her fear,hailemichael testified about her political activities and her husband and father imprisonment in ethiopia.relying upon hailemichael testimony and numerous exhibits containing country information regarding the respondent,the ij found that hailemichael possessed a fear of persecution.as a result,in september,the ij granted hailemichael asylum.
procedural history and termination of asylum 
in november,approximately two months after the ij granted hailemichael asylum,dhs moved to reopen removal proceedings against hailemichael and to terminate the grant of asylum.based upon an investigation that it began after the ij granted hailemichael asylum,dhs claimed it had discovered that hailemichael application was fraudulent.according to dhs,contrary to hailemichael asylum application and hearing testimony,her husband was not imprisoned in ethiopia.hailemichael opposed the motion to reopen.
in support of its motion to reopen,dhs attached letters from dhs to the united states embassy in ethiopia and the embassy responses.the letters from dhs sought information on most of hailemichael claims,including her claim that her father died in,that her children applied for visas to come to the united states and that her husband had been imprisoned.dhs also asked the embassy to investigate the authenticity of a warrant for hailemichael arrest that hailemichael introduced in support of her application.the embassy investigation indicated that,just as hailemichael had testified,her children had applied for visas to come to the united states.the embassy was unable to verify or refute most other portions of hailemichael testimony.the embassy stated,however,that it had contacted a prison official in ethiopia and that the prison official claimed that his prison had never held hailemichael husband.the embassy also located a witness who allegedly stated that she purchased a home from hailemichael husband in a year in which,according to hailemichael testimony,hailemichael husband should have been in jail.according to the embassy,that same witness claimed that hailemichael husband is a businessman in addis ababa.the witness was unwilling,however,to sign a sworn statement.the embassy also turned up a document from the ethiopian government indicating that hailemichael husband had been cleared of at least one criminal charge in.
based solely upon the information provided by dhs and without a hearing,the ij granted dhs motion to reopen removal proceedings and terminated hailemichael asylum.hailemichael subsequently moved the ij to reconsider,but the ij refused.having terminated the prior grant of asylum,the ij then held hearings on the asylum application in march and august,during which hailemichael introduced additional testimony and documents.hailemichael testified that she did not know that her husband had been released from prison when she testified at the initial hearing.she also asserted that it was the ethiopian government practice to release and reimprison its enemies and that her husband had likely been reimprisoned.hailemichael also offered the testimony of two witnesses who testified that they were on the telephone with hailemichael when she learned her husband had been released.they testified that hailemichael was genuinely shocked.
in february,the ij reversed her earlier decision and denied hailemichael application for asylum.contrary to her first opinion,the ij now found hailemichael to be not credible for many reasons.in the course of her decision to deny asylum,the ij discounted hailemichael proffered evidence in favor of the evidence that dhs gathered in its investigation.she also reversed a number of holdings and findings from her opinion granting asylum,many of which were logically unrelated to the issue of hailemichael husband imprisonment or her credibility.
hailemichael appealed to the bia.however,during the pendency of her appeal,hailemichael visa number became current.she therefore moved the bia to remand her case to the ij so that she could seek adjustment of status.the bia remanded the case to the ij in december.hailemichael sought adjustment of status because her sister a united states citizen and mother a legal permanent resident reside in the united states,claiming that hailemichael deportation would be an extreme hardship on her elderly mother,as hailemichael mother was in ill health and relied upon hailemichael for medical care.in june,the ij took testimony concerning hailemichael application for adjustment of status and waiver of any fraud finding to allow that adjustment.less than a month later,the ij denied hailemichael application for adjustment of status and waiver.on that same date,the ij issued a supplemental order wherein she made an explicit finding for the first time that hailemichael committed fraud in connection with her application for asylum.hailemichael moved the ij to reconsider the denial of her application for adjustment.however,in august,the ij issued another opinion in which she refused to reconsider the application.
hailemichael subsequently appealed the ij denials of asylum,adjustment of status and waiver.in june,the bia dismissed hailemichael appeal and adopted and affirmed the ij february and june orders denying hailemichael all relief,as well as the august order refusing to reconsider the application for adjustment.hailemichael timely petitioned for review.
ii.discussion 
hailemichael contends that her asylum proceedings should not have been reopened that the ij impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to hailemichael when deciding whether to terminate hailemichael asylum and that,in any event,the ij should have adjusted hailemichael status.we address each issue in turn.
dhs motion to reopen and terminate asylum 
hailemichael argues in her petition that the ij committed a host of procedural errors when reopening,chief among them that the ij reopened based upon evidence offered by dhs that was available and capable of discovery prior to hailemichael asylum hearing.hailemichael also argues that the ij impermissibly shifted the burden of proof on the fraud issue from dhs to hailemichael and that there was insufficient evidence upon which to determine that hailemichael committed fraud in connection with her asylum application.
