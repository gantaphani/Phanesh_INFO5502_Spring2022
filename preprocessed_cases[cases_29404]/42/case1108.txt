this appeal by the united states united states or government requires us to review a sentence imposed on defendant jose armando in the united states district court for the district of connecticut dorsey,in a judgment entered september,following defendant conviction for illegal reentry into the united states after being deported.we think,as the government contends,that the district court erred as a matter of law when it granted defendant a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines or guidelines based on the nature of defendant underlying aggravated felony conviction and due to the fact that defendant original sentence was for three months and was only increased to four years when his probation was revoked.moreover,we agree with the government contention that the sentencing court failed to make sufficient findings upon which to depart downward based on unique motive for not wanting to return to el salvador on the grounds of personal safety.
the district court attempt to avoid a substantial increase in a sentence for illegal reentry when that increase is based on a prior felony conviction for two separate sales of worth of marijuana is understandable.the increase at issue here would impose a sentence of four to five years in prison months recommended by the probation service,as opposed to a sentence of one to two years in prison months if the prior conviction was simply categorized as a regular felony.the severity of this increase reminds us of those scenes familiar in medieval times when a poor person steals a loaf of bread for his family and is promptly clapped into prison for a lengthy term.we think it was that sort of concern that prompted the district court reduction,since the consequences of the defendant prior conviction at first blush appear to lead to an offensive disproportion between crime and punishment,which the trial court thought was overlooked or unintended by the sentencing commission.but closer analysis reveals more to the case before us than appears initially.
background 
defendant jose armando,a citizen of el salvador,was born there in suchitoto on september.according to the immigration and naturalization service ins he illegally entered the united states for the first time in july.he was arrested nine years later on may,in los angeles,california for selling worth of marijuana,on two separate occasions,to undercover police officers in violation of a of the california health and safety code.on june,pled guilty to these violations and was sentenced to a probationary period,with the first days to be spent in jail.defendant violated probation in december and that status was revoked in march,resulting in a sentence of years imprisonment.
while the revocation of his probation was pending,the ins instituted deportation proceedings against predicated on his conviction for violating a state law relating to a controlled substance.a b i previously codified at a.on february,prior to revocation of his probation,defendant was deported to el salvador.subsequently,and before the revocation in march of his probationary status,defendant illegally entered the united states for the second time.while defendant was incarcerated in california due to the march probation revocation,the ins in may again commenced deportation proceedings and deported defendant back to el salvador on february.
years later in september,for the third time illegally entered the united states.on may,while in the custody of the stamford,connecticut police department,the ins was informed of his return and,on june,defendant was charged with one count of illegal reentry after deportation under a.in september the government filed a notice of enhanced penalty,alleging that had a prior california conviction for sale of a controlled substance that constituted an aggravated felony under b,and that he was therefore subject to up to years imprisonment.on april,defendant pled guilty to the indictment.
sentencing 
the presentence report psr prepared by the probation department recommended a base offense level of for unlawfully entering or remaining in the united states,a a enhancement for illegal reentry after conviction for a felony drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was greater than months,b a i and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,a b.these recommendations resulted in an adjusted offense level of which,in conjunction with defendant criminal history category of iii,led to a range of to months imprisonment.defendant criminal history included prior convictions for the sale of marijuana,possession of drug paraphernalia and failure to appear,and pending state charges in new york for attempted robbery and criminal possession of a weapon,and for possession of burglary tools and stolen property and in connecticut for possession of narcotics,drug paraphernalia and breach of the peace.
on the eve of sentencing,filed a motion for downward departure alleging that he originally came to the united states,and continued to reenter,because of atrocities he had witnessed and injuries he himself had suffered in el salvador during the and,and because of his fear that his life would be in danger were he to return there.these allegations were specifically outlined in a letter written by defense counsel and signed by defendant.the allegations included vivid examples of the human suffering he had witnessed in his home country and statements regarding the loss of his family members and his constant need to be on the run to escape capture.in its response to this motion,the government presented prior sworn affidavits of in which he stated he was in no danger in el salvador and that his reason for not wanting to remain there was because there were no job opportunities.
at the sentencing hearing on september,the district court departed downward by levels,resulting in a sentence of months imprisonment.it ruled that the sentencing commission had not adequately considered this type of minor in amount and moral turpitude drug trafficking offense when it drafted the aggravated felony enhancement provision the original sentence imposed upon defendant was months imprisonment,which does not reach the threshold required under the guidelines for the enhancement and the sentencing commission had not adequately considered a person with a personal safety motive for reentry as opposed to one that is purely economic when drafting the guidelines.the government has appealed the sentence imposed on defendant,challenging each of the district court three rulings.we address each in turn.
discussion 
i seriousness of the underlying aggravated felony 
during the sentencing hearing,the district court stated that it believed treating all trafficking offenses equally and applying a increase across the board to all of them suggested that the commission had not adequately considered an appropriate differentiation related to the factual bases upon which such a substantial increase would be applied.despite contrary advice from counsel for both parties,the sentencing court insisted it would depart on this ground.
it rationalized its holding by saying that when congress acted illogically,unreasonably and unfairly,it would try to get around it,as long as it legal to do so because the worth of marijuana at issue in this case was not substantial enough to justify a increase,and the sentence the psr recommended and the government supported was inconsistent with the purpose of offense level calculations being designed to measure the moral turpitude that involved in the underlying aggravated felony.one of the grounds upon which the sentencing court based its departure was the sentencing commission alleged failure adequately to take into account the proper sentencing considerations that would be involved at the extreme low end of drug trafficking conduct.
we begin analysis by noting that following the supreme court decision in koon united states,d,we adhered to an abuse of discretion standard when reviewing a downward departure from the sentencing guidelines.united states,cir united states galante,cir.on april,the prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end the exploitation of children today act of protect act became effective,stat.april,codified at e west,westlaw through.that act directs us to review downward departures de novo.protect act d e.because the issue of whether the factor relied upon by the sentencing court is a permissible ground for departure is one that has always been reviewed de novo,we need not decide whether the protect act applies to appeals pending before april.united states korman,cir.
recently,we addressed the exact issue now before us in the instant case,namely,whether or not the district court erred when it departed based on its conclusion that the sentencing commission did not take into account the severity of an underlying felony conviction when it drafted the graduated enhancement provisions of b of the guidelines.in united states stultz,cir,argued on the same day as the argument in this case,we held that the district court erred in its conclusion.in stultz,we ruled that the sentencing commission took the severity of the underlying felony into account when creating the graduated system of felonies in the amendments to.stultz,at.thus,we concluded the commission intended the enhancement to apply to all felony convictions for trafficking controlled substances that resulted in imprisonment for a period of greater than months.id.at.
in this appeal,as in stultz,defendant prior crime was a felony drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed ultimately turned out to be greater than months.first,the prior crime was a federal,state or local offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,application note b iv definition of felony.under a of the california health and safety code,every person who transports,imports into this state,sells,furnishes,administers,or gives away marijuana shall be punished by imprisonment for a period of two,three or four years.cal.health safety code a west,westlaw through reg.sess.defendant conviction for a state offense punishable by at least two years imprisonment meets the criteria for a felony conviction prescribed by the guidelines.
second,defendant prior crime was a drug trafficking offense,defined in the guidelines as an offense under federal,state,or local law forbidding the distribution of a controlled substance with intent to manufacture,distribute or dispense it.see,application note b iii.defendant conviction was for the sale of marijuana,a controlled substance under,c,c.hence,it meets the criteria for a drug trafficking offense prescribed by the guidelines.
finally,was originally sentenced to three years of probation and days in jail for the offense.later,after this probation was revoked,he was sentenced to years imprisonment.whether the sentence exceeds months and was therefore sufficient to meet the requirements of b a i will be discussed in part ii.
ii insufficiency of the original sentence 
discussion turns next to the trial court determination that the sentence imposed for purposes of the increase mandated by b a i does not include a prison sentence imposed after probation revocation.section b a i of the guidelines requires a increase if the defendant reentered the united states after a conviction for a felony that is i a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded months.at the sentencing hearing,the trial court stated that defendant original sentence was less than months and that the additional period came from a violation of probation.it concluded that since the sentencing guidelines did not specifically identify a sentence based on a violation of probation as a factor warranting an upward adjustment in the offense level,it would not take the sentence imposed following revocation of probation into account.under the original sentence defendant offense level increase would have been instead of.b b.the district court decided to depart downward by two levels.
in a recent decision addressing an issue similar to that raised in the case at hand,we held that a probation revocation sentence that,by itself,is longer than months qualifies as a sentence imposed for a drug trafficking offense under b a i,when the original sentence was itself for a drug trafficking offense.united states,cir.other circuits ruling on this issue have reached the same result.united states,cir united states,cir united states,cir 
in this case,the original sentence of years probation with the first days to be spent in jail was imposed for the sale of marijuana,which,under,application note b iii and,c,c,is a drug trafficking violation.the probation revoked was the three years of probation imposed for that drug trafficking conviction.therefore,since the original sentence was for a drug trafficking offense,the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of defendant probation qualifies as a sentence imposed for a drug trafficking offense under the guidelines.it was error for the sentencing court to depart downward by two levels in part upon this ground.when resentencing defendant,the district court may not rely on this ground for any downward departure it might grant.
in sum,defendant conviction clearly falls under the plain meaning of the guidelines,since it was a felony drug trafficking offense that resulted in a period of imprisonment of over months.because stultz held that the sentencing commission had taken the seriousness of the the type of controlled substance at account when drafting the amendments to the guidelines,the district court departure on the ground that this prior conviction was at the extreme low level of felony conduct and,therefore,fell outside of the heartland of reentry cases,must be held to be in error.
iii personal safety motive 
contentions at hearing 
the final issue for review is the sentencing court decision to depart downward based on concerns for his personal safety.at the beginning of the sentencing hearing,the district court asked defense counsel if defendant motion to depart was based on the fact that he reentered the united states illegally due to fear for his life and physical safety in el salvador,as opposed to the reason most defendants reenter,that is,lack of work in their home country.counsel stated that it was fear and not lack of work that brought defendant to this country.during the sentencing hearing,the defendant spoke on his own behalf,repeating the allegations of human suffering and physical and emotional injury made in his letter,and showing the district court scars on his body that he declared resulted from shots fired at him in el salvador.
the district court declined to pass judgment on this issue believing it was better addressed in an asylum proceeding,stating that its goal was to try to keep in the united states long enough to pursue such an asylum claim after hearing from the parties and before handing down the sentence,the district court conceded that the government was correct that there was no independent corroboration of defendant allegations.however,it stated that,according to,his original entry and reentry was motivated 
to a very substantial degree,by an effort to get away from the inhumane conditions in which he was forced to live,and the safety risks to which his letter suggest he was subject.
those are not contradicted in the record,and from the court general knowledge of conditions in el salvador over the last couple of decades,his recitations are not without some reason and logic,and the marks that he has on him,reflective of the treatment that he did receive to some extent personally,tends to corroborate his story.
after the district court imposed sentence,the government objected to the court statement that there was nothing in the record to controvert defendant allegations that he entered and reentered the united states only for reasons of personal safety.in challenging this statement,the government pointed out that there were sworn affidavits,presented by the defendant in spanish,in which he averred that he came to the united states because there was no work in el salvador and that he was not subject to personal harm there.in response,defense counsel asked the court to make a credibility determination as to defendant statements.
the district court refused to do so,commenting that the defendan
