lazaro antonio mejia applied for special rule cancellation of his removal from the united states under section of the nicaraguan and central american relief act nacara,stat,as amended by,b,stat.he was ruled ineligible for relief on the basis of his criminal history.in this petition,mejia raises a single issue of law as to which we have jurisdiction.
the board of immigration appeals bia characterized his massachusetts shoplifting conviction as a crime involving moral turpitude,citing one bia opinion that considered a pennsylvania statute,and not undertaking any analysis of massachusetts law or a categorical approach.the government attempts to fill in what was missing from the bia analysis in its brief to our court.the petitioner both objects to the bia not having done the analysis and argues that a modified categorical approach was required.because the bia did not adequately consider the statutory issue presented,we grant the petition,vacate the bia order insofar as it denied relief on these grounds,and remand for further proceedings.
mejia arrived in the united states from el salvador on an unknown date.on april,he admitted to a single count of shoplifting in violation of.laws ch,and the trial judge continued his case without making a finding of guilt while mejia served a term of probation.after the continuance,the trial judge dismissed the shoplifting charges.
in may,mejia was charged with larceny in an amount over in violation of.laws ch,and he later admitted to an amended charge of larceny by inducement.laws ch.the trial judge continued the case without a finding of guilt,placed mejia on probation,and ordered him to pay in restitution.
on january,mejia was served with a notice to appear,and was charged with removability on two grounds as a n alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled,a a i and as an alien who has been convicted of,or who admits having committed a crime involving moral turpitude,id.a a i i.mejia conceded removability on the first ground,but denied that he was removable on the second.
mejia applied for special rule cancellation of removal under section of nacara before the immigration judge ij.in order to be eligible for this relief,mejia had to show,inter alia,that he was not inadmissible for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude under a.b.he conceded that his larceny by inducement conviction was such a crime but argued that he fell within the petty offense exception,under which the bar on admissibility for those convicted of a crime of moral turpitude does not apply to an alien who committed only one crime if that crime does not carry a maximum penalty of over one year.a a ii ii emphasis added.
on may,the ij denied mejia application for cancellation of removal under nacara on grounds that need not detain us mejia appealed to the bia,which dismissed his appeal on august.the bia concluded that the immigration judge properly found that mejia shoplifting conviction is also a crime involving moral turpitude rendering him ineligible for the petty offense exception see in re jurado delgado,bia.we have just quoted the extent of its reasoning.this petition for review followed.
the government argues that we lack jurisdiction over this petition because mejia is removable under a a i i as a result of his conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude.see a c n o court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section a.we reject the argument we lack jurisdiction.petitioner presents a legal issue whether the bia erred when it concluded,based on the analysis quoted above,that a violation of massachusetts shoplifting statute is a crime involving moral turpitude.see a d.
the ultimate legal conclusion as to whether the offenses for which the petitioner was convicted constitute a ground for removal,or for preclusion of cancellation of removal,would be a legal issue that we would review de novo.campbell holder,cir.that has its limits.we afford deference to the bia reasonable interpretations of the immigration and nationality act,including its construction of the term moral turpitude,but not to its reading of an underlying criminal statute as to which it has no expertise.patel holder,cir.where,as here,the bia has rendered a decision with its own analysis of the question at issue,our review focuses on the bia decision,not the ij.v√°squez holder,cir.
the difficulty here is that the bia has not provided a comprehensible analysis to support its conclusion.we explain.congress has never defined the term moral turpitude in the immigration law context.we have approved the bia definition for immigration purposes of a crime involving moral turpitude as conduct that shocks the public conscience as being inherently base,vile,or depraved,and contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general.patel,at quoting da silva neto holder,cir internal quotation mark omitted.the focus of the moral turpitude analysis is on the inherent nature of the crime of conviction,as opposed to the particular circumstances of the actual crime committed nguyen reno,cir.
but to answer that question the bia must look to the pertinent state law as to the offense of conviction.the analysis of whether petitioner shoplifting offense was a crime involving moral turpitude looks first to the inherent nature of the crime of conviction,as defined in the criminal statute.idy holder,cir quoting maghsoudi ins,cir internal quotation mark omitted.the language of the statute may be clear that the conduct it proscribes fits the definition of moral turpitude.in that case,the inquiry ends with the statutory language.if,however,the statute is divisible,encompassing both turpitudinous and conduct,then the bia must apply what we have called the modified categorical approach,patel,at,under which we look to the record of conviction the indictment,plea,verdict,and sentence,to determine the nature of the petitioner conviction.idy,at.
where theft offenses are involved,the bia generally distinguishes between turpitudinous thefts and their less depraved counterparts by asking whether the defendant intended to permanently deprive the owner of the purloined property.patel,at see matter of grazley,bia ordinarily,a conviction for theft is considered to involve moral turpitude only when a permanent taking is intended.the question faced by the bia was whether the massachusetts shoplifting statute of conviction requires an intent to permanently deprive a victim of property.
the bia opinion on the issue before us amounts to a conclusion that petitioner shoplifting conviction is also a crime involving moral turpitude.likewise,its sole supporting citation was to an earlier case,in re jurado delgado,bia,in which the bia addressed whether a violation of pennsylvania retail theft statute was a crime involving moral turpitude for these purposes.
generally,our review is limited to the reasoning articulated below,patel,at,and we have emphasized that a reviewing court should judge the action of the bia based only on reasoning provided by the agency,not based on grounds constructed by the reviewing court,mihaylov ashcroft,cir alteration in original quoting yatskin ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in this case,the bia provided no reasoning,offering instead a bare conclusion.that is insufficient.
further,the bia citation to jurado delgado is misplaced in this case,which requires the parsing of massachusetts shoplifting statute.laws ch.among other differences between the two statutes,the pennsylvania statute at issue in jurado delgado did not expressly prohibit any types of shoplifting in which the intent required was an intent to permanently deprive the owner of property.see.by contrast,the massachusetts shoplifting statute includes a section that prohibits the shoplifting of a shopping cart with the intention of permanently depriving the merchant of the possession,use or benefit of such a cart.laws ch.the bia,as would have been appropriate,simply did not use the modified categorical approach,and so did
