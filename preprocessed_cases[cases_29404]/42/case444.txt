appellant ramon antonio pled guilty to charges of unlawful reentry into the united states after removal and unlawful use of false identification.see,a.the district court imposed a term of imprisonment,which included a enhancement under the federal sentencing guidelines based on its finding that appellant prior conviction for aggravated battery constituted a felony.appellant claims that,under puerto rico law,the battery conviction was a misdemeanor,not a felony,and that he is entitled to.we agree and therefore remand.
appellant,a citizen of the dominican republic,first entered the united states unlawfully in march.on december,he was charged in puerto rico superior court with felony aggravated battery,a violation of article of the puerto rico penal code,laws ann.tit.appellant later entered a guilty plea and was sentenced to six months imprisonment on may,he was removed to the dominican republic.he reentered the united states in september,again in puerto rico,and in july pled guilty to a felony charge of unlawful reentry.he was sentenced to seven months imprisonment and again removed from the united states.
the incident underlying this case occurred on april.during a inspection at the luis mar√≠n international airport in carolina,puerto rico,appellant was detained and found to be using a counterfeit puerto rican driver license bearing a name other than his own.he subsequently was charged in a indictment with unlawful presence in the united states after removal,in violation of a and b and with the knowing and unauthorized use of another person identification to facilitate his unlawful reentry,in violation of a.he pled guilty to both counts.
under the sentencing guidelines,a defendant convicted of an unlawful reentry crime is subject to a increase in his offense level if he previously was deported after a conviction for a felony that is a crime of violence.b a ii.the applicable guidelines definition of felony is any federal,state,or local offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.cmt.there is no dispute that the felony crime of aggravated battery,with which appellant was charged in,would trigger the enhancement the question is whether appellant was convicted of that crime 
puerto rico article divides aggravated battery into discrete misdemeanor and felony crimes,which cover different types of specified conduct.see infra.the complaint filed against appellant framed the charge as a felony.felony aggravated battery is punishable by imprisonment for a fixed term of years that sentence could be increased to five years if aggravating factors existed and decreased to two years if attenuating circumstances are present.laws ann.tit.aggravated battery otherwise is punishable by a term not exceeding six months,and is thus a misdemeanor under puerto rico law 
at the sentencing hearing,both defense counsel and the assistant united states attorney agreed that appellant aggravated battery conviction should be considered a misdemeanor based on the sentence that was imposed the misdemeanor classification would have resulted in only a enhancement and a sentencing range of eight to fourteen months,compared to a range of to months with the enhancement.the alternative increase in offense level would not be based on the misdemeanor conviction,but would result from appellant prior reentry conviction.the guidelines impose a enhancement for a prior felony conviction that has no special as aggravated or crime of violence would trigger a harsher penalty.see b d.
although the district court had before it the complaint that led to appellant conviction,it had no other information about the crime because the file could not be located.relying on the language in the complaint,the court concluded that appellant had been convicted of a felony within the meaning of the guidelines 
t he prior felony conviction is a state conviction for an offence sic punishable by im prisonment for a term exceeding one year,regardless of whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentence imposed,which means that regardless of having been sentenced to six months,and the court do know whatever the judge did and sentenced him to six months,but according to what he was charged with,he was charged with a felony that carried a term of imprisonment of more than one year,carried a fixed term of three years.
if afterwards he plea bargained and the case was reduced to a misdemeanor,that is something else.but for purposes of the guidelines that we are applying,a prior felony conviction means a state conviction punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year regardless of the actual sentence imposed.
the court therefore applied the enhancement and imposed the sentence.
legal principles 
the body of law surrounding the proper classification of state crimes for purposes of federal sentencing is both complex and growing,see,lopez gonzales,d,and this is not the first time that we have confronted a defendant attempt to link the short length of his sentence to the crime status under the sentencing guidelines.in united states santiago,cir,the appellant claimed that his two prior convictions for assault and battery did not satisfy the career offender requirement that they be punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year because he received sentences on each occasion.id.at quoting.we noted,however,that the offenses were punishable at the time they occurred by imprisonment of up to years,and we made the following observation the guideline does not speak in terms of a judicial judgment the length of the sentence meted out,but,rather,in terms of a legislative judgment the maximum punishment applicable to the offense.id.at emphasis in original.we thus held the crimes qualified as predicate convictions for career offender status.
other case law in our circuit and elsewhere confirms that it is the statutory maximum for a particular crime,and not the specific sentence imposed,that determines the crime status,including its classification as a felony under.see,united states,cir rejecting defendant contention that mandatory suspended sentence for offender removed prior crime from classification as felony under where statute provided for maximum term of imprisonment united states,cir rejecting felony classification under where maximum authorized punishment was probation united states sanchez,cir rejecting claim that district court erroneously treated crimes as felonies where defendants were sentenced to six years but actually served less than one year and one month.
the issue here,however,is materially different.appellant does not seek to classify a crime based solely on the sentence imposed,but invokes the sentence as decisive proof that he was convicted of a misdemeanor.framed in the language we used in santiago,the issue is whether appellant term was the product of a judicial judgment as to the appropriate sentence for the felony with which he was charged,or a legislative judgment as to the appropriate penalty for a lesser crime.put another way,was appellant convicted and sentenced for the misdemeanor crime of aggravated which the legislature fixed a maximum prison was he sentenced leniently for the felony crime of aggravated battery if the former,the conviction would not qualify as a felony crime of violence under.
we typically review de novo the district court determination of the legal meaning of guidelines provisions.united states robinson,cir united states,cir per curiam interpreting.a court factual findings on sentencing are reviewed only for clear error.robinson,at.the question we face here is legal,requiring us to consider both the nature of puerto rico aggravated battery statute and the legal significance owed to appellant plea and sentencing under the provision.accordingly,we apply de novo review.
appellant concedes that he was charged with felony aggravated battery,but he argues that the only conclusion that can be drawn from his sentence is that he was convicted of the less serious crime of misdemeanor aggravated battery.this is so,he maintains,because puerto rico was a fixed sentence jurisdiction at the time of his conviction,and the judge who sentenced him was therefore obligated to follow the fixed term prescribed by statute if he were convicted of a felony,that term would have been between two and five years,with a term being the standard.he argues that,because he was sentenced to six months incarceration,he must have been convicted of misdemeanor aggravated battery.
we find this reasoning persuasive.under article,each form of aggravated battery has its own set of factual criteria.at the time of appellant crime,aggravated battery was classified as a misdemeanor when committed under one or more of seven specifically designated circumstances,including w hen committed with the intent to inflict serious bodily injury.laws ann.tit,e aggravated battery was considered a felony,however,under three other specified instances,including w hen serious bodily injury is inflicted on the person assaulted,id.at b second part,and when it was committed with deadly weapons under circumstances not amounting to an intent to kill or maim,id.at c second part 
the district court had no information before it other than that appellant had been charged with the felony version of aggravated that he received a sentence.translating from spanish,the court quoted the complaint filed against appellant,in pertinent part,as follows 
d efendant illegally,voluntarily,maliciously,and with criminal intention,did use force or violence against a human being with the purpose of causing him harm,committing said crime with deadly weapons under circumstances that do not amount to an intent to kill or to maim 
unquestionably,the language in the complaint tracks the language in subsection c of the felony portion of article referring to the use of deadly weapons.the court concluded that it should rely on that language,rather than on the sentence,to classify the crime.it recognized,reasonably,that sentences often reflect a variety of factors,and its own experience revealed that,in some cases,plea bargaining can result in a misdemeanor penalty for a felony charge.
however,under puerto rico law,a sentencing judge imposing a term of imprisonment for the felony crime of aggravated battery appears to lack the discretion to reduce the sentence below the statutory minimum of two years.law provides that,when extenuating or aggravating circumstances exist to justify departing from the standard term,the court must increase or decrease the established fixed sentence within the limits established by law for the crime.laws ann.tit,emphasis added.thus,the sentence is strong evidence that appellant conviction was not for a felony and that,consequently,it can not support the penalty of a increase in his offense level.
the fifth circuit also has considered an illegal reentry case involving a challenge to the enhancement,and an important difference in context provides some perspective here.in united states,cir per curiam,the appellant argued that his prior conviction did not constitute a felony crime of violence because his plea agreement provided that he would be punished as if the crime were a misdemeanor,with a maximum sentence,and he was sentenced to a term of ninety days.id.at.
the court rejected the appellant argument because,under a provision of texas law,a crime remains a felony even if punished as a misdemeanor.id.at citing.penal code a.significantly,the plea bargain in that case stated,with emphasis,that despite rivera punishment,the judgment shall constitute a final felony conviction for the defendant.id.
the government,which on appeal endorses the district court ruling despite its agreement at sentencing that the aggravated battery conviction was a misdemeanor,cites no comparable provision of puerto rico law.it relies on the district court rationale that a plea bargain may have prompted a reduced felony sentence,and alternatively suggests that the puerto rico court may have imposed a term because of extenuating or mitigating circumstances.that logic,however,requires the government to argue that the puerto rico court imposed a sentence that was not permitted by commonwealth law,which sets a minimum for felony aggravated battery.we think it more sensible to conclude that the puerto rico court imposed a lawful sentence for misdemeanor aggravated battery.indeed,if we were to deem this conviction a felony for purposes of,we think it likely that we would be elevating the severity of the crime beyond the intent of the law that criminalized the conduct.we have neither authority nor inclination to take such a step.we hold that appellant aggravated battery conviction may not be treated as a felony in calculating his sentence.
vacated and remanded for.
we draw the facts from the government proffer at appellant change of plea hearing and from two reports psr,one prepared in this case and one prepared in connection with an earlier reentry charge.
the psr reported that appellant also pled guilty to a weapons law violation stemming from the same incident,for which he received a concurrent term of imprisonment.that conviction is not at issue in this case.
section a provides,in relevant part,that any alien who has been denied admission,excluded,deported,or removed,and thereafter enters,attempts to enter,or is at any time found in,the united states,without having obtained permission to reenter shall be subject to a fine or up to two years imprisonment,or b provides that,in the case of any alien described in subsection a whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of three or more misdemeanors involving drugs,crimes against the person,or both,or a felony other than an aggravated felony,such alien shall be fined under title,imprisoned not more than years,or both.
appellant does not dispute that his conviction for aggravated battery qualifies as a crime of violence.see cmt.b iii crime of violence includes aggravated assault.
our references throughout are to the statute as it existed at the time of appellant conviction,although subsequent amendments have not changed the provision in ways that would affect our analysis.the statute continues to have separate sections for the felony and misdemeanor crimes,with each section listing various factual circumstances in which it applies.as in the earlier version,the current statute states explicitly that aggravated battery is a felony when it occurs in the specified circumstances.see laws ann.tit.the statute first section,currently designated subsection,is not expressly labeled as a misdemeanor provision it is the prescribed penalty that triggers the misdemeanor classification.puerto rico penal code defines a misdemeanor asa crime punishable by detention for a term that does not exceed six months or by a fine that does not exceed five thousand dollars,or both penalties at the discretion of the court.a felony comprises all other.laws ann.tit.section was added to the penal code in and its later revisions did not materially change its substance.
the government explicitly relied on the psr prepared in connection with appellant unlawful reentry conviction.that earlier psr considered the aggravated battery a misdemeanor.the psr prepared in connection with the instant offenses treated the conviction as a felony.
act,codified at laws ann.tit,states the fixed sentence system is hereby established in puerto rico.when the court orders a sentence of imprisonment,it shall hand down a fixed sentence with a specific term of duration.in felony cases a fixed term established by law shall be imposed for the crime committed.should there be extenuating or aggravating circumstances,the court must increase or decrease the established fixed sentence within the limits established by law for the crime.in these cases the prison term to be imposed shall also be fixed sentence system was enacted into law in.
the current version of section lists six instances of misdemeanor aggravated battery,including the one noted in the text.
the current version of section lists seven instances of felony aggravated battery,including the two noted in the text.
the psr states that the charge specified that the deadly weapon was a machete.the charging document is not in the submitted record materials.
