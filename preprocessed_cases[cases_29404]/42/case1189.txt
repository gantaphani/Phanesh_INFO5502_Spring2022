the immigration judge ij determined that,inter alia,paek was statutorily ineligible for a h waiver pursuant to the aggravated felony bar 
no waiver shall be granted under this subsection in the case of an alien who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if since the date of such admission the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony 
ina h,h.the ij determined that paek conviction for first degree robbery was an aggravated felony pursuant to ina a f,a f,and that paek was convicted of this aggravated felony after the date he was admitted as a conditional lpr,after june.paek attempted to circumvent the aggravated felony bar by arguing that the bar does not apply to persons initially admitted as conditional lprs,but the ij rejected this argument.
paek appealed to the bia.the only issue on appeal was whether the aggravated felony bar applies to an alien who was admitted at a port of entry as a conditional permanent resident under section a of the ina.app.in a published decision,the bia determined that the bar did apply.the bia reached its decision based on the plain language of,but it also relied on a supporting regulation,and a decision of this court,gallimore attorney general,cir.the bia analysis led it to conclude that paek is subject to the aggravated felony bar and is statutorily ineligible for a h waiver.paek petitioned for review.

iii.discussion 
paek urges that,because he was initially admitted as a conditional lpr,he has not previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.see ina h,h.he reasons that the conditional nature of his lawful permanent resident status meant that he was not permanent when admitted,as required by the statutory definition of lawfully admitted for permanent residence.see ina a,a the term lawfully admitted for permanent residence means the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the united states as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws,such status not having changed.alternatively,he urges that,if we find the relevant ina sections ambiguous,we should remand to the bia for further consideration.
however,we conclude that the plain language of the ina indicates that an alien admitted as a conditional lpr constitutes an alien who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,ina h,h,and,therefore,that the bia correctly determined that the aggravated felony bar renders paek statutorily ineligible for a h waiver.
as with any question of statutory interpretation,our analysis begins with the plain language of the statute.jimenez quarterman,d.i n looking for the meaning of this statutory language,we must look to the statutory context in which that language is used and the broader context of the statute as a whole as well as the language itself.payphone ass town of,cir.it is true that,in the face of statutory ambiguity or uncertainty,we may have recourse to the legislative history of the measure and the statements by those in charge of it during its consideration by the congress,estate of arrington michael,cir quoting united states great.however,we do not resort to legislative history to cloud a statutory text that is clear.ratzlaf united states,d.here,the statutory text is clear,not ambiguous.
the aggravated felony bar provides that a h waiver is not available to an alien who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if since the date of such admission the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony ina h,h emphasis added.we have already addressed the proper date on which a conditional lpr,who had the conditional basis of his status removed,who became a lpr,was admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.gallimore,at in gallimore,the attorney general argued that the alien,earl gallimore,was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence until the date on which the conditional basis of his immigration status was removed,as opposed to the date on which he became a conditional lpr.id.at.we remanded because the bia simply overlooked the fact that the date on which gallimore had become a conditional lpr may have been the relevant date.id.however,in strong and persuasive dicta,we noted that the provisions in unambiguously accord conditional lprs the privilege of residing permanently in the united states,notwithstanding the literal meaning of the word permanently and the conditional nature of the status.id.at.furthermore,we proclaimed that t he ina thus equates conditional lprs with lprs,except to the extent but only to the extent that prescribes additional obligations.id.at.while we did opine on this issue,the parties before us agree as do we that this was dicta and not controlling on remand in that case
