the united states seeks to strip jack reimer reimer or defendant of his citizenship.the government argues that reimer conduct during world war ii should have rendered him ineligible to receive the visa upon which he entered the country in,see displaced persons act of dpa,stat,as amended by,stat,and that his subsequent naturalization in was illegally procured,see immigration and nationality act ina,a.specifically,the government contends that,pursuant to section of the dpa,reimer was ineligible for a visa,because during the war he assisted the nazis in persecution,or alternatively,because he was a member or participant in a movement hostile to the united states.see dpa,stat.at.
following a bench trial,the united states district court for the eastern district of new york mckenna,found that the government had met its burden of proving by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence,see fedorenko united states,d,that reimer assisted in persecution of jews at the behest of the nazis,and ordered reimer citizenship revoked.the district court,however,ruled against the government on its claim that reimer was a part of a movement hostile to the united states reimer appeals,arguing that his aid to the he maintains was largely administrative and entirely,as a matter of law,constitute assistance in persecution.the government,urging this court to reverse the district court ruling on its claim and find against reimer on that basis as well.because we affirm on the ground that reimer assisted in persecution,we need not reach the issue raised by the government on.
background 
in the aftermath of world war ii,congress passed the dpa in an effort to permit at least some of the hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the war to seek refuge in the united states,without regard to previous immigration quotas.fedorenko,at.united states sokolov,cir.at the same time,however,congress unequivocally provided that not all displaced persons were eligible for visas.among those barred from eligibility by section of the dpa,as amended in,was 
any person who is or has been a member of or participated in any movement which is or has been hostile to the united states or the form of government of the united states,or any person who advocated or assisted in the persecution of any person because of race,religion,or national origin,or any person who has voluntarily borne arms against the united states during world war ii.
dpa,stat.at.
among the throngs of refugees and survivors of the death and work camps who entered the united states on visas issued under the dpa,was jack reimer.
although reimer is of german descent,he was born in in the ukraine and grew up in the soviet union prior to the war,reimer studied at a state school to become a librarian.he spoke both german and russian.in january,reimer was drafted into the russian army.when the germans invaded the soviet union on june,reimer was deployed into combat.he was captured not long after and held by the germans as a.after two months in a camp at,poland,reimer was transferred to the infamous training camp at trawnicki.
the purpose of the camp at trawnicki was to train guards,who were then placed under the control of the german schutzstaffel ss.although the guards provided a variety of logistical support to the german army,they played a key role in furthering the nazis operation reinhard to exterminate poland jews.thus,for example,the were collectively referred to as wachmannschaften or trawnicki men policed concentration camps and cleared poland jewish ghettos.the wachmannschaften,including reimer,typically were uniformed,paid,given leave,occasionally armed,and given the possibility of promotion.
reimer exact role in the wachmannschaften was very much disputed at trial.reimer conceded in his testimony that he not only received guard training but also assisted in the training of other trawnicki men.he was promoted four times,and awarded a medal for outstanding service to the german forces by a.reimer maintained,however,that his responsibilities were largely administrative and confined to accounting,translating,and keeping track of supplies.
the government asserted that reimer was in the thick of the wachmannschaften operations.for example,the government presented evidence that placed reimer in lublin,czestochowa,and warsaw when those cities jewish ghettoes were cleared,and tens of thousands of jews were forced into concentration and labor camps.the government expert witness testified that these wachmannschaften operations were customarily manned with no more guards than were absolutely necessary to effectuate the mission objective of forcibly deporting the ghetto residents to concentration camps.the government argued that this gave rise to an inference that reimer role in these events could not merely have been limited to administrative support.
the district court largely refused to draw such inferences,instead confining much of its factual findings to the version of events to which reimer testified at trial the district court,however,found that even these facts were sufficient to support the conclusion that reimer assisted the nazis in persecution.reimer testified to providing logistical support to other wachmannschaften during the ghetto clearings at czestochowa and warsaw,standing guard while armed outside empty buildings in lublin after the buildings had been cleared of jewish inhabitants,and being present when civilians were thrown into a pit and murdered.reimer was armed at the pit killing,and he admitted to having fired on command when one of those in the pit was observed to be still alive,although the district court credited reimer account that he fired over the victim head.reimer also testified to witnessing the ss carry out mass killings of jews.
near the end of the war,when the german army was in retreat,the trawnicki men,including reimer,were consolidated into the ss battalion streibel.around that time,reimer applied for and was given german citizenship.although the record is sparse as to reimer precise conduct during the final months of the war,we know he entered germany around the same time that the war was declared over.seven years later,in,reimer applied for and was granted a visa pursuant to the dpa.he acquired united states citizenship in.
discussion 
of the questions presented to us,we answer only whether reimer can,as a matter of law,be said to have assisted in the persecution of any person because of race,religion,or national origin.dpa,stat.at.reimer argues that his conduct can not amount to assistance in persecution because his service in the wachmannschaften was involuntary his duties were largely administrative he engaged in no personal act of persecution and he did not know that those murdered in his presence were persecuted because of their race,religion,or national origin.to find in reimer favor,however,we would need to close our eyes to the facts as found by the district court,and overlook that many of these same defenses have been rejected by prior decisions of this court and the supreme court.we will do neither.
the leading case on the interpretation of the dpa is fedorenko united states,d,in which the supreme court affirmed the decision of the fifth circuit ordering the denaturalization of feodor fedorenko on the ground that he had made material misrepresentations to authorities in obtaining his visa id.at.fedorenko was drafted into the russian army,captured and sent to a series of camps,and then selected to go through military training at the camp in trawnicki,poland.id.at.thereafter,fedorenko spent much of the remainder of the war as an armed guard at concentration and labor camps.id.although fedorenko admitted in his testimony at trial that he once followed orders and shot in the general direction of prisoners fleeing a concentration camp,fedorenko maintained that he usually just stood watch as a perimeter guard and that he was compelled to provide such service against his will.id.at.
the supreme court,however,found that fedorenko conduct during the war would have rendered him ineligible to receive a visa,because the dpa made all those who assisted in the persecution of civilians ineligibl
