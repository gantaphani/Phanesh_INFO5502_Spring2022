this case was transferred to our court by an order of the united states district court for the southern district of new york gerard lynch,judge,which found,pursuant to b,that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the nationality claim made in jose napoleon habeas corpus petition.as we explain below,resolution of the complex procedural and jurisdictional questions originally presented by the case is no longer necessary in light of the enactment,on may,of the real id act of,stat.the real id act eliminates habeas corpus review of orders of removal and requires that any petition pending in the district court at the time of its enactment be transferred to the court of appeals in which the petition could have been properly brought as a petition for review from a final order of removal under.we thus construe case as a petition for review from the january,order of the board of immigration appeals bia and reach the merits of claim without considering the district court jurisdictional ruling 
seeks to avoid removal by arguing that he can demonstrate that he owes permanent allegiance to the united states and thus qualify as a national under section a b of the immigration and nationality act ina,a b.that provision defines national of the united states as a person who,though not a citizen of the united states,owes permanent allegiance to the united states.we hold that a b itself does not provide a means by which an individual can become a national,and deny petition accordingly.
background 
in april,a native of the dominican republic,was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident.in november,he voluntarily enlisted in the army.served from to,for three years as a regular and for five years as a reservist.while in the army,he submitted an application for citizenship,but the application apparently was never processed several years after finishing his military service,in may,was convicted in new york state court of possessing and attempting to sell cocaine,for which he was sentenced to three concurrent terms of imprisonment,the longest of which was a term of seven years to life.in may,the immigration and naturalization service ins served with a notice to appear,charging that he was subject to removal from the united states both because he was an alien who had been convicted of a offense,see a b i,and because he was an alien who had been convicted of an aggravated felony,as that term is defined in a,see a a iii.in december,hearings commenced in immigration court,at which was represented by an accredited immigration representative.in his defense,claimed that the convictions that provided the basis for his removal were still pending on direct appeal.on december,the immigration judge ij agreed to suspend removal proceedings in order to determine whether this claim was true.
while the proceedings were suspended,in january,applied to the ins for naturalization,indicating on his application form that he qualified for citizenship based on his service in the army.on june,when removal hearings resumed,the ij determined that convictions were not pending on appeal.then asked that removal proceedings be terminated pursuant to former f stating that he had applied for naturalization and claiming that he could demonstrate prima facie eligibility for citizenship.the ij held that was not prima facie eligible because his drug convictions precluded him from showing the good moral character required for naturalization,and,further,because there were no unusual or compelling humanitarian reasons to terminate the proceedings under f.the ij then ordered removed to the dominican republic.
on july,appealed the ij decision to the bia,arguing that the ij erred in finding him prima facie ineligible for naturalization.on july,the bia rejected his appeal on the grounds that he had failed to attach proof of service.resubmitted his papers on july,only to have the bia,on october,dismiss his appeal as untimely.he thereafter filed numerous motions for reconsideration,all of which were rejected on procedural grounds.
on december,filed a pro se habeas corpus petition in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,claiming for the first time that he was a national of the united states,not an alien,and thus could not be removed.the district court appointed counsel to represent,and,upon receiving a joint stipulation and order of settlement and withdrawal from and the government,allowed to withdraw his habeas petition without prejudice,vacated all of the bia previous orders,and remanded the case to the bia for consideration on the merits of the claim of nationality raised in habeas petition.see marquez ins,civ.
following the district court order,submitted to the bia a motion to terminate removal proceedings,arguing that his service in the army,efforts to acquire citizenship,and other evidence,demonstrated that he owed permanent allegiance to the united states,and was thus a national of the united states as defined by a b.on january,the bia rejected submission,construing it as a motion to reopen,and finding that since its october,order had dismissed appeal of the ij order of removal as untimely,jurisdiction over a motion to reopen still lay with the ij.the bia order did not address the fact that the district court remand order had purported to vacate the bia october,order,or otherwise refer to the district court remand.
on february,petitioned our court for review of the bia january,order,characterizing it as a final order of removal.additionally,on march,filed a new habeas corpus petition in the district court pursuant to,asserting that he could not be removed from the united states,because he was a national and the ij had erroneously found that he was not prima facie eligible for naturalization as a citizen based on his aggravated felony conviction.on may,the district court held that,under b,only the court of appeals could hear nationality claim,and that the district court therefore did have not jurisdiction to entertain this claim as part of a petition.the district court accordingly purported to dismiss petition,and transferred it to our court under.see ashcroft,wl june,dist.lexis,at.appealed.
we subsequently consolidated the case as it was transferred to us by the district court appeal from the district court decision dismissing his petition and petition for review of the january,bia order.
discussion 
nationality claima.jurisdiction 
the district court transferred petition to our court on the theory that b bars district courts from adjudicating in the first instance claims of nationality,when raised as a defense to removal.the court found that b on its face,appears to provide that nationality claims shall be presented to the court of appeals in the first instance,and transferred to the district court only if the court of appeals determines that the petition involves genuine issues of material fact,dist.lexis,at.
argues that the district court erred in light of the supreme court decision in ins cyr,d,and our own decisions in liu ins,cir,and wang ashcroft,cir.in his view,these cases establish that habeas corpus review remains available unless congress has explicitly abrogated such review by referring to habeas corpus or in the statute said to eliminate it.neither b,nor any other part of,contained such a reference at the time brought his habeas petition in the district court.the government argues,following the reasoning of the district court,that the rule in cyr applies only where abrogating habeas would leave a petitioner with no other means of review under the statutory scheme.because b provides for review of nationality claims in the court of appeals,the government contends,we should interpret the statute as foreclosing review in the district court.
this question was of considerably greater significance when we heard argument than it is now,as we issue our decision.that is because on may,the real id act of,stat,became law.section a b of the act,a unequivocally eliminates habeas corpus review of orders of removal,with a limited exception not relevant here.section b makes this provision effective immediately and applicable to cases,like,in which the final administrative order of removal,deportation,or exclusion was issued before,on,or after the date of enactment.section c requires that any case pending in district court on the date of enactment that was brought challenging an order of removal under the general habeas statute,be transferred to the court of appeals for the circuit in which a petition for review could have been properly filed.the court of appeals is to treat the transferred case as if it had been filed pursuant to a petition for review under,except that the deadline ordinarily imposed on such petitions by b does not apply.real id act c.
argument that does not contain a clear statement abrogating relief has thus been answered by the new provisions added to by the real id act.moreover,even if we were to determine that the district court,at the time of its decision,erred in transferring habeas petition to our court,it would be pointless to remand this case to the district court,as the district court would be obliged by section c of the act to transfer the case back to us for resolution on the merits we thus decline to decide the primary jurisdictional question presented by this case,as our jurisdiction no longer depends upon its resolution,and as any answer in this regard would have little,if any,relevance to future litigation,given the real id act elimination of relief as a means to review orders of removal 
accordingly,we treat transferred petition as a petition for review filed under b,and proceed to the merits.langhorne ashcroft,cir.
argues that he is not an alien and thus can not be removed from the united states for his crimes.see a b i any alien convicted of controlled substance offense after admission to united states is deportable a a iii any alien convicted of aggravated felony after admission to united states is deportable.the term alien is defined in this context as any person not a citizen or national of the united states.a.acknowledges that he is not a citizen,but he claims to be a national of the united states.the term national of the united states means either a citizen of the united states or a person who,though not a citizen of the united states,owes permanent allegiance to the united states.a a b.
claims that,although he is not a citizen,he owes permanent allegiance to the united states,and thus has acquired nationality under a b.the statute,as he reads it,creates an independent avenue to national status one can become a national without citizenship,a national solely by manifesting permanent allegiance to the united states.he asserts that his enrollment and service in the army which required that he swear allegiance to the constitution,his application for naturalization which required that he swear he was willing to take an oath of allegiance to the united states,his registration for the selective service,his complete immersion in american society,and his lack of ties to the dominican republic together demonstrate that he owes permanent allegiance to the united states 
we have previously indicated that construction of a b is erroneous,but have not addressed the issue at length.in oliver ins,cir per curiam,the petitioner,as a defense to deportation,argued that she qualified as a national under a b because she had resided exclusively in the united states for twenty years,and thus owe d allegiance to the united states.without extensively analyzing the statute,we found that the petitioner could not be a national as that term is understood in our law.id.we pointed out that the petitioner still owed allegiance to canada her country of birth and citizenship because she had not taken the naturalization oath,to renounce and abjure absolutely and entirely all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign state of which the petitioner was before a subject or citizen.id.at quoting ina a,a.in making this observation,we did not suggest that the petitioner in oliver could have qualified as a national by affirmatively renouncing her allegiance to canada or otherwise swearing permanent allegiance to the united states.in fact,in the following sentence we said that title iii,chapter of the ina indicates that,with a few exceptions not here pertinent,one can satisfy a b only at birth thereafter the road lies through naturalization,which leads to becoming a citizen and not merely a national.id.at.
our conclusion in oliver,which we now reaffirm,is consistent with the clear meaning of a b,read in the context of the general statutory scheme.the provision is a subsection of a.section a defines various terms as they are used in our immigration and nationality laws,tit,ch,codified at.the subsection placement indicates that it was designed to describe the attributes of a person who has already been deemed a national elsewhere in chapter of the,rather than to establish a means by which one may obtain that status.for example,the only statute in chapter expressly conferring national status on anyone,describes four categories of persons who are nationals,but not citizens,of the united states at birth.all of these categories concern persons who were either born in an outlying possession of the united states,see,or found in an outlying possession at a young age,see id,or who are the children of nationals,see id.thus,establishes a category of persons who qualify as nationals those who qualify,in turn,are described by a b as owing permanent allegiance to the united states.in this context the term permanent allegiance merely describes the nature of the relationship between nationals and the united states,a relationship that has already been created by another statutory provision.see barber gonzales.it is conceded that respondent was born a national of the united states that as such he owed permanent allegiance to the united states philippines independence act of,a,stat.requiring the philippines to establish a constitution providing that pending the final and complete withdrawal of the sovereignty of the united states,a ll citizens of the philippine islands shall owe allegiance to the united states.
other parts of chapter indicate,as well,that a b describes,rather than confers,nationality.the provision immediately following a defines naturalization as the conferring of nationality of a state upon a person after birth,by any means whatsoever.a.if were correct,therefore,one would expect to find naturalization by a demonstration of permanent allegiance in that part of the entitled nationality through naturalization,see ina tit,ch,subch.iii,pt.ii,codified at.yet nowhere in this elaborate set of naturalization requirements which contemplate the filing by the petitioner,and adjudication by the attorney general,of an application for naturalization,see,did congress even remotely indicate that a demonstration of permanent allegiance alone would allow,much less require,the attorney general to confer national status on an individual.
finally,the interpretation of the statute underlying our decision in oliver comports with the historical meaning of the term national as it is used in chapter.the term which as a b and indicate,includes,but is broader than,citizen was originally intended to account for the inhabitants of certain said to belong to the united states,including the territories acquired from spain during the war,namely the philippines,guam,and puerto ricoin the early twentieth century,who were not granted citizenship,yet were deemed to owe permanent allegiance to the united states and recognized as members of the national community in a way that distinguished them from aliens.see charles gordon et,immigration law and procedure,b see also rabang boyd,d the filipinos,as nationals,owed an obligation of permanent allegiance to this country in the philippine independence act of,the congress granted full and complete independence to the philippines,and necessarily severed the obligation of permanent allegiance owed by filipinos who were nationals of the united states.the term national developed within a specific historical context and denotes a particular legal status.the phrase owes permanent allegiance in a b is thus a term of art that denotes a legal status for which individuals have never been abl
