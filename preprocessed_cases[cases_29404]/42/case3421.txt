jose angel gomez zarate gomez petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia dismissing his appeal from the immigration judge ij decision pretermitting his application for cancellation of removal.gomez contends that his departure to mexico which occurred after he attempted to reenter the united states but was stopped by border patrol agents,arrested,charged and convicted of possessing a false identification document,and taken to the mexican border in immigration and naturalization service ins custody did not interrupt his continuous physical presence for purposes of cancellation of removal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we deny the petition.
gomez is a native and citizen of mexico.he first entered the united states in january of.in february of,he went to mexico for two or three weeks.gomez attempted to reenter the united states,and at the border,gave the immigration officer a notification of birth registration from the state of new mexico.according to the record of deportable alien form i documenting his attempted reentry,gomez at first claimed that he was a citizen,but on further questioning,admitted that he was a mexican citizen and that he had no documents allowing him to enter or legally remain in the united states.
gomez was then arrested and charged in the district court for the district of arizona with two offenses falsely claiming citizenship,and possessing a false identification document.gomez pleaded guilty to count,possession of a false identification document,in violation of a,b count was dismissed.the district court sentenced gomez to two years of supervised probation,but stated,since it is expected that the immigration authorities will cause the defendant to leave the united states of america,no reports shall be required of defendant.after pleading guilty,gomez went to jail for five days.he was then returned to ins custody,put into a transport filled with other aliens,taken to the mexican border,and released.the next day,gomez crossed into the united states on foot.
on august,the ins filed a notice to appear nta charging gomez with removability under a c i.at a hearing before the ij,gomez conceded removability,applied for cancellation of removal and requested voluntary departure in the alternative.the ij pretermitted gomez application for cancellation of removal,finding that gomez departure to mexico interrupted his continuous physical presence and made him ineligible for cancellation of removal.the ij granted gomez voluntary departure.gomez appealed to the bia.
on october,the bia remanded the matter to the ij.the bia found that the evidentiary record was insufficiently developed for it to conclude that gomez return to mexico meaningfully interrupted his continuous physical presence.citing vasquez lopez ashcroft,cir,and in re romalez alcaide,bia en banc,the bia instructed the parties to present evidence on remand on whether gomez departed under threat of proceedings so as to terminate his continuous physical presence.
at a hearing after the remand,gomez testified about his departure.he testified that he did not recall discussing leaving the united states before the district court.he also testified that no immigration official explained to him that he could go to immigration court and fight his case and that he was not given the option of returning voluntarily to mexico.gomez believed that he had no choice but to board the bus and go back to mexico.
the ij again pretermitted gomez application for cancellation of removal because gomez did not establish the requisite continuous physical presence.the ij found that gomez departure was clearly different from a mere at the border,thus distinguishing this case from in re avilez nava,bia en banc.the ij again granted gomez voluntary departure.gomez again appealed to the bia.
the bia dismissed gomez appeal.citing juarez ramos gonzales,cir,and avilez nava,the bia found gomez departure more akin to expedited removal than to a mere turnaround at the border.the bia stated that it agreed with the ij that the process of being arrested by border patrol while attempting to enter the united states,detained,convicted of a crime related to the attempted entry,and returned to mexico in dhs custody is sufficiently formal to constitute a break in the respondent otherwise continuous physical presence.the bia reinstated the ij grant of voluntary departure.gomez filed a timely petition for review in this court.
we review for substantial evidence the bia decision that an alien did not establish ten years of continuous physical presence in the united states.gutierrez mukasey,cir.under the substantial evidence standard,a petitioner can obtain reversal only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion.id.
to be eligible for cancellation of removal,an applicant must ha ve been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than years immediately preceding the date of such application.b a.service with an nta ends an alien accrual of continuous physical presence.id.d.because gomez was served with an nta in august of,he is eligible for cancellation of removal only if he can establish continuous physical presence in the united states since august of.
deportation under a formal exclusion or deportation order or an expedited removal order breaks an applicant continuous physical presence.landin zavala gonzales,cir juarez ramos,at holding that a slightly more formal procedure at the border an expedited removal does interrupt continuous physical presence.a departure under threat of removal proceedings also interrupts continuous physical presence.vasquez lopez ashcroft,cir per curiam romalez,at b.
on the other hand,under our precedent,continuous physical presence is not interrupted if a person is merely stopped at the border and turned away without any more formality.valadez munoz holder,cir see also tapia.gonzales,cir.the bia has stated the rule regarding turnarounds at the border as follows 
a n immigration official refusal to admit an alien at a land border port of entry will not constitute a break in the alien continuous physical presence,unless there is evidence that the alien was formally excluded or made subject to an order of expedited removal,was offered and accepted the opportunity to withdraw his or her application for admission,or was subjected to any other formal,documented process pursuant to which the alien was determined to be inadmissible to the united states.
avilez nava,at.
gomez contends that the proceedings after his departure to mexico were not the sort of formal,documented process that breaks continuous physical presence.we disagree.
the evidence required to show a formal,documented process pursuant to which the alien was determined to be inadmissible to the united states sufficient to terminate an alien continuous physical presence will vary from case to case.in avilez nava,the bia stated that such evidence might include,among other things,testimony or documentary evidence of a legally enforced refusal of admission and return such as a record of alien form i.id.at.we have held that the making of a record of a turnaround,or the acts of photographing and fingerprinting,do not alone constitute sufficient formality to break an alien continuous physical presence.valadez munoz,at tapia,at see also juarez ramos,at.something must be legally added to a simple turnaround,and as we have stressed,some formality is required.valadez munoz,at.
in valadez munoz,we rejected the argument that an alien stopped at the border and ultimately turned away necessarily continues to accrue continuous physical presence.at.in that case,valadez sought to use a false birth certificate and driver license to reenter the united states.id.at.after questioning from immigration inspectors,valadez admitted his true identity.id.he was given the option of either seeing an ij or withdrawing his application for admission and voluntarily returning to mexico he chose the latter.id.at.though this procedure may not have been as formal as an actual completed proceeding that results in an exclusion order or in an expedited removal order,we held that it was formal nonetheless and th
