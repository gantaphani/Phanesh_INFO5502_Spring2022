according to the government,ramon peters,a lawful permanent resident alien,became deportable because of his conviction for felony solicitation to transport marijuana for sale under arizona law.because we agree that peters violated a law relating to a controlled substance,he was removable under a b i.accordingly,we lack jurisdiction and dismiss this petition.
background 
ramon anthony peters,a native and citizen of jamaica,was admitted to the united states in july as a nonimmigrant visitor,but he soon adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident.on may,peters was convicted in arizona state court for felony solicitation to transport marijuana for sale and was sentenced to four years probation.the immigration and naturalization service ins initiated removal proceedings against peters under a a iii,rendering deportable a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission.a a iii.after being denied bond by an immigration judge,peters appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia,and the bia reversed because it did not consider peters prior conviction an aggravated felony.ins then withdrew the aggravated felony charge and filed a new deportation charge against peters as an 
alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of or a conspiracy or attempt to violate any law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title,other than a single offense involving possession for one own use of grams or less of marijuana 
peters moved to terminate the removal proceedings based on the ninth circuit decision that a conviction for solicitation to possess cocaine under arizona law did not render an alien removable under a b i.see ins,cir.peters proceedings,however,occurred in oakdale,louisiana,in the fifth circuit,and the immigration judge refused to be bound by ninth circuit precedent.instead,the immigration judge applied a bia decision contrary to.see matter of beltran,bia.on appeal to the bia,peters again relied on the ninth circuit opinion and also contended that the bia earlier decision in his bond proceeding barred his deportation based on res judicata principles.the bia rejected peters arguments.he has appealed the resulting removal order.
ii.discussion 
notwithstanding the limited scope of judicial review of deportation orders authorized by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,stat.iirira,this court retains jurisdiction to review facts concerning our jurisdiction.reno,cir.specifically,we have jurisdiction to determine whether the petitioner is an alien who is deportable for committing an offense that bars this court review.smalley ashcroft,cir citing nehme ins,cir.if he is,then we lack jurisdiction to consider other issues.
our jurisdiction here turns on whether peters arizona conviction for solicitation to transport marijuana for sale constitutes 
a violation of or a conspiracy or attempt to violate any law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance 
a b i there are three components to this determination whether peters arizona conviction constitutes a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance whether the ninth circuit interpretation of the interplay of the federal and state statutes in is correct and whether a solicitation offense is excluded from the purview of this statute.this court reviews the federal statute de novo,but if congress language is silent or ambiguous on the question at issue,as we conclude it is,we must defer to a reasonable construction of the language by the bia.see chevron,natural resources defense council,d ins,d applying chevron deference to bia interpretation of immigration laws.in regard to chevron deference,however,we follow this court decision in omagah ashcroft,cir,which deferred to bia on the interpretation of immigration law but not of federal or state criminal laws.but see,supra,refusing to defer to bia at all on the construction of a b i.
initially,we agree with bia conclusion that peters violated a law relating to a controlled substance.peters judgment of conviction,dated may,states 
it is the judgment of the court that the defendant is guilty of the crime of count i,amended,solicitation to transport marijuana for sale a class felony,and offense,in violation of a,committed on or about january.
emphasis added.under arizona revised statute a,a person shall not knowingly t ransport for sale marijuana,and under,
a person commits solicitation if,with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of a felony such person solicits another person to engage in specific conduct which would constitute the felony or which would establish the other complicity in its commission.
because peters was convicted of a class felony,the relevant provisions indicate that he solicited the commission of a class felony and that the underlying offense involved at least two pounds or more of marijuana.see.stat.b solicitation is a class felony if the offense solicited is a class felony.stat.b a person who violates subsection a,paragraph of this section involving an amount of marijuana having a weight of two pounds or more is guilty of a class felony.
the arizona statutes thus expressly define the offense of solicitation in the context of another underlying illegal act.a person can not be convicted of felony solicitation without the specific intent to promote or facilitate the commission of another felony.moreover,pursuant to the statutes,peters penalty was directly based on the severity of the felony crime that he solicited had he solicited the transportation of a lesser amount of drugs,he would have been subject to a lesser penalty.in this legislative framework,and particularly on the state record of peters conviction,it makes no sense to speak of a conviction for solicitation in the is only a crime insofar as an individual acts with the intent to get another to commit a particular underlying felony.
that peters was convicted of soliciting another individual to transport two or more pounds of marijuana for sale on its face constitutes a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance.the fact that peters did not personally transport the marijuana does not exclude him from having committed a offense this understanding of the relating to language is informed by congress consistent effort to target aliens who are involved in activities.as the ninth circuit acknowledged,congress has clearly spoken against aliens who abuse the hospitality of the united states by committing crimes,at citing a variety of statutes enacted over the last two decades that place substantial procedural and substantive burdens upon aliens convicted of offenses see also ins,cir we have construed the relating to language broadly in the past.moreover,the supreme court has traditionally afforded an expansive reading of related to.see,district of columbia greater.bd.of trade,d indeed,it has been reiterated so often that petitioners did not challenge the proposition that the statute in this case related to respondent erisa plan.
peters urges the opposite result for reasons that originate in.first,he contends,an alien violates a law relating to a controlled substance only if the underlying convicting statute,read without reference to any other statutes,directly refers to controlled substances.see also,cir citing for this proposition.second,because the statute parenthetically includes two generic crimes,conspiracy and attempt,it necessarily excludes the crime of solicitation,at.peters posits these positions as a plain language interpretation of a b i.id.we disagree with all of these points.
as mapped out above,peters solicitation conviction expressly incorporated the underlying illegal delivery of over two pounds of marijuana.the basis for the ninth circuit apparently contrary conclusion is unclear.it may have been derived from lesser crime of solicitation to possess cocaine,which constitutes a class felony,see,supra at,as compared with peters conviction of a class felony solicitation to transport marijuana.alternatively,the conv
