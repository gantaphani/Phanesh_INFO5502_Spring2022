petitioner is an alien who has been apprehended by agents of immigration and customs enforcement ice for illegal entry into the united states and placed in removal proceedings.he seeks to characterize certain aspects of these proceedings as constitutional defects that deprive him of his right to due process of law.we deny in part and dismiss in part his petition for review.
background 
on may,ice agents arrested petitioner cecilio at his parents home in aurora,illinois,and served him with a notice to appear nta in immigration court to commence removal proceedings.the nta charged that petitioner was removable under a a i because he was an alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled.the nta bore the heading department of justice,immigration and naturalization service.it was signed by robin buckley as the issuing officer in chicago,illinois.the nta ordered the recipient to appear before an immigration judge at a time and date to be set in the future.
following the arrest,ice agents filled out a department of justice record of alien,known as form,which explained that appellant,an associate member of the aurora faction of the surenos gang,was rounded up as part of operation dismantle.form further specified that,a native and citizen of mexico,entered the united states on foot on february,twenty miles west of el paso,texas.he had previously been apprehended on the border and voluntarily removed to mexico on january.form also stated that after agents arrested at midnight on may,he resisted arrest and was hostile and uncooperative with all officers regarding the whereabout of his uncle,jose verdin.
petitioner requested a bond hearing before an immigration judge ij.as part of its response,on june,the government submitted a copy of the nta to immigration judge george katsivalas.submitted his high school diploma and transcript a picture of himself in a cap and gown a letter from the pastor of saint nicholas catholic church stating that attends mass every sunday with his parents a certificate of achievement dated october,and a certificate for completion of middle school at simmons middle school,dated june.
the ij ordered released upon posting an bond.per petitioner request,ij katsivalas also continued the case for additional attorney preparation.on november,appeared before immigration judge john brahos,represented by his current counsel.petitioner advised the court that he would not be admitting any of the allegations against him and moved to suppress and exclude form,the nta,and their contents on the ground that the government procured the evidence in violation of fourth and fifth amendment rights.along with the motion,petitioner presented an affidavit where he swore that ice agents lacked a warrant for his arrest.petitioner also stated that during the arrest,the agents mistreated me.they yelled at me and handcuffed my hands behind my back,and lifted them up,and pushed me out the door,it felt like my arms were going to break.i was very afraid.they had guns.they did not advise me of my rights.the affidavit went on to state 
when they the ice agents took me to broadview staging area and detention center,two officers demanded that i sign some papers,but i refused.a man yelled at me and said sign the fucking papers.you do have any rights.a woman yelled at me,and also swore at me and told me to sign the papers.
i was not charged with committing a crime.
i have never been arrested before the arrest i have described.
i am married to a united states citizen,and i am the father of a united states citizen child.i believe that my rights were violated.i was treated like an animal.
on petitioner motion,the ij continued the case and held a substantive hearing on april.the government planned to present only the nt a,form,and testimony by to make their case,but petitioner moved to suppress the form on the grounds that it was filed in violation of local timing rules and was procured through unconstitutional means.immigration judge brahos denied petitioner motion to suppress,explaining that even if taken at face value,affidavit fails to describe misconduct egregious enough to justify suppression.the ij then went to find petitioner,who refused to answer any questions for fear of,a removable alien on the basis of the combination of a negative inference drawn from his silence with the uncontroverted contents of the presumptively reliable form brahos determined that the level of detail in the permitted the inference that himself provided the information relating to his alienage,and that petitioner did not present enough evidence to show that the government obtained the information in the through coercion or duress.
the ij then dismissed as merit less objection that the form bears the heading of ins,which no longer exists,explaining that in d and,the statute transferring ins removal functions to the department of homeland security dhs specifically provided that any reference to ins in regulations and delegations of authority should be read to mean dhs.finally,although the ij drew an adverse inference from refusal to testify,he acknowledged that silence alone is not sufficient to establish a prima facie case of removability under matter of guevara.
finding that the government satisfied its burden of proof,the ij then considered whether respondent could show that he was in the united states lawfully.since stayed silent and his affidavit said nothing about lawful admission,ij brahos found him removable as charged.he then went on to deny petitioner request for voluntary departure.
petitioner filed a timely appeal from the order to the board of immigration appeals bia.he requested that a pan el rule on the issues,but on february,the bia issued a decision wholly adopting and affirming the ij decision.it denied request for review because petitioner arguments did not fall into any of the categories entitled to such a procedure under e.the bia found no evidence of bias or partiality in the ij,concluded that he did not abuse his discretion in denying voluntary departure,and rejected petitioner attempts to portray the nta as defective.finally,the bia held that removal to mexico did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the eighth amendment.subsequently,the bia denied timely motions to reconsider and reopen the matter.he now appeals from both orders.
ii.discussion 
where,as here,the board of immigration appeals adopts the decision of the immigration judge as a whole,we review the original ij decision.rodriguez galicia gonzales,cir.this case implicates four separate standards of review.first,we scrutinize de novo the ij determination that admission of form did not violate petitioner due process rights because it is a question of law.boci gonzales,f d,cir.second,we give great deference to the ij factual findings,deeming them conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary b b see also ins.that is,we reverse the agency decision only if the record compels a different result,and not simply because we are convinced that we would have decided the case differently.hassan holder,cir.third,we review the board denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider for abuse of discretion.kebe gonzales,cir.in doing so,we take into account the strong public interest in bringing litigation to a close,ins abudu,and thus disfavor reopening.see selimi ashcroft,cir.accordingly,we uphold the decision of the bia unless it was made without a rational explanation,inexplicably departed from established policies,or rested on an impermissible basis such as invidious discrimination against a particular race or group.awad ashcroft,cir.finally,we lack jurisdiction to review discretionary decisions by the department of justice with respect to requests for voluntary departure.see f sofinet ins,cir.
petitioner sets forth a litany of complains about the ij decision,but these can be condensed into four main contentions that the ij erred in denying petitioner motion to suppress form that the government did not adequately prove petitioner alienage that some aspect of petitioner arrest and subsequent deportation hearings violated his right to due process of law and that the bia denial of petitioner motion to reopen violated his right to due process as well as his right to equal protection.the rest of his arguments are either redundant or not properly presented in this appeal.
motion to suppress 
the ij did not err in denying motion to suppress form.since the fourth amendment protects t he right of the people to be secure in their persons,houses,papers,and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures,but does not specify an enforcement mechanism for its violations,the supreme court has articulated the exclusionary rule.said rule,when applicable,forbids the use of improperly obtained evidence at trial and seeks to safeguard fourth amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect.herring united states,citations omitted.exclusion is a relatively narrow remedy,however.it is used in only a subset of all constitutional excessive force in making an arrest or seizure is not a basis for the exclusion of evidence.evans poskon,cir.
more importantly,removal proceedings are civil,not criminal,and the exclusionary rule does not generally apply to them.see ins,krasilych.holder,cir.in,the supreme court left open the possibility that the exclusionary rule may apply where there have been egregious violations of fourth amendment or other liberties that might transgress notions of fundamental fairness and undermine the probative value of the evidence obtained.at see also ins,cir.claims do not reach this level.even taken at face value,petitioner affidavit alleges what can best be characterized as very minor physical abuse coupled with aggressive questioning.questions and verbal demands that a person sign documents are not themselves searches and seizures that could violate the fourth amendment,muehler mena,at united states childs,cir en banc.this observation is especially true here,where such entreaties proved unsuccessful because petitioner refused to comply.as for potential physical misconduct,handcuffing an alien who resisted arrest is certainly not the egregious behavior contemplated by.
form is a presumptively reliable administrative document.since petitioner did not demonstrate any inaccuracy in its contents,the ij acted appropriately in considering it as evidence of alienage.see barradas holder,cir absent any indication that a form contains information that is manifestly incorrect or was obtained by duress,the bia has found the form to be inherently trustworthy and admissible as evidence.we have agreed with that position.citing in re,ins,cir.
also argues that he was arrested without a warrant,but the record does not support this contention.petitioner then claims that the nta and accompanying warrant were issued by the immigration and naturalization service ins,which was part of the department of justice,and thus could not authorize action by ice agents,who fall under the umbrella of the department of homeland security and actually carried out the arrest.the ij correctly found this assertion to be vacuous based on both explicit statutory transfer of authority from the ins to the dhs,and our own caselaw.sosnovskaia gonzales,cir diallo ashcroft,cir.in any event,warrantless arrests of suspected illegal aliens are permissible in some situations,see,and there is no evidence that the government violated procedures associated with such an arrest in a way prejudicial to the petitioner in this case.see,at t he supreme court has held that where an administrative regulatory violation does not adversely affect a petitioner substantive rights an exclusionary remedy is not available.the fact that the nta left the time and date of a deportation hearing to be determined at a future date did not render it defective because subsequent documents set out the requisite information.dababneh.gonzales,cir.
finally,to the extent that affidavit could be read to mean that ice agents did not adequately notify him of his rights,such an error would not make otherwise voluntary statements inadmissible.see,at.there is no evidence of coercion in the record or the motion to suppress,so the ij did not offend the constitution by admitting form into evidence.appellant concludes by arguing that the ij erred in admitting the form because it was part of the record during the bond hearing,but the relevant regulations do not prevent the ij from considering the same pieces of evidence during both stages of adjudication.a breach of the applicable procedures would be harmless here anyway,because petitioner counsel had months to review the form.
due process right to a hearing 
next argues that ij brahos demonstrated bias and irreverence of a degree sufficient to deprive him of due process guaranteed by the fifth amendment.see plyer doe.we have long held that if an applicant in an immigration court has not received a meaningful opportunity to be heard,she has been denied due process,and we must grant her petition and remand for further proceedings.floroiu gonzales,cir.to obtain relief,the petitioner must produce some evidence indicating that the denial of due process actually had the potential for affecting the outcome of the proceedings.id.
petitioner claim that the ij was impermissibly partial to the government,essentially amounts to an ad hominem attack on the judge.that is,cites two cases where we criticized ij brahos for his conduct in immigration proceedings and argues that his behavior in the present case was similarly problematic.our review of the record shows this contention to be baseless.
petitioner states that the fact that the ij overruled all of petitioner objections demonstrates a disregard for the evidence on behalf of the judge.petitioner also points to the following offensive comment by the ij as an indicator of his bias 
but as a as you recall,alienage is not suppressible.all right.so we have an alien before the court and as you recall as a euphemism,not tending at all to insult the respondent sic.once the ins or the department of homeland security,in the stream,locates a alien sic and they pick him out of the stream,they do throw him back into the stream.
unsurprisingly,does not attempt to explain which aspect of the remark he considers to be inappropriate.when the bia reviewed this argument,it determined that ij brahos did not intentionally characterize as a fish and that any unintentional connotation was not enough to render the hearing ineffective.we agree.
the two cases where we found the ij behavior to be so inappropriate as to violate the due process clause stand in stark contrast to the matter before us today.first,in bosede mukasey,cir,ij brahos gave short shrift to arguments made by an petitioner that if he was deported to nigeria,he would be imprisoned pursuant to a decree requiring all nigerian citizens convicted of drug crimes abroad to serve sentences decree.bosede also introduced evidence that the death rate of individuals in nigerian custody is high because of poor nutrition,bad living conditions,and trivial access to medical care state department reports in the record showed that these circumstances have led to the death of at least one person in prison and that all prisoners in nigeria are severely mistreated.finally,bosede testified that when he independently traveled to nigeria in,the government discovered his infection status,detained him on arrival,and released him only on the condition that he stay in a hotel they specified.fearing for his life,he ended up bribing an official to get out of the country undetected.
the predicate offenses for bosede deportation were two instances of possession of subgram quantities of cocaine and one conviction for drinking liquor at a grocery store prior to paying for it.nonetheless,the ij issued a removal order finding,without elaboration,that bosede convictions were particularly serious crimes that rendered petitioner,a married father of two,ineligible for cancellation of removal.the ij then went on to deny petitioner convention against torture claim and state that he would order removal even without a statutory bar to contest.the ij found irrelevant evidence showing that nigerian prisons were decrepit to the point that an prisoner could face the po
