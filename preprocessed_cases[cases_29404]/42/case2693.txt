ricardo appeals the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia which found him removable from the united states for committing the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor,and statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief from removal.argues that he did not commit sexual abuse of a minor under a a,and that the application of the recently enacted provisions of the immigration and nationality act ina adding sexual abuse of a minor to the list of aggravated felonies and making ineligible to apply for relief from removal violated his rights to due process and equal protection.we find that did commit sexual abuse of a minor and that he fails to raise any substantial constitutional claims.therefore,we dismiss his appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
background 
is a mexican national who was granted lawful permanent residence in the united states in.in,he was convicted of sexual assault under,ch,a and a.section a defines sexual assault as commit ting an act of sexual penetration by the use of force or threat of force,and a defines it as commit ting an act of sexual penetration and the accused knew that the victim was unable to understand the nature of the act or was unable to give knowing consent.the record indicates that victim was a girl.
on december,the immigration and nationalization service ins issued a notice to appear placing in removal proceedings.the ins charged him as removable because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony under ina a a iii,codified at a a iii.specifically,the ins charged him with committing sexual abuse of a minor,which is an aggravated felony under a a of the ina,codified at a a.
on february,attended a hearing before an immigration judge ij,during which he conceded alienage but denied removability.the ij found him removable as charged.the ij also concluded that because was an alien convicted of an aggravated felony,he was statutorily ineligible for discretionary cancellation of removal under a,and that he d id not appear to be entitled to any other relief from removal.appealed to the bia,arguing that his illinois convictions for sexual assault did not constitute sexual abuse of a minor and that the application of amendments to the ina which classified sexual abuse of a minor as an aggravated felony and removed his eligibility to apply for discretionary relief from removal was impermissibly retroactive,and therefore violated his due process rights.the bia dismissed his appeal,finding that his illinois convictions counted as sexual abuse of a minor,and declined to address his constitutional claim.
appeals the bia decision,reasserting the arguments that he made before the bia,and adding the contention that h of the ina violates his rights to equal protection under the due process clause of the fifth amendment by making lawful permanent resident aliens who commit aggravated felonies statutorily ineligible to receive a waiver of inadmissibility,while leaving illegal aliens who commit the same offenses eligible to apply for such relief.the ins argues that we lack jurisdiction to hear the appeal because is an alien who has been ordered removed as an aggravated felon and because his constitutional claims are meritless.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
as a preliminary matter,the government argues that a c of the ina,codified at a c,strips us of jurisdiction to hear claims.that section provides 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section a or a a iii,b,c,or d of this title,or any offense covered by section a a ii of this title for which both predicate offenses are,without regard to their date of commission,otherwise covered by section a a i of this title.
section a a iii provides that a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.therefore,a c generally eliminates our jurisdiction to review any final order of deportation against an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.however,we retain jurisdiction to determine whether we have is,to determine whether an alien criminal conviction is indeed an aggravated felony under the ina,thereby triggering the jurisdictional bar of a c.see,xiong ins,cir yang ins,cir.moreover,in addressing a similar jurisdictional bar announced in an earlier enacted amendment to the ina,we have held that an alien may challenge his deportability on constitutional grounds directly in the courts of appeals,provided that he raises a substantial constitutional claim.see reno,cir singh reno,cir laguerre reno,cir.thus,while we honor congress intent to curtail judicial review of final deportation orders for certain disfavored criminals,we have retained jurisdiction over any substantial constitutional claims raised as a safety valve to prevent bizarre miscarriages of justice.see laguerre,at.however,we have recognized that such direct review of constitutional claims is an exceptional procedure,see singh,at,which is available only when the alien raises substantial constitutional claims.see,at.thus,in addressing appeal,we must first determine whether the bia correctly concluded that was an alien deportable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony.if we answer that question in the affirmative,we must then consider whether has nevertheless raised substantial constitutional claims,and we may assert jurisdiction over claims only if we find that he has as both of these inquiries are jurisdictional in nature,we review them de novo.see,ins,cir.
sexual abuse of a minor 
argues that he is not deportable because his state conviction for sexual assault does not constitute the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor under a a.he notes that the crime sexual abuse of a minor is defined at a as knowingly engaging in a sex act with a person who is at least but not yet,and who is at least four years younger than the offender.he argues that the bia was obligated to use definition of sexual abuse of a minor,since this is the only definition of that exact phrase contained in the.because victim was not between the ages of and,he maintains that he did not commit sexual abuse of a minor.he also notes that the principle of lenity,which is applicable to deportation proceedings,see ins,d,requires us to construe a a narrowly and to resolve all matters of doubt as to its interpretation in his favor.he contends that the bia violated this principle when it found that he had committed sexual abuse of a minor.we are not persuaded 
the phrase sexual abuse of a minor is not defined in a a,either expressly or by reference to any other statutory provision.in attempting to determine its meaning,the bia began by noting that it was not obliged to adopt any particular federal or state statutory definition as controlling.however,the bia went on to note that,since removal proceedings are a matter of federal law,it is useful to look at federal definitions in determining the meaning of the language used by congress.with this principle in mind,the bia turned to consider two federal statutory provisions which it deemed relevant.specifically,the bia considered c,which provides that whoever knowingly engages in a sexual act with another person who has not attained the age of years has committed the offense of aggravated sexual abuse,and a,which defines sexual act as including contact between the male and female genitals.the bia ruled that conduct which fell within the meaning of these two statutory provisions would constitute sexual abuse of a minor under a a.the bia then considered the conviction documents relating to illinois sexual assault established that had intentionally performed a sexual act upon a child in that he had initiated the contact of his genitals with the genitals of the concluded that these actions fell within the ambit of c and a,and therefore counted as the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor.
we find the bia definition of sexual abuse of a minor to be a reasonable construction.in construing a statute,we start by looking to the plain language,giving the words used their ordinary meaning.see pioneer inv.services brunswick.partnership,d komorowski townline and restaurant,cir.the bia decision referred to various federal statutory provisions in an attempt to construct a generic definition of sexual abuse of a minor which was consistent with the ordinary,meaning of that phrase.taylor united states,d.the bia conclusion that a defendant who initiates contact between his genitals and the genitals of a child engages in sexual abuse of a minor certainly comports with the ordinary meaning of that phrase.indeed,only the most tortured definition of the phrase would exempt such conduct from its reach.while there might be room for doubt as to whether certain kinds of conduct would count as sexual abuse of a minor,if the phrase has any commonly recognized meaning at all,contact between an adult and a child is included within that meaning 
however,one further point needs to be addressed.in determining whether congress intended the phrase sexual abuse of a minor to include conduct punished under a particular state statute,we must generally employ a categorical approach that is,we consider only whether the elements of the state offense of which the alien was with the language of the sexual abuse of a minor,rather than whether the alien specific conduct could be characterized as sexual abuse of a minor.see united states shannon,cir.however,in this case,the bia looked beyond the illinois statutory definition of sexual assault,and apparently beyond the indictment to determine that had sexually assaulted a minor.it is likely that the bia found it necessary to do this because the statute of conviction did not list any particular age of the victim or even the victim status as a minor as an element of the offense,and because the indictment for the offenses of which was ultimately convicted did not mention the age of the victim nevertheless,we find that it was not improper for the bia to look beyond the statutory elements and the charging documents in this case.first,the statute under which was convicted would cover conduct that was sexual abuse of a minor and conduct that was not.in such circumstances,sentencing courts can look to the charging document,and if that yields no clear answer,they can look beyond such documents for example,to the criminal complaint,provided that doing so would not require evidentiary hearings into contested issues of fact.see xiong,at.further,in his brief to the bia,stated that he admitted before the state court that he fondled a girl,and that he was convicted of the illinois version of statutory rape.in addition,he has not contested either the bia or the ins assertion that his victim was four years old.finally,several of his arguments to this court are premised on the fact that his victim was a very young child therefore,looking beyond the statutes of conviction and the related indictments in this case would not require an evidentiary hearing into any contested issue of fact,and we find that it was proper for the bia to do so 
further argues that the bia was obligated to define sexual abuse of a minor by reference to,because that section and only that section defines the crime of sexual abuse of a minor.however,those of our sister circuits that have addressed this argument have rejected it,and with good reason.see united states,cir united states,cir.congress did not define sexual abuse of a minor by expressly referencing any other provision of the,as it did with respect to other terms in a.see,a b,c,d,e,f,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o p.congress decision not to limit a a in a similar fashion is conspicuous,and it strongly suggests that congress intended to give a broad meaning to the term sexual abuse of a minor.see united states,d where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.internal quotation omitted,at.moreover,since creates a substantive federal offense,while a a merely attaches immigration consequences to criminal acts already committed,it would have been reasonable for congress to intend a broader definition for the latter provision.see,at.finally,as the bia noted in in re,interim,wl bia,sexual abuse is defined more broadly in than it is in.this further undermines argument because,even if we were to accept his misguided premise that a a definition of sexual abuse of a minor should be exhaustively defined by reference to some other single statutory provision,offers no good reason why we must refer to rather than to.see id.finally,we reject argument that the rule of lenity requires a different result.the rule of lenity directs us to read ambiguous statutory provisions narrowly in favor of the alien in deportation proceedings.the rule applies only when a reasonable doubt persists about a statute intended scope even after resort to the language and structure,legislative history,and motivating policies of the statute.moskal united states,d internal quotations omitted.we find that a a is not ambiguous.by considering the ordinary meaning of the words,together with other relevant provisions of the,we conclude that congress clearly intended the phrase sexual abuse of a minor to cover conduct.therefore,the rule of lenity is inapplicable here.
because we find that the bia interpretation of a a as applied to conduct is reasonable and comports with the ordinary meaning of the language that congress used in that section,we agree with the bia that committed the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor.
retroactivity 
at the time of convictions in,c of the ina gave the attorney general discretionary authority to grant waivers of deportation for equitable reasons to aliens who had lawfully resided in the united states for at least seven years.see c jideonwo ins,cir citation omitted.in,congress passed aedpa,d of which limited this authority.specifically,d amended c by making aliens who had been convicted of aggravated felonies ineligible to receive discretionary waivers of deportation.congress subsequently repealed c and replaced it with a new form of discretionary relief called cancellation of removal,see iirira a,codified at a.this new section mirrors aedpa d in that it vests the attorney general with the discretion to grant waivers of removal,but renders aliens who have been convicted of aggravated felonies ineligible to receive such relief.contends that the bia violated due process by applying d to him,thus making him ineligible for relief.while he concedes that we have rejected arguments challenging the retroactive application of d to aliens previously convicted of offenses which were classified as aggravated felonies at the time of the conviction,see turkhan perryman,cir laguerre reno,at,he attempts to distinguish his case on the ground that his offense was not defined as an aggravated felony at the time that he was convicted.sexual abuse of a minor was added to the list of aggravated felonies in iirira.
as a preliminary matter,we must clarify a confusion that pervades retroactivity argument.objects to the application of aedpa d to his case,and both parties cite cases construing the retroactive application of d to situations wherein deportation proceedings were pending prior to its enactment.in this case,however,the ins began removal proceedings against on december,well after the passage of both aedpa d,and iirira a,b a.iirira,which was passed on september,contained temporary transitional rules as well as permanent provisions.iirira set april,as its effective date.the transitional rules applied during a period ending on iirira effective date.see cyr ins,cir walker,dissenting citation omitted.that is,they applied to aliens placed in deportation proceedings prior to april,and whose deportation orders became administratively final on or after october.musto perryman,cir.under the transitional rules,the attorney general retained the discretion to grant waivers of deportation under ina c,as amended by aedpa d.however,iirira permanent provisions repeal ed c altogether and consolidate d prior suspension of deportation relief and aspects of former c relief into a new form of relief namely,cancellation of removal,at see also a.therefore,since was placed in removal proceedings after iirira effective date,to address his retroactivity argument we will have to determine whether a of iirira applies,thus barring him from receiving a cancellation of removal.
as a lawful permanent resident,is entitled to due process before he may be deported or removed.see yang,at.applying a new law retroactively to conduct completed before its enactment may violate due process if it impair s rights a party possessed when he acted,increase s a party liability for past conduct,or impose s new duties with respect to transactions already completed.landgraf usi film,d.therefore,there is a presumption against retroactive application of new laws absent a clear congressional intent that the law should be applied to past conduct.jideonwo,at.landgraf prescribed a method for determining whether provisions like iirira a and aedpa d may be applied retroactively to pending cases.landgraf,at.first,we must determine whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.id.at.if congress has clearly indicated that the provision is to be applied either prospectively or retroactively,then we must apply it as congress directed.see hughes aircraft united states,d ruling that the presumption against retroactivity applies unless congress has clearly manifested its intent to the contrary landgraf,at.see also ins,cir.however,if we are unable to discern congress intent,then we must resort to judicial default rules to determine whether the statute can be applied retroactively.specifically,we must ask whether the statute would have a retroactive effect if it were applied to conduct which occurred prior to its enactment that is,whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.if so,we invoke the judicial presumption against applying the provision retroactively.
under step one of the landgraf analysis,we find that congress clearly intended iirira a to apply to all removal proceedings brought after april.section a states that the amendments made by iirira,which include the repeal of c and the enactment of b shall take effect on april.while it is generally true that a statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date,landgraf,at,an examination of iirira reveals that congress included more than a mere effective date.rather,congress enacted a detailed scheme of both transitional and permanent provisions,which expressly made certain provisions applicable to certain aliens at certain times,while simultaneously exempting other aliens from other provisions.see fasano,cir.for example,section a expressly exempts b,c,d d,and d from the general effective dates.see id.this carefully crafted scheme suggests that congress devoted a good deal of thought to the question of precisely when the various specific iirira provisions should apply,and the fact that it took pains to exempt certain provisions from the general effective date suggests that it intended that those provisions which were not expressly as the provision repealing c apply to proceedings brought against an alien on and after the effective date.we join the ninth circuit in concluding that 
the legislative scheme of transitional provisions followed by permanent legislation can be reduced to one essential point relevant to iirira repeal of c congress intended the whole of iirira permanent provisions to apply to every alien as of april,except where it expressly exempted those provisions that were not meant to apply as of that date.the provision repealing c was not one of them.
at quoting cyr,at walker,dissenting.
our conclusion that c waivers of deportation are not available to aliens against whom removal proceedings are brought after iirira effective date is bolstered by the fact that deportation proceedings can no longer be brought against an alien after the enactment of iirira.as we have noted,iirira abandoned the old scheme which included both exclusion and deportation in favor of a new unified scheme which allows only removal proceedings.therefore,to apply c waiver of deportation relief to an alien subject to an order of removal under the new provisions would create an awkward statutory patchwork sewn together from scraps of the iirira and the former ina,at quoting cyr,at walker,dissenting.we agree with the ninth circuit that such a construction faces insurmountable hurdles even on a linguistic level.id.citing cyr,id.
we conclude that the application of iirira a to case would not be retroactive.since the ins brought removal proceedings against after the effective date of a,we need not determine here whether a statutory provision can be applied to a deportation or removal proceeding that was brought before the provision was enacted.therefore,cases like landgraf and its progeny,laguerre,which address the application of newly enacted rules to pending cases,are inapposite.in applying a to case,the bia applied the law in effect at the time that it rendered its decision,and therefore did not violate due process rights.see reno,cir citing landgraf,at.put another way,because his case was not pending before april,had no protected interest in retaining the ability guaranteed by c to apply for a discretionary waiver of deportation,at.therefore,his retroactivity argument raises no substantial constitutional claim.
moreover,even if preventing from applying for a c waiver could have some retroactive effect in that it might attach new legal consequences to his past crimes,we would not find such retroactivity impermissible in this case.first,as we have noted,iirira evidences congress clear intent to apply the bar on cancellation of removal relief and by implication,on the waiver of deportation relief as well to all proceedings brought after april.therefore,under landgraf,the provision may permissibly be applied to all such cases,regardless of the date of the commission of the offense or the conviction.second,even if we were to find that congress intent regarding the application of iirira a was ambiguous,can not show that applying the rule to his case has any impermissible retroactive effect.we have found such a retroactive effect in the application of aedpa d to pending cases in two rather limited circumstances where the alien has conceded deportability,forgoing a colorable defense to deportability,in reliance at least in part on the potential availability of c relief,see,at and where the alien pled guilty to the underlying criminal offense in reliance at least in part on the availability of c relief.see jideonwo,at.neither scenario confronts us in this case.contested his removability before the ij,and as he conceded at oral argument,he fully contested the state criminal charges and did not enter a plea of guilty.he does not argue that his expectation of the availability of the waiver in any way influenced his litigation strategy either in his state criminal proceedings or in his removal proceedings.indeed,he does not argue that he performed any act or gave anything up in reliance on the potential availability of a c waiver.the only relevant prior conduct that could conceivably have been influenced by such reliance is his commission of the crimes,and we have already stated that it would border on the absurd to argue that an alien would refrain from committing crimes or would contest criminal charges more vigorously if he knew that after he had been imprisoned and deported,a discretionary waiver of deportation would no longer be available to him.see laguerre,at.thus,can not seriously maintain that the application of any rule barring discretionary relief from removal or deportation would upset his settled expectations sufficiently to trigger the presumption against retroactivity 
equal protection 
argues that,even if we conclude that he has committed an aggravated felony and is therefore removable,he should be eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility u
