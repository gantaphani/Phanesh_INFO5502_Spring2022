francisco garcia mendez petitions for review of an order by the board of immigration appeals bia dismissing his challenge to a decision by an immigration judge ij denying his application for special rule cancellation of removal for battered spouses under b special rule cancellation.we are asked to determine whether garcia mendez was entitled to seek a waiver of inadmissibility under h section h in conjunction with his application for special rule cancellation.we conclude that his status as a special rule cancellation applicant did not render him eligible to pursue a section h waiver,nor did he qualify for such relief under any alternative approach.accordingly,we deny garcia mendez petition for review.
garcia mendez,a native and citizen of mexico,first entered the united states,without admission,in.in,the immigration authorities served garcia mendez with a notice to appear,which alleged that he was removable under a a i as an alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled.in may,less than two weeks before his scheduled removal hearing,garcia mendez married a united states citizen named crystal lopez.
on may,the immigration court in los angeles conducted a removal hearing.garcia mendez,represented by counsel,conceded the allegations in the notice to appear and admitted that he was subject to removal from the united states.several months later,however,garcia mendez filed an application for cancellation of removal under b standard cancellation,asserting that his removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his citizen wife.
for reasons immaterial to the instant proceedings,garcia mendez application for standard cancellation remained pending for several years.in september,during the pendency of that application,garcia mendez was convicted in orange county superior court of three california crimes possessing,receiving,or uttering forged paper second degree burglary of a commercial structure and attempted petty theft.in august of,garcia mendez separated from his wife.
on june,garcia mendez filed an i petition seeking designation as a violence against women act vawa on the grounds that his wife had battered him.according to the petition,lopez had subjected garcia mendez to verbal abuse,thrown household items at him,and forced him to sleep in his car.as garcia mendez explained in his filing,classification as a vawa would enable him to seek a section h waiver of inadmissibility.absent a section h waiver,garcia mendez conceded,he would be disqualified from relief by his convictions.specifically,he acknowledged,those convictions constituted crimes involving moral turpitude cimts and,absent a waiver,would bar him from satisfying the good moral character requirement found at a a iii ii bb.united states citizenship and immigration services uscis rejected garcia mendez i petition on april,determining he had failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that he married lopez in good faith and that the couple had resided in the same household.see a a iii i aa,ii dd.as a result,garcia mendez was denied classification as a vawa.
garcia mendez next filed an application for special rule cancellation.as in his i petition,he again argued that he was entitled to a section h waiver absolving the disqualifying effect of his cimt convictions.on september,the ij issued an oral decision denying garcia mendez application for special rule cancellation.upon determining that garcia mendez past convictions qualified as cimts,the ij reasoned he was facially ineligible for special rule cancellation.the ij then rejected garcia mendez argument that he was entitled to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under section h.the ij ordered garcia mendez removed to mexico.due to a transcription error affecting the september,decision,the ij issued a new decision on october,essentially repeating the substance of the prior decision.garcia mendez appealed to the bia,which affirmed the ij rulings in an unpublished decision.we have jurisdiction over garcia mendez petition for review under a,a d.

iii.discussion 
garcia mendez asks us to hold that he is eligible to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility under section h in conjunction with his application for special rule cancellation of removal.he needs the waiver to eliminate the effect of his cimt convictions,which otherwise render him ineligible for special rule cancellation.in attempting to avail himself of section h relief,garcia mendez advances two paths to eligibility.first,as an applicant for special rule cancellation,he claims thereby to satisfy the ina definition of a vawa.those so classified are expressly permitted to seek section h waivers.h c the attorney general may,in his discretion waive certain grounds of inadmissibility if the alien is a vawa and other requirements have been met.in the alternative,should he not be entitled to vawa status,garcia mendez argues that he is otherwise entitled to seek a section h waiver solely by virtue of his status as an applicant for special rule cancellation.
vawa self petitioners and special rule cancellation applicants 
the term vawa is specifically and exhaustively defined under the ina as an alien,or a child of the alien,who qualifies for relief under one of several enumerated provisions expressly incorporated into the definition.a a g.aliens who apply for special rule cancellation are nowhere to be found in the definitional list.because the statute is complete and unambiguous on its face,our inquiry is at an end.emmert indus.artisan,f d,cir.garcia mendez is not,solely as a consequence of his application for special rule cancellation,a vawa.
we are not swayed by the fact that both vawa status and special rule cancellation relief were created by the violence against women act for the purpose of providing immigration benefits to aliens battered by citizen spouses.indisputably,vawa was a generous enactment,intended to ameliorate the impact of harsh provisions of immigration law on abused women,and its provisions should therefore be interpreted and applied in an ameliorative fashion.lopez birrueta holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this principle,however,can not overcome the manifest intent of congress,as clearly expressed in the ina exclusive definition of a vawa.see durand dep t of labor,cir holding that arguments that remedial statutes should be construed liberally in favor of their beneficiaries can not override the principle that the ordinary meaning of words in a statute controls.presumably,had congress intended to classify special rule cancellation applicants as vawa,it would have expanded the definitional list found at a a g to include aliens who apply for special rule cancellation under b 
nor does garcia mendez otherwise satisfy the definition of a vawa.in june,prior to submitting the application now at issue,garcia mendez filed an i petition seeking classification as a vawa under a a iii i uscis denied the petition,finding among other things that garcia mendez had not demonstrated his marriage to lopez was entered into in good faith.while it is undisputed that vawa may apply for a section h waiver,as the agency correctly found,gar
