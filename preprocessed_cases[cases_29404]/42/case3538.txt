background 
viridiana is an indonesian citizen of chinese descent.viridiana testified that when she lived in indonesia,she was harassed,robbed,attacked,and sexually assaulted on account of her chinese ethnicity.on one occasion,viridiana was the only person riding on a bus.four indonesian men on the bus targeted only her,dragged her off the bus at,robbed her,attempted to rape her,and cut her with the knife as she struggled to escape.on another occasion,she was again targeted by indonesian men while riding public transportation.the men attacked and attempted to rob viridiana.according to viridiana,in both instances she was the only chinese person around and the indonesian men singled her out due to her chinese ethnicity.viridiana testified that she did not report the two incidents to the police because the police were hostile to ethnic.following these incidents,viridiana became depressed,feared leaving her home,and had to be escorted to and from her office by her father.
viridiana fled indonesia and entered the united states on january,with a visitor visa.her visa authorized her to remain in the country until july.in may,she consulted with benny muaja of bm associates bm,an immigration consultant and indonesian interpreter,to assist her in filing an application for extension of her nonimmigrant status.she also sought his assistance in filing an application for asylum and withholding of removal.viridiana learned of bm from an advertisement in a local indonesian magazine.viridiana paid muaja in cash installments for his assistance in filing her visa extension and asylum applications.viridiana understood that muaja was not a lawyer and that bm was not a law firm.
in august,muaja,acting on behalf of viridiana,submitted an application to extend viridiana visa.in december,the immigration and naturalization service denied her application.
in july,viridiana began calling muaja to inquire about the status of her asylum application.in her declaration submitted at the hearing before the ij,she stated 
initially,muaja would not return my calls.later,when confronted,muaja did not answer my questions directly about my request for proof of filing.whenever i called,muaja would make an appointment,but when i appeared for the appointment,muaja would say that he had not time to see me.this happened five or six times from july until march.
despite viridiana frequent calls and numerous appointments,muaja never filed an application for asylum on viridiana behalf.
in march,viridiana contacted the law offices of warmuth niu.in april,with the aid of her new warmuth niu attorney,viridiana filed her asylum application,which included a request for withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture cat.by that point,viridiana had been in the country for one year and three months,and her asylum application was three months late.
on july,the immigration and naturalization service issued to viridiana a notice to appear for removal proceedings in immigration court.the ij held a hearing on her application for asylum and other forms of relief.viridiana testified at the hearing.on october,the ij delivered his oral decision denying viridiana asylum application as untimely.because the time bar does not apply to claims for withholding of removal and relief under cat,the ij proceeded to address those claims on the merits.with respect to both of these claims,however,the ij found that viridiana failed to meet her burden of proof to warrant relief.accordingly,the ij denied her application for withholding of removal and relief under cat.viridiana filed a timely appeal to the bia.in june,the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision.viridiana timely petitioned for review.
ii.standard of review 
the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision pursuant to matter of burbano.w here the bia cites its decision in burbano and does not express disagreement with any part of the ij decision,the bia adopts the ij decision in its entirety.abebe gonzales,cir en banc.we therefore review the ij decision directly.id.
the proper standard of review in immigration proceedings depends on the nature of the decision under review.see ins,cir.factual determinations are reviewed for substantial evidence.see ashcroft,cir.under this deferential standard,the ij determination must be upheld unless the petitioner can show that a reasonable fact finder would have been compelled to reach a different conclusion.ins.questions of law are reviewed de novo.ins,cir.the ij did not make an explicit adverse credibility finding,and therefore we take viridiana testimony as true and further corroboration is not required.see kataria ins,f d,cir.
iii.discussion 
as noted above,under a b,an alien seeking asylum must file an application within one year of arrival in the united states.see a i a.there are two exceptions to this rule late applications may be considered if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the attorney general either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.u.a d alterations added a.viridiana argues that she is eligible for relief under the later exception,extraordinary circumstances,due to the mishandling of her asylum application by an immigration consultant.the ij construed viridiana argument as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and determined that although ineffective assistance of counsel is one of the enumerated extraordinary circumstances,which will excuse the untimely filing of an asylum application,see a iii,viridiana failed to demonstrate that she qualified for the exception.
the issue of whether a petitioner has demonstrated extraordinary circumstances warranting equitable tolling is a mixed question of fact and law and,therefore,subject to our review.see husyev mukasey,cir holding that petitioner claim to extraordinary circumstances was a question of law and that we therefore have jurisdiction to review it accord dhital mukasey,cir.
the government argues that,because relevant facts are in dispute,we lack jurisdiction to review the bia determination that viridiana asylum application is time barred.see ramadan,at.we disagree.the only facts that might be considered in dispute were the terms of viridiana contract with muaja.indeed,the ij noted viridiana inability to produce a copy of her contract as a weakness in viridiana claim.yet,the government presented no competing evidence concerning the terms of the contract and cited no evidence that can support a finding that viridiana version of the facts was incredible,nor do we find any.a reasonable fact finder would therefore be compelled to find viridiana story credible.ins,cir citation omitted.the ij ultimately found viridiana credible and proceeded to consider the merits of her withholding of removal claim.because the relevant historical facts are undisputed,we have jurisdiction to consider whether viridiana demonstrated extraordinary circumstances that would excuse her untimely asylum application.see ramadan,at see also,lin holder,cir concluding that the facts were not in dispute and reviewing an ij determination that the alien asylum application was untimely mutuku holder,cir reviewing an alien claim that extraordinary circumstances excused her failure to meet the filing deadline for filing an application for asylum.
viridiana admits she filed her asylum application almost three months late.viridiana argues,however,that the ij misconstrued her claimed extraordinary circumstance as one of ineffective assistance of counsel under a iii.viridiana argues that she did not allege ineffective assistance of counsel she alleged that she was defrauded by a immigration consultant.section a iii does not strictly encompass that claim.thus,viridiana argues,the ij should have considered whether the circumstances that resulted in her delayed filing of her asylum application as a whole were sufficiently extraordinary.applying this broad analysis,viridiana argues that she qualifies for an exception to the filing requirement due to extraordinary circumstances as a result of the fraudulent inaction and misrepresentations of immigration consultant muaja.see a d.
under the governing regulation,the term extraordinary circumstances refer s to events or factors directly related to the failure to meet the deadline,and may excuse the failure to file within the period as long as the alien filed the application within a reasonable period given those circumstances.a.the regulation goes on to explain that such extraordinary circumstances may include but are not limited to the following 
i serious illness or mental or physical disability,including any effects of persecution or violent harm suffered in the past,during the period after arrival 
ii legal disability,the applicant was an unaccompanied minor or suffered from a mental impairment during the period after arrival 
iii ineffective assistance of counsel,provided that 
a the alien files an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard 
b the counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned has been informed of the allegations leveled against him or her and given an opportunity to respond and 
c the alien indicates whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel ethical or legal responsibilities,and if not,why not 
iv the applicant maintained temporary protected status,lawful immigrant or nonimmigrant status,or was given parole,until a reasonable period before the filing of the asylum application 
v the applicant filed an asylum application prior to the expiration of the deadline,but that application was rejected by the service as not properly filed,was returned to the applicant for corrections,and was refiled within a reasonable period thereafter and 
vi the death or serious illness or incapacity of the applicant legal representative or a member of the applicant immediate family.
here,the ij construed viridiana extraordinary circumstances claim as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,citing a iii.the ij concluded that based on her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,viridiana did not qualify for the exception and her asylum application was therefore untimely.the ij explained that viridiana claim of ineffective assistance of counsel failed for two reasons because viridiana did not claim that muaja held himself out as an attorney,citing lopez ins,cir and varela ins,cir and because she did not file anything by way of complaint with the appropriate disciplinary authorities,implicitly relying on matter of lozada.both grounds on which the ij relied to reject viridiana claim relate to the ij incorrect characterization of viridiana extraordinary circumstance as that of ineffective assistance of counsel.instead,viridiana alleged the extraordinary circumstance of immigration consultant fraud,a claim which we conclude is distinct from ineffective assistance of counsel.
with respect to the first reason given by the ij for rejecting viridiana claim,the fact that muaja did not hold himself out as an attorney,the ij incorrectly relied on lopez and varela.in lopez,we concluded that the statute of limitations to reopen deportation proceedings under c was equitably tolled where the alien late motion was the result of the deceptive actions of an immigration consultant,a,posing as an attorney.see lopez,at.after lopez,in varela,we considered whether the fraudulent inaction of a,who falsely held himself out as the assistant to an attorney,equitable tolling untimely second motion to reopen.see varela,at.we concluded that it did.see also fajardo ins,cir citing lopez and varela and holding that the limitation period for petitioner motion to reopen must be tolled until petitioner was aware of the harm resulting from the immigration consultant fraudulent action.lopez and varela are inapplicable to viridiana case because she neither alleges ineffective assistance of counsel nor seeks equitable tolling.
we have considered allegations of fraudulent representation by a immigrant consultant in another context,which was not cited by the ij in its decision,but which arguably relates to the ij reasoning.under b c i,an alien who is ordered removed in absentia due to a failure to appear at his or her removal hearing may allege exceptional circumstances.we have concluded that one such exceptional circumstance,warranting reopening of an alien in absentia order of removal,is ineffective assistance of counsel.see,reyes ashcroft,cir considering an alien claim that he suffered the exceptional circumstance of ineffective assistance of counsel warranting relief from an in absentia removal order pursuant to b c i.we have extended this principle to actions of an attorney agent.in,we held that an alien reasonable reliance on an attorney agent,which resulted in the alien failure to appear at his deportation hearing,amounted to an exceptional circumstance.at.thereafter,however,we concluded that reliance upon the advice of an immigration the petitioner knew was not an attorney and who was not the actual or purported agent or assistant of an not qualify as an exceptional circumstance under the rubric of ineffective assistance of counsel under b c i.see hernandez mukasey,cir.
this line of cases is also inapplicable.both and hernandez concerned an alien claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in the context of an in absentia removal order.see,at,hernandez,f d at.in these cases,the alien seeking relief alleged an exceptional circumstance under b c i.the present case,by contrast,concerns the timeliness of viridiana application for asylum,a process governed by and a 
although both as interpreted by this court,and as implemented by a,recognize an exception for ineffective assistance of counsel,the exceptions are not equally easy to satisfy,and exceptional circumstances are distinct from extraordinary circumstances.see,reyes,at cir considering the exceptional circumstance of ineffective assistance of counsel under b c i tamang holder,cir considering the extraordinary circumstance of ineffective assistance of counsel as defined by a.although this distinction might seem inconsequential as a matter of common parlance,these terms are defined differently in the relevant statutes and regulations,and the exceptional circumstances standard is more
