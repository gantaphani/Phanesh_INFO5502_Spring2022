bassel banat petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia order denying him asylum,arguing that his due process rights were violated when the immigration judge ij based his adverse credibility determination on a state department investigation report that banat claims was inherently unreliable.we agree that the report was unreliable,and we grant the petition.
bassel banat is a palestinian refugee who was born and lived most of his life in beirut,lebanon.he finished college in beirut and visited his brother,a united states citizen,in minnesota in january,where he attended college classes and applied for admission into graduate programs in the united states.he was not accepted to any graduate programs and originally planned to leave the united states on september,with his father,who was also visiting the united states.for unstated reasons,banat decided to stay in the united states and did not return to beirut until december,when his visitor visa expired.
banat returned to the united states less than four weeks later on january,using a lebanese passport.banat applied for asylum with the immigration and naturalization service ins on august.a hearing was held on october,and banat testified on his own behalf.banat testified that upon his return to beirut on january,he was approached at the beirut airport by two men with syrian accents.he was told to go with the men to answer some questions,and he was blindfolded,handcuffed,and driven away in a car.lebanese officials at the airport witnessed his abduction but did nothing to stop it.according to banat story,he was held for several days at a palestinian refugee camp,questioned,and beaten.his captors spoke with syrian accents,but he thought some were also lebanese.the outside of the building indicated it belonged to the popular front for the liberation of palestine pflp.his captors accused him of working as a spy for the fbi or the cia and wanted to know why he changed his travel plans just before the terrorist attacks of and stayed in the united states for several months following.they released him but did not take his passport and told him they might contact him for further questioning.they also tried to recruit him to fight with them against israel.
following his release,banat stayed at his family home for about two weeks.his father bought him a plane ticket and encouraged him to return to the united states.banat arrived back in the united states on january.after arriving in the united states,banat father sent him a handwritten letter purporting to be from the pflp that had been sent to banat lebanon address prior to his return to the united states.the letter commanded banat to return for questioning on january,and threatened that if banat failed to report,the arms of revolutionary justice will reach you and get back at you.death to the traitors pet r add.at.banat parents allegedly received numerous threatening inquiries from the pflp about his whereabouts.when his father died,banat did not attend the funeral,and allegedly there were armed pflp men at the funeral looking for banat.
banat introduced the handwritten pflp letter at the october,hearing.the ij noted that the letter purport ed on its face to be a letter addressed to banat from a recognized terrorist organization,the pflp,which is one of the worst operators among the palestinian terrorist organizations pet r app.at,and that it ha d what purport ed to be an original seal of the pflp id.at.the department of homeland security dhs had not verified the authenticity of the letter,and the ij inquired with the state department about its authenticity.the state department responded with a letter dated march,wherein it acknowledged that the embassy in beirut had not had any previous experience with that type of document,but that its investigation suggested that the letter had been fabricated.the ij forwarded a copy of the state department letter to the parties and held another hearing on may.banat objected to introduction of the state department letter into evidence,arguing that it was internally inconsistent,inherently unreliable,improper evidence,a violation of due process,and afforded banat no opportunity to.id.at.although banat counsel stated he could get affidavits from others contesting statements in the state department letter,he did not offer them at the hearing.the ij issued an oral decision finding that banat was not credible based primarily on the ij conclusion that the pflp letter had been fabricated.the ij denied banat request for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.
banat appealed the ij decision to the bia.the bia dismissed the appeal,concluding that introduction of the state department letter did not violate banat due process rights,and it affirmed the ij adverse credibility determination.banat now seeks review of the bia order dismissing his appeal.
in an appeal from the bia,we review the bia for substantial evidence,and we review its legal determinations,as well as any constitutional challenges,de novo.ntangsi gonzales,cir.where the bia adopts the ij reasoning,we review the ij decision as well.see bhosale mukasey,cir.the ij determined that if banat story had been credible,he would have found that banat suffered past persecution and would have been entitled to relief.pet r add.at.the ij ultimately discredited banat testimony,however,relying on the state department letter determination that the handwritten pflp letter had been fabricated,coupled with the lack of any other corroboration for banat story.adverse credibility determinations,like other findings of fact,must be supported by substantial evidence.see mamana gonzales,cir.an ij making a n adverse credibility determination must give reasons that are specific enough that a reviewing court can appreciate the reasoning behind the decision and cogent enough that a reasonable adjudicator would not be compelled to reach the contrary conclusion.guled mukasey,cir internal marks omitted.the bia affirmed the ij credibility finding based on its conclusion that introduction of the state department letter did not violate banat right to due process.
banat argues that his due process rights were violated when the ij relied on the state department letter to make his adverse credibility determination.although the federal rules of evidence are not controlling in an immigration proceeding,the fifth amendment right to due process places limits on the evidence that may be considered in an immigration hearing.tamenut ashcroft,cir.due process requires that the ij consider only evidence that is probative and its admission fundamentally fair.tun gonzales,cir internal marks omitted.the focus in a due process inquiry is on fairness.in the evidentiary context,fairness is closely related to the reliability and trustworthiness of the evidence.ezeagwuna ashcroft,cir quoting felzcerek ins,cir.thus,banat must show that the state department letter was unreliable and untrustworthy and therefore improperly considered in violation of his right to due process.
banat due process claim turns on the reliability of the investigation conducted by the state department in response to the ij inquiry about the authenticity of the handwritten pflp letter.we recognize that overseas investigations by state department officials concerning the authenticity of documents purportedly originating in foreign countries are often necessary for the adjudication of an asylum claim.see,rafiyev mukasey,cir affirming ij determination that documents were fraudulent based on examination by foreign document examiner and investigation by the embassy in azerbaijan.nonetheless,when a report of an investigation concerning the authenticity of a document is presented in an asylum hearing,sufficient evidence must be presented to allow the ij to determine the investigation reliability and trustworthiness without surrendering that function to the author of the report.see alexandrov gonzales,cir reiterating that ijs and the bia should exercise extreme caution in relying on state department reports to deny asylum claims because excessive deference to the government or a shallow evaluation of th
