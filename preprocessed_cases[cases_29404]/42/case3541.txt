joseph young petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia decision affirming a final order of removability.the bia affirmed the immigration judge ij decision finding young removable because of his conviction for an offense relating to a controlled substance pursuant to a b i and denying young application for cancellation of removal.the bia held that young was ineligible for cancellation of removal because he failed to prove that his conviction for violating california health safety code a was not an aggravated felony as defined by the immigration and nationality act ina,a b.
we deny young petition for review of the order of removal because he failed to exhaust his claim that his conviction was not for a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance.we grant young petition for review,however,with respect to his eligibility for cancellation of removal because the judicially noticeable documents in the record fail to establish that his conviction was necessarily for an aggravated felony.
background 
young,a native of kitts and nevis,is a british citizen.he was admitted into the united states as a lawful permanent resident in.
in,young pled no contest in the superior court of california to one count of violating cal.health safety code a in,young was charged again with violating cal.health safety code a.he pled guilty on february,and was sentenced to years in prison.on march,the department of homeland security dhs served young with a notice to appear because of the conviction.the notice to appear charged young with removability both as an alien convicted of an offense relating to a controlled substance,a b i and as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony related to illicit trafficking of a controlled substance,u.a a iii 
young appeared pro se at a hearing before an immigration judge ij on april.he admitted the factual allegation in the notice to appear that he had been convicted under cal.health safety code a,but he did not concede removability.he also applied for cancellation of removal.
the hearing was continued to september.again,young appeared pro se.the government produced young record.after hearing argument,the ij held young removable and denied his application for cancellation of removal.the ij first held that young was subject to removal as an alien convicted of an offense relating to a controlled substance based on his conviction the ij then turned to young application for cancellation of removal.he held that although the statute was overbroad,the record of conviction established that young committed an aggravated felony.he noted that the information in young conviction recited the conduct prohibited by cal.health safety code in the conjunctive,and therefore that young necessarily pled guilty to doing every act listed in the statute,including selling cocaine.the ij held that because sale of cocaine is conduct which constitutes illicit trafficking of a controlled substance,young was convicted of an aggravated felony which rendered him both removable and statutorily ineligible for cancellation for removal.
young filed a pro se notice of appeal and a pro se brief with the bia.in both,he challenged the ij finding that the conviction constituted an aggravated felony.in november,young obtained pro bono counsel through the bia pro bono appeal project.pro bono counsel filed a new brief arguing that charging papers are not sufficient to establish an aggravated felony and that a plea of guilty to an statute stated in the conjunctive can not establish an aggravated felony although dhs filed a motion for summary affirmance,it did not file a brief responding to young arguments.
the bia dismissed young appeal.the bia first held that young failed to challenge the ij decision that he was removable based on violating a law relating to a controlled substance.because young was removable on that ground,the bia declined to rule on whether he was also removable for being convicted of an aggravated felony.
the bia then upheld the ij finding that young was ineligible for cancellation of removal.relying on united states,cir,withdrawn and superseded on other grounds by united states,cir,the bia stated that when an individual pleads guilty to facts stated in the conjunctive,each factual allegation is taken as true.as a result,the bia held that young guilty plea necessarily admitted that he had committed acts that constituted drug trafficking because the information stated all of the acts prohibited by the statute in the conjunctive and young presented no evidence showing that he did not plead guilty to every allegation in the information.young therefore failed to satisfy his burden to establish that he had not been convicted of an aggravated felony.see c d.
young filed a timely petition for review in this court.
ii.discussion 
to the extent we have jurisdiction,it is granted by.because the bia conducted its own review of the evidence and law,our review is limited to the bia decision,except to the extent the ij opinion is expressly adopted.hosseini gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
removability based on a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance 
young contends that the bia erred in holding him removable based on a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance.relying on gonzales,cir,he argues that the documents in his record of conviction do not unequivocally establish that his conviction under cal.health safety code a involved a substance regulated by the federal controlled substance act.
we may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.d.a petitioner failure to raise an issue to the bia generally constitutes a failure to exhaust,thus depriving this court of jurisdiction to consider the issue.see barron ashcroft,cir.young can not satisfy the exhaustion requirement by making a general challenge to the ij decision,but,rather,must specify which issues form the basis of the appeal.gonzales,cir quoting zara ashcroft,cir.
even construing young pro se filings liberally,as we must we can not find that young raised this specific claim before the bia.nowhere in his notice of appeal,his pro se brief,or the brief filed by pro bono counsel does young question the ij finding that he was convicted for a violation of a law relating to a controlled substance.we therefore do not have jurisdiction to review the removal order.see,at.
eligibility for cancellation of removal 
young challenges the bia finding that his conviction for violating cal.health safety code a was an aggravated felony disqualifying him from cancellation of removal.the conduct prohibited by cal.health safety code a is stated in the disjunctive.id.e very person who transports,imports into this state,sells,furnishes,administers,or gives away any controlled substance.he argues that because the information in his criminal case merely restated the statute in the conjunctive,his guilty plea does not establish that he necessarily committed a drug trafficking offense that would constitute an aggravated felony.
we have jurisdiction to review questions of law presented in petitions for review of final orders of removal,even those pertaining to otherwise discretionary determinations,pursuant to a d.afridi gonzales,cir.whether the judicially noticeable documents in the administrative record establish that a controlled substance offense is not an aggravated felony under a b is a question of law.gonzales,cir.we therefore have jurisdiction to review whether the bia erred when it held that young conviction was for an aggravated felony.we review the bia legal determinations regarding young eligibility for cancellation of removal de novo.gonzales,cir.
in order to qualify for cancellation of removal under a,a lawful permanent resident must show that he has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than years,has resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status,and has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks omitted the applicant bears the burden to establish his eligibilit
