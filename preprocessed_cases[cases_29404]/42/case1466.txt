opinion of the court 
beatrice mulanga,a citizen of the democratic republic of the congo,petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia order dismissing her appeal from the immigration judge ij denial of her application for asylum and withholding of removal.mulanga argues that the ij erred by unreasonably requiring her to provide evidence corroborating her husband political affiliation and by discrediting two aspects of her account of persecution.she also asserts that the bia violated her due process rights and ins regulations by summarily affirming the ij decision the government counters that the ij decision is supported by substantial evidence and that the bia properly affirmed without opinion the ij determination that mulanga failed to satisfy her burden of establishing eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal.we conclude that petitioner should have been given an opportunity to provide corroborating documentation of her husband political affiliation or,if she could not produce such evidence,an opportunity to explain her inability to do so and the decision is not supported by substantial evidence.we therefore grant the petition for review.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
except as otherwise noted,the following account is based on two sources.first,the events relating specifically to mulanga and her family are based on mulanga testimony the credibility of which is disputed.second,information about political events and conditions in the democratic republic of congo drc is taken from the state department reports which she introduced into evidence.mulanga was born on june,in zaire,now called the democratic republic of the congo drc.in,she married celestin kabamba,a high school teacher.their seven children were born in kinshasa between august,and january.mulanga husband was a member of the opposition party,the union for democracy and social progress udps.according to mulanga,the udps fought the dictatorship in order to establish a democracy.she testified that her husband worked for the young of the party,trying to get them together.he was the local person his primary function was to work with the young people and to help them how to function within the party.and then,to help them not to be afraid what going around.at.her own involvement with the udps consisted of taking part in the group protest rallies.also,she often cooked for the party members.
on april,security agents of the government of mobutu sese arrested her husband because of his political beliefs.mulanga testified that he was detained in a house of the government for two days and beaten badly,which left his face puffed and a lot of scars on his arms.id.at.he was released when representatives from the udps pleaded with the government to release him.
in june,mulanga participated in a protest march organized by udps in kinshasa,the purpose of which was to fight the dictatorship and the restoration of democracy.id.at.one of mobutu soldiers who was trying to keep the march from taking place shot mulanga in the chest.she fell unconscious and was taken to the clinic ngaliema,where she stayed for three and a half weeks.mulanga supplied a medical certificate from okenge,who treated her at the clinic shortly after the shooting.an ins medical report confirms that mulanga was shot,noting that she sustained a second degree gunshot wound.
in,a political change occurred.kabila forcibly took over zaire,thereby ending the regime of mobutu.he renamed the country the democratic republic of the congo.see id.at.he ruled by decree,without the constraint of a constitution,and formed people power committees to monitor activities of citizens at their neighborhoods,schools,and workplaces.id.according to the state department report,his government was responsible for human rights abuses,including extrajudicial killings,disappearances,torture,beating,rape and other abuses.id.at.also,the judiciary was corrupt and it permitted arbitrary arrests and detentions to become common.see id.at.security forces used arbitrary arrest to intimidate outspoken opponents and journalists.charges rarely were filed,and the political motivation for such detentions was obscure d etention without charge was a frequent problem under the kabila administration t here were many secret or unofficial detention centers in kinshasa id.at.
after laurent kabila came to power in,petitioner and her husband continued to have problems because of their political beliefs.during,security forces would often come to their home to arrest mulanga because of his political beliefs and to get him to get out of the political scene.id.at.mulanga testified that the laurent kabila government was looking for him because of his politics,and he was.id.at.mulanga often fled to friends houses when the authorities came looking for him.
in may,petitioner went to a local clinic because she was having problems with her chest.during her absence,her three youngest children stayed at the local church while her husband stayed at home with the four oldest children.when she returned home,neighbors told her that people had come to the house looking for her husband and that he and the children who were with him ran and jumped the fence in the back of the house.she waited in her home for her husband and children to return.they never did.she has not seen her husband or children since that day and does not know their whereabouts.
two or three days later,kabila security agents came to mulanga home at in the morning,showed her their cards,and demanded to know the whereabouts of her husband.they told her that if you do show us where your husband is,that going to be a problem.id.at.according to mulanga,they said her husband had been doing a bad thing a nd they said that,you people,you doing the politic here.id.the security agents stayed in petitioner home for about minutes,during which time they taped her mouth and beat her up while saying you got to tell us the whereabouts.id.at.they then pushed her into their car and drove about an hour to the government house in kinsuca,where seven other people were being held.she was held at the house for days,during which she was given no food,repeatedly asked the whereabouts of her husband,beaten,and pulled to the ground by her hair.
on the sixth day,mulanga escaped from the government house with the help of a kabila soldier named alfonse,who was a friend of hers and of her husband.she testified that alfonse came there and they called my name and he helped me to get out of there.id.at.alfonse brought petitioner to the zaire river congo river,where she boarded a boat along with two other people headed for brazzaville in the republic of the congo,a separate country.she entered brazzaville and remained there from june to november with marie jean ngalulu,a woman from her village.
while mulanga was in brazzaville,civil war broke out.see id.at.as a result,there was destruction and looting in much of the southern part of the country,particularly in brazzaville,where more than of the country population normally resides.fighting and heavy looting led to the destruction of many southern towns,and much of brazzaville,the capital.an estimated civilians,approximately of the country estimated population of million,were displaced.id.as petitioner and her friend ran,shots were fired.her friend was hit by a bullet.when she noticed her friend on the ground,not moving,mulanga kept running for her life.she ended up at the bethel church where she was taken in and allowed to stay for years.
while mulanga was at the bethel church another political change occurred in her former country.on january,laurent kabila was assassinated by one of his guards.his son,joseph kabila,took control of the government of the drc days later.see id.at.as his father had before him,joseph kabila ruled by decree and without the constraint of a constitution.according to the state department,security agents monitored mail passing through both private carriers and the drc dysfunctional state mailing system and there was a widespread belief that the government monitored telephone communications.see id.at.although there were fewer reported cases of human rights abuses,i n general security forces committed these abuses with impunity.prison conditions remained harsh and life threatening.security forces continued to arbitrarily arrest and detain citizens however,the number of such cases decreased.prolonged pretrial detention remained a problem,and dozens of suspects remained in detention without formal charges filed,without any evidence presented against them,and without an opportunity to defend themselves in court.id.at.the state department report also indicates that t he government operated known prisons and other places of detention,and in all such facilities,conditions remained harsh and life threatening there reportedly were many other secret or informal detention centers.id.at.
other abuses which continued during the joseph kabila regime were also noted by the state department report 
there was no known action taken against the members of the security forces responsible for torturing,beating,or otherwise abusing the persons in the following cases from the november assault and shooting of athanese matenda kyelu the november beating of students the october beating and torture of military court officials the october detention and beatings of members of the opposition union for democracy and social progress udps the may beating to death of mukoko and the torture of his family the may killing of nsaiala nkia mbiyavange,beating of his parents,and rape of his sister the april beating of koyagialo ahonzim wasana the april torture of freddy lomboto wa lomboto the march public raping of a young girl the march beating of the president of the front for the survival of democracy fsd the march beating and torture of refugees the february torture and harassment of residents of villages surrounding the february torture and beating of zuki phu kuta dieudonne,a reporter for the newspaper palme and president of the human rights ngo justice sans frontiere the january torture of freddy loske lisumbu,editor of the newspaper la libre afrique the january death by torture of iyela mokolo the january torture of udps activist crispin ipondo banda the january beating of christophe kalonji ntambwe and his wife and the january torture of albert angbana mate by the anr.
id.at emphasis added.also,according to the state department,although the government adopted a law liberalizing political activity,udps members were arrested after they submitted a request to hold a public rally without submitting party registration papers.they were charged with assault against state security,incitement to revolt,and sedition.id.at.needless to say,at least through,government agents continued to target members of the udps in a crackdown on political activity.
petitioner testified that she was afraid to return to the drc after joseph kabila took control of the government in because it the same thing,father and son.id.at.in june,after a family member obtained a canadian passport for her,mulanga fled brazzaville because of the violent things that were going there at the time.id.at.she headed for abidjan,ivory coast,where she remained for one month.about a month later,she arrived in the united states.petitioner testified before the ij that she was afraid to go back home b ecause kabila security forces see me as and i have never shown them the whereabouts of my husband.they say i involved in the politics,so they will do those bad things.id.at.
in addition to state department reports,petitioner tendered documentary evidence in support of her account.as previously stated,petitioner obtained and introduced into evidence a medical certificate from okenge,in which he stated that petitioner came into the emergency room in and that w hen she arrived,the patient had a large bullet wound which had come very close to the left side of the chest cavity.id.at.an ins medical report also confirms that petitioner sustained a second degree gunshot wound.see id.at.additionally,petitioner introduced into evidence a letter from her cousin,baidouin mwanza ngoie jezu ntumba,in which he confirmed that petitioner had been shot during a demonstration and that security forces were searching for her husband when they detained her.see id.at.petitioner also supplied her birth and marriage certificates and offered to introduce her children birth certificates.see id.at petitioner also introduced into the record reports by amnesty international,human rights watch,and other organizations,describing human rights abuses in the drc and the republic of the congo.
procedural background 
petitioner arrived at john kennedy international airport on july.thereafter,she was detained in the elizabeth detention center in elizabeth,new jersey on july,an ins asylum officer found her to have demonstrated a credible fear of persecution and torture and issued her a notice to appear.see id.at.petitioner admitted to the immigration judge that she attempted to enter the united states with a fraudulent canadian passport,see id.at,and thereafter submitted to the immigration court her application for asylum pursuant to of immigration and nationality act ina,withholding of removal pursuant to ina b,and for relief under the convention against torture an evidentiary hearing on the merits of petitioner application was held on march.
on april,the ij denied petitioner application and ordered that she be removed to the drc from the united states pursuant to the charges in the notice to appear.at.specifically,the ij held that she had failed to meet her burden of proving persecution or a fear of persecution on account of her husband political opinions being attributed to her.the ij found that there was no record evidence showing that mulanga was a udps member or that he was a vocal opponent of the government.the ij also held that petitioner did not show that the april beating of her husband was politically motivated.
additionally,the ij questioned petitioner testimony on two points.the ij noted that petitioner asserted in her airport statement that she did not know who shot her,but later testified at her hearing that she was shot by one of mobutu soldiers.the ij found incredulous petitioner account of her escape from the government detention house with the help of alfonse,question ing the ease with which she escaped and noted that no mention of alfonse was made in petitioner asylum application.id.at.the ij also noted that petitioner had lived in the drc from to with no incident.based on the lack of evidence that mulanga arrest was politically motivated,the supposed inconsistency between the airport statement and petitioner testimony,the ij rejection of petitioner account of her escape with alfonse,and the relative calm experienced by mulanga between and,the ij held this court is not convinced that these incidents amount to past persecution of the respondent.id.
finally,the ij found that petitioner did not establish a fear of persecution if returned to the drc because she did not testify to any incidents occurring after and had no knowledge of her husband whereabouts or political activities.the ij observed that there was no reason to believe that the new regime in power in the drc was actively pursuing petitioner.
petitioner timely filed a notice of appeal to the bia.on july,the bia affirmed,without opinion,the immigration judge decision.on august,petitioner filed a petition for review and motion for stay of removal.this court granted petitioner motion for stay of removal on september.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
this court has jurisdiction to review final orders of removal pursuant to a.see abdulai ashcroft,cir.where,as here,the bia defers to the decision of the ij,we review the decision of the ij.see id.at citation omitted.
whether an asylum applicant has demonstrated past persecution or a fear of future persecution is a factual question,which we review under the substantial evidence standard.see gao ashcroft,cir.adverse credibility determinations are also reviewed for substantial evidence.see id.we will uphold the findings of the bia to the extent that they are supported by reasonable,substantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,and will reverse those findings only if there is evidence so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude as the bia did.kayembe ashcroft,cir citing gao,at.see also zubeda ashcroft,cir.
iii.legal standards 
the basic principles underlying mulanga claim are well established.the attorney general has the discretionary power to grant asylum to an alien who qualifies as a refugee within the meaning of a a.see b.a refugee is any person who is outside any country of such person nationality and who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.as previously stated,mulanga appeals the denial of her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the united nations convention against torture.
to establish eligibility for asylum based on past persecution,an asylum applicant must show one or more incidents rising to the level of persecution that is on account of one of the grounds and is committed either by the government or by forces that the government is either unable or unwilling to control.gao,at citing navas ins,cir.a showing of past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of a fear of future persecution.see b abdulrahman ashcroft,cir.that presumption can be rebutted if the ins establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the applicant could reasonably avoid persecution by relocating to another part of his or her country or that conditions in the applicant country have changed so as to make his or her fear no longer reasonable.id.at citations omitted.where past persecution is not established,a n applicant can demonstrate that she has a fear of future persecution by showing that she has a genuine fear,and that a reasonable person in her circumstances would fear persecution if returned to her native country.abdulrahman,at citing gao,at.once an asylum applicant shows that s he has a subjective fear of persecution that is supported by objective evidence that persecution is a reasonable possibility,the attorney general may,but is not required to,grant asylum.chang ins,cir citation omitted.
asylum applications constitute simultaneous applications for mandatory withholding of removal.see b.in order to qualify for withholding of removal,an applicant must show a clear probability that his or her life or freedom would be threatened if is deported.lin ins,cir citing chang,at.the question under that standard is whether it is more likely than not that the alien would be subject to persecution.ins stevic,d.the standard for eligibility for withholding of removal is more exacting than the asylum standard.see chang,at.thus,if an alien fails to establish the fear of persecution required for a grant of asylum,he or she will,by definition,have failed to establish the clear probability of persecution standard for withholding of removal.zubeda,at citation omitted.
in order to obtain relief under the convention against torture,an applicant must establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.sevoian ashcroft,cir quoting c.once an applicant establishes a claim for relief under the convention against torture,may not be removed to the country where the torture occurred.zubeda,at.
the burden of establishing eligibility for asylum,withholding of removal under ina b,and relief under the convention against torture is on the applicant the testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.a,b,c.however,as discussed in greater detail below,applicants may be required,under certain circumstances,to provide corroborating evidence in order to meet their burden of proof.see abdulai,at.
iv.analysis 
the parties dispute in this case concerns the ij assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence presented by mulanga during her removal proceedings.her primary contention is that the ij unreasonably required her to provide corroborating documentation of her husband political party affiliation in support of her claims of past persecution on account of imputed political opinion and membership in a particular social group mulanga insists that the ij corroboration requirement together with the ij disbelief of mulanga escape from the government house and her account of her shooting resulted in findings not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
in abdulai ashcroft,we observed that t he ina is completely silent as to whether,when it is reasonable to expect corroborating evidence,an applicant who neither produces such corroboration nor adequately explains his or her failure to do so may be deemed to have failed to meet his or her burden of proof.at.we explained that s aying that something may be enough is not the same as saying it is always enough and that in fact,the most natural reading of the word may in the context of a and b is that credible testimony is neither per se sufficient nor per se insufficient.in other words,it depends.id.emphasis in original.applying principles of deference,we upheld in abdulai the corroboration rule set out in in re,interim decision bia,and we formulated a inquiry an identification of facts for which it is reasonable to expect corroboration,an inquiry as to whether the applicant has provided information corroborating those facts and,if he or she has not,an analysis of whether an applicant has adequately explained why was unable to do so.abdulai,at 
in qiu ashcroft,the court noted that before rejecting an applicant petition for lack of sufficient corroboration,the adjudicator must a identify the particular pieces of missing,relevant documentation,and b show that the documentation at issue was reasonably available to the petitioner,cir citing diallo ins,cir.the second circuit also cautioned that u nless the bia anchors its demands for corroboration to evidence which indicates what the petitioner can reasonably be expected to provide,there is a serious risk that unreasonable demands will inadvertently be made.id.additionally,the court in qiu noted that the requirement that an adjudicator support his or her demand for corroborative evidence with a reasoned explanation that conforms to the actual conditions in the applicant former country of residence constitutes one small,but crucial,defense against potentially mistaken,culturally based assumptions about the existence and availability of documents.id.at.
in addition to laying the foundation for the corroboration requirement,the bia has commented on the relationship between the burden of proof and the role of the ij in deportation hearings.in,the bia opened its analysis with a discussion of the unique nature of such proceedings.the bia explained 
although we recognize that the burden of proof in asylum and withholding of deportation cases is on the applicant,we do have certain obligations under international law to extend refuge to those who qualify for such relief.see united nations convention relating to the status of refugees,july.congress incorporated the international obligation into domestic united states law when it enacted the withholding of deportation provision of the refugee act of,pub,stat,prohibiting the refoulement of refugees.going beyond the refoulement provision,congress also established asylum as a discretionary form of relief for those who could meet a lesser standard of proof.see section of the immigration and nationality act.because this board,the immigration judges,and the immigration and naturalization service are all bound to uphold this law,we all bear the responsibility of ensuring that refugee protection is provided where such protection is warranted by the circumstances of an asylum applicant claim.
although the burden of proof in establishing a claim is on the applicant,the service and the immigration judge have a role in introducing evidence into the record.
at.thus,asylum and withholding of removal cases are different from other types of cases because,while the burden of proof is borne by the applic
