a the categorical approach historically taken in determining whether a state conviction renders an alien removable looks to the statutory definition of the offense of conviction,not to the particulars of the alien conduct.the state conviction triggers removal only if,by definition,the underlying crime falls within a category of removable offenses defined by federal law.the bia has long applied the categorical approach to assess whether a state drug conviction triggers removal under successive versions of what is now a b i.matter of paulus,is illustrative.at the time the bia decided paulus,california controlled certain narcotics not listed as narcotic drugs under federal law,at.the bia concluded that an alien california conviction for offering to sell an unidentified narcotic was not a deportable offense,for it was possible that the conviction involved a substance controlled only under california,not federal,law.under the paulus analysis,mellouli would not be deportable.the state law involved in mellouli conviction,like the california statute in paulus,was not confined to federally controlled substances it also included substances controlled only under state,not federal,law.
the bia,however,announced and applied a different approach to offenses as distinguished from drug possession and distribution offenses in matter of martinez espinoza.there,the bia ranked paraphernalia statutes as relating to the drug trade in general,reasoning that a paraphernalia conviction relates to any and all controlled substances,whether or not federally listed,with which the paraphernalia can be used,at.under this reasoning,there is no need to show that the type of controlled substance involved in a paraphernalia conviction is one defined in.
the bia disparate approach to drug possession and distribution offenses and paraphernalia possession offenses finds no home in a b i text and leads to consequences congress could not have intended.moncrieffe holder.that approach has the anomalous result of treating less grave paraphernalia possession misdemeanors more harshly than drug possession and distribution offenses.the incongruous upshot is that an alien is not removable for possessing a substance controlled only under kansas law,but he is removable for using a sock to contain that substance.because it makes scant sense,the bia interpretation is owed no deference under the doctrine described in chevron natural resources defense council.
b the government interpretation of the statute is similarly flawed.the government argues that aliens who commit any drug crime,not just paraphernalia offenses,in states whose drug schedules substantially overlap the federal schedules are deportable,for state statutes that criminalize hundreds of federally controlled drugs and a handful of similar substances,are laws relating to federally controlled substances.brief for respondent.while the words relating to are broad,the government reading stretches the construction of a b i to the breaking point,reaching convictions,like mellouli,in which no controlled substance as defined in figures as an element of the offense.construction of a b i must be faithful to the text,which limits the meaning of controlled substance,for removal purposes,to the substances controlled under.accordingly,to trigger removal under a b i,the government must connect an element of the alien conviction to a drug defined in.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
this case requires us to decide how immigration judges should apply a deportation removal provision,defined with reference to federal drug laws,to an alien convicted of a state misdemeanor.
lawful permanent resident moones mellouli,in,pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor offense under kansas law,the possession of drug paraphernalia to store,contain,conceal,inject,ingest,inhale or otherwise introduce a controlled substance into the human body.stat.ann.b cum.supp.the sole paraphernalia mellouli was charged with possessing was a sock in which he had placed four orange tablets.the criminal charge and plea agreement did not identify the controlled substance involved,but mellouli had acknowledged,prior to the charge and plea,that the tablets were adderall.mellouli was sentenced to a suspended term of days and months probation.
in february,several months after mellouli successfully completed probation,immigration and customs enforcement officers arrested him as deportable under a b i based on his kansas misdemeanor conviction.section a b i authorizes the removal of an alien convicted of a violation of any law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title.we hold that mellouli kansas conviction for concealing unnamed pills in his sock did not trigger removal under a b i.the possession law under which he was convicted.stat.ann.b,by definition,related to a controlled substance the kansas statute made it unlawful to use or possess with intent to use any drug paraphernalia to store or conceal a controlled substance.but it was immaterial under that law whether the substance was defined in.nor did the state charge,or seek to prove,that mellouli possessed a substance on the schedules.federal law a b i,therefore,did not authorize mellouli removal.
this case involves the interplay between several federal and state statutes.section a b i,a provision of the immigration and nationality act,stat,as amended,authorizes the removal of an alien convicted of a violation of any law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title,other than a single offense involving possession for one own use of grams or less of marijuana.section a b i incorporates,which limits the term controlled substance to a drug or other substance included in one of five federal schedules.

the question presented is whether a kansas conviction for using drug paraphernalia to store or conceal a controlled substance,b,subjects an alien to deportation under a b i,which applies to an alien convicted of a violation of a state law relating to a controlled substance as defined in.
mellouli,a citizen of tunisia,entered the united states on a student visa in.he attended universities,earning a bachelor of arts degree,magna cum laude,as well as master degrees in applied mathematics and economics.after completing his education,mellouli worked as an actuary and taught mathematics at the university of.in,he became a conditional permanent resident and,in,a lawful permanent resident.since december,mellouli has been engaged to be married to a citizen.
in,mellouli was arrested for driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license.during a postarrest search in a kansas detention facility,deputies discovered four orange tablets hidden in mellouli sock.according to a affidavit submitted in the state prosecution,mellouli acknowledged that the tablets were adderall and that he did not have a prescription for the drugs.adderall,the brand name of an drug typically prescribed to treat hyperactivity disorder is a controlled substance under both federal and kansas law.see cfr d listing amphetamine and its salts and isomers stat.ann.d cum.supp.same.based on the affidavit,a criminal complaint was filed charging mellouli with trafficking contraband in jail.
ultimately,mellouli was charged with only the lesser offense of possessing drug paraphernalia,a misdemeanor.the amended complaint alleged that mellouli had use d or possess ed with intent to use drug paraphernalia,a sock,to store,contain,conceal,inject,ingest,inhale or otherwise introduce into the human body a controlled substance.app.the complaint did not identify the substance contained in the sock.mellouli pleaded guilty to the paraphernalia possession charge he also pleaded guilty to driving under the influence.for both offenses,mellouli was sentenced to a suspended term of days and months probation.
in february,several months after mellouli successfully completed probation,immigration and customs enforcement officers arrested him as deportable under a b i based on his paraphernalia possession conviction.an immigration judge ordered mellouli deported,and the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the order.mellouli was deported in.
under federal law,mellouli concealment of tablets in his sock would not have qualified as a offense.federal law criminalizes the sale of or commerce in drug paraphernalia,but possession alone is not criminalized at all.see a b.nor does federal law define drug paraphernalia to include common household or items like socks rather,it defines paraphernalia as any equipment,product,or material which is primarily intended or designed for use in connection with various activities.d emphasis added.in states as well,the conduct for which mellouli was convicted use of a sock to conceal a controlled substance is not a criminal offense.brief for national immigrant justice center et as amici curiae.at most,it is a infraction,often not attended by a right to counsel,at.
the eighth circuit denied mellouli petition for review.we granted certiorari,and now reverse the judgment of the eighth circuit.
we address first the rationale offered by the bia and affirmed by the eighth circuit,which differentiates paraphernalia offenses from possession and distribution offenses.essential background,in evaluating the rationale shared by the bia and the eighth circuit,is the categorical approach historically taken in determining whether a state conviction renders an alien removable under the immigration statute because congress predicated on convictions,not conduct,the approach looks to the statutory definition of the offense of conviction,not to the particulars of an alien behavior.das,the immigration penalties of criminal convictions resurrecting categorical analysis in immigration law.the state conviction triggers removal only if,by definition,the underlying crime falls within a category of removable offenses defined by federal law.ibid.an alien actual conduct is irrelevant to the inquiry,as the adjudicator must presume that the conviction rested upon nothing more than the least of the acts criminalized under the state statute.moncrieffe holder,slip,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted 
the categorical approach has a long pedigree in our nation immigration law.at slip,at.as early as,courts examining the federal immigration statute concluded that congress,by tying immigration penalties to convictions,intended to limi t the immigration adjudicator assessment of a past criminal conviction to a legal analysis of the statutory offense,and to disallow examination of the facts underlying the crime.das,supra,at.
rooted in congress specification of conviction,not conduct,as the trigger for immigration consequences,the categorical approach is suited to the realities of the system.asking immigration judges in each case to determine the circumstances underlying a state conviction would burden a system in which large numbers of cases are resolved by immigration judges and immigration officers,often years after the convictions.koh,the whole better than the sum a case for the categorical approach to determining the immigration consequences of crime,geo.immigration.by focusing on the legal question of what a conviction necessarily established,the categorical approach ordinarily works to promote efficiency,fairness,and predictability in the administration of immigration law.see,at das,supra,at.in particular,the approach enables aliens to anticipate the immigration consequences of guilty pleas in criminal court,and to enter safe harbor guilty pleas that do not expose the alien defendant to the risk of immigration sanctions.koh,supra,at.see das,supra,at 
the categorical approach has been applied routinely to assess whether a state drug conviction triggers removal under the immigration statute.as originally enacted,the removal statute specifically listed covered offenses and covered substances.it made deportable,for example,any alien convicted of import ing,buy ing,or sell ing any narcotic drug,defined as opium,coca leaves,cocaine,or any salt,derivative,or preparation of opium or coca leaves,or cocaine.ch,stat.over time,congress amended the statute to include additional offenses and additional narcotic drugs ultimately,the abuse act of replaced the increasingly long list of controlled substances with the now familiar reference to a controlled substance as defined in.see,stat.in interpreting successive versions of the removal statute,the bia inquired whether the state statute under which the alien was convicted covered federally controlled substances and not others 
matter of paulus,is illustrative.at the time the bia decided paulus,the immigration statute made deportable any alien who had been convicted of a violation of any law or regulation relating to the illicit possession of or traffic in narcotic drugs or marihuana.at.california controlled certain narcotics,such as peyote,not listed as narcotic drugs under federal law.ibid.the bia concluded that an alien california conviction for offering to sell an unidentified narcotic was not a deportable offense,for it was possible that the conviction involved a substance,such as peyote,controlled only under california law,at.because the alien conviction was not necessarily predicated upon a federally controlled narcotic drug,the bia concluded that the conviction did not establish the alien deportability,at.
under the paulus analysis,adhered to as recently as in matter of ferreira,bia mellouli would not be deportable.mellouli pleaded guilty to concealing unnamed pills in his sock.at the time of mellouli conviction,kansas schedules of controlled substances included at least nine substances,salvia and jimson weed not defined in.see.stat.ann.d.the state law involved in mellouli conviction,therefore,like the california statute in paulus,was not confined to federally controlled substances it required no proof by the prosecutor that mellouli used his sock to conceal a substance listed under,as opposed to a substance controlled only under kansas law.under the categorical approach applied in paulus,mellouli conviction does not render him deportable.in short,the state law under which he was charged categorically relat ed to a controlled substance,but was not limited to substances defined in.
the bia,however,announced and applied a different approach to offenses as distinguished from drug possession and distribution offenses in matter of martinez espinoza.there,the bia ranked paraphernalia statutes as relating to the drug trade in general.at.the bia rejected the argument that a paraphernalia conviction should not count at all because it targeted implements,not controlled substances,at.it then reasoned that a paraphernalia conviction relates to any and all controlled substances,whether or not federally listed,with which the paraphernalia can be used,at.under this reasoning,there is no need to show that the type of controlled substance involved in a paraphernalia conviction is one defined in.
the immigration judge in this case relied upon martinez espinoza in ordering mellouli removal,quoting that decision for the proposition that the requirement of a correspondence between the federal and state controlled substance schedules,embraced by matter of paulus has never been extended to paraphernalia offenses.app.to pet.for cert.quoting martinez espinoza,at.the bia affirmed,reasoning that mellouli conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia involves drug trade in general and,thus,is covered under a b i.app.to pet.for cert.denying mellouli petition for review,the eighth circuit deferred to the bia decision in martinez espinoza,and held that a kansas paraphernalia conviction relates to a federal controlled substance because it is a crime associated with the drug trade in general.at.
the disparate approach to state drug convictions,devised by the bia and applied by the eighth circuit,finds no home in the text of a b i.the approach,moreover,leads to consequences congress could not have intended.moncrieffe,at slip,at.statutes should be interpreted as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme.fda brown williamson tobacco,internal quotation marks omitted.the bia,however,has adopted conflicting positions on the meaning of a b i,distinguishing drug possession and distribution offenses from offenses involving the drug trade in general,with the anomalous result that minor paraphernalia possession offenses are treated more harshly than drug possession and distribution offenses.drug possession and distribution convictions trigger removal only if they necessarily involve a federally controlled substance,see paulus,while convictions for paraphernalia possession,an offense less grave than drug possession and distribution,trigger removal whether or not they necessarily implicate a federally controlled substance,see martinez espinoza.the incongruous upshot is that an alien is not removable for possessing a substance controlled only under kansas law,but he is removable for using a sock to contain that substance.because it makes scant sense,the bia interpretation,we hold,is owed no deference under the doctrine described in chevron natural resources defense council.
offering an addition to the bia rationale,the eighth circuit reasoned that a state paraphernalia possession conviction categorically relates to a federally controlled substance so long as there is nearly a complete overlap between the drugs controlled under state and federal law,at the eighth circuit analysis,however,scarcely explains or ameliorates the bia anomalous separation of paraphernalia possession offenses from drug possession and distribution offenses.
apparently recognizing this problem,the government urges,as does the dissent,that the overlap between state and federal drug schedules supports the removal of aliens convicted of any drug crime,not just paraphernalia offenses.as noted,a b i authorizes the removal of any alien convicted of a violation of any law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance as defined in.according to the government,the words relating to modify law or regulation,rather than violation.brief for respondent a limiting phrase ordinarily modifies the last antecedent.therefore,the government argues,aliens who commit drug crimes in states whose drug schedules substantially overlap the federal schedules are removable,for state statutes that criminalize hundreds of federally controlled drugs and a handful of similar substances,are laws relating to federally controlled substances.brief for respondent.
we do not gainsay that,as the government urges,the last reasonable referent of relating to,as those words appear in a b i,is law or regulation.the removal provision is thus satisfied when the elements that make up the state crime of conviction relate to a federally controlled substance.as this case illustrates,however,the government construction of the federal removal statute stretches to the breaking point,reaching convictions,like mellouli,in which no controlled substance as defined in figures as an element of the offense.we recognize,too,that the a b i words to which the dissent attaches great weight,relating to,post,at,are broad and indeterminate.maracich spears,slip,at internal quotation marks and brackets omitted as we cautioned in new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,those words,extend ed to the furthest stretch of their indeterminacy,stop nowhere.c ontext,therefore,may tu g in favor of a narrower reading.yates united states,slip,at.context does so here.
the historical background of a b i demonstrates that congress and the bia have long required a direct link between an alien crime of conviction and a particular federally controlled drug.supra,at.the government position here severs that link by authorizing deportation any time the state statute of conviction bears some general relation to federally controlled drugs.the government offers no cogent reason why its position is limited to state drug schedules that have a substantial overlap with the federal schedules.brief for respondent.a statute with any overlap would seem to be related to federally controlled drugs.indeed,the government position might well encompass convictions for offenses related to drug activity more generally,such as gun possession,even if those convictions do not actually involve drugs let alone federally controlled drugs.the solicitor general,while resisting this particular example,acknowledged that convictions under statutes that have some connection to drugs indirectly might fall within a b i.tr.of oral arg.this sweeping interpretation departs so sharply from the statute text and history that it can not be considered a permissible reading.
in sum,construction of a b i must be faithful to the text,which limits the meaning of controlled substance,for removal purposes,to the substances controlled under.we therefore reject the argument that any drug offense renders an alien removable,without regard to the appearance of the drug on a schedule.instead,to trigger removal under a b i,the government must connect an element of the alien conviction to a drug defined in.
for the reasons stated,the judgment of the court of appeals for the eighth circuit is reversed.
it is so ordered.

justice thomas,with whom justice alito joins,dissenting.
the court reverses the decision of the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit on the ground that it misapplied the federal removal statute.it rejects the government interpretation of that statute,which would supply an alternative ground for affirmance.yet it offers no interpretation of its own.lower courts are thus left to guess which convictions qualify an alien for removal under a b i,and the majority has deprived them of their only guide the statutory text itself.because the statute renders an alien removable whenever he is convicted of violating a law relating to a federally controlled substance,i would affirm.
with one exception not applicable here,a b i makes removable a ny alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of or a conspiracy or attempt to violate any law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title.i would hold,consistent with the text,that the provision requires that the conviction arise under a law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title.thus,mellouli was properly subject to removal if the kansas statute of conviction relat es to a controlled substance as defined in section of title,regardless of whether his particular conduct would also have subjected him to prosecution under federal laws.see ante,at an alien actual conduct is irrelevant to the inquiry the majority references to the sock that mellouli used to conceal the pills are thus entirely beside the point 
the critical question,which the majority does not directly answer,is what it means for a law or regulation to relat e to a controlled substance as defined in section of title.at a minimum,we know that this phrase does not require a complete overlap between the substances controlled under the state law and those controlled under.to relate to means to stand in some relation to have bearing or concern to pertain refer to bring into association with or connection with.morales trans world airlines,quoting black law dictionary ed.in ordinary parlance,one thing can relate to another even if it also relates to other things.as ordinarily understood,therefore,a state law regulating various controlled substances may relat e to a controlled substance as defined in section of title even if the statute also controls a few substances that do not fall within the federal definition.
the structure of the removal statute confirms this interpretation.phrases like relating to and in connection with have broad but indeterminate meanings that must be understood in the context of the structure of the statute and its other provisions.maracich spears,slip,at in connection with see also new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,relate to see generally california div.of labor standards enforcement dillingham,describing the court efforts to interpret the clearly expansive relate to language in the provision of the employee retirement income security act of.in interpreting such phrases,we must be careful to honor congress choice to use expansive language.maracich,supra,at ginsburg,dissenting slip,at noting that a statute should be interpreted broadly in light of congress decision to use sweeping language like in connection with see also,alaska of environmental conservation epa,ginsburg,interpreting environmental protection agency authority in light of the notably capacious terms contained in its authorizing statute.
here,the structure of the statute and its other provisions indicate that congress understood this phrase to sweep quite broadly.several surrounding subsections of the removal statute reveal that when congress wanted to define with greater specificity the conduct that subjects an alien to removal,it did so by omitting the expansive phrase relating to.for example,a neighboring provision makes removable a ny alien who is convicted under any law of purchasing,selling,offering for sale,exchanging,using,owning,possessing,or carrying any weapon,part,or accessory which is a firearm or destructive device as defined in section a of title.a c emphasis added.this language explicitly requires that the object of the offense fit within a federal definition.other provisions adopt similar requirements.see,a e i making removable a ny alien who is convicted of a crime of domestic violence,where the term crime of domestic violence means any crime of violence as defined in section of title committed by a person with a specified family relationship with the victim see generally a defining certain aggravated felonies using federal definitions as elements.that congress,in this provision,required only that a law relate to a federally controlled substance,as opposed to involve such a substance,suggests that it understood relating to as having its ordinary and expansive meaning.see,russello united states.
applying this interpretation of relating to,a conviction under kansas drug paraphernalia statute qualifies as a predicate offense under a b i.that state statute prohibits the possession or use of drug paraphernalia to store,contain,conceal,inject,ingest,inhale or otherwise introduce a controlled substance into the human body.stat.ann.b cum.supp.and,as used in this statute,a controlled substance is a substance that appears on kansas schedules,a,which in turn consist principally of federally controlled substances.ante,at see also brief for petitioner listing nine substances on kansas schedules that were not on the federal schedules at the time of mellouli arrest brief for respondent noting that,at the time of mellouli arrest,more than percent of the named substances on kansas schedules were federally controlled.the law certainly relat es to a controlled substance as defined in section of title because it prohibits conduct involving controlled substances falling within the federal definition in.
true,approximately three percent of the substances appearing on kansas lists of controlled substances at the time of mellouli conviction did not fall within the federal definition,ante,at,meaning that an individual convicted of possessing paraphernalia may never have used his paraphernalia with a federally controlled substance.but that fact does not destroy the relationship between the law and federally controlled substances.mellouli was convicted for violating a state law relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title,so he was properly removed under a b i.
the majority rejects this straightforward interpretation because it reach es convictions in which no controlled substance as defined in figures as an element of the offense.ante,at.this assumes the answer to the question at the heart of this case whether the removal statute does in fact reach such convictions.to answer that question by assuming the answer is circular.
the majority hints that some more limited definition of relating to is suggested by context.see ibid.i wholeheartedly agree that we must look to context to understand indeterminate terms like relating to,which is why i look to surrounding provisions of the removal statute.these reveal that when congress wanted to define with greater specificity the conduct that subjects an alien to removal,it did so by omitting the expansive phrase relating to.supra,at.for its part,the majority looks to the context of other provisions referring to controlled substances without a definitional parenthetical,ante,at,and rejoins that the most natural reading of the statute shrinks to the vanishing point the words as defined in,ante,at.but the definition of controlled substances does play a role in my interpretation,by requiring that the law bear some relationship to federally controlled substances.although we need not establish the precise boundaries of that relationship in this case given that kansas paraphernalia law clearly qualifies under any reasonable definition of relating to,the definition of controlled substances imposes a meaningful limit on the statutes that qualify.
the majority appears to conclude that a statute relates to a federally controlled substance if its definition of the offense of conviction necessarily includes as an element of that offense a federally controlled substance.ante,at.the text will not bear this meaning.
the first problem with the majority interpretation is that it converts a removal provision expressly keyed to features of the statute itself into one keyed to features of the underlying generic offense.to understand the difference,one need look no
