petitioner jhonny guerrero guerrero,a native and citizen of the dominican republic,petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia order denying his application for cancellation of removal.on appeal,guerrero raises two challenges to the bia finding that he was a crewman upon entry into the united states,and thus,statutorily ineligible for discretionary relief under the immigration and nationality act ina.first,guerrero argues that he does not fit within the crewman classification because he was admitted into the united states as a c nonimmigrant in transit.second,guerrero contends that the circumstances surrounding his entry indicate that he was not intending to pursue a calling as a crewman and,consequently,should not have been classified as such.after carefully considering guerrero claims,we deny the petition for review.
background 
on september,the united states issued guerrero a c visa the annotation on the visa reads as engineer aboard poseidon.guerrero entered the united states on october,following his arrival at miami international airport.at the airport,guerrero was admitted as a c nonimmigrant in transit,and was authorized to remain in the united states until november.
according to guerrero,after leaving the airport he checked in with rigel ships agency,a shipping agency he had worked with in the past.but due to adverse weather conditions,the ship that guerrero was scheduled to work on,the sea mist,had departed miami earlier than planned.guerrero remained in the united states and eventually married a united states citizen.in,guerrero applied for an adjustment of status,which was denied,and was subsequently placed in removal proceedings.in,he was served with a notice to appear,which charged that he was removable for remaining in the united states for a time longer than permitted.see a b.
guerrero conceded removability,but applied for cancellation of removal under ina before an immigration judge ij.see b.as an alternative to cancellation of removal,guerrero requested voluntary departure.in his application,guerrero indicated that he had been employed as a manual laborer painting,remodeling,providing maintenance,and cleaning.
in support of his application for cancellation of removal,guerrero submitted a written declaration,dated may.in that declaration,guerrero swore that,prior to his entry into the united states,he worked with rigel ships agency aboard various vessels furthermore,guerrero conceded that,as part of his application to renew his visa,he submitted a letter from when he worked aboard the poseidon knowing that upon arrival he would not be boarding the poseidon.moreover,he asserted that,on the day of his arrival,when he checked in with rigel ships and learned he could not depart on the sea mist or the poseidon as they were not in miami he had no intention of leaving on any other vessel as a crewman.
on march,an ij pretermitted guerrero application.on may,the ij entered an oral decision finding guerrero ineligible for cancellation of removal because he had last entered the united states as a crewman.explaining her reasoning,the ij stated when guerrero entered on the c visa,his intent was to pursue his calling as a crewman and whether he intended to do that directly or indirectly by reporting to his employing agency is really irrelevant in these proceedings.however,the ij granted guerrero voluntary departure.guerrero appealed the denial of his application for cancellation of removal to the bia.
on july,the bia affirmed the ij decision and dismissed guerrero appeal.after reviewing the evidence of record based on its previous decisions in matter of g d m,bia and matter of goncalves,bia,the bia found that guerrero was a crewman.the bia asserted that,even though guerrero visa was annotated c,and he had not been employed as a crewman since his arrival,the following facts were dispositive of his classification as a crewman he secured a visa as a crewman entered the united states on that visa arrived in this country with the intention of working as a seaman and was pursuing employment as a crewman,even though he was unable due to adverse weather conditions.thus,the bia concluded that guerrero was ineligible for cancellation of removal pursuant to section c.this petition for review followed.
ii.discussion 
guerrero appeal presents a question of law over which we have jurisdiction.see a in cases like this,where the board has affirmed an ij decision but opts to offer a glimpse into its considerations,we review both the decision of the bia and the ij.restrepo holder,cir.this court reviews the bia and the ij legal conclusions de novo,giving deference to the agency reasonable interpretation of the statutes and regulations within its purview.gonzález holder,cir.
as relevant here,the ina grants the attorney general power to cancel the removal of an alien if the alien meets certain requirements.see c.nevertheless,section c of the ina establishes that an individual who entered the united states as a crewman subsequent to june,is ineligible for cancellation of removal.c matter of rebelo,bia congress intended to bar from relief only such aliens as had gained relatively easy access to the united states by reason of their occupation as crewmen.
the ina provides two definitions for crewman to be read in conjunction when construing the crewman provision.matter of loo,bia.the first definition defines a crewman as a person serving in any capacity on board a vessel or aircraft.a.the second provides that an alien crewman is an individual serving on board a vessel intend ing to land temporarily and solely in pursuit of his calling as a crewman and to depart from the united states with the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived or some other vessel or aircraft.a d i.
in determining whether an alien is a crewman,we examine both the type of visa the alien possessed as well as the circumstances surrounding an alien entry gonzález,at.if it is apparent that the alien was issued a visa as a crewman and entered the united states in pursuit of his occupation as a seaman,then he is to be regarded as an alien crewman.matter of g d m,at.
guerrero challenges the assignment of a crewman classification to him,arguing that he was admitted as a c nonimmigrant in transit.this argument fails.first,we find that the type of visa guerrero possessed supports the bia determination that guerrero was properly classified as an alien crewman.the record clearly demonstrates that the united states issued guerrero a c visa to serve as an engineer aboard the poseidon.the d on the visa accorded guerrero alien crewman status.furthermore,guerrero admission as a c nonimmigrant in transit,while holding a c visa,is consistent with crewman classification.see chica román attorney of,app x,cir finding that petitioner,who was issued a c visa,and admitted to the united states under a c classification,was properly classified as an alien crewman petitson,app x,cir same.
recently,this court determined that the particular type of visa with which a person enters is not outcome determinative.gonzález,at.in gonzález,we held that the bia properly classified petitioner as an alien crewman,despite the fact that it was unclear whether he had entered the united states on a c visa or a d crewman visa.id.moreover,pursuant to bia precedent,an individual who enters as a c nonimmigrant in transit may nevertheless qualify as a crewman.see matter of g d m,at matter of goncalves,at see also chica román,app x at t he pertinent inquiry in determining whether a petitioner is a crewman is not the entry document the united states immigration authority issued him but whether the petitioner was issued a visa as an alien crewman and entered the united states as a crewman.since guerrero classification as a c nonimmigrant is not dispositive of his crewman classification,and the visa he was issued clearly indicated he was accorded alien crewman status,we agree with the ij and bia determination.
second,the circumstances surrounding guerrero entry indicate that he arrived in the united states with the intention of working as a seaman.guerrero admits that he submitted a letter from his previous employment ab
