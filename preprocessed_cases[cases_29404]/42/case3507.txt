petitioner,trung thanh hoang,seeks review of the board of immigration appeals bia decision affirming an immigration judge ij order of removal.this case requires us to determine whether petitioner state misdemeanor conviction for rendering criminal assistance is a crime related to obstruction of justice and thus constitutes an aggravated felony under immigration and nationality act ina a s,a s.we have jurisdiction to determine as a matter of law whether petitioner has been convicted of an aggravated felony.see a d madujano real mukasey,cir.because the bia conducted an independent review,we review the bia decision rather than the ij.vasquez holder,cir.we grant the petition.
hoang is a native and citizen of vietnam who was admitted to the united states as a refugee in.he became a lawful permanent resident in.in,hoang pleaded guilty to rendering criminal assistance in the second degree,a misdemeanor in violation of washington revised code hoang plea agreement admits that he d id unlawfully render criminal assistance to a person who has committed a class b felony drive by shooting by providing such person transportation.hoang was sentenced to one year imprisonment and discharged in october.
in,hoang application to become a naturalized citizen was denied on account of his conviction.on october,the ins charged hoang with being removable as an aggravated felon who had committed a crime of obstruction of justice as defined by a s.after a hearing,the ij issued a written decision sustaining the charge and ordered hoang removed to vietnam.hoang timely appealed.
on august,in an unpublished,order,the bia upheld the ij decision.the bia reasoned that because the elements of washington revised code are the same as the elements of the federal accessory after the fact statute and in re batista hernandez,en banc,held that federal accessory after the fact is a crime related to obstruction of justice then rendering criminal assistance in violation of is a crime related to obstruction of justice.the bia rejected hoang claim that his crime was not a categorical match for the definition of the generic obstruction of justice crime provided in in re espinoza gonzalez,en banc.the bia stated that in espinoza gonzalez,the bia reaffirmed rather than overruled batista hernandez.this petition followed.
the ina defines the term aggravated felony to include,as relevant here,an offense related to obstruction of justice for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year ina a s,a s.to determine whether rendering criminal assistance constitutes obstruction of justice within the meaning of a s,we first apply the categorical approach set forth in taylor united states,d.
under the categorical approach,we compare the elements of the statute of conviction with the federal definition of the crime to determine whether conduct proscribed by the state statute is broader than the generic federal definition.fregozo holder,cir alteration and citation omitted.to determine the elements of a federal generic crime,we must first consider whether congress provided any specific guidance.estrada espinoza mukasey,cir.though the united states criminal code includes a chapter entitled obstruction of justice,it does not clearly set forth the elements of a generic federal obstruction of justice crime nor does a s provide a generic definition.renteria morales mukasey,cir.consequently,we must determine whether the agency charged with implementing the ina has defined the term.id.we defer to the bia reasonable interpretations of ambiguous terms in the ina.see id.citing chevron,natural res.def.council.
in espinoza gonzalez,the bia defined the term obstruction of justice for the purposes of the ina.the issue in espinoza gonzalez was whether the alien conviction for misprision of a felony,in violation of was a crime related to obstruction of justice.at.the bia looked to the chapter of the federal criminal code entitled obstruction of justice to guide its interpretation of the term id.at.it concluded that i n general,the obstruction of justice offenses listed in have as an element interference with the proceedings of a tribunal or require an intent to harm or retaliate against others who cooperate in the process of justice or might otherwise so cooperate.id.at.the bia emphasized that 
congress did not adopt a generic descriptive phrase such as obstructing justice or obstruct justice,but chose instead a term of art utilized in the united states code to designate a specific list of crimes.it employed that term in conjunction with other crimes,perjury and bribery that also are clearly associated with the affirmative obstruction of a proceeding or investigation.we do not believe that every offense that,by its nature,would tend to obstruct justice is an offense that should be properly classified as obstruction of justice.
id.at emphasis added.the bia noted that the supreme court has interpreted the term obstruction of justice narrowly.id.at citing united states aguilar,d holding that making false statements to an fbi agent was not obstruction of justice absent evidence that the declarant knew the statements would be provided to a grant jury.misprison of a felony,the bia concluded,was not categorically obstruction of justice because it lacks the critical element of an affirmative and intentional attempt,motivated by specific intent,to interfere with the process of justice.id.at.
we have twice afforded chevron deference to espinoza gonzales.in renteria morales mukasey,cir,we held that espinoza gonzalez articulated both an actus reus and mens rea element of the generic definition of obstruction of justice crimes for purposes of a s.we described the actus reus as either active interference with proceedings of a tribunal or investigation,or action or threat of action against those who would cooperate with the process of justice and the mens rea as specific intent to interfere with the process of justice.id.at quoting espinoza gonzalez,at we concluded that espinoza gonzalez represented a reasonable construction of a s because it deriv ed the definition of obstruction of justice for purposes of a s from the body of federal statutes imposing criminal penalties on offenses.see also salazar luviano mukasey,cir deferring to espinoza gonzalez and analyzing whether petitioner offense was related to any of the provisions in the federal criminal code chapter entitled obstruction of justice.in light of our precedent,we look to espinoza gonzalez to supply the definition of the generic federal obstruction of justice offense.
after determining the elements of the generic crime listed in a s,we next identify the elements of the specific crime of conviction.salazar luviano,at.we do not defer to the bia interpretations of state law or provisions of the federal criminal code,and instead must review de novo whether the specific crime of conviction meets the ina definition of an aggravated felony.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.if the statute of conviction criminalizes conduct that would not satisfy the federal definition of the crime at issue,then the conviction does not qualify as a predicate offense under the categorical approach.fregozo,at quoting quintero salazar keisler,cir alteration omitted.
washington revised code defines rendering criminal assistance for the purposes of.it states that a person renders criminal assistance if 
w ith intent to prevent,hinder,or delay the apprehension or prosecution of another person he knows has committed a crime or juvenile offense or is being sought by law enforcement officials for the commission of a crime or juvenile offense he 
harbors or conceals such person or 
warns such person of impending discovery or apprehension or 
provides such person with money,transportation,disguise,or other means of avoiding discovery or apprehension or 
prevents or obstructs,by use of force,deception,or threat,anyone from performing an act that might aid in the discovery or apprehension of such person or 
conceals,alters,or destroys any physical evidence that might aid in the discovery or apprehension of such person or 
provides such person with a weapon.
by the statute plain language,rendering criminal assistance in violation of washington law has three elements.defendant must have the intent to prevent,hinder or delay the apprehension or prosecution of another person know the person has committed a crime or juvenile offense or is being sought by law enforcement officials for the commission of a crime or juvenile offense and commit one of the statutorily enumerated acts,including,as relevant here,providing transportation to the offender.
washington revised code criminalizes conduct falling outside the bounds of the generic federal obstruction of justice crime as defined by espinoza gonzalez because it does not require that defendant commit an act involving either active interference with proceedings of a tribunal or investigation,or action or threat of action against those who would cooperate with the process of justice.at emphasis added.in salazar luviano,we held that an individual can not actively interfere with the proceedings of a tribunal or investigation unless,at the time of defendant act,such a proceeding was pending.at see also aguilar,at.salazar luviano considered whether escape from custody,as criminalized by,was an offense relating to obstruction of justice.we concluded that 
because a violation of does not require the existence of a pending judicial proceeding,much less knowledge of or specific intent to obstruct such a proceeding,one could violate while serving a sentence in federal prison after the conclusion of all judicial proceedings,for example,or as here while in detention before the commencement of any judicial proceedings.
at.we acknowledged that the government was probably correct that an escape from custody impedes the prospective judicial or tribunal process,but held that was insufficient,under the bia narrow interpretation of the term obstruction of justice,to bring petitioner crime within the meaning of a s.at emphasis added.
this case is analogous to salazar luviano.a defendant could be convicted of rendering criminal assistance in violation of washington law if he provided transportation to an individual he knows is subject to a pending investigation or proceeding but he could also be convicted if he provides transportation to an individual he knows has committed a crime,before any investigation or judicial proceeding has begun.the state statute of conviction is divisible,and a conviction for misdemeanor rendering criminal assistance does not necessarily require the defendant to have provided transportation to an individual who had committed and was being sought for a crime.providing transportation to an individual who has committed a crime may impede the prospective judicial process,salazar luviano,at,and it is certainly criminal.but that is insufficient to make it obstruction of justice.espinoza gonzalez,at.because washington revised code does not require the necessary actus reus,a violation of that statute is not categorically obstruction of justice.
the bia decision in batista hernandez,does not compel a different conclusion.batista hernandez decided two years before espinoza gonzalez considered whether an immigrant who was convicted as an accessory after the fact pursuant to was removable because he had committed a crime relating to obstruction of justice at.
batista hernandez discussion of and obstruction of justice is cursory.it states,in its entirety 
clearly relates to obstruction of justice.in so finding,we note that the wording of itself indicates its relation to obstruction of justice,for the statute criminalizes actions knowingly taken to hinder or prevent another apprehension,trial or punishment.moreover,as the circuit stated in united states barlow,the nature of being an accessory after the fact lies essentially in obstructing justice and preventing the arrest of the offender.this case law lends further support to our conclusion that the respondent crime meets the definition of an obstruction of justice offense.
while we defer to the bia definitions of ambiguous terms in the ina,we do not defer to the bia every conclusion that a particular crime is a removable offense.see,renteria morales,at we view de novo whether the specific crime of conviction meets the ina definition of an aggravated felony.mandujano real,at the answer to the question of whether petitioner conviction is an aggravated felony lies in interpretation of an oregon criminal statute this is a matter that is not committed to the bia expertise.accordingly,we owe no deference to the bia resolution of this question on appeal.to determine whether a state or federal conviction constitutes a removable offense,the bia undertakes a inquiry.first,the bia must determine the elements of the state or federal conviction.fregozo,at citing marmolejo campos holder,cir en banc.as the bia has no statutory expertise in such matters,we review de novo its determination of the elements of the offense for which the petitioner was convicted.fregozo,at.second,the bia must construe the ina by defining a particular removable offense and applying that definition to a petitioner state conviction.id.we defer to the bia determinations on the second question to the extent that the bia interpretation is reasonable and precedential.id.at.
thus,batista hernandez is relevant to the categorical analysis in this case only to the extent it defines obstruction of justice and applies that definition to the identified elements of.batista hernandez does neither.it merely concludes that violation of is obstruction of justice without defining the ambiguous term,identifying the elements of the statute of conviction,or applying a definition of obstruction of justice to the statute.see at.accordingly,we do not defer to batista hernandez.
in this case,the bia was correct that espinoza gonzalez,which defined the generic obstruction of justice crime,did not overrule batista hernandez espinoza gonzalez distinguished misprison of a felony from accessory after the fact on the grounds that the latter both references the specific purpose for which the act is done,at,and requires as an element either active interference with proceedings of a tribunal or investigation,or action or threat of action against those who would cooperate in the process of justice.id.at.the bia stated that concealment of a crime is qualitatively different from an affirmative action to hinder or prevent another apprehension,trial,or punishment.it is a lesser offense to conceal a crime where there is no investigation or proceeding,or even an intent to hinder the process of justice id.at emphasis added.taken as a whole,espinoza gonzalez does not suggest that the bia considered accessory after the fact to be an offense relating to obstruction of justice even though it does not require the defendant to interfere with an ongoing proceeding or investigation.the language used indicates that the bia now concludes that accessory after the fact is an obstruction of justice crime when it interferes with an ongoing proceeding or investigation.thus,we disagree with the dissent apparent conclusion that in espinoza gonzalez,the bia recognized that batista hernandez provided a supplemental definition of obstruction of justice not requiring interference with an ongoing proceeding or investigation.dissent at.the definition provided in espinoza gonzalez the actus reus and mens rea necessary for a crime to categorically match generic obstruction of justice controls.
iii.modified categorical analysis 
even though criminalizes a broader range of conduct than the generic obstruction of justice crime as defined in espinoza gonzalez,hoang conviction may still qualify as a crime related to obstruction of justice under the modified categorical approach under the modified categorical approach,we conduct a limited examination of documents in the record of conviction to determine whether petitioner was necessarily convicted of all of the elements of the generic crime.renteria morales,at quoting ferreria ashcroft,cir.if the petitioner pleaded guilty,the examination of the record is limited to the terms of the charging document,the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of the plea colloquy or to some comparable judicial
