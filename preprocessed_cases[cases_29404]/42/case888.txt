factual and procedural background 
initial order of removal 
melnitsenko is a citizen of estonia who entered the united states on march,as a visitor with authorization to remain in the united states for one year.she did not leave the united states after the year had elapsed.
on august,melnitsenko was traveling from vermont to her home in connecticut with her then boyfriend now husband stanley demakos,a united states citizen,when she was stopped at a border patrol checkpoint at white river junction,vermont the checkpoint.upon being detained and interrogated by border patrol agents,melnitsenko admitted that she was a citizen of estonia and had overstayed her visa.that same day,the border patrol agents issued melnitsenko a notice to appear charging her with removability under immigration and nationality act ina a b 
at melnitsenko removal hearing,the government introduced into evidence a record of alien form.the form indicates that melnitsenko was stopped at the checkpoint on august,and that she admitted that she was a citizen of estonia and had overstayed her visa.melnitsenko,who was represented by counsel,applied for no relief from removal,but moved to suppress the form on the basis that its contents were illegally obtained.in support of this motion,melnitsenko submitted a sworn affidavit detailing her detention by the border patrol.in the affidavit,melnitsenko stated that she was stopped by the border patrol while driving home from a weekend in vermont,was taken into a trailer with about four or five other border patrol officers,and was detained for three hours before being released.melnitsenko provided no other evidence in opposition to the charges or in support of any ground of relief.moreover,melnitsenko refused to testify at the hearing beyond admitting her name and date of birth on the ground that providing more information might incriminate her.
on january,the ij found melnitsenko removable as charged.the ij noted that the only evidence offered by melnitsenko was her sworn affidavit,which was insufficient to indicate that the border patrol acted improperly,much less egregiously.the ij also rejected any allegation that the roadblock checkpoint set up by the border patrol was illegal.the ij accordingly admitted the form into evidence.based on melnitsenko admissions as to her name and date of birth,records showing that a person with melnitsenko exact name and date of birth entered the united states on a visa as an au pair,and contents of the form,the ij found melnitsenko removable as charged.
on appeal to the bia,melnitsenko argued that the manner of the search and seizure by the border patrol officer at the checkpoint,which was located approximately miles from the canadian border,constituted sufficiently egregious conduct to warrant suppression of the form.melnitsenko,citing to ina a,which gives immigration officers authority to search vehicles for aliens within a reasonable distance from the border,a,also challenged the constitutionality of,inter alia,a,which defines reasonable distance as within air miles from any external boundary of the united states.on june,the bia affirmed the ij decision denying the motion to suppress and ordering melnitsenko removed.the bia rejected melnitsenko argument that she had suffered an egregious constitutional violation and noted that stopping vehicles without a warrant at a fixed checkpoint is expressly authorized by ina a.the bia declined to address melnitsenko argument regarding the constitutionality of a due to a lack of authority to entertain facial challenges to the constitutionality of the laws or regulations that it administer s.
motion to reopen 
on august,within days of the bia order melnitsenko filed a motion to reopen her removal proceedings with the bia in order to adjust her status to that of a legal permanent resident based upon her april,marriage to demakos,with whom she had lived since october the department of homeland security dhs opposed this motion on the ground that,at her removal hearing,melnitsenko refused to provide any argument or evidence to support her claim and refused to answer any questions.accordingly,the dhs reasoned,t he display of audacity by melnitsenko in now asking the bia and ultimately the immigration judge for a favorable exercise of discretion and to reopen her case for possible relief is astonishing.
on december,the bia denied the motion to reopen.the bia stated that,under its decision in matter of,en banc,any motion to reopen to adjust status based upon an unapproved petition with respect to a marriage occurring after the initiation of removal proceedings requires,inter alia,that the dhs not oppose the motion.the bia concluded that the motion must be denied based solely on the fact that the dhs opposed it.
discussion 
initial order of removal 
melnitsenko first challenges the initial order of removal,arguing that the form should have been suppressed in her removal proceedings because it was obtained in violation of her fourth amendment rights.to that end,she argues that the checkpoint was located approximately miles away from the canadian border,in excess of the reasonable distance from the border defined by a melnitsenko further argues that even if the checkpoint is within air miles of the border,it still does not qualify as a functional equivalent of the border for fourth amendment purposes,because it is located closer to four other states,in a fairly densely populated area,with many interconnected secondary and tertiary roads,and there is no indication that the nature of the traffic passing through the checkpoint was international in character.for support,melnitsenko cites united states jackson,cir en banc,which held that t o justify searches at checkpoints labeled the functional equivalent of the border the government must demonstrate with reasonable certainty that the traffic passing through the checkpoint is international in character.accordingly,melnitsenko argues that the case should be remanded for an evidentiary hearing as to a exactly how far from the border the checkpoint was located and b whether the traffic passing through the checkpoint was international in character.
we need not decide whether use of the checkpoint violated melnitsenko fourth amendment rights,nor remand for the agency to decide this issue,because,as explained below,we find that even if it did,suppression of the form would not be required.
the united states supreme court has held that a fourth amendment violation does not,by itself,require suppression of evidence in the course of a removal proceeding.see ins,d important as it is to protect the fourth amendment rights of all persons,there is no convincing indication that application of the exclusionary rule in civil deportation proceedings will contribute materially to that end.however,as we have recognized,
t he supreme court in qualified this ruling in two significant ways.first,it stated that its conclusions concerning the exclusionary rule value might change,if there developed good reason to believe that fourth amendment violations by immigration officers were widespread.and,second,it explained that its holding did not necessarily pertain to circumstances involving egregious violations of fourth amendment or other liberties that might transgress notions of fundamental fairness and undermine the probative value of the evidence obtained.
gonzales,cir internal citations omitted.before the bia,melnitsenko argued only that the alleged fourth amendment violation was so egregious as to survive.accordingly,any argument that the alleged violation is widespread is unexhausted.see d 
in,we stated that under the egregiousness prong of,exclusion of evidence is appropriate if record evidence established either a that an egregious violation that was fundamentally unfair had occurred,or b that the of its egregiousness or the reliability of the evidence in dispute.at.as in,n othing before us raises doubts about the veracity of the evidence obtained as a result of the seizure.id.thus,we need only determine whether the search transgress ed notions of fundamental fairness.id.alternation in original internal quotation marks omitted.in making this determination,two principles apply 
first,the egregiousness of a constitutional violation can not be gauged solely on the basis of the validity or invalidity of the stop,but must also be based on the characteristics and severity of the offending conduct.thus,if an individual is subjected to a seizure for no reason at all,that by itself may constitute an egregious violation,but only if the seizure is sufficiently severe.second,even where the seizure is not especially severe,it may nevertheless qualify as an egregious violation if the stop was based on race or some other grossly improper consideration.
id.melnitsenko has not alleged that her stop was based on race or some other grossly improper consideration accordingly,the only determination we must make is whether the stop and search were sufficiently severe to be deemed egregious fourth amendment violations.if they were not,then the ij properly declined to suppress the form.
with respect to the severity of the search,melnitsenko argues that o nce she was stopped,she was escorted to a trailer by four or five uniformed officers and interrogated,fingerprinted and photographed,for three hours without any evidence of any miranda or other warnings given.we find that these actions by the border patrol agents,even assuming the checkpoint itself was illegal,fall short of the type of fourth amendment violation that could be considered egregious under.
in,one of the petitioners was arrested in violation of his fourth amendment rights as part of a raid on a potato processing plant,briefly detained,taken to the county jail,and without being warned of his right to remain silent.at.nevertheless,the supreme court found that this conduct was not an egregious violation of fourth amendment or other liberties.id.at.the actions at issue here were less severe than those in,as melnitsenko was neither arrested nor taken to jail.see,ashcroft,cir navarro list of complaints,including being taken upstairs to an interrogation room,does not rise to that level of egregiousness.accordingly,melnitsenko can not be said to have experienced an egregious fourth amendment violation,if she experienced a fourth amendment violation at all,and so the ij did not err in refusing to suppress the form or in ordering melnitsenko removed this portion of the petition for review must therefore be denied.
motion to reopen 
next,melnitsenko challenges the bia denial of her motion to reopen as an abuse of discretion.in denying the motion,the bia stated that its decision in matter of,en banc holds,inter alia,that should the dhs oppose a motion to reopen to adjust status based upon an unapproved petition pertaining to a marriage occurring after the initiation of removal proceedings,the motion may not be granted.as the dhs opposed melnitsenko motion to reopen,the bia concluded that the motion must be denied.for the reasons set forth below,we find that the bia exceeded its allowable discretion in denying melnitsenko motion to reopen,and we accordingly remand.
in,in an effort to prevent aliens from receiving immigration benefits based on fraudulent marriages,congress amended the ina to bar any alien from adjusting status based upon marriage if that alien had entered into the marriage after the commencement of deportation or exclusion proceedings.see immigration marriage fraud amendments of,a,stat,codified as amended at section e of the ina,e.however,this same broad sweep also excluded from adjustment many aliens,including those with united states citizen children,whose marital relationships were bona fide,with obvious resulting hardship to citizens and lawful permanent residents of this country,at holmes,board member,concurring.congress subsequently amended the act in to exclude from the bar any alien who could establish by clear and convincing evidence to the satisfaction of the attorney general that the marriage was entered into in good faith and was not entered into for the purpose of procuring the alien entry as an immigrant.immigration act of,a,stat,codified as amended at section e of the ina,e.
initially,in matter of arthur,the bia held that it would decline to grant motions to reopen for consideration of applications for adjustment of status based upon unadjudicated visa petitions pertaining to marriages entered into after removal proceedings had commenced.id.at.the bia reasoned that a n inquiry into whether the evidence submitted is sufficient to demonstrate prima facie eligibility would necessarily involve an examination into the merits of the petition.such examination would constitute a substantial and unwarranted intrusion into the district director authority over the adjudication of visa petitions.id.
however,in,the bia concluded 
the effect of the policy in matter of arthur,coupled with the regulation limiting respondents to one motion to reopen filed within days of a final administrative decision and the service inability to adjudicate many visa petitions within that time frame,ha d been to deprive a small class of respondents,who we re otherwise prima facie eligible for adjustment,of the opportunity to have their adjustment applications reviewed by an immigration judge.
at.accordingly,the bia,en banc,modified the arthur rule as follows 
a properly filed motion to reopen may be granted,in the exercise of discretion,to provide an alien an opportunity to pursue an application for adjustment where the following factors are present the motion is timely filed the motion is not numerically barred by the regulations the motion is not barred by matter of shaar,or on any other procedural grounds the motion presents clear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood that the respondent marriage is bona fide and the service either does not oppose the motion or bases its opposition solely on matter of arthur.
id.at relying on the legislative history of the amendment,the bia reasoned 
a prima facie showing of eligibility merely affords respondents who present sufficient evidence a single opportunity to have their adjustment applications adjudicated.such an opportunity is consistent with congress legislative intent in amending the marriage fraud provisions that aliens who marry after proceedings have been initiated,and who seek adjustment of status,should be afforded one opportunity to present clear and convincing evidence that their marriage is bona fide.
melnitsenko motion to reopen 
we review the bia denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.see maghradze gonzales,cir.the bia exceeds its allowable discretion if its decision provides no rational explanation,inexplicably departs from established policies,is devoid of any reasoning,or contains only summary or conclusory statements.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the bia also exceeds its allowable discretion when it fails to consider the facts of record relevant to the motion.see lopes gonzales,cir.
here,melnitsenko filed a timely motion to reopen to adjust her status based on a pending visa petition pertaining to her marriage to a united states citizen.she submitted,along with her motion,evidence of the bona fides of her marriage.there appears to be no dispute that melnitsenko satisfied the first four factors before the bia however,the dhs opposed her motion to reopen,relying on a ground unrelated to the bona lack her marriage her refusal to answer any questions at her removal hearing melnitsenko argues that the bia abused its discretion in finding that her motion to reopen must be denied based only on the fact that the dhs objected and with no regard to the merits of the dhs objection.for the reasons that follow,we agree.
as an initial matter,the question of whether
