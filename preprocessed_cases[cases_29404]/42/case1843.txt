veronica jaime jaime is charged in a two count indictment with having,on or about october,possessed less than fifty kilograms of marihuana with intent to distribute it and having conspired to do so,contrary to a,b d and.the united states appeals the district court order granting jaime motion to suppress evidence obtained in a search of jaime suitcase while she was a passenger on a bus stopped at a fixed immigration checkpoint.we vacate and remand.
facts and proceedings below 
on october,jaime was a passenger on a greyhound bus traveling north when it was stopped at the permanent immigration inspection station fifteen miles north of laredo,texas,on interstate.border patrol agent corey grubbs boarded the bus at its front to perform an immigration inspection of all the passengers.he was the only agent on the bus.agent grubbs proceeded to move down the aisle of the bus,asking each passenger other than those who were handing me immigration documents in turn to state his or her citizenship and travel plans.jaime was seated in an aisle seat slightly in front of the middle of the bus.the window seat next to her was unoccupied.there were some passengers in front of her and some behind her.when agent grubbs reached jaime,he asked her to state her citizenship.jaime replied that she was a united states citizen.agent grubbs then asked jaime about her travel plans and she responded accordingly.the interview was conducted entirely in english.
agent grubbs then asked jaime whether a suitcase on the floor in front of the window seat next to her belonged to her he testified that he found the bag presence odd,and believed there might be narcotics in it,because,in his experience,most people placed baggage of that size in the checked luggage compartment of the bus jaime confirmed the bag was hers and agent grubbs then asked whether he could look inside it jaime consented,and opened the front pocket of the bag,revealing only clothing.agent grubbs then asked jaime to open the back pocket of the bag.she did so and,upon jaime opening the back pocket,agent grubbs immediately recognized what appeared to be a bundle of marihuana agent grubbs removed jaime and her bag from the bus,and then reboarded the bus to complete his immigration inspection of the remaining passengers.
agent grubbs testified that his questions to jaime were asked one right after the other and that from the time he asked her if she was a citizen to the time when he actually got consent to look in the bag,the total amount of time that had elapsed was maybe ten seconds.agent grubbs also stated that by the time he escorted jaime off the bus,no more than a minute had been spent with jaime.agent grubbs admitted that he was satisfied that jaime was a united states citizen within the first ten seconds,after the initial two questions,and that asking for consent to search the bag did not have anything to do with immigration status but did extend what is customary for him to interview somebody for immigration purposes.he also testified that he was not acting in an intimidating or coercive manner when he asked for consent to search jaime bag and that she was not in custody then.he stated that jaime seemed cooperative and did not hesitate to open her bag 
the district court concluded that the evidence should be suppressed under the most recent circuit precedent,although the court noted its belief that the state of the law was unsatisfactory on this issue and that jaime is getting an absolutely undeserved windfall on this.the court then issued a written memorandum and order granting jaime motion to suppress.the court there ruled that with respect to jaime the valid immigration fixed checkpoint suspicionless detention terminated as soon as agent grubbs was satisfied of her citizenship,which was immediately after she stated her travel plans,and accordingly any further detention was unconstitutional referring to our decisions in united states,cir,united states chacon,cir,and united states,cir,the court concluded that the subjective motivation not the former duration the standard for evaluating the propriety of a seizure at an immigration checkpoint,and that absent reasonable suspicion,an agent may not continue to question an individual stopped at an immigration checkpoint after becoming satisfied as to that individual immigration status.the court held that the immigration purpose of the stop was complete at the moment agent grubbs was satisfied as to jaime immigration status,and,there being no reasonable suspicion,from that instant on jaime was under illegal detention.the court held that the search was not validated by jaime consent because it was requested and given virtually immediately grubbs became satisfied as to jaime immigration status,and no circumstances intervened between the detention and the consent,and t herefore,no matter how voluntarily defendant gave her consent,the search was impermissible.
discussion 
standard of review 
reviewing a district court ruling on a motion to suppress,this court accepts the district court factual findings unless clearly erroneous or influenced by an incorrect view of the law.united states alvarez,cir.the district court conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.id.to the extent the underlying facts are undisputed we may resolve questions such as probable cause and reasonable suspicion as questions of law.united states,cir.
at a fixed checkpoint having the primary purpose of identifying illegal immigrants,vehicles may be briefly detained in furtherance of that purpose and their occupants questioned,all without either a warrant or any individualized reasonable suspicion,but checkpoint searches are constitutional only if justified by consent or probable cause to search and a ny further detention must be based on consent or probable cause.united states,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted 
in city of indianapolis edmond,d,the supreme court held invalid a highway checkpoint program concededly having the primary purpose of interdicting illegal narcotics,id.at,stating we decline to approve a program whose primary purpose is ultimately indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control.id.at at such checkpoints,stops can only be justified by some quantum of individualized suspicion.id.at.edmond goes on to state that its holding does not impair the ability of officers to act on information they properly learn during a checkpoint stop justified by a lawful primary purpose,even though that results in arrest for an offense unrelated to that purpose.id.immediately thereafter,edmond explains that the purpose inquiry in this context is to be conducted only at the programmatic level and is not an invitation to probe the minds of individual officers acting at the scene.whren united states,d,supra.emphasis added 
as noted,the district court ruled that jaime consent to the search of her bag was invalid,no matter how voluntarily she gave her consent,because it was given while she was under illegal detention and no circumstances intervened between the detention and consent.the central issue on this appeal is the correctness of the district court legal conclusion that jaime was then under illegal detention because virtually immediately before agent grubbs asked for,and jaime gave,her consent,he had as reflected only by his admission at the suppression hearing subjectively satisfied himself on the basis of her answers to his initial two questions as to her citizenship.the district court reached this conclusion notwithstanding that agent grubbs credited testimony reflects that no more than approximately ten seconds elapsed between his initial encounter with jaime and his asking and receiving the consent to search,and that the total elapsed time from his initial question of jaime to her giving of consent to search her bag was not greater than what was customary to interview somebody for immigration purposes.
in its resolution of this legal issue the district court,and the parties below and on this appeal,focused mainly on our decisions in,chacon and.the district court concluded that the latter two cases essentially supplanted and controlled outcome here.we disagree,and accordingly vacate the district court order and remand.
in,we addressed the validity of a suspicionless consent based search at a fixed immigration checkpoint in light of and edmond.the evidence there showed that late on a sunday afternoon the defendant,accompanied by a companion,drove his car to the checkpoint,where border patrol agent holt 
questioned the pair about their travel plans and citizenship.they replied that they were citizens living in pecos,texas,and that they were returning from a weekend trip to ojinaga,mexico.
at this point,agent holt asked them whether they were carrying any firearms or drugs.replied no.agent holt requested consent to search the car,which gave,at.emphasis added footnote omitted.
the district court,although crediting the defendant version of the events,overruled a motion to suppress the fruits of the search which found marihuana hidden in a speaker box.id.we affirmed.
we held that because the brief stop lasted no longer than necessary to fulfill its purpose,the stop did not violate the fourth amendment.id.at.for this purpose,we considered only the time up to the point at which consented to a search of his car because a fter consented to a search,agent holt needed no justification to prolong the encounter.id.at our holding in this respect rested on two legal principles.
first,that so long as the primary programmatic purpose of the checkpoint was the detection of illegal immigrants,the permissible duration of a suspicionless detention there would be determined by objective factors,not by the subjective motivation or state of mind of the specific individual officers conducting the stop and related examination or questioning on the particular occasion at issue.thus we stated that i t is the length of the detention,not the questions asked,that makes a specific stop unreasonable,id.at,and that 
we decline a protocol that measures the pertinence of questions to the immigration purpose by an standard for admissibility at trial policing the duration of the stop is the most practical enforcing discipline of purpose.the key is the rule that a stop may not exceed its permissible duration we deploy a test that is both workable and which reinforces our resistance to parsing the relevance of particular questions.to scrutinize too closely a set of questions asked by a border patrol agent would court inquiry into the subjective purpose of the officer asking the questions.
we do not inquire into the motives of individual border patrol agents in performing stops.see whren united states,d id.at.
see also id.at we will not scrutinize the particular questions a border patrol agent chooses to ask as long as in sum they generally relate to determining citizenship status.
the second principle thus relied on in is that the permissible duration of a suspicionless stop at a fixed immigration checkpoint includes the time necessary to request consent to extend the detention.id.at.thus,we held 
the scope of an immigration checkpoint stop is limited to the justifying,programmatic purpose of the stop determining the citizenship status of persons passing through the checkpoint.the permissible duration of an immigration checkpoint stop is therefore the time reasonably necessary to determine the citizenship status of the persons stopped.this would include the time necessary to ascertain the number and identity of the occupants of the vehicle,inquire about citizenship status,request identification or other proof of citizenship,and request consent to extend the detention.id.emphasis added footnotes omitted.
on the basis of the foregoing two principles,we held that suspicionless detention at the checkpoint was legal because its duration,up to the time he gave his consent to search,was objectively reasonable,and thereafter the duration of his detention could be lawfully extended without any other justification.we stated 
the permissible duration of the stop was the amount of time reasonably necessary for agent holt to ask a few questions about immigration status.agent holt few questions took no more than a couple of minutes this is within the permissible duration of an immigration checkpoint stop.although notes that agent holt asked a question about drugs,we will not agent holt judgment in asking that question.the brief stop by agent holt,which determined the citizenship status of the travelers and lasted no more than a couple of minutes before agent holt requested and received consent to search,was constitutional.id.at.
it is clear that dictates the result here.there,the time elapsed between the agents initial contact with the defendant until he consented to the request to search his vehicle was no more than a couple of minutes here the comparable time was clearly less than half a minute.during that period of time three things occurred in.first,citizenship and travel plan questions were asked and answered,the answers reflecting united states citizenship,and that is likewise the case here.second,in,the agents asked questions about carrying drugs and guns,which were answered in the negative,and we declined to the asking of that question or to engage in inquiry into the subjective purpose of the officer asking the questions.the next thing that occurred in was that consent to search the car was asked for and given,and we expressly and specifically held that the permissible duration of a suspicionless fixed checkpoint immigration stop included the time reasonably necessary to request consent to extend the detention and,by necessary implication,to receive the reply to the request by consenting to search of the vehicle.here,what immediately followed the citizenship and travel plan questions and answers,was jaime being asked if the bag was hers,and on her promptly responding that it was,whether she would consent to its search and her affirmative reply.clearly the question whether the bag was hers was a part of,and a necessary predicate to,asking her consent to search it,and hence should be treated in the same way as the request for and receipt of consent to search was in.but,even wholly apart from that,there is no conceivable justification for holding that the bag ownership question and answer impermissibly extended the duration of the stop here,while the carrying drugs or weapons question and answer in did not.
jaime argues that is distinguishable because there the consent to search was given before the agents had satisfied themselves that the car occupants were citizens.we reject that argument.in the first place,no statement in,nor anything in its factual recitation,supports that assertion.the opinion factual recitation reflects that the first questions concerned citizenship and travel plans and the answers reflected that both individuals were citizens.the next questions related to drugs or guns being carried,and were answered negatively,followed only by asking for and receiving consent to search.nothing else is related.nothing suggests that the opinion does not completely state all the relevant facts up to that point,and it specifically states that what follows that is irrelevant,as noted above.in the second place,clearly holds both that test is the length of the detention and that the time necessary to request consent to extend the detention by requesting and receiving consent to search is included in the permissible duration of the stop.therefore,under it is necessarily irrelevant whether a question comes before,rather than immediately following,the completion of the immigration questions and answers,for in either event the duration of the stop is equally extended,and,if the question and answer are asking and giving consent to search,in either event the extension of the stop duration is permissible.
compels the conclusion that the duration of jaime detention from the first question agent grubbs asked her to the time she gave her consent to search her bag,a period of less than half a minute,was not excessive and that her detention during all that time was legally valid,no matter what agent grubbs subjectively concluded respecting her citizenship following her answers to his initial questions of her.
