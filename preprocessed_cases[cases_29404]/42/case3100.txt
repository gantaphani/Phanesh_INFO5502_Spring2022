immigration 
the panel granted a petition for review of the denial of a motion to reconsider or reopen a negative reasonable fear determination in reinstatement removal proceedings.
an immigration judge affirmed an asylum officer determination that petitioner failed to establish a reasonable fear of persecution in reinstatement removal proceedings.petitioner filed a motion to reconsider or reopen,which the ij denied.rather than directly petitioning this court for review,petitioner filed an appeal with the board of immigration appeals,and the board dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.petitioner then filed the present petition for review within days of the board decision.
the panel first held that this court has jurisdiction over petitions for review from negative reasonable fear determinations in the context of the reinstatement of an expedited removal order.
the panel next held that under all the circumstances of this case,including the fact that the ij decision on the motion advised petitioner of a right to appeal to the board,even though no such right exists,the board decision constituted the final order of removal,and the petition is therefore timely.
turning to the merits,the panel held that the ij abused his discretion in denying the motion to reconsider or reopen.the panel held that the ij erred in concluding that extortion could not constitute persecution because extortion,plus the threat of violence,on the basis of a protected characteristic,can constitute persecution.
noting that petitioner sought only withholding of removal and not asylum,and therefore needed to establish only that a protected characteristic was a reason motivating the extortionate acts,the panel remanded to the ij to determine whether petitioner established an extortion plus claim of persecution,based on her claimed extortion due to her family ties.
reinhardt,circuit judge 
after having been previously removed from the country and reentering,petitioner silvia ayala was detained and her removal order was reinstated.ayala contended,however,that she had a reasonable fear of persecution because she had been targeted for extortion,accompanied by threats of violence,in guatemala based on her family ties.
pursuant to e,ayala had the right to have her reasonable fear claim heard by an asylum officer and then reviewed by an immigration judge ij.the asylum officer found that ayala lacked a reasonable fear,and the ij affirmed,holding that ayala extortion claim was legally insufficient to establish persecution.ayala filed a motion to reconsider and reopen,which the ij denied.instead of directly petitioning the ninth circuit for review,however,she appealed that decision to the bia.the bia dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.following the bia dismissal,ayala filed a petition with the ninth circuit within days the petition,however,was filed more than days after the ij denial of the motion to reopen and reconsider.
first,we must decide whether we have jurisdiction over petitions for review from negative reasonable fear determinations in the context of the reinstatement of an expedited removal order under.we conclude that we do.
second,we must decide whether ayala petition for review is timely filed within days of her final order of removal.b.to do so,we must determine whether the final order was the bia dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or the ij denial of ayala motion to reopen and reconsider.ayala petition for review is timely only if the former was the final order.we conclude that,under all of the circumstances,the bia dismissal is the final order of removal,and ayala petition for review is therefore timely.
we next turn to the merits of her motion and hold that the ij abused his discretion in denying it.the ij committed legal error by holding that extortion could not constitute persecution.on the contrary,extortion,plus the threat of violence,on the basis of a protected characteristic can constitute persecution.see borja,cir.en banc,superseded by statute on other grounds as stated by parussimova mukasey,cir.because ayala seeks only withholding of removal and not asylum,she need establish only that a protected characteristic was a reason motivating the extortionate acts.see lynch,cir.therefore,we grant ayala petition for review and remand to the ij to determine whether ayala has established an extortion plus claim of persecution.see id.
statutory background

factual and procedural background 
silvia ayala is a year old native and citizen of guatemala.she first entered the united states in and requested asylum three years later on account of persecution she suffered for joining a student protest.her asylum request was denied,but she was granted voluntary departure.nevertheless,she remained in the united states until december,when she left with her husband for guatemala.
ayala stayed in guatemala for only one month.soon after returning to guatemala,she and her husband were followed by a car while riding their motorcycle.although ayala got off the motorcycle at her husband urging,he continued riding,and the car followed him.later that day,he was found badly beaten.her husband then told her to return to the united states with their child.during that same month in guatemala,ayala also received threatening phone calls at her house.
ayala returned to the united states in january,was apprehended at the border,and removed within the same week.soon thereafter,she reentered the united states and has resided here since that time.while she has been in the united states,her family in guatemala has continued to face threats.in,her husband was murdered and at some point in,unknown assailants shot at her mother house.
in october,over a decade after she reentered in,ayala was detained by ice and was served with a notice of reinstatement of her prior deportation order that same day.she was not deported immediately,however,because she expressed a fear of returning to guatemala.
on february,pursuant to e and the procedures described above,ayala met with an asylum officer for a determination as to whether she had a reasonable fear of persecution or torture.despite deeming her credible,the asylum officer concluded that ayala had not established a reasonable fear because her past harm did not rise to the level of persecution and there was no evidence that such harm was due to ayala membership in a particular social group.the officer stated that her husband was targeted only for extortion,which did not rise to the level of past persecution.
because the asylum officer made a negative reasonable fear determination,ayala was entitled to appeal this determination to an ij.on april,an ij conducted a reasonable fear hearing and affirmed the asylum officer negative determination.during the hearing,ayala claimed that a group of people was targeting her because m y husband family owned hotels and i believe they wanted to extort us and that is why we were being followed.at the end of the hearing,the ij stated that he was affirming the asylum officer decision because the only motivation indicated throughout is extortion,criminal acts.he did not offer any other explanation.the denial form signed by the ij and served on ayala states that the case is returned to the dhs for removal of the alien.it also states this is a final order.there is no appeal available.the ij denial form is incorrect.there is,in the normal parlance,an appeal available from the ij affirmance of the negative reasonable fear determination ayala was entitled to what is denominated a petition for review to this court,at.
on april,ayala filed a motion for reopening and reconsideration of the ij reasonable fear determination with the ij.she argued that she was afraid of returning as she was married to a hotel owner and that he was murdered and she had been a victim of criminal activity in guatemala when she was in the company of her husband.on april,the ij denied the motion to reopen for failing to state any new facts and the motion to reconsider for failing to specify any error of law or fact.a cover sheet from the immigration court mailed to ayala with the ij decision stated this decision is final unless an appeal is filed with the board of immigration appeals within calendar days of the date of the mailing of this written decision.the cover sheet then provides an address of the bia for the appeal.as explained above,these instructions were also incorrect ayala should have been instructed to petition directly to this court for review,not to the bia,at the regulations do not provide any means for the alien to appeal the ij decision regarding a reasonable fear of persecution to the bia.
in accordance with the court instructions,on may,ayala appealed the denial of the motion to reopen and reconsider to the bia.on june,the bia dismissed the appeal,stating that no appeal lies from an immigration judge decision reviewing a negative reasonable fear determination.
ayala then filed a petition for review with this court on june,four days after the bia dismissed her appeal,but more than days after the ij denied her motion to reopen and reconsider on april.
jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction to consider our own jurisdiction.daas holder,cir.this case presents two jurisdictional questions.
jurisdiction to review an ij reasonable fear determination arising under the reinstatement of an expedited removal order 
ayala was issued an expedited removal order when she reentered the country on january.the present case arises out of the government reinstatement of that january expedited removal order against ayala.we clearly have jurisdiction over timely petitions for review of reasonable fear determinations that arise out of the reinstatement of ordinary that is,not expedited removal orders.see,at.we must decide whether the fact that this case deals with the reinstatement of an expedited removal order precludes us from exercising jurisdiction 
in garcia de rincon department of homeland security,we held that we lack jurisdiction to review the reinstatement of an expedited removal order when an alien seeks to collaterally attack the underlying expedited removal order on due process grounds,cir.although a d vests us with jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law on appeal of reinstated removal orders,e precludes review of such issues for the reinstatement of an expedited removal order.id.we noted in garcia de rincon that we retain some limited jurisdiction to adjudicate a collateral attack on an underlying expedited removal order that has been reinstated but a a and e expressly limit the scope of such review to habeas petitions alleging that the petitioner is not an alien or was never subject to an expedited removal order.at.in that case,these provisions deprived us of jurisdiction over the petitioner due process challenge to the proceedings that resulted in her expedited removal order.id.
garcia de rincon,however,is distinguishable from and inapplicable to this case.unlike the petitioner in garcia de rincon,ayala does not seek to collaterally attack her underlying expedited removal order.instead,she is challenging the accuracy of the outcome of her reasonable fear determination during her reinstatement proceedings rather than during her original underlying expedited removal proceedings.her petition for review in no way implicates the underlying expedited removal order,and therefore garcia de rincon is inapplicable.nothing in prevents us from exercising jurisdiction to review the accuracy of the reasonable fear determination arising from ayala reinstatement proceedings.morales de soto lynch,cir.concluding jurisdiction is proper where petitioner does not challenge the legitimacy of her expedited order of removal but instead limits her appeal to the manner in which ice decided to issue the reinstatement order against her,at r esolving the issues presented by ortiz petition for review will not undermine the reinstatement of the removal order,as ortiz has not challenged the validity of the reinstatement or the underlying prior removal order.accordingly,we conclude that we have jurisdiction over petitions for review of reasonable fear determinations made in connection with the reinstatement of expedited removal orders.
ayala petition for review is timely 
a petition for review must be filed not later than days after the date of the final order of removal.b.this time limit is mandatory and jurisdictional and not subject to equitable tolling.yepremyan holder,cir.quoting stone.the central question before us is whether the bia dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or the ij denial of the motion to reopen and reconsider was the final order.if it was the former,the petition was timely if not,we lack jurisdiction.we conclude that ayala petition is timely because the bia order of dismissal was the final order in this case.
the ina provides that a removal order becomes final upon the earlier of i a determination by the bia affirming such an order or ii the expiration of the period in which the alien is permitted to seek review of such order by the bia.a.this statutory definition of finality,however,does not answer the question when an order becomes final in cases,like ayala,in which the regulations preclude bia review.neither of the alternatives provided in a is applicable in such cases.see,at.in,we gave a somewhat understated explanation of the problem,stating that the statutory definition of finality does not dictate a clear answer in reinstatement cases because there is no way to appeal the reinstatement of a removal order to the bia.id.at citing.in a subsequent case,we explained further that when the statutory definition of finality fails to definitively provide an answer,a removal order is considered final only when all administrative proceedings have concluded.abdisalan holder,cir.en banc,as amended,accord,at.
applying and abdisalan,we conclude that the bia dismissal for lack of jurisdiction was the final order in ayala case for three reasons.first,all administrative proceedings were not concluded until the bia rendered its order dismissing ayala appeal.after proceedings were completed before the ij,ayala initiated further proceedings before the bia in accordance with the specific directions provided to her by the agency.where the agency has advised a petitioner to pursue f
