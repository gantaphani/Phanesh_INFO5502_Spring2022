yasmin shoaira and hesham gawdat tobar petition for review of separate decisions of the board of immigration appeals denying their applications for asylum and withholding of removal.
factual background 
shoaira and tobar are a wife and husband who seek asylum in the united states because they fear persecution based on their religious beliefs,imputed political beliefs,and membership in a particular social group if returned to their home country,egypt.tobar came to the united states on september,as a visitor for pleasure and stayed beyond the date authorized by his visa.shoaira came to the united states on september,to marry tobar,who is her cousin.she also entered as a visitor for pleasure and overstayed her visa.
the immigration and naturalization service ins began deportation proceedings against both petitioners separately in successive months.the ins filed a notice to appear in the immigration court for tobar on december.it filed a notice to appear for shoaira on january.an ij subsequently joined their cases.both shoaira and tobar conceded deportability before the ij,but applied for asylum and withholding of removal.the ij held a joint asylum hearing on august,and took the testimony of both petitioners and a psychologist who had treated shoaira at the center for victims of torture.
the petitioners base their claim to fear of future persecution on events that occurred to shoaira father,abdulmann shoaira,who is also tobar uncle.tobar and shoaira testified that abdulmann shoaira is a devout muslim who dresses and grooms himself in strict accordance with muslim traditions.he wears a long beard and distinctive clothing that identify him as a traditional muslim.according to the petitioners,the egyptian government believes his dress and grooming mark him as a fundamentalist muslim with particular political views regarding the acceptability of egypt secular government.
according to both petitioners,abdulmann shoaira suffered four arrests largely on the basis of his appearance.the first arrest occurred in.the authorities suspected abdulmann shoaira of involvement in the assassination of president anwar sadat.shoaira,who was five years old at the time,testified that there was no particularized suspicion of her father,but that the authorities had picked up anyone with a beard.there was conflicting evidence on this point,however,as tobar claimed abdulmann shoaira was suspected because he once wrote a letter to anwar sadat criticizing the egyptian government.abdulmann shoaira was arrested a second time in.on this occasion,the police came to the shoaira home at night,harassed her family,and took her father away.when shoaira tried to take shoes to her father that night,a police officer pushed her to the ground.according to shoaira,her mother succumbed to mental illness after this event.in,the police again arrested abdulmann shoaira.on this occasion,shoaira testified,the authorities detained him for four or five months.the final arrest occurred in,after abdulmann shoaira returned to egypt from delivering his daughter to the united states for her wedding to tobar.according to shoaira,the police detained her father for four or five days,questioning him about the reason for his trip.she also said they tried to get her father to persuade tobar to return to egypt.the petitioners claim the authorities questioned abdulmann shoaira about tobar views and activities during that detention.
tobar testified that his now lives in europe,where he works as a kind of merchant marine.he says that membership in certain revolutionary islamic fundamentalist groups is an offense in egypt,punishable by life in prison.both petitioners deny that abdulmann shoaira ever had any connection to such groups.they say that the egyptian government inference from his grooming to his politics was faulty.
the petitioners relate few incidents of government mistreatment they have experienced in their own rights.shoaira admits that she was never detained by the police.she claims to have suffered psychological damage from experiencing the police arrests of her father,and her therapist provided supporting testimony on this point.shoaira also claims that she was pushed to the ground by police during her father second arrest.tobar claims that he was detained on two occasions.when he was seventeen years old,authorities detained him upon his return from a trip to yemen.later,while in college,the police detained tobar for six hours.he concedes that these incidents are not past persecution.nevertheless,he believes that the authorities keep a file on him because his visit drew tobar to their attention.
asylum hearing 
during the asylum hearing,the ij at times adopted a hostile demeanor with the petitioners.he stated that i am one of those judges that is not the least bit interested with the process.i do care about the procedure.i do care about the process here.it all for show.app.of petitioners app.at.beyond dismissing procedural safeguards,he also treated the petitioners in a combative fashion.as he stated at the hearing,i got to challenge you with some tough questions and turn your own answers back against you.app.at.later,he explained that when people are angry they usually tell me the truth.app.at.the ij peppered the hearing with remarks he apparently meant to throw the petitioners off their story,if it was concocted.
the ij held that neither shoaira nor tobar had established that they had experienced past persecution directly.respecting shoaira experiences,the ij wrote,the court fails to see that the egyptian government,while they certainly may have caused shoaira psychological disorders,intended to persecute her at the same time they were mistreating her father.app.at.in essence,the ij held that though the egyptian police may have been persecuting her father in making these arrests,they were not persecuting shoaira,notwithstanding the fact that she incurred psychological damages.
the ij ruled that neither petitioner could base a fear of future persecution on the experiences of shoaira father alone.the ij did not make any explicit credibility determination,but appeared to accept that the facts were as the petitioners presented them at the hearing.
the ij,assuming without deciding that the arrests of abdulmann shoaira constituted persecution,also held that his treatment was not based on his religious beliefs.he wrote,t he court would not be able to state that he was persecuted for religious reasons,because egypt is,according to the documents in the record,officially an islamic country and while the egyptian government may be a little secular for some of the more extreme muslim fundamentalists,nevertheless,the government has no history of persecuting people simply because they are muslim.app.at.thus,the ij concluded that the state department report evaluation of egypt outweighs the petitioners attributions of motive to the government actors.the religious aspect of abdulmann shoaira treatment arises only because people of a certain type of religious belief often advocate a certain political secular governments should be overthrown in favor of islamic states.
the ij also rejected imputed political belief as a basis for the father persecution,and by extension as the basis for the petitioners fear of future persecution.basing its opinion on country conditions reports,the ij stated that egypt tolerates a fair amount of dissent in the form of opposition newspapers.he also noted that the petitioners were unable to express the particular views they thought the government attributed to them based on shoaira father opinions.the ij held that the petitioners had not met their burden of proving that they had a fear of future persecution based on political belief.
finally,the ij rejected the claim that the petitioners reasonably feared persecution based on their family membership,which they claim to be a social group under the asylum statute.
finding no basis to fear persecution for a protected activity,the ij denied shoaira and tobar applications for asylum.it also held that the applications for withholding of removal failed as a matter of course.finally,the ij granted the petitioners applications for volunt
