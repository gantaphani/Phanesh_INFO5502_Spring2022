hector martin rodriguez castellon,a native and citizen of mexico and lawful permanent resident,petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the finding that he was removable under a a iii.we hold that because rodriguez state crime of conviction,california penal code section c,is a categorical crime of violence under b,rodriguez is an alien convicted of an aggravated felony within the meaning of a f.therefore,we deny the petition.
in april,rodriguez at that time,a year old man was charged with seventeen counts of lewd and lascivious acts upon children during the period between and,in violation of various provisions of the california penal code.as amended,count of the felony information alleged that rodriguez had sexual intercourse with a year old girl in violation of section c rodriguez pleaded nolo contendere to count on june,and received a sentence.
in june,the government served rodriguez with a notice to appear,which alleged that based on his conviction under section c,he was subject to removal under a a iii,for being convicted of an aggravated felony,as defined in both a a sexual abuse of a minor and a f crime of violence.in addition,the government alleged that due to his section c conviction,rodriguez was removable under a e i for a crime of child abuse.
at a hearing before an immigration judge ij on november,the ij adopted the government factual allegations and sustained all charges of removal.the ij first determined that a violation of section c constituted a crime of sexual abuse of a minor as defined in united states medina villa,cir.further,the ij determined that a violation of section c was also a crime of violence as defined in a f,because the nature of the offense,where the perpetrator,motivated by a desire for sexual arousal and in a superior physical position,engages in physical contact with the child victim at least ten years his junior is such that it inherently involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.finally,relying on the statutory definition of child abuse as meaning the physical or mental injury,sexual abuse or exploitation,or negligent treatment of a child,a,and the definition of sexual abuse as including the employment,use,persuasion,inducement,enticement,or coercion of a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct,a,the ij determined that a violation of section c constituted a crime of child abuse.
rodriguez appealed to the bia primarily on the ground that the government had failed to properly certify the documents comprising his record of conviction.on october,the bia dismissed the appeal.the bia rejected rodriguez certification argument in a footnote,and focused instead on an unbriefed issue whether a violation of section c constituted a crime of sexual abuse of a minor.relying on the newly decided united states castro,cir,in which we held that section c was not categorically sexual abuse of a minor,the bia concluded that the ij erred in sustaining removability on that ground.nevertheless,the bia upheld the ij ruling on one of the alternative grounds,that section c was a categorical crime of violence under b.the bia reasoned that w henever an adult engages in a lewd and lascivious act with a child at least years younger,there is a substantial risk that the child will take exception and,as a result,cause the adult to use force to further effectuate the conduct or to act in.the bia did not consider the third basis for the ij determination,that rodriguez committed a crime of child abuse.rodriguez timely filed this petition for review,appealing only the bia ruling that section c was a categorical crime of violence under b.
we have jurisdiction over this appeal under d.although we lack jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony among other offenses,a c,we retain jurisdiction over constitutional claims or questions of law,d,which includes the question whether a state crime of conviction is an aggravated felony.while we generally do not have jurisdiction to review unexhausted claims,we may review any issue addressed on the merits by the bia,regardless whether it was raised to the bia by the petitioner.abebe gonzales,cir.accordingly,we have jurisdiction to review the bia determination that rodriguez prior state conviction was a crime of violence,even though rodriguez did not raise this question to the bia.
we review questions of law de novo.we generally defer to the bia interpretation of the statutes and regulations it is charged with administering,fregozo holder,cir,but do not defer to the bia interpretation of state or federal criminal statutes,because the bia does not administer such statutes or have any special expertise regarding their meaning.see fernandez ruiz gonzales,cir en banc see also fregozo,at.here,a f provides that the term crime of violence has the definition set forth in which is a federal criminal statute.accordingly,we do not defer to the bia interpretation of.
on appeal,rodriguez argues that his conviction under section c is not a conviction for a crime of violence,under,and therefore is not an aggravated felony under a f.we begin by considering the relevant legal background.
an alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.a a iii.the government has the burden of proving that a particular offense qualifies as an aggravated felony.see salazar luviano mukasey,cir.the immigration and nationality act ina defines aggravated felony to mean among other things a crime of violence,as defined in,for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.a f.
in order to determine whether a conviction under section c qualifies as a crime of violence as defined in,we apply the categorical approach set forth in taylor united states,d.see nijhawan holder,d applying the categorical approach in the context of immigration offenses.under taylor,we first compare the elements of the statute of conviction with a federal definition of the crime to determine whether conduct proscribed by the statute is broader than the generic federal definition.quintero salazar keisler,cir.in identifying the elements of the statute of conviction,we consider not only the language of the state statute,but also the interpretation of that language in judicial opinions.covarrubias teposte holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted.if the federal generic offense is not a separate crime at common law but rather a classification of other crimes,such as crimes involving moral turpitude,or here,crimes of violence,we must also compare the crime of conviction with crimes we have previously determined to fall into that particular classification of crimes.cerezo mukasey,cir citing navarro lopez gonzales,cir en banc reinhardt,concurring for the majority internal quotation marks and citations omitted,overruled on other grounds by united states aguila montes de oca,cir en banc 
under this categorical approach,if the state statute of conviction criminalizes more conduct than the federal generic offense,then the state offense is not categorically included in the definition of the federal generic offense.united states velasquez bosque,cir.a state crime of conviction qualifies as a generic federal offense if and only if the full range of conduct covered by the state criminal statute is included in the relevant definition of the federal offense.barragan lopez holder,cir quoting penuliar mukasey,cir.if the state statute is divisible,and the full range of conduct in the state statute is not included in the federal offense,we may use the modified categorical approach so long as one of the crimes included in the statute is a categorical match for the federal generic offense.see descamps united states,d stating that the modified approach merely helps implement the categorical approach when a defendant was convicted of violating a divisible statute.under the modified approach,we examine certain judicial records to determine whether the defendant was necessarily convicted of the elements of a crime listed in a divisible statute that is a federal generic offense.shepard united states,d.
in order to apply this categorical approach,we must first determine the elements or definition of the federal generic offense.under,the phrase crime of violence has two meanings.first,under a,a state crime of conviction is a crime of violence if it has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.because the statute does not define the term physical force,we give the term its ordinary meaning,which in this context is violent force or force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.johnson united states,d interpreting the phrase physical force in the context of determining whether a state statute of conviction constitutes a violent felony under the armed career criminal act,e,which is defined as a felony having as an element the use of physical force against the person of another,e b i.second,even if the state crime does not include one of the elements listed in a,it is a crime of violence under b if it is i a felony and ii by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.b.the supreme court has explained that b criminalizes conduct that naturally involve s a person acting in disregard of the risk that physical force might be used against another in committing an offense.leocal ashcroft,d.
in determining whether a particular state crime presents a substantial risk of physical force for purposes of b,we must determine whether the conduct covered by the crime presents the requisite risk of injury in the ordinary case.united states ramos medina,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also delgado hernandez holder,cir holding that in determining whether a state crime presents a substantial risk that physical force may be used,we inquire whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense,in the ordinary case,presents such a risk quoting james united states,d internal quotations omitted barragan lopez,at same.our inquiry is thus not directed to conduct at the margins of the statute,delgado hernandez,at,but rather to a usual or ordinary violation.ramos medina,at emphasis removed.accordingly,we have held that a state crime may categorically be a crime of violence under b even though it is possible to violate the state statute without the use of any physical force.united states sandoval orellana,cir holding that a statute prohibiting specified sexual abuse is the type of felony that,by its nature,creates a substantial risk of physical force,even though some violations may occur through use of psychological,rather than physical coercion see also united states galvan rodriguez,cir w hen analyzing the operative phrase substantial risk,it is not necessary that the risk must occur in every instance rather a substantial risk requires a strong probability that the event,in this case the application of physical force during the commission of the crime,will occur.internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
further,a state crime may categorically be a crime of violence for purposes of b even when a state court has,in some cases,construed the statute as requiring something less than violent force.thus,in considering whether a violation of section of the california penal code which prohibits a person from kidnapping another forcibly,or by any other means of instilling fear was a categorical crime of violence,we noted the california supreme court ruling,in construing this section,that the only force required to kidnap an unresisting infant or child is the amount necessary to move the victim a substantial distance.delgado hernandez,at quoting in re michele,cal th,d.the state court ruling was later codified by the state legislature and added to section.id.while acknowledging that merely picking up and carrying away an infant,without any other conflict,does not entail a substantial risk of force as the term is used in,we held that the state court interpretation of section does not describe an ordinary case of the offense conduct rather it merely sets a lower limit on the force required.id.emphasis in original.because kidnapping presented a substantial risk of force in the ordinary case,we concluded that a violation of the state statute constituted a crime of violence for purposes of b.id.at.
in summary,in order for a state crime of conviction to constitute a crime of violence for purposes of,it must either include as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,a,or be a felony which by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense,b.to determine whether a state crime of conviction involves a substantial risk of the use of force,we must determine whether the conduct covered by that crime raises a substantial risk of physical force in the ordinary case,even though,at the margin,some violations of the state statute may not raise such a risk.in determining whether a particular state crime meets this criteria,we may compare the state crime of conviction to other crimes that we or other courts have previously categorized as crimes of violence under or other statutes using a similar definition 
we now turn to the state crime of conviction,section c,and compare its elements with the federal definition of.section c criminalizes the following conduct willfully committing any lewd or lascivious act upon or with any part of the body of a child who is or years old with the intent of arousing,appealing to,or gratifying the lust,passions,or sexual desires of the defendant or the child when the defendant is at least ten years older than the child.castro,at.
section c is not categorically a crime of violence as defined in a,because it does not include as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.a.we turn then to the question whether section c is categorically a crime of violence as defined in b.there is no dispute that a violation of section c is a felony under california law,castro,at,and so we must determine,as an issue of first impression in this circuit,whether a violation of section c,in the ordinary case,poses a substantial risk of the use of physical force under b.
to characterize an ordinary case in the absence of detailed statistical information that is unlikely to be available,united states sonnenberg,cir,the best we can do is use common sense and experience,and look to persuasive authority from other courts that have considered whether similar statutes qualify as crimes of violence for purposes of b,as we do in cases analyzing crimes involving moral turpitude.see cerezo,at see also delgado hernandez,at looking to california cases and authority to evaluate whether attempted kidnapping was a categorical crime of violence under b prakash holder,cir adopting the reasoning of a third circuit case in deciding whether solicitation to commit murder was a crime of violence under b.based on such a review,set out in detail below,we conclude that the weight of authority supports the conclusion that the sort of sexual conduct described in section c raises a substantial risk that an adult may use physical force against the or year old child in the ordinary case.
although we have not yet considered whether section c or another state statute criminalizing sexual conduct by an older adult with children who are or years old constitutes a crime of violence as defined in b,other circuits considering this issue have generally concluded that such state crimes by their nature create a substantial risk of physical force.see,united states austin,cir recognizing the general consensus that sexual abuse in touching a minor inherently,or by its nature,constitutes a crime of violence under because it involves a substantial risk of physical force.the eleventh circuit decision in ramsey,cir,is directly on point.in ramsey,a petitioner sought review of the bia determination that he was deportable because his state conviction for attempted lewd assault was a crime of violence for purposes of b,and therefore constituted an aggravated felony.the state crime of conviction provided that any person who h andles,fondles,or assaults any child under the age of years in a lewd,lascivious,or indecent manner without committing the crime of sexual battery,commits a felony of the second degree.id.at.the statute also provided that the victim consent was not a defense to the crime.id.while acknowledging that a violation of this statute could be committed without the use of physical force,the court concluded that the offense was a felony which involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used against the victim in the course of committing the offense.in reaching this conclusion,ramsey relied on united states reyescastro,cir and united states rodriguez,cir.in reyes castro,the tenth circuit held that a state crime of conviction involving an adult touching the anus,buttocks,or genitalia of a female child younger than years poses a substantial risk of the use of physical force for purposes of b,because when an older person attempts to sexually touch a child there is always a substantial risk that physical force will be used to ensure the child compliance.at see also rodriguez,at holding that a state statute making it unlawful for a person or older to sexually touch a child or solicit a child to engage in a sex act among other things is inherently an aggravated felony for purposes of b,which at that time defined aggravated felony as any crime of violence as defined in 
united states velazquez overa,cir,followed much the same reasoning.here,the fifth circuit determined that a state statute making it a crime for an adult to engage in sexual contact with a child younger than years and not his spouse was a crime of violence as defined in b,because the offense inherently involved a substantial risk that physical force may be used id.at citing.penal code a.the court reasoned that it was obvious that such crimes typically occur in close quarters,and are generally perpetrated by an adult upon a victim who is not only smaller,weaker,and less experienced,but is also generally susceptible to acceding to the coercive power of adult authority figures.id.at.because a child has very few,if any,resources to deter the use of physical force by an adult intent on touching the child,the court concluded that there is a significant likelihood that physical force may be used to perpetrate the crime.id.
the second circuit reached a similar conclusion in costa holder,cir.in costa,the court considered a state statute providing that a person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and such other person is thirteen years of age or older but under sixteen years of age and the actor is more than three years older than such other person.id.at citing.a.the second circuit determined that this offense was a crime of violence for purposes of,citing the reasoning in rodriguez.see id.at.further,the court endorsed and applied the reasoning in reyes castro that when an older person attempts to sexually touch a child there is always a substantial risk that physical force will be used to ensure the child compliance.id.at.the court explained that the risk of the use of force is inherent in each of the offenses set forth in the statute,even though a defendant could be convicted of the state offense by engaging in consensual sexual intercourse without force.id.at see also chery ashcroft,cir endorsing the reasoning in reyes castro.
courts have likewise determined that state crimes involving sexual contact between children and older adults give rise to a risk of force and were therefore crimes of violence for purposes of,which requires a showing that the offense otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.see united states curtis,noting that it is universally recognized that sexual offenses against children are crimes of violence under u.because of the substantial likelihood that the perpetrator will use physical force to ensure the child compliance with his demands in united states pierce,cir,abrogated in part by begay united states,d,for instance,the court considered whether a state statute described a crime of violence for purposes of,which at the time simply required a court to analyze whether the state crime otherwise involves conduct that presents a potential risk of physical injury to another.the state statute at issue provided that it was a felony to w illfully commit any lewd or lascivious act upon or with the body or any part or member of the body of any child of either sex under the age of years if the perpetrator was at least five years older than the child.id.at citing.a.although the state supreme court had defined the statute as not requiring any physical touching,the fourth circuit determined there was a risk of physical injury,because among other reasons w hen a child is the victim of adult conduct,force can be inferred.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the fourth circuit asserted that it joined every other circuit that has considered the question.id.at citing cases see also united states scudder,cir holding that fondling or touching a child between and is crime of violence for purposes of e b ii,which uses the same definition of the term as.we have reached a similar conclusion in analyzing a state statute that criminalized sexual offenses involving younger children.see united states wood,cir holding that a statute involving sexual contact with children under involved a serious potential risk of physical injury under the provision of,because the risk of violence is implicit in the size,age and authority position of the adult in dealing with a child.
these concerns are amplified where the perpetrator is significantly older than the victim.in united states alas castro,cir,for example,the eighth circuit concluded that a statute prohibiting adults over from subject ing another person fourteen years of age or younger to sexual contact was a crime of violence as defined by b because this type of contact between parties of differing physical and emotional maturity carries a substantial risk that physical force may be used in the course of committing the offense.internal quotation marks omitted.when the state statute does not specify the perpetrator age,the analysis may be different.for instance,in xiong,the seventh circuit considered a case involving an year old man who had been convicted of engaging in consensual sex with his year old girlfriend,cir.the court concluded that the state crime of conviction,which prohibited sexual contact or sexual intercourse with a person who has not attained the age of years,id.at,but did not specify the age of the perpetrator,was not a crime of violence for purposes of b,id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the court reasoned that the conduct of which the defendant was convicted consisted of consensual sex between a boyfriend and his fifteen year old girlfriend,and therefore a bsent a substantial age difference,this conduct did not,by its nature,involve a substantial risk of physical force.id.internal alterations omitted.the court proviso suggests that when a substantial age difference between the perpetrator and the victim is an element of the state crime of conviction,the court would reach a different conclusion.see id.at 
our decision in united states pereira salmeron,cir,though not directly on point,is consistent with the reasoning of these circuits.pereira salmeron considered whether a prior felony conviction under state law for carnally know ing,without the use of force,a child thirteen years of age or older but under fifteen years of age constituted a crime of violence for purposes of b a ii of the guidelines,which at that time included forcible sex offenses including sexual abuse of a minor.id.at emphasis omitted even though the state crime explicitly addresse d conduct undertaken without the use of force,id.at citing,we concluded that sexual contact with a minor inherently presents a risk of
