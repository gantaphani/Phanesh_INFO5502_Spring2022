igor bondarenko petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.bondarenko claims that he was arrested and beaten by the russian police,and later hit in the head so severely as to require hospitalization,because of his political activism against the war in chechnya.the immigration judge ij found bondarenko not credible,largely based on an investigative report introduced by the government without prior notice to bondarenko.the report concluded that a medical document bondarenko had submitted in support of his hospitalization claim was fraudulent.bondarenko requested an opportunity to investigate the manner in which the report had been prepared,and to question the person who had prepared the report.the ij denied the request,saying that bondarenko had already had an opportunity to authenticate the medical document and had failed to do so.the bia affirmed.
we conclude that bondarenko was denied due process and grant his petition.the two opinions upon which we primarily base our decision are cinapian holder,cir,and vatyan mukasey,cir.we note that both opinions came down after the ij rendered his decision,and that the opinion in cinapian came down after the bia rendered its decision.
background 
igor bondarenko is a native and citizen of russia.he entered the united states on june,on a j cultural exchange visa.he filed for asylum in march.the department of homeland security dhs initiated removal proceedings in september.
the following narrative is based on testimony and other evidence provided by bondarenko.bondarenko was a student at the state university in novosibirsk in and.he testified through a translator,i was studying the russian language and literature and sic second subject was german language.while at the university,bondarenko organized what he characterized as an,student group with several fellow students.
on three occasions,bondarenko experienced problems with russian authorities as a result of his antiwar activities.first,in november,he participated in a small demonstration near the military commissioner office in novosibirsk.during the demonstration,a special unit of the police,the omon,knocked bondarenko and other demonstrators to the ground,handcuffed them,and put them on a bus.they were taken to a cage at a district police station and held for approximately one and a half hours.the police questioned bondarenko,warned him that he was involved in activity,and instructed him not to do it again.the police fined him an amount equivalent to five months average salary.they also informed the dean of bondarenko university that his students were violating the law.
second,on saturday,february,bondarenko again distributed flyers,this time at a huge protest against the chechen war.as bondarenko and several others were packing up their car after the protest,four police officers approached.bondarenko recounted that the police knocked us on the ground face down in the snow and they handcuffed us and they put us in a bus that was standing nearby bondarenko was taken to the central police station and detained separately from other members of his group.on monday,the police took him from his cell and asked him to admit that he and his fellow protesters were receiving money from chechen warlords.bondarenko refused to admit the charge.the police then took him back to his cell.
on tuesday evening,the police again took him from his cell,took him to the same room as before,handcuffed him to a chair,and again asked him to admit that he had been receiving money from chechen warlords.when bondarenko refused to sign a document admitting the charge,he was knocked to the floor.two sergeants took turns beating him in the kidneys and legs with metal batons for about thirty minutes.they then left him alone.after a time,a captain of the federal security service came in and asked him to sign the document admitting the charge.when bondarenko again refused to do so,the two sergeants returned.this time,they beat him with batons for about an hour.
bondarenko was released early wednesday morning.he speculated that his release may have been due to a telephone call from the very influential soldiers mothers organization.after his release,bondarenko had taken and learned that no bones had been broken.he tried to submit a complaint about the behavior of the police,but the prosecutor office refused to accept it.
third,on june,bondarenko was present at a demonstration of about five hundred people.while a speaker was talking,a police captain took the floor and instructed the participants to disperse and break up.about fifteen or twenty minutes later,police arrived in omon buses.the police were beating left and right.while bondarenko was trying to protect a short girl who was trying to escape,the police hit him on the head.he was bleeding a lot,passed out for a second,and fell down.he was arrested and put into one of the buses.bondarenko and others on the bus were sprayed with what bondarenko believed to be tear gas.
bondarenko and the others were taken to the central police station.he and thirty other people were crowded into a cell meant to hold four or five people.because of his head injury,he could not stand.others in the cell asked the police to call a doctor.after three hours,the police finally took bondarenko to the emergency room at a hospital,public clinic.bondarenko spent three days at the hospital.when he was discharged from the hospital on june,a medical doctor at the hospital gave him a document.the document does not name bondarenko,but it gives the dates of admission and discharge and describes the injury as closed trauma of temporal area of medium severity.the document has what appears to be an official stamp at the bottom.bondarenko testimony before the ij was consistent with the dates and injury described in the document 
at the hearing,the ij asked bondarenko if he and his fellow demonstrators had a permit for the november protest.bondarenko said they did not need one because they were not obstructing anything.bondarenko added that he knew for sure that there had been a permit for the february protest,testifying that the permission was gotten by soldiers mothers organization.no questions were asked,and no evidence was presented,on whether a permit was required or obtained for the june protest.
after bondarenko was discharged from the hospital,he went to the university to prepare for his exams.when he arrived,the dean informed him that he had been expelled as a result of his continuing problems with the authorities.bondarenko had already received his j visa authorizing him to travel to the united states.bondarenko took the train from novosibirsk to moscow on june.he flew to the united states on june.
while bondarenko was living in the united states,he received a summons to appear at the russian ministry of internal affairs.after filing for asylum,he received a second summons requiring him to appear at the military registration and enlistment office.according to bondarenko,his expulsion from the university automatically required him to serve in the army.he believed that the police were searching for him while he was in the united states because he was avoiding this service and because of previous antigovernment activities.he fears that he will be arrested if he returns to russia and that he will be disappear ed or locked up forever.
in support of his asylum application,bondarenko submitted the medical document he says he received on june,upon his release from public clinic,the two summonses from the russian government,a certificate showing that he was dismissed from the university on june,and screenshots of websites for the antiwar organizations with which he worked.
the ij held a lengthy initial hearing on may,during which bondarenko testified on both direct and cross.at the end of the hearing,the government objected to the documents bondarenko submitted,on the ground that they had not been authenticated.bondarenko attorney stated that he would not try to have the exhibits independently authenticated because of the difficulties in doing so,but argued that bondarenko should be allowed to authenticate the documents through his own testimony.the government stated that it wished to send several of the documents for forensic investigation.
bondarenko appeared briefly before the ij on march,march,and october.on each of those dates,the hearing was rescheduled,in part because the government had not received a response to its request for forensic investigation of bondarenko documents.finally,on july,the ij conducted a brief hearing.the government first questioned bondarenko about the medical document he claimed to have been given upon his discharge from public clinic.the government then produced a report summarizing its investigation into the authenticity of the document.the government had not previously shown the report to bondarenko or his attorney.
the report,dated october,was prepared by united states citizenship and immigration service uscis assistant stephen smoot.the report states,in its entirety 
on april,a memorandum was received from megan oshiro,acc.los angeles,ca requesting that uscis moscow verify the authenticity of a medical document submitted by igor bondarenko in support of immigration benefits.the medical document in question was purportedly issued by the municipal clinic in novosibirsk,russia.
uscis moscow contacted the head physician of the city policlinic formerly municipal clinic in novosibirsk,in order to verify the authenticity of the document.the head physician of the hospital,in an official written response to the embassy stated the following 
the form of the document in question does not match known examples of the form that is issued by the hospital.
there is currently,nor has there ever been a doctor ivanov employed by the hospital.
that there is no record of treatment for igor bondarenko at the hospital.
the document in question is fraudulent.
uscis moscow is aware of the confidentiality requirements of c,and did not reveal or imply the existence of an asylum application on the part of any alien in this investigation.
given the date on the report,we may infer that by the time of the hearing it had been in the possession of government attorneys for more than eight months.the report includes neither the name of the head physician of the hospital who had written the official response to the embassy,nor a copy of his response.the report indicates that the number of the clinic has been changed from to but does not provide the address of the clinic.uscis assistant smoot,who prepared the report,did not attend the hearing.
bondarenko attorney objected to the introduction of the report on the ground that this was the first time he had seen it.he requested a continuance so that he could investigate the report.he specifically asked to be allowed to send interrogatories to smoot to ask him how he conducted his investigation.bondarenko attorney said,we have had our own investigator look into these types of reports and come back with completely different results.the ij denied the request for a continuance.in the ij view,bondarenko had had the burden of authenticating the medical document,and now it was too late 
bondarenko attorney your honor,may i request some more time to do our own investigation 
ij you should have done it already y ou have had four years to get this document authenticated.
attorney we were waiting for this report.
ij no,you had the burden of getting it authenticated since september of and you did.
attorney how would i know what in this report 
ij you do have to know.all you had to do was get the record authenticated and you did do it.
in a written decision,the ij denied bondarenko claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.the ij found bondarenko was not credible.based on the forensic report presented by the government,he found that the medical document was fraudulent.he wrote,since respondent vouched for the veracity of the medical record and did not claim that someone else obtained this document,the court finds that respondent knew the document was fraudulent.the ij then pointed to other things in the record,such as inconsistencies in bondarenko testimony and the lack of specific detail in the written narrative of his asylum application,and made an adverse credibility finding.the ij held,in the alternative,that even if bondarenko were credible,he did not qualify for relief.
the bia rejected bondarenko due process claim 
nor are we persuaded by the respondent arguments that the immigration judge committed error and violated his due process by concluding that the respondent s document was fraudulent without allowing the respondent to the investigating officer or granting a continuance so that he could conduct his own investigation.in this regard,the immigration judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the continuance request,and the proceedings were not so fundamentally unfair that the respondent was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.gonzalez ins,cir colmenar ins,cir.
the bia upheld the ij adverse credibility finding as not clearly erroneous.the bia noted that the medical document was not the only basis for the ij adverse credibility finding.it pointed to other credibility problems and stated,t he constellation of problems identified by the immigration judge leads us to conclude that his findings regarding the respondent lack of credibility are not clearly erroneous.the bia further concluded that even if bondarenko were credible,the harm he had suffered was not of such severity as to rise to the level of persecution,and that the ij did not err in concluding that the respondent failed to adequately demonstrate an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution.
bondarenko timely petitioned for review.
ii.standard of review 
the bia affirmed the ij decision,citing matter of burbano.when the bia cites matter of burbano and does not expressly disagree with the ij decision,it adopts the ij decision in its entirety.id.at abebe gonzales,cir en banc.when the bia cites burbano but adds its own analysis,we review factual findings by both the bia and the ij for substantial evidence.ali holder,cir hakeem ins,cir.
we review constitutional due process challenges to immigration decisions de novo.ramirez alejandre ashcroft,cir en banc.we review for substantial evidence the bia decision that an applicant has failed to establish eligibility for asylum.njuguna ashcroft,cir.the bia determination of facts is conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.
iii.discussion 
bondarenko challenges the bia decision in several respects.his most important arguments are the ij violated due process by allowing the government to introduce its forensic report on the medical document without prior notice and by refusing a continuance to allow bondarenko to investigate the report on the assumption that bondarenko was credible,the ij and the bia improperly concluded that he had not suffered past persecution and the government improperly revealed information about bondarenko asylum application in conducting its forensic investigation of the medical document.
due process 
we conclude that the ij violated due process in not allowing bondarenko a continuance to investigate the forensic report.a n alien who faces deportation is entitled to a full and fair hearing of his claims and a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on his behalf.colmenar,at.in circumstances remarkably similar to those in bondarenko case,we held in cinapian holder,cir,that the government had violated due process.id.at.at the cinapians asylum hearing,the government had submitted,without prior notice,forensic reports concluding that documents the cinapians had submitted were fraudulent.id.at.the author of the report was not available for at the hearing.id.at.the ij refused a continuance to allow the cinapians to review the reports.id.we held that the combination of the government failure to disclose the dhs forensic reports in advance of the hearing or to make the reports author available for and the ij subsequent consideration of the reports under these circumstances denied petitioners a fair hearing.id.at.
