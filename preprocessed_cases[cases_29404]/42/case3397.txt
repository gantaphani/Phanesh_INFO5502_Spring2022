jose maria vasquez cruz appeals from the month prison sentence imposed following his conviction for illegal reentry in violation of a.he argues that the district court procedurally erred by failing to analyze whether he was entitled to a downward departure from the applicable sentencing range under the sentencing guidelines and by failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.he also argues that the district court imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we affirm.
on december,the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice investigated a report that a previously deported alien was residing unlawfully in reno,nevada.the investigation led ice agents to vasquez cruz,a citizen of mexico who had previously been removed from the united states on four occasions.on june,vasquez cruz pleaded guilty to unlawful reentry by a deported,removed,or excluded alien in violation of a without a plea agreement.
taking into account vasquez cruz five prior criminal convictions for burglary,battery,and battery on a police officer,the presentence report calculated vasquez cruz total offense level as and criminal history category as iv,which translated to a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.the presentence report noted that vasquez cruz might be culturally assimilated to the united states because he entered the country for the first time at age,but recommended against a downward departure from the guidelines range on that basis.the report also noted that vasquez cruz had learning disorders and mild retardation,but recommended that the district court not apply a downward variance under a because of vasquez cruz criminal history which included four battery convictions.the presentence report then recommended a guideline sentence of months.
in response to the presentence report,vasquez cruz filed a sentencing memorandum requesting a sentence of twelve months and one day.vasquez cruz first argued that the district court should grant him a downward variance under on account of his cultural assimilation and mental disability.vasquez cruz then argued that he was entitled to a downward departure under cmt.on account of his cultural assimilation.to support his request for a downward variance or departure,vasquez cruz attached the expert reports of martha mahaffey,who diagnosed vasquez cruz with mild mental retardation and other disabilities,and amado padilla,who concluded that vasquez cruz meets the necessary criteria for cultural assimilation.
at the sentencing hearing,the district court listened to the parties arguments,including discussion of vasquez cruz cultural assimilation and mental disability.before imposing a sentence,the court stated that it had carefully considered the presentence report,defendant sentencing memorandum,and the expert reports,and also considered the factors which the court is required to consider under united states code,section a.the court held that the appropriate guidelines range was to months and remarked that vasquez cruz does fall outside the heartland of that,nor do i see any basis for a variance or departure in this case.the court then imposed a sentence of months,at the low end of the guidelines range.it reasoned that,although inclined to impose a sentence at the highest end of the guideline range,or even consider a departure upward because of vasquez cruz fairly extensive and troubling criminal history,a low end sentence was nevertheless warranted because of the defendant mental capacity.
vasquez cruz timely appealed his sentence.on appeal,vasquez cruz argues that the district court procedurally erred by failing to determine whether he was entitled to a departure under the sentencing guidelines before considering whether he was entitled to a variance under a.this failure,vasquez cruz argues,violates the sequencing required by,as amended in,which directs district courts to first determine the guidelines range,then consider departures from the guidelines,and finally consider the applicable factors in a taken as a whole.vasquez cruz also asserts that the district court procedurally erred by failing to give an adequate explanation of the chosen sentence,and that the district court abused its discretion by imposing a substantively unreasonable sentence.
in reviewing a sentence determination,a court must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error,such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence including an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.gall united states,d.if the district court sentence is procedurally sound,the appellate court should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an standard.id.
we turn first to vasquez cruz argument that the district court procedurally erred by failing to address whether he was entitled to a departure for cultural assimilation under cmt.before applying the sentencing factors set forth in a.
we have long held that we do not review the procedural correctness of a district court discretionary decision to depart from the guidelines range.rather,we treat the scheme of downward and upward departures as essentially replaced by the requirement that judges impose a reasonable sentence.united states mohamed,cir see also united states ellis,cir.in mohamed we explained that,even if the district court erred in applying a departure,there would be no point in reversing for such an error because the sentencing judge still would be free on remand to impose exactly the same sentence by exercising his discretion under the guidelines and s uch a sentence would then be reviewed for reasonableness.at.for this reason,any erroneous application of the departure would be harmless so long as the sentence actually imposed was substantively reasonable.therefore,our review of the departure would have little or no independent value and would result in wasted time and resources in the courts of appeal,with little or no effect on sentencing decisions.id we made clear that these rules governed the appellate review of sentences,id.at citing united states booker,d,and did not prevent consultation of the system of departures that existed under the mandatory regime,either by the district court or by this court,id.at.in declining to review departures,we acknowledged that we were parting ways with several of our sister circuits,and instead following the seventh circuit,which had declared that the concept of departures has been rendered obsolete in the world.id.at quoting united states arnaout,cir.
vasquez cruz argues that mohamed was abrogated by the sentencing commission amendment to of the guidelines,referred to as amendment.see app.c,vol.iii,at.as explained by the sentencing commission,amendment reorganized the text of to divide the existing sentencing procedure into three steps the specific language changes to made by amendment were relatively minor.first,the amendment made adjustments to the instructions to district courts for determining the correct guidelines range second,the amendment grouped the instructions into three subsections subsections a to c with nested paragraphs to,rather than listing all instructions in order as subsections a to i.finally,the amendment added subsection c,which,per booker,requires the district court to determine the substantive reasonableness of the sentence by considering the applicable factors in a taken as a whole.c.the sentencing commission also amended the commentary to to note that s ubsections a,b,and c are structured to reflect the process used in determining the particular sentence to be imposed.app.c,vol.iii,at.in its statement of reasons for amendment,the sentencing commission explained that while most circuits agree on a approach to determining a sentence,including the consideration of departure provisions,the seventh circuit had stated that departures are obsolete.id.at.according to the sentencing commission,amendment resolves the circuit confl
