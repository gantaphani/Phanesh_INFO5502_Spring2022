jorge aguilera rios aguilera,a citizen of mexico,was convicted of a california firearms offense,removed from the united states on the basis of that conviction,and,when he returned to the country,tried and convicted of illegal reentry under.he contends that his prior removal order was invalid because his conviction under california penal code c was not a categorical match for the federal firearms aggravated felony.we agree that he was not originally removable as charged,and so could not be convicted of illegal reentry.we therefore reverse the judgment of conviction.
aguilera entered the united states without inspection at the age of five to live with his parents,who were lawful permanent residents.he became a lawful permanent resident in.two years later,he was convicted of unlawful firearms possession in violation of california penal code c 
in,aguilera was served with a notice to appear,alleging that he had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude,u.a a i,and an aggravated felony firearms offense,a c,and so was subject to removal.one week later,aguilera appeared before an immigration judge ij.he admitted that he had been convicted of unlawful firearms activity in violation of california penal code c,but did not concede removability.the ij nonetheless held aguilera subject to removal as charged,and denied him any relief from removal.aguilera was removed to mexico.
six years later,aguilera was charged with attempted entry after deportation,in violation of a and b.aguilera moved to dismiss the indictment under d,arguing that,during the removal proceedings,the ij did not meaningfully advise him of his opportunity to apply for voluntary departure.the district court denied the motion,and aguilera was found guilty of illegal reentry.aguilera was sentenced to time served,and has since been removed to mexico.
on april,after aguilera filed his opening brief in this case,the supreme court issued its decision in moncrieffe holder,concerning application of the categorical approach in immigration cases.although that case involved a marijuana conviction,the majority opinion addressed an argument by the solicitor general that,under the court analysis,a conviction under any state firearms law that lacks an exception for antique firearms present in the federal firearms statute will be deemed to fail the categorical inquiry.id.at.aguilera moved to file a substitute opening brief in this case,arguing that,after moncrieffe,his removal order was invalid for a second reason in addition to the previously asserted due process violation aguilera was never deportable as charged because the california statute of conviction lacked an antique firearms exception.we accepted the substitute brief,and the government responded to aguilera arguments in its answering brief.
we review aguilera collateral attack on his removal order de novo.see united states lopez velasquez,cir en banc.
a defendant charged with illegal reentry pursuant to has a due process right to bring a collateral attack challenging the validity of his underlying deportation order because it serves as a predicate element of his conviction.united states melendez castro,cir per curiam citation omitted.section d expressly provides for such collateral attacks on an underlying deportation order,but establishes limits on them.a defendant must demonstrate that he exhausted all administrative remedies available to appeal his prior removal order the prior removal proceedings improperly deprived him of the opportunity for judicial review and the entry of the prior removal order was fundamentally unfair.d.
the government recognizes that the first two elements of d have been met.it maintains,however,that aguilera can not meet the last element,fundamental unfairness.
an underlying removal order is fundamentally unfair if an alien due process rights were violated by defects in the underlying deportation proceeding,and he suffered prejudice as a result of the defects.united states pallares galan,cir citation omitted.if aguilera was removed when he should not have been,his removal was fundamentally unfair,and he may not be convicted of reentry after deportation.united states camacho lopez,cir.
aguilera central contention is that the generic federal definition of a firearm specifically exempts antique firearms,while the california definition of a firearm does not.thus,a person may be convicted under cal infornia penal code for conduct that does not fall within the firearms ground of removal.the government asks us not to reach this argument on the ground that aguilera waived it by failing to raise it in the district court.in addition,the government argues that moncrieffe can not be retroactively applied to invalidate a removal that was proper under the law at the time it was ordered.we address each of these points in turn.
as to waiver,the government contends that aguilera failure to raise his new moncrieffe argument before trial as part of his motion to dismiss the indictment effected a waiver pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure b b.that rule provides that a motion alleging a defect in the indictment or information must be raised before trial.b b.
we decline to find such a waiver here.rule e sets forth specifically the circumstances under which an argument is waived.it provides that a party waives any rule b defense,objection,or request not raised by the deadline the court sets for pretrial motions.e.but rule e further indicates that f or good cause,the court may grant relief from the waiver.id.on appeal,we have held that even issues that are deemed waived in the district court under rule may be addressed by this court and relief may be granted where good cause is shown for the party failure to raise the argument earlier.united states anderson,cir quoting united states murillo,f d,cir internal quotation marks omitted emphasis and alteration in original.we find good cause to excuse aguilera failure to raise this argument in the district court.
prior to moncrieffe,aguilera would have had no reason to challenge whether he was properly removed for a firearms offense.as we explain below,this court caselaw prior to moncrieffe foreclosed the argument he now makes.see gil holder,cir.we have previously albeit not explicitly in the rule context elect ed to entertain an issue raised for the first time on appeal because of a change in the intervening law that brought the issue into focus.in re skywalkers,cir citing romain shear,cir holding that a change in the law during the pendency of an appeal permits entertainment of an issue not previously raised,cert.denied,united states tekle,cir affirming finding of no good cause to excuse a rule waiver because united states gantt,cir did not change the law.in fact,the gantt court acknowledged as much.
moreover,aguilera demonstrated diligence by moving in this court within a month after moncrieffe was decided to substitute his opening brief.and the government had a full opportunity to respond in written briefing and at oral argument to this purely legal issue.aguilera has therefore shown good cause to excuse his failure to raise this argument in the district court.we decline to find it waived.
the government next contends that moncrieffe can not be retroactively applied to invalidate aguilera removal order.it cites united states vidal mendoza,cir,for the proposition that on collateral review,a removal is to be judged under the applicable law at the time of the removal hearing,id.at,not precedent,id.at.
vidal mendoza concerned the scope of an ij duty to advise a noncitizen of his eligibility for discretionary relief.it held that a noncitizen due process rights are not violated if an ij informs him,based on controlling law at the time of the removal hearing,that he is ineligible for relief,even if changes in the law would have altered that analysis.id.at.noting that an ij need not anticipate future change s in law,vidal mendoza suggested that applying precedent on collateral review would violate our principle that ijs are not expected to be clairvoyant when discharging their duty to inform.id.at quoting lopez velasquez,at alteration in original.
vidal mendoza and its predecessor,lopez velasquez,do not apply here.those cases asked what law applies when evaluating whether an ij violated its duty to inform the noncitizen of potential avenues for relief.this case concerns not the duty to inform the noncitizen of his eligibility for relief in a removal proceeding,but whether he was removable at all.
in a similar case,the tenth circuit concluded that d ecisions of statutory interpretation are fully retroactive because they do not change the law,but rather explain what the law has always meant.united states rivera nevarez,cir citing rivers roadway express,a judicial construction of a statute is an authoritative statement of what the statute meant before as well as after the decision of the case giving rise to that construction.rivera nevarez concerned whether the supreme court decision in leocal ashcroft,which held that a florida driving under the influence of alcohol offense did not constitute a crime of violence,would apply retroactively to invalidate a defendant removal order.rivera nevarez,at.the court held that b ecause leocal involves a question of statutory construction,its holding is retroactively applicable to the time of rivera nevarez removal hearing.id.as leocal merely explain ed what the law has always meant,rivera nevarez noted that it provides the correct interpretation of the law as it stood in when rivera nevarez was deported.id.
we reached the same conclusion as the tenth circuit in camacho lopez.like rivera nevarez,camacho lopez concerned a removal that was invalid after leocal.camacho lopez retroactively applied leocal,explaining that the government concedes that leocal a substantive interpretation of crime of violence under applies to camacho deportation hearing,that camacho notice to appear charged him as removable only for having committed an aggravated felony,and that after leocal,camacho prior conviction did not fit that definition.camacho lopez,f d at emphasis omitted.we therefore reversed his conviction as having been premised on an invalid removal order.id.
camacho lopez has since been cited by district courts within the ninth circuit for the proposition that any substantive interpretation of a crime of violence or aggravated felony provision is fully retroactive on collateral review.see,united states dominguez,no.cas,wl,at.may,united states rodriguez garcia,no.cr efs,wl,at.our recent precedent,however,counsels a more restrictive reading of camacho lopez.see united states gomez,wl cir.
unlike vidal mendoza and lopez velasquez,gomez did not concern the ij duty to inform.gomez nonetheless considered only the federal law at the time gomez was ordered deported in january in determining whether the alien was eligible for relief from deportation.id.at emphasis added.gomez did not,however,involve application of precedent on collateral review where that precedent would render a noncitizen not removable camacho lopez did.indeed,gomez specifically distinguished camacho lopez,noting that i t concerned whether leocal was nonetheless applicable on collateral review to determine whether he was subject to removal as,as in this case,whether,although removable,he was entitled to discretionary relief.id.at distinguishing relief from removal from removability.
moreover,whether or not one regards camacho lopez as binding precedent on that point there is good reason to distinguish between discretionary relief,as in gomez,and grounds for removability for purposes of collateral review of removal proceedings.section is concerned with whether a noncitizen has reentered after being denied admission,excluded,deported,or removed.a.where a noncitizen is in fact removable,the denial of an opportunity to apply for a voluntary departure,the discretionary relief at issue in gomez,does not implicate the propriety of a removal in the same fundamental a way as does an ij legal determination that a noncitizen is removable on the basis of precedent we now know to have been erroneous.
where relief is discretionary,it may not have been accorded,requiring an inquiry comparing the equities in a particular case to those in similar cases.see,united states rojas pedroza,cir describing the process of determining whether a noncitizen was prejudiced by an ij failure to advise him of his eligibility for discretionary relief,including the focus on whether aliens with similar circumstances received relief.and where relief was not available at the time,there are no comparable cases with which to conduct the required analysis.moreover,the relevant facts tending to show whether an ij would have granted discretionary relief to a particular noncitizen would often have to be reconstructed,because there would have been no reason to develop them if the noncitizen was categorically ineligible for relief from removal at the time.finally,most forms of relief from removal are matters of grace as to someone already determined to be removable.see,tovar landin ashcroft,cir describing voluntary departure,the form of relief also at issue in gomez.failing to obtain such discretionary relief is quite different than the situation here,where aguilera would have had the right to be in the united states,as a lawful permanent resident,but for the ij determination that he was removable a determination we now know to be legally erroneous after moncrieffe,as we explain below.
where that is the question,the usual rule that statutory interpretation decisions are fully retroactive should apply.otherwise,an individual who had the right to remain here as a legal resident and to return to this country if he leaves but was removed as a result of a legal error,would be subject to criminal conviction and incarcerated for returning.such an individual is in effect being criminally punished for the government legal mistake.to maintain via enforcement proceedings the finality of an otherwise proper removal order is one thing to impose criminal sanctions under these circumstances is quite another 
we therefore reject the government position that we can not consider moncrieffe in evaluating whether aguilera was removable as charged.we proceed to consider aguilera challenge on the merits.
federal law makes deportable a ny alien who at any time after admission is convicted under any law of purchasing,selling,offering for sale,exchanging,using,owning,possessing,or carrying any firearm or destructive device as defined in section a of title in violation of any law.a c.section a defines the term firearm,stating,inter alia,that s uch term does not include an antique firearm.a.
aguilera asserts that after moncrieffe,any conviction under a state firearms statute lacking an exception for antique firearms is not a categorical match for the federal firearms ground of removal.we agree.and because moncrieffe is clearly irreconcilable with this court prior case law,particularly in gil,we must follow moncrieffe not gil.see miller gammie,cir.
gil held that in conducting the categorical analysis,we do not consider the availability of affirmative defenses the fact that there may be an affirmative defense under the federal statute,but not under the state statute of conviction,does not mean that the state conviction does not fall categorically within the federal statute.at.that general holding is still valid after moncrieffe,as the court decision said nothing about affirmative defenses.united states albino loe,cir.but gil treatment of the antique firearms exception of a c as an affirmative defense,which need not be considered in a categorical analysis,see at,rather than as an element of the definition of the criminal offense,which must be,has been clearly overruled.
a bit of background on moncrieffe is necessary to understand its effect on our case law moncrieffe,a lawful permanent resident,pleaded guilty under georgia law to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.moncrieffe.at.alleging that moncrieffe conviction constituted an aggravated felony,the government sought to deport him.id.the board of immigration appeals concluded that possession with intent to distribute is an offense under the controlled substances act csa,a,punishable by up to five years imprisonment,id.b d,and therefor
