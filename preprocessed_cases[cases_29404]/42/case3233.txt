in this case,we consider whether a statute written in the disjunctive is divisible in light of the supreme court decision in descamps united states.the statutory text at issue is a different portion of the same statute that the supreme court encountered in descamps california penal code section which states,inter alia,that e very person who enters any vehicle,when the doors are locked,with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.here,the board of immigration appeals bia determined that petitioner conviction under section qualified as an attempted theft offense,an aggravated felony under a u,by applying the modified categorical approach.this approach is permissible only if section is divisible.we hold that the presence of an or between grand or petit larceny and any felony does not,in itself,render the statute divisible,and that,under descamps,section is indivisible as a matter of law.therefore,the bia use of the modified categorical approach was impermissible,and we accordingly grant the petition for review.
background 
petitioner carlos alberto rendon,a native and citizen of mexico,was admitted to the united states in as a lawful permanent resident lpr.on july,the immigration and naturalization service ins lodged a charge against petitioner based on his burglary conviction in california state court under section b of the california penal code.the ins contended that this offense qualified as an aggravated felony under a g because it was a theft offense or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment was at least one year.on this basis,the ins alleged that petitioner was subject to removal under a a iii for having committed an aggravated felony 
on august,the immigration judge ij agreed with the ins that petitioner was removable and denied petitioner request for adjustment of status and a waiver under h because,according to the ij,petitioner had been convicted of an aggravated felony,which rendered him ineligible for such a waiver.on appeal,the board of immigration appeals bia remanded to the ij for consideration of a subsequent bia opinion interpreting the meaning of burglary offense in a g,as well as conflicting federal court cases concerning the intersection between state burglary convictions and crimes of violence,which are aggravated felonies under a f.
on remand,petitioner sought cancellation of removal under a.this time,the ij determined that petitioner burglary conviction was an aggravated felony because it qualified under a u as an attempted theft offense commission of an aggravated felony renders an alien statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal.a.as a result,the ij concluded that petitioner was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal the bia dismissed petitioner appeal of the ij decision.in support of its decision,the bia looked to the contents of petitioner plea to determine that he had been convicted of california penal code section for entering a locked vehicle with the intent to commit larceny,an aggravated felony emphasis added.petitioner filed a timely petition with this court for review of the bia decision that his conviction under california penal code section was an aggravated felony that rendered him ineligible for cancellation of removal.

discussion 
petitioner was convicted of burglary under california penal code section,which states,inter alia,that e very person who enters any vehicle,when the doors are locked,with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary.this conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony if petitioner violation was an attempted theft offense or burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment was at least one year.a g id.a u.descamps held that a conviction under section does not qualify as a conviction for generic burglary.at.the bia determined,however,that petitioner was ineligible for cancellation of removal because his conviction under section was for an attempted theft offense.we disagree.accordingly,we grant the petition and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion 
in order to determine whether a state conviction qualifies as an attempted theft offense under the federal aggravated felony statute,a u,we use the approach set forth in taylor united states.see gonzales duenas alvarez.that approach deemed the categorical approach requires that courts look only to the statutory definitions,the elements of a defendant prior offenses,and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions when making a comparison between a prior conviction and a federal,generic crime.descamps.at quoting taylor,at.if the state statute under which the defendant was previously convicted has the same elements as,or is narrower than,the federal,generic crime,then the prior conviction can serve as an aggravated felony predicate.id.however,if the state statute sweeps more broadly than the generic crime,a conviction under that law can not count as an aggravated felony predicate,even if the defendant actually committed the offense in its generic form.id.
for the limited purpose of help ing to implement the categorical approach,id.at,the court has recognized a narrow range of cases in which courts may apply the modified categorical approach,id.at quoting taylor,at internal quotation marks omitted.the modified categorical approach allows courts to look beyond the statutory text to a limited set of documents to determine the elements of the state offense of which the defendant was convicted when some alternative elements of the state crime would match the federal,generic crime,and other alternative elements would not.see id.at.recently,the supreme court in descamps explained that courts may use the modified categorical approach only when a statute is divisible,lists multiple,alternative elements,and so effectively creates several different crimes.id.quoting nijhawan holder,emphasis added.the court contrasted divisible statutes with those that are indivisible,contain a single,indivisible set of elements constituting a single crime for which the modified categorical approach is inappropriate.id.at.this decision abrogated our earlier decision in united states aguila montes de oca,cir en banc,in which we had asserted that courts could use the modified categorical approach when a statute is indivisible,yet missing an element of the federal,generic crime.thus,after descamps we may apply the modified categorical approach only when the state statute at issue is divisible if the state statute at issue is overbroad and indivisible,we may not apply the modified categorical approach,and we must hold that petitioner has met his burden for establishing that he was not convicted of an aggravated felony 
in this case,the bia applied the modified categorical approach to determine that petitioner conviction under california penal code section was an attempted theft offense,which is an aggravated felony under a u and a g.we review only whether petitioner conviction qualifies as an attempted theft offense because o ur review is limited to the bia decision and the grounds upon which it found petitioner ineligible for cancellation of removal.vargas hernandez gonzales,cir 
as an initial matter,california penal code section is not a categorical match to the federal,generic crime of an attempted theft offense because section punishes a broader range of conduct than a generic attempted theft offense.section states,inter alia,that e very person who enters any vehicle,when the doors are locked,with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony is guilty of burglary emphasis added.a generic attempted theft offense includes two elements an intent to commit a theft offense and an overt act constituting a substantial step towards the commission of the offense.ngaeth,at.our precedent squarely holds that section punishes a broader range of conduct than the generic crime of an attempted theft offense because s ection may be violated by an attempt to commit a crime other than theft for example,by breaking into a vehicle with the intent to commit arson.id 
before descamps,we would have applied the modified categorical approach to determine whether the documents we are permitted to examine in implementing that approach reveal that petitioner intended to commit theft.see,id.at.however,in light of descamps,we can not employ that approach unless the statute is divisible.here,we conclude that it is not.
descamps addressed the proper method for distinguishing divisible statutes from indivisible statutes.the critical distinction is that while indivisible statutes may contain multiple,alternative means of committing the crime,only divisible statutes contain multiple,alternative elements of functionally separate crimes.see descamps.at united states cabrera gutierrez,wl,at n cir,u nder descamps,what must be divisible are the elements of the crime,not the mode or means of proving an element.this distinction explains why the modified categorical approach is appropriate only for divisible statutes because the modified categorical approach as applied to a divisible statute may reveal which alternative element the state charged and the jury or judge found when only some alternative elements match the federal,generic crime.in other words,as descamps explained,when a state statute punishes a broader range of conduct than a federal,generic crime,only divisible statutes enable a sentencing court to conclude that a jury or judge at a plea hearing has convicted the defendant of every element of the generic crime.at.that is because a prosecutor charging a violation of a divisible statute must generally select the relevant element from its list of alternatives.and the jury,as instructions in the case will make clear,must then find that element,unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt.id.citation and footnote omitted.
while the jury faced with a divisible statute must unanimously agree on the particular offense of which the petitioner has been convicted and thus,the alternative element,the opposite is true of indivisible statutes the jury need not so agree.for example,if the statute at issue is indivisible,the jury would not need to agree on the particular substantive crime that the defendant intended as long as all jurors find that the defendant intended to commit at least one of grand or petit larceny or any felony.to illustrate this point,the descamps court used an example from aguila montes where a state statute criminalized assault with a weapon,while a federal enhancement statute applied only if the defendant was convicted of assault with a gun.the court explained that a s long as the statute itself requires only an indeterminate weapon,that is all the indictment must or is likely to allege and all the jury instructions must or are likely to mention.and most important,that is all the jury must find to convict the defendant.the jurors need not all agree on whether the defendant used a gun or a knife or a tire iron,because the actual statute requires the jury to find only a weapon.and even if in many cases,the jury could have readily reached consensus on the weapon used,a later sentencing court can not supply that missing judgment.id.in other words,descamps held that indivisible statutes are indivisible precisely because the jury need not agree on anything past the fact that the statute was violated.as long as the defendant conduct violates the statute,the jury can disagree as to how,and a later sentencing court can not conclude that the jury in fact agreed on the particular means of commission.
of course,this logic need not be limited to statutes with indeterminate words,weapon that are only implicitly divisible gun,knife,tire iron.any statutory phrase that explicitly or implicitly refers to multiple,alternative means of commission must still be regarded as indivisible if the jurors need not agree on which method of committing the offense the defendant used.otherwise,the court express purpose for separating indivisible statutes from divisible statutes preventing sentencing courts from finding facts on which a jury did not have to agree,rather than elements on which a jury did have to agree would be undermined.to be clear,it is law that a statute is divisible only if it contains multiple alternative elements,as opposed to multiple alternative means.id.at.thus,when a court encounters a statute that is written in the disjunctive that is,with an or,that fact alone can not end the divisibility inquiry.only when state law requires that in order to convict the defendant the jury must unanimously agree that he committed a particular substantive offense contained within the disjunctively worded statute are we able to conclude that the statute contains alternative elements and not alternative means.
that the distinction between elements and means is reflected in the requisite jury findings is in supreme court precedent.for example,in richardson united states,the court encountered a federal statute forbidding any person from engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise,which the statute defined as involving a continuing series of violations.the question at issue was whether the jury was required to unanimously agree on which particular violations constituted the series of violations.id.at.the court explained that while a a jury in a federal criminal case can not convict unless it unanimously finds that the government has proved each element,a federal jury need not always decide unanimously which of several possible means the defendant used to commit an element of the crime.id.at emphasis added.on the assumption that three violations constitutes a series,the court held that i f the statute creates a single element,a series,in respect to which individual violations are but the means,then the jury need only agree that the defendant committed at least three of all the underlying crimes the government has tried to prove but need not agree about which three,while if the statute makes each violation a separate element,then the jury must agree unanimously about which three crimes the defendant committed.id.at.it necessarily follows from richardson that the supreme court regards elements as those circumstances on which the jury must unanimously agree,while it regards means as those circumstances on which the jury may disagree yet still convict.indeed,the descamps court cited richardson for the proposition that the only facts the court can be sure the jury found unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt are those constituting elements of the offense.at citing richardson,at emphasis added 
both binding and persuasive precedent provide further support for our conclusion that the distinction between elements and means parallels the need for juror agreement.in united states cabrera gutierrez,we considered whether an oregon sexual abuse statute was divisible because it covered sexual intercourse both where the victim,although capable of consenting,does not consent,and where the victim is incapable of consenting.wl,at.we explained that,under descamps,what must be divisible are the elements of the crime,not the mode or means of proving an element,and the statute at issue was therefore indivisible because the state in a case concerning this oregon statute need s to prove only that a defendant has engaged in intercourse with another and that the other does not consent thereto.id.at.in other words,the state does not need to prove and the judge or jury does not need to find one particular theory of,and as a result,a sentencing court can not tell whether the jury or judge convicted a defendant of intercourse with a victim who did not actually consent or a victim who lacked capacity to consent.id.at the fourth circuit has reasoned similarly.see united states royal,cir,cert.denied.holding that offensive physical contact and physical harm are merely alternative means of satisfying a single element of the maryland assault statute,rather than alternative elements,because maryland juries are not instructed that they must agree unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt on whether the defendant caused offensive physical contact or ph
