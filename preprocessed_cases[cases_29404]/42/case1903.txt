monique mwembie petitions for review of the denial by the board of immigration appeals bia of her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.we deny the petition.
mwembie,a citizen of the democratic republic of congo drc,fled that country in after the assassination of the former president,laurent kabila mwembie worked as a secretary in the communications department at the marble palace,where kabila held various meetings mwembie job involved editing creating press releases regarding the meetings,based on reports she received from others.
her job went well until january,when she heard gunshots,during which everyone panicked.soldiers and other people were running everywhere.at first,mwembie and others in her office hid under their desks she was shaking.the gunshots lasted about thirty minutes.
after that,mwembie went outside her room and saw everyone running around.other colleagues in the hallway also asked what was going on.she did not really know what to do,so she picked up the phone,but there was no dial tone.
around the military ordered that each person return to his work station,explained that the marble palace was under siege,and said no one was to leave the palace.mwembie did not know whether it was the police or the military that told them not to leave the palace and that they had been taken hostage.because of the large number of soldiers present,she thought they consisted of not only the military guard of the president working at the palace,but also some other soldiers from the outside.
mwembie remained at her desk till,when the military put everyone into a jeep,where they were ordered to lie down and close their eyes.someone asked where they were being taken and why,and in response the soldiers beat the person with a baton,causing his nose and mouth to bleed the soldiers then explained that everyone had to be quiet and did not have the right to ask questions.
mwembie and the others were taken to a big room,where they were kept for two days.she explained that everyone working at the palace approximately or more people were taken to that room.on the third day,the women were separated from the men,and all the women that worked in mwembie department were taken to one prison.
there,mwembie and five other women from her department were taken to a cell,which she described as the size of the courtroom.they were shown a rug on which they were to sleep and five or so soldiers that were supposed to watch over them.mwembie did not know how many women were in the prison and could not estimate how many had been arrested on january.they were fed a single piece of bread and tea mixed with milk once a day and were allowed to use an outdoor restroom once a day.they received no medical treatment.
each woman was taken daily to be interrogated.during her questioning,mwembie was told she had been arrested because she was working at the palace on the day kabila was killed.there were three judges who interrogated them.the interrogators told her they had talked to her friends,who had said she had given information to outsiders about when kabila was in the palace and that she had enabled the outsiders to enter the palace.mwembie told them she had no involvement in kabila death or knowledge of who had killed him.the women were instructed not to talk to each other about the interrogations.
the guards in charge of mwembie cell beat and raped each of the women in the cell on a daily basis,each taking a turn while the others held the woman down,or watched.mwembie was one month pregnant at the time of her detention.on one occasion when she was raped,she suffered a miscarriage,causing her to lose blood and then consciousness.she was traumatized over this experience.the guards,however,took no mercy on her and continued to rape her even after the loss of her child.
one day,during an interrogation,judge gigal asked mwembie about her parents and told her he knew her parents,sister,and aunt and that because he knew her family,he would help her.he asked for the help of chief judge mukumbi who was his uncle,to organize mwembie escape from prison.
two days after the judges promised to help her,soldiers came for her in the middle of the night and took her out of her cell it was well known that when soldiers take someone in the middle of the night,that person will be killed.they did not kill her,however,but put her into mukumbi car trunk,whereupon he drove away with her in the trunk.
after thirty minutes,he stopped and made her change her clothes,then she rode inside the car to the border at kinsuka.there,mukumbi told her that it would be made to appear on paper that she had been killed in prison,so she was never to return to the drc,or to communicate with anyone.gigal,who knew her family,indicated he would explain to her parents that she had actually escaped the country.
mwembie then crossed the river and met a person who was waiting there with a car.she hid inside that person home in brazzaville for two weeks until he obtained a passport for her to leave the country.mwembie and this person flew from brazzaville to ethiopia,then to italy,and finally,to new york.
during the immigration inspection at the airport in new york on march,mwembie companion presented the fraudulent belgian passport he had obtained for her,and spoke on her behalf,because she did not understand english.after their admission into the united states,they took a bus to raleigh,north carolina,where her companion left her to return to the congo.
mwembie then contacted the only person she knew in the united states,laurent matalatala who resided in san antonio,texas.though mwembie had never met matalatala,she knew of him through a friend,and they had exchanged letters and had spoken on the telephone.after contacting matalatala,mwembie took a bus to san antonio,where he picked her up.after hearing her story,matalatala advised her to apply for asylum and assisted her in filing her application on september.
the ij denied mwembie claims,and the bia affirmed without opinion.therefore,the proper focus of our review is the underlying decision of the ij.ashcroft,cir.the ij devoted most of her opinion to credibility determinations and found that mwembie is ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal and protection under cat.
we review this factual basis for substantial evidence.zhang gonzales,cir.under that standard,we will not disturb the ij findings of fact unless we find not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion,but that the evidence compels it.chun ins,cir.the alien bears the burden of proving that the evidence was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could conclude against it.id.
for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat claims,t he testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.we can not the bia or ij by substituting our credibility judgment for that of the factfinder.chun,at.
even given this highly deferential standard,however,the ij conclusion that mwembie did not meet her burden of persuasion on the likelihood of future persecution if returned to drc is not supported by substantial evidence.although we ultimately sustain the ij decision by denying the petition for review,it is not because mwembie has not met her burden of proof that she will be persecuted,but because she has not satisfied her burden to show that she will be persecuted on account of one the five enumerated reasons we address,nonetheless,the credibility issue because of the poor quality of the ij work and because the parties devote the bulk of their briefs to this question.
although w e will not review decisions turning purely on the ij assessment of the alien petitioner credibility,chun,at quoting mantell ins,cir,we have not read this to mean that credibility determinations that are unsupported by the record and are based on pure speculation or conjecture will be upheld.rather,our caselaw interprets this as meaning that where the judge credibility determinations are supported by the record,we will affirm them even if we may have reached a different conclusion,because we will reverse only if the record compels a different conclusion in fact,this is the standard the department of justice cites in its brief,though it mistakenly labels third circuit precedent as coming from this court 
further,although adverse credibility determinations can not be based on speculation or conjecture,such findings will be afforded substantial deference where it sic is grounded in evidence in the record and where the ij provides specific cogent reasons for her determination.abdulrahman ashcroft,sic cir.
many of the key findings by the ij are not supported by the record and are based on pure speculation or conjecture.for example,the ij found it implausible that mwembie fled her country without saying goodbye to her family.to reach this finding,however,the ij should have had more information.
there is nothing in the record to suggest that aliens fleeing from prison to a different country usually go home to say.in fact,the bia has rejected such a speculation and has found that it is not unreasonable for an asylum applicant to flee his country,leaving family behind,where returning to his or her family members would put his life in danger.in re b,i n bia.
mwembie did not have control of where mukumbi was driving while she was in the trunk of his car.further,mwembie escaped to a different country during the night of her escape from prison she fled from the drc to congo brazzaville.during her short stay in brazzaville,she was not allowed to leave the house.so,there is nothing in the record that would contradict her testimony that she did not and could not say to her family in fact,the record compels the opposite conclusion.
the ij also found that mwembie testimony was vague because she gave few details of her life in prison other than consistently stating that she was raped daily and interrogated.to the contrary,mwembie described prison life in detail.she explained what type of food she received,how often,how many times she was allowed to use a restroom,how many cellmates she had,and how big her cell was.she gave the number and names of the judges and the number of soldiers guarding her cell and described in detail the episode leading to her miscarriage.
in discrediting mwembie testimony as vague,the ij pointed out that mwembie did not state the date on which she was released from prison.the record compels a different conclusion,however.mwembie testified that she fled to congo brazzaville on the night of her escape.she also wrote in her asylum application that she fled her native county on march.accordingly,in light of the fact that she escaped from prison on the day she fled to brazzaville,she must have escaped on march as well.this date is consistent with her account that she spent six weeks in prison having been imprisoned on january,that she spent about two weeks in brazzaville,and that she arrived in the united states on march.
the ij also found that mwembie testimony that she was raped daily is implausible because the brutality that she has described is simply not comprehensible.this is error.
that brutality is extraordinary does not render it implausible.under the ij logic,jews fleeing nazi germany and describing the concentration camp atrocities would have been denied asylum because the brutality they described would be incomprehensible.
absent more information about congolese guards watching prisoners for the military tribunals,the record does not support a conclusion that the brutality was incomprehensible.in fact,the record shows that several defendants in the kabila trial were tortured in prison.the record also does not contain information that would challenge the claim that the soldiers were brutal.to the contrary,the record shows that the congolese guards apparently told mwembie that she deserved to be raped and die because she was a criminal.this justification for brutality is far from incomprehensible.
thus,given the justification the guards offered for their brutality,there is no reason to think they aspired to be comprehensible persecutors who rape less than daily.also,because the record indicates that mwembie was not allowed to have a lawyer or to see her family,there was no apparent external pressure that would keep the soldiers in check.
the ij also found it implausible that five guards were guarding six female prisoners.that finding would be defensible if indeed there were any evidence that the guards were guarding only the six female prisoners in mwembie cell.there is,however,no evidence that her cell was the only one in the prison or that the guards did not guard any other cells.although mwembie could not say how many women were in the prison,she never testified that there were no other women there.she merely had no information with respect to that.the ij finding is not supported by substantial evidence in the record,which compels a contrary conclusion.
the ij also found it implausible that two judges helped mwembie escape when it was in their power to release her.but,there is no indication in the record that the decision to release her was in their hands.there is no hint that any suspect was released before trial,and the verdict was rendered almost two years after january.indeed,the fact that as many as fifty people were found not guilty suggests that no one was released prior to trial.
therefore,if indeed one of the judges was a friend of mwembie parents,it is plausible that he would have helped her get out of prison before trial,given that prison meant daily rape and a slice of bread per day for several more months.further,we have no information on whether the interrogating judges would have been the same judges presiding at trial.if they were not the same,they presumably could not have helped release her 
the ij also found it implausible that the judges would make it appear on paper that mwembie had been killed,but on the other hand telling her family she had escaped.again,this is not a rational reason for which any reasonable factfinder could ever find a testimony implausible.there is absolutely no inconsistency between the two actions the judges,who are friends of mwembie family,wanted the drc government to think she was dead so it would not harass her family after her escape,and the judges also wanted her family to know she in fact was safe.there is nothing in the record to suggest otherwise.
the ij also found implausible mwembie account of being detained for more than two days,because the ij thought that the record shows that the only women who were detained were married to other suspects.this statement misreads the record.
the newspaper articles and reports state that at least three women were arrested and tried for and on behalf of their husbands,the suspects included civilians,among which five women,a number of the female defendants may be detained simply because they were related or married to suspects still at large,and kabila former guards and aides,as well as the wives and girlfriends of suspects are charged with a role in the assassination.therefore,the fact that at least three women were arrested on behalf of their husbands does not indicate that only those women,or only those types of women,were arrested more information is needed to draw that inference.
similarly,the record shows that a number of female defendants were arrested on behalf of their husbands,not that all women were.also,the record indicates that not only the wives of suspects,but also a number of kabila guards and aides were arrested as an employee at the marble palace,mwembie can be considered to have been a presidential aide.therefore,there is nothing in the record that supports the ij finding,and the record compels a different conclusion.
the ij took issue with mwembie testimony that she memorized and remembered matalatala phone number the ij thought that no one who suffered daily rape for six weeks could remember a phone number.to make that decision,however,the ij would need to know several facts not in the record how often did mwembie call matalatala before her imprisonment how good was mwembie memory generally and how is memory affected by six weeks of prison and rape though mwembie indicated she lost consciousness after one of the rapes,ther
