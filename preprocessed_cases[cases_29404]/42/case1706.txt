petitioner constantin rusu seeks our review of the may order of the board of immigration appeals the bia denying his application for asylum.order of the board of immigration appeals,file no.a bia the bia order.rusu contends that his video conferenced asylum hearing violated his due process and statutory rights,and that the bia erred in declining to grant him asylum.although we agree that his asylum hearing was conducted in a haphazard manner,we conclude that rusu suffered no prejudice as a result thereof.we therefore deny his petition for review and affirm the bia.
rusu fled his native romania in,allegedly out of fear of persecution by the communist government of nicolai ceausescu.rusu apparently had been an organizer for a transcendental meditation group which the ceausescu government deemed to be subversive.rusu contends that,as a result of his involvement in this group,he was interrogated and assaulted on multiple occasions by the romanian secret police the securitate in the years preceding his flight from that country.on one occasion,the securitate supposedly held rusu for three days,during which they tortured him by removing his teeth with pliers and a screwdriver.
upon escaping from romania,rusu travelled first to yugoslavia and applied for asylum there.before rusu status could be determined,however,war broke out in the balkans.he then fled to canada and applied for asylum,but his application was denied.in november,he left canada and illegally entered the united states.shortly after arriving in this country,rusu obtained a passport from the romanian embassy.in february,he flew to great britain,but he was refused entry and forcibly returned to the united states.
upon his return,rusu was placed in a detention facility in farmville,virginia,and he was charged by the immigration and naturalization service the ins with being removable under a a i of the immigration and naturalization act the ina on february,the ins instituted removal proceedings against him.rusu then applied for asylum and withholding of removal the application and,on september,an immigration judge the ij conducted an asylum hearing the hearing was conducted by video conference,during which rusu remained in an ins detention facility in farmville,while the ij,as well as counsel for rusu and the ins,were in a courthouse in arlington,virginia under this procedure,video cameras and television monitors were set up in both farmville and arlington to provide contemporaneous transmission of the hearing images and sounds between the two sites.
rusu asylum hearing consumed approximately three hours,and it was plagued by communication problems.although rusu best language is romanian,he declined to accept an interpreter and chose instead to testify in english.in addition,due to his damaged mouth and missing teeth,he was unable to speak clearly.the ij had difficulty comprehending rusu testimony,and on numerous occasions she stated that she could not understand rusu and requested that he repeat himself.the court reporter was also unable to fully understand him,and the transcript of rusu asylum hearing testimony is marked indiscernible a total of times.moreover,rusu had difficulty comprehending the questions of his counsel,schneiderman,and the ij,and they were often obliged to repeat themselves.rusu also became confused when the person addressing him was not the one on camera,schneiderman would ask a question but the camera would be focused on the ij,and on several occasions he directed his response to the wrong person.finally,there were technological problems with the video conference equipment.during the hearing,the ij asked a correctional officer in farmville to move rusu closer to the camera,once stating i think maybe that will help me understand him better.the ij was also compelled to suspend the hearing at one point in order to check the quality of the equipment and its ability to record rusu voice.
in sum,the record reveals that the ij and the lawyers,on the one hand,and rusu,on the other,had difficulty understanding one another.after some effort,however,the ij concluded that she could glean the asserted factual basis of rusu application.in her decision she stated 
we are conducting the hearing by televideo conference and had to have rusu repeat some of his answers in order to understand it.we have assured ourselves however that we did understand the testimony.the testimony appears to be clear on the tape.
oral decision of the immigration judge,file no.a at,the ij decision.in the ij decision,she observed that,in order to be eligible for asylum,a petitioner must have a fear of persecution,and that such a fear must be objectively reasonable.id.at.she noted that romania had undergone substantial reform of its political process,and,pursuant to legislation,most of the former securitate officers had been purged from the present security force she also observed that there was no evidence that individuals who either engaged in transcendental meditation,or were previously critical of the ceausescu government,were currently in danger of persecution.thus,the ij concluded that rusu fear of future persecution was not.id.at.in addition,while she found rusu claims of past persecution to be unpersuasive,she stated that,assuming their validity,he nonetheless failed to qualify for asylum as a matter of discretion id.at.the ij therefore ordered rusu to voluntarily depart the united states or,in the alternative,to be deported.id.at.
rusu appealed the ij decision to the bia,which dismissed his appeal on may.rusu has now petitioned for our review of the bia order,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to 
it is elementary that any judicial inquiry into the handling of immigration matters is substantially circumscribed.as the supreme court observed in landon plasencia,control over matters of immigration is a sovereign prerogative,largely within the control of the executive and the legislature,d.deportation and asylum hearings,however,are subject to the requirements of procedural due process.mathews diaz,d yamataya fisher the japanese immigrant case.bia,cir.we review de novo a claim that the procedures utilized in such hearings contravened due process or the ina.jacinto ins,cir.in order to prevail on a due process challenge to a deportation or asylum hearing,an alien must demonstrate that he was prejudiced by any such violation,at farrokhi ins,cir.similarly,an alien must establish prejudice in order to invalidate deportation proceedings on a claim that his statutory or regulatory rights were infringed.reno,d,citing united states,cir.and we may only find prejudice when the rights of an alien have been transgressed in such a way as is likely to impact the results of the proceedings.jacinto,at see also farrokhi,at.
rusu maintains that the video conferencing procedures utilized in his asylum hearing violated due process and the ina by rendering him unable to present his case for asylum in a meaningful manner before addressing the merits of this contention,we will briefly examine the legal principles governing the procedural rights of asylum petitioners.
in assessing whether a deportation or asylum hearing has comported with due process,we are guided by the principles of mathews eldridge,d,in which the court recognized that t he fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.as the court acknowledged,what constitutes being heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner will have different meanings in different circumstances,and due process only calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.id.at.because of the government compelling interest in controlling immigration,hearing procedures that comport with due process in the asylum context might well be unacceptable in other proceedings.mathews diaz,at.nevertheless,due process requires,at a minimum,that the ins adopt procedures to ensure that asylum petitioners are accorded an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner,that they receive a full and fair hearing on their claims.jacinto,at,at landon plasencia,at.observing that fai
