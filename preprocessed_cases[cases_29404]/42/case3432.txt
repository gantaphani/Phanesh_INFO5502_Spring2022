we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we deny the petition for review.
background 
oshodi asylum application 
oshodi,a citizen of nigeria,requested asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under cat based on his fear of persecution and torture due to his religion and political opinions.
in his declaration,oshodi stated that his mother was killed in by officers because of her political activities.when oshodi was sixteen he joined the national association of nigerian students nans,a group that opposed the security forces,and when he returned to nigeria in,he joined the unity party of nigeria upn,a group that opposed the government and security forces.
oshodi described three incidents of persecution.first,oshodi attended a rally against the government and was beaten by police,but escaped arrest.second,in february,oshodi and his friend drove through a police after the police saw political propaganda.according to oshodi,the police shot at the car and hit oshodi friend,who died eight days later.the police detained and tortured oshodi for two days until his uncle paid for his release.thereafter,an open warrant was issued against oshodi for failing to report for weekly monitoring.third,on february,the police arrested oshodi after he dropped a party member off at the airport.the police drove oshodi to an unknown location where he was shot in the foot,burnt with cigarettes,elctric sic shocked,beaten with swagger canes,pistol and riffle sic whipped,stripped nude and sodomized with swagger canes and dirty bottles.after this incident,oshodi returned to the united states.
professor mitchell and oshodi testimony 
professor mitchell,a nigerian expert,testified that a member of nans who has been in political exile and who is regarded as being an opponent of the nigerian government would likely be detained and tortured should he be returned.professor mitchell noted that a member of the upn would have nearly the same difficulty he would be sic as a member of nans,but that it would be horrific for oshodi to return to nigeria based on the treatment of people who have been in detention,especially who return under those circumstances under a warrant when questioned about oshodi father,professor mitchell stated that he could be mistaken,but he believed oshodi father was living in southern california.
when oshodi began to testify regarding his political involvement and the political rally he attended,the ij told oshodi he had read oshodi application and did not need oshodi testimony line by line.oshodi then testified about his political activities,and that he believed he would be tortured,detained,and most likely killed if he returned to nigeria.
during,oshodi stated that his father was deceased,and that he signed the sworn statement stating that his father was involved in politics instead of his granddad because he was rushed.when asked about why his name was not on the deed to the nigerian property he said was confiscated,oshodi answered that the deed never transferred to his name,but he paid taxes on the property and received income from it.
on examination,oshodi explained that he used aliases to hide his identity from nigerians,and that his last name is well known in nigeria.when questioned by the ij,oshodi stated that his father had been back and forth from nigeria,that he only listed three siblings on his application because some of his siblings are half brothers,and that larry,his,was in court during the removal proceedings,but did not submit a statement to the court.
c.the ij and bia decisions 
the ij determined that oshodi was not credible.the ij concluded that oshodi acknowledged use of made up false names all cast doubt upon his forthrightness.the ij also relied on the fact that oshodi complained that a substantial amount of his property was confiscated in nigeria,but later admitted that the properties were not in his name and that the deed was never transferred.the ij further noted that oshodi failed to satisfactorily explain whether his father was living or deceased.oshodi also stated in a sworn statement to immigration authorities that he feared harm in nigeria because of his dad,but then later testified that he said granddad and that the discrepancy was due to being rushed into signing the document without reading it.
the ij observed that there were also notable omissions and discrepancies between oshodi application and his testimony regarding his siblings.namely,oshodi only listed three out of ten siblings on his application.he attempted to explain the omission by asserting that he thought he was supposed to put full siblings on the application despite the fact that two of the three siblings were.
the ij further noted that oshodi claimed that his father had regularly come and gone from nigeria,which undermined oshodi claim that he would be identified and detained in nigeria because of his name.the ij also observed that oshodi brother was sitting in court during the entire proceeding and failed to testify or submit an affidavit to corroborate oshodi claims.the ij concluded that oshodi should have provid ed evidence that corroborat ed his testimony and denied oshodi requests for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the cat 
the bia upheld the ij adverse credibility determination and dismissed oshodi appeal.oshodi then petitioned this court for review,and we remanded the case to the bia to analyze and consider a the impact of the real id act on the bia finding that petitioner claims for relief and protection were not sufficiently corroborated b the legislative history of the real id act credibility provisions,and its impact upon the immigration judge sic credibility determination and c any other issues the bia deems appropriate to address if it chooses to permit further briefing from counsel.
on remand,the bia concluded that the real id act codified the bia corroboration requirements and that oshodi failed to provide corroborating evidence.the bia further considered the fact that the real id act changed the heart of the claim analysis to a totality of the circumstances analysis and found no clear error in the immigration judge adverse credibility finding oshodi filed a timely petition for review.
ii.standard of review 
the decision that an alien has not established eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal is reviewed for substantial evidence.malkandi holder,cir,as amended citation and internal quotation marks omitted.under the substantial evidence standard,administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
under the substantial evidence standard,we may reverse a bia credibility determination only if the evidence that the petitioner presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could find that the petitioner was not credible.id.at citation,alteration,and internal quotation marks omitted.where the bia has reviewed the ij decision and incorporated portions of it as its own,we treat the incorporated parts of the ij decision as the bia.id.citation and alteration omitted.
iii.discussion 
a.the bia inquiry upon remand 
oshodi contends that we should remand because the bia failed to conduct an inquiry in accordance with our prior mandate.
on remand,a court is free as to anything not foreclosed by the mandate,and,under certain circumstances,an order issued after remand may deviate from the mandate if it is not counter to the spirit of the circuit court decision.united states perez,cir citation omitted.
addressing the first remand issue,the bia determined that the real id act codified the bia corroboration standards,which place the burden on the applicant to provide corroborative evidence when the trier of fact requires corroboration.the bia found that the ij was correct in concluding that oshodi failed to meet
