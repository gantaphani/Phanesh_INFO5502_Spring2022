plaintiffs appellants,certain individuals from china seeking permanent residency in the united states,appeal from the district court dismissal of their claims under the immigration and nationality act ina against federal defendants appellees in their complaint,plaintiffs allege that defendants misallocated immigrant visas to eligible applicants in the third preference category eb during the and fiscal years.plaintiffs request that visa numbers be made available to them and other members of their class so that they can obtain visas or adjustment of status before the end of the fiscal year.
we hold that the district court properly dismissed the complaint because there is no live case or controversy about the establishment of visa dates,and the allocation of visa numbers,in the and fiscal years.we also hold that the district court did not err in dismissing plaintiffs claims for prospective relief because they did not allege that defendants failed to take discrete actions they were legally required to take.accordingly,we affirm the decision of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
this case concerns applications for visas by professionals and skilled workers in the eb category.to become eligible for such visas,an alien employer must first file an application for labor certification with the department of labor dol,requesting certification that there are no qualified workers in the united states available to fill a relevant job opening.see a a i.once dol provides such a certification,the employer may file a petition requesting that uscis approve the alien for a visa in the eb category.see a.the date a request for certification is accepted for processing by dol is called the priority date.see d.once the alien priority date becomes current,the alien becomes eligible to be allotted an immigrant visa number,and he or she may file an application for adjustment of status with uscis,if the alien is then physically located within the united states.see a.
uscis has jurisdiction to adjudicate an application for adjustment of status.see a.pursuant to a ii,however,uscis may not approve an application for adjustment of status until the department of state dos has allocated an immigrant visa number.see a ii.in allocating visa numbers,dos must comply with the worldwide and limits on the number of preference immigrant visas established by congress.see a worldwide limit,a limit.to process these congressionally imposed limits in an orderly manner,the secretary of state is authorized to make reasonable estimates of the anticipated numbers of visas to be issued during any quarter of any fiscal year and to rely upon such estimates in authorizing the issuance of visas.g.
dos visa office subdivides the annual number of visas,taking into consideration limits established by congress,into monthly allotments.the visa office considers several variables in determining how many visa numbers to make available,such as past number use,expected future number use,and estimates of additional uscis demand.once the number of available visa numbers has been calculated,dos allocates numbers to applicants.
the total number of qualified applicants are compared each month with the visa numbers available for the next regular allotment.when the number of qualified applicants in a category exceeds the supply of numbers available for allotment in a particular month,the category is deemed oversubscribed,and dos creates a visa availability date for that category.the date is the priority date of the first qualified alien for whom a visa number was not available.when visas are thus oversubscribed,only persons with a priority date earlier than the date are entitled to be allotted a visa number.
plaintiffs brought suit in on behalf of a class of individuals from china,who are seeking to acquire permanent resident status in the eb visa category.they claim that during the and fiscal years,defendants did not allocate immigrant visas to eligible applicants in the correct order,thereby delaying their applications,and their eligibility for adjustment of status.according to plaintiffs,dos visa office also failed to maintain an adequate registration list or to properly monitor uscis use of immigrant visa numbers,in part or in whole because the visa office does not have accurate information from uscis concerning the number of applications pending and concerning uscis demand for immigrant visa numbers.as a result,the visa office allegedly established dates that allowed eb visas to be made available to individuals from countries other than china before the class members from china,even though the class members had earlier priority dates,and china eb limit had not yet been reached.accordingly,the rest of the world was able to use immigrant visas up to its limit in the eb category,but the china eb category was not able to use immigrant visas up to its limit even though there was sufficient demand.plaintiffs allege that they and their derivative beneficiaries would have been approved for permanent resident status in fiscal year or fiscal year but for governmental errors in allocating visa numbers.as a remedy,plaintiffs seek an order requiring defendants to make immigrant visa numbers available for class members so they can obtain immigrant visas or have their status adjusted before the end of the current fiscal year.they also sought an injunction requiring that defendants take steps to improve the visa number allocation system.for example,plaintiffs asked the district court to order uscis to provide complete and accurate information to the visa office,and to direct dos to make public all relevant information contained on its waiting lists.
the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss.because plaintiffs cited no statutory authority requiring uscis to participate in the creation of dates or the maintenance of waiting lists,the district court concluded that plaintiffs failed to state a claim against uscis.the district court also found that plaintiffs claims regarding the allocation of visa numbers from prior fiscal years were moot because no authority allows visa numbers from previous years to be recaptured,and allocated during the current year.the district court further found that plaintiffs claims for prospective relief were moot because they conceded that they did not challenge dos process for allocating visa numbers.plaintiffs timely appealed the district court decision.

discussion 
plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in three ways by dismissing their claims against uscis by holding that it lacked jurisdiction to recapture visa numbers from past years and by dismissing their claims for prospective relief.
claims against uscis 
in their complaint,plaintiffs alleged a number of causes of action against uscis.we agree with the district court that plaintiffs failed to state a plausible claim against uscis 
in their second cause of action,plaintiffs allege that uscis violated ina,e by approving applications for adjustment of status for individuals out of priority date order.plaintiffs opening brief states two different theories under which uscis is alleged to have violated this provision.plaintiffs first claim that uscis violated the first subsection of that provision,ina e,e,which requires that immigrant visas be made available in priority date order.plaintiffs can not prevail under this theory,however,because it is dos,not uscis,that issues immigrant visa numbers.see de avilia civiletti,cir stating that dos is responsible for administering provisions relating to numerical limits on immigration,such as issuing immigrant visas.this statute is silent about the order in which uscis must approve applications for adjustment of status after dos has allocated immigrant visa numbers.accordingly,plaintiffs failed to state a plausible claim against uscis under the first subsection of that statute.
alternatively,plaintiffs contend in their opening brief that uscis violated the third subsection,ina e,e,which requires that adequate waiting lists be maintained.however,this theory appears to have been raised for the first time on appeal.nowhere in their complaint or in their response to the government motion to dismiss do plaintiffs assert that uscis had an affirmative duty to participate in the maintenance or creation of waiting lists.indeed,in their motion for preliminary injunction below,plaintiffs effectively conceded that their claim under this subsection applies only to dos.we do not address in the first instance claims not raised below accordingly,we hold that the district court did not err in concluding that plaintiffs failed to state a claim against uscis under e.
although the district court did not explicitly consider the additional causes of action alleged against uscis,we affirm the dismissal of these claims as well,based on the insufficiency of plaintiffs allegations in the complaint.see hall,at steckman hart brewing,cir if support exists in the record,a dismissal for failure to state a claim may be affirmed on any proper ground,even if the district court did not reach the issue or relied on different grounds or reasoning.
in their third cause of action,plaintiffs contend that uscis violated b and a ii by approving applications for adjustment of status out of priority date order.under these provisions,uscis may not approve an application for adjustment of status until dos allocates an immigrant visa number.see b a,a ii.these provisions are silent about the order in which uscis must approve applications for adjustment of status after dos has allocated immigrant visa numbers.accordingly,plaintiffs failed to state a plausible claim against uscis for violating b and a ii.
lastly,plaintiffs allege that uscis violated the law,and acted arbitrarily and capriciously,b y failing to establish a complete and accurate system for monitoring the priority dates of individuals who are applying for immigrant visas fourth cause of action,and b y failing to provide and maintain a system adequate to account for the number of immigrant petitions form i and adjustment of status applications form i that are pending fifth cause of action.these claims appear to be based on a,which requires a reviewing court to set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.
plaintiffs provide no authority,and we can locate none,suggesting that uscis has a specific duty to maintain such an elaborate system for monitoring priority dates or the number of pending applications.instead,uscis responsibilities are carefully circumscribed and tied to the actions of other agencies.see,a,a ii giving uscis jurisdiction to adjudicate applications for adjustment of status,but forbidding uscis to approve adjustment of status until an immigrant visa number has been allocated by dos.
plaintiffs essentially ask us to hold that uscis could be acting arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to create a system,or complying with vague standards,not required by law.we decline their invitation,and we hold that plaintiffs failed to state a claim against uscis see cal.energy comm dep t of energy,cir discussing when we will overturn an agency decision as arbitrary and capricious lands council mcnair,cir en banc noting that we can not require an agency to abide by our notions of which procedures are best or most likely to achieve the public good,and that we can not impose procedural requirements not expressly required by statute.
ii.recapture of visa numbers from past years 
the district court also held that it lacked jurisdiction over plaintiffs claims seeking to recapture visa numbers from previous fiscal years,because these claims were moot.the district court decision was correct.
a claim is moot if it has lost its character as a present,live controversy.kearns ford motor,cir citation omitted.if there is no longer a possibility that an appellant can obtain relief for his claim,that claim is moot and must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.ruvalcaba city of,cir 
congress has established annual numerical limits on the number of immigrant visas.see setting a worldwide limit,setting a limit.there are a very limited number of situations when a visa number is returned to dos for reallocation,such as when an immigrant is deported,when an immigrant does not apply for admission to the united states before the expiration of the visa,and when an immigrant visa is revoked.see c.however,even in those situations,dos must reallocate the visa numbers within the fiscal year in which the visa was issued.id.there is no statute or regulation authorizing dos to take a visa number from one year and allocate it to another year.just as in the diversity visa lottery program,the visa numbers available in a particular fiscal year expire at the end of the year,rendering moot any claim for a visa number from a prior year it does not matter whether administrative delays and errors are to blame for an alien not receiving a visa number on time once a visa number is gone,it can not be recaptured absent an act of congress any other interpretation of the statute would allow statutory limits on levels of immigration in a particular fiscal year to be exceeded as the result of treating all unused visa numbers from the past as cumulatively available to be allocated at any time.
another problem with plaintiffs alleged causes of action is that some of the visa numbers they seek to recapture have already been allocated to other individuals.since courts are not time machines,we are unable to order dos to go back in time and not do something it already did,let alone determine which individuals awarded visa numbers in the past should have their numbers taken away because they should have been awarded to plaintiffs.
plaintiffs primarily rely on silva bell,cir in support of their view that the district court has authority to recapture previously unused visa numbers.silva presented the issue of how to allocate erroneously charged visa numbers among western hemisphere applicants on a waiting list.see silva,at.the question was not whether recapture was pos
