title a authorizes the attorney general to cancel the removal of an alien from the united states who,among other things,has held the status of a lawful permanent resident lpr for at least five years,a,and has lived in the united states for at least seven continuous years after a lawful admission,a.these cases concern whether the board of immigration appeals bia or board should impute a parent years of continuous residence or lpr status to his or her child.that issue arises because a child may enter the country lawfully,or may gain lpr status,after one of his parents does meaning that a parent may satisfy a or a,while his child,considered independently,does not.in in re escobar,the bia concluded that an alien must meet a requirements on his own.but the ninth circuit found the board position unreasonable,holding that a and a require imputation.see holder,gonzales.
respondent martinez gutierrez illegally entered the country with his family in,when he was years old.martinez gutierrez father was lawfully admitted to the country two years later as an lpr.but martinez gutierrez was neither lawfully admitted nor given lpr status until.two years after that,he was apprehended for smuggling undocumented aliens across the border.admitting the offense,he sought cancellation of removal.the immigration judge concluded that martinez gutierrez qualified for relief because of his father immigration history,even though martinez gutierrez could not satisfy a or a on his own.relying on escobar,the bia reversed.the ninth circuit then granted martinez gutierrez petition for review and remanded the case to the board for reconsideration in light of its contrary decisions.
respondent sawyers was lawfully admitted as an lpr in october,when he was years old.at that time,his mother had already resided in the country for six consecutive years following a lawful entry.after sawyers was convicted of a drug offense in august,the government began removal proceedings.the immigration judge found sawyers ineligible for cancellation of removal because he could not satisfy a.the bia affirmed,and sawyers petitioned the ninth circuit for review.there,he argued that the board should have counted his mother years of residency while he was a minor toward a requirement.the court of appeals granted the petition and remanded the case to the bia.
held the bia rejection of imputation is based on a permissible construction of a.
a the board has required each alien seeking cancellation of removal to satisfy a requirements on his own,without relying on a parent years of continuous residence or immigration status.that position prevails if it is a reasonable construction of the statute,whether or not it is the only possible interpretation or even the one a court might think best.see,chevron natural resources defense council,and.the bia approach satisfies this standard.
the board position is consistent with the statute text.section a does not mention much less require imputation.instead,it simply calls for the alien to meet the prerequisites for cancellation of removal.see a a and a.respondents contend that this language does not foreclose imputation,but even if so,that is not enough to require the board to adopt that policy.
b neither does the statute history and context mandate imputation.section a replaced former c of the immigration and nationality act ina,which allowed the attorney general to prevent the removal of an alien with lpr status who had maintained a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years in this country.like a,c was silent on imputation.but every court of appeals that confronted the question concluded that,in determining eligibility for c relief,the board should impute a parent years of domicile to his or her child.based on this history,sawyers contends that congress would have understood a language to provide for imputation.but in enacting a,congress eliminated the very term domicile on which the appeals courts had founded their imputation decisions.and the doctrine of congressional ratification applies only when congress reenacts a statute without relevant change.see jama immigration and customs enforcement.
nor do the ina purposes demand imputation.as respondents correctly observe,many provisions of immigration law advance the goals of promoting family unity and providing relief to aliens with strong ties to this country.but these are not the ina only goals,and congress did not pursue them at all costs.for example,aliens convicted of aggravated felonies are ineligible for cancellation of removal,regardless of the strength of their family ties,see a.in addition,as these cases show,not every alien with lpr status can immediately get the same for a spouse or minor child.a silent statute can not be read as requiring imputation just because that rule would be.
c respondents advance two additional arguments for why the board position is not entitled to chevron deference.first,they claim that the board approach to a is arbitrary because it is inconsistent with the board acceptance of imputation under other,similar provisions that are silent on the matter.see k and b.but the board decision in escobar provided a reasoned explanation for these divergent results the board imputes matters involving an alien state of mind,while declining to impute objective conditions or characteristics.see,at,and.section a hinges on the objective facts of immigration status and place of residence.see,at.so the board approach to a largely follows from one straightforward distinction.
second,respondents claim that the bia adopted its rule only because it thought congress had left it no other choice.but escobar belies this contention.the board did explain how a text supports its policy.but the board also brought its experience and expertise to bear on the matter it noted that there was no precedent in its decisions for imputing status or residence,and it argued that allowing imputation under a would create anomalies in the statutory scheme.escobar thus expressed the bia view that statutory text,administrative practice,and regulatory policy all pointed toward disallowing imputation.in making that case,the opinion reads like a multitude of agency interpretations to which this and other courts have routinely deferred.

on writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
an immigration statute,a,authorizes the attorney general to cancel the removal of an alien from the united states so long as the alien satisfies certain criteria.one of those criteria relates to the length of time an alien has lawfully resided in the united states,and another to the length of time he has held permanent resident status here.we consider whether the board of immigration appeals bia or board could reasonably conclude that an alien living in this country as a child must meet those requirements on his own,without counting a parent years of residence or immigration status.we hold that the bia approach is based on a permissible construction of the statute.
the immigration laws have long given the attorney general discretion to permit certain aliens to remain in the united states.see judulang holder,slip,at.the attorney general formerly exercised this authority by virtue of c of the immigration and nationality act ina,stat,c ed,a provision with some lingering relevance here,see infra,at.but in,congress replaced c with a ed.that new section,applicable to the cases before us,provides as follows 
a cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents 
the attorney general may cancel removal in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the united states if the alien 
has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than years,
has resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status,and 
has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.ibid.
section a thus specifies the criteria that make an alien eligible to obtain relief from the attorney general.the first paragraph requires that the alien have held the status of a lawful permanent resident lpr for at least five years.and the second adds that the alien must have lived in the united states for at least seven continuous years after a lawful admission,whether as an lpr or in some other immigration status the third paragraph is not at issue in these cases.
the question we consider here is whether,in applying this statutory provision,the bia should impute a parent years of continuous residence or lpr status to his or her child.that question arises because a child may enter the country lawfully,or may gain lpr status,after one of his parents does.a parent may therefore satisfy the requirements of a and,while his or her child,considered independently,does not.in these circumstances,is the child eligible for cancellation of removal 
the ninth circuit,the first court of appeals to confront this issue,held that such an alien could obtain relief.see gonzales.enrique and his parents came to the united states illegally in,when he was one year old.mother was lawfully admitted to the country in,as an lpr.but was lawfully admitted only in,when he too received lpr status.that meant that when committed a removable offense in,he could not independently satisfy a requirement of seven consecutive years of residence after a lawful entry the parties agreed that he just met a status requirement.the board deemed ineligible for relief on that account,but the ninth circuit found that position unreasonable.according to the court of appeals,the board should have imputed to his mother years of continuous residence during the time he lived with her as an unemancipated minor.at.that approach,the ninth circuit reasoned,followed from both the ina priorit ization of familial relations and the board consistent willingness to make imputations from a parent to a child in many areas of immigration law,at.
the board responded by reiterating its opposition to imputation under both relevant paragraphs of a.in in re escobar,the board considered whether a child could rely on a parent period of lpr status to satisfy a clock.the board expressly disagree d with the reasoning of,rejecting the ninth circuit understanding of both the statute and the board prior policies,at,and.accordingly,the board announced that it would decline to extend to any case involving a,and that it would ignore the decision even as to a outside the ninth circuit,at.a year later,in matter of,the bia took the final step it rejected imputation under a in a case arising in the ninth circuit,maintaining that the court should abandon and defer to the board intervening reasoned decision in escobar.see,at citing national cable telecommunications brand x internet services.
the bia position on imputation touched off a split in the courts of appeals.the third and fifth circuits both deferred to the bia approach as a reasonable construction of a.see augustin attorney,deus holder.but in holder,the ninth circuit doubled down on its contrary view,declaring the bia position unreasonable and requiring imputation under both a and a.see,at t he rationale and holding of apply equally to the permanent residence and the continuance residence requirements of a.
two cases are before us.in,at the age of five,respondent carlos martinez gutierrez illegally entered the united states with his family.martinez gutierrez father was lawfully admitted to the country two years later as an lpr.but martinez gutierrez himself was neither lawfully admitted nor given lpr status until.two years after that,martinez gutierrez was apprehended for smuggling undocumented aliens across the border.he admitted the offense,and sought cancellation of removal.the immigration judge concluded that martinez gutierrez qualified for relief because of his father immigration history,even though martinez gutierrez could not satisfy either a or a on his own.see app.to pet.for cert.in,citing.the bia reversed,and after entry of a removal order on remand,reaffirmed its disposition in an order relying on escobar,see app.to pet.for cert.in,at.the ninth circuit then granted martinez gutierrez petition for review and remanded the case to the board for reconsideration in light of the court contrary decisions.see fed.appx.
respondent damien sawyers was lawfully admitted as an lpr in october,when he was years old.at that time,his mother had already resided in the country for six consecutive years following a lawful entry.after sawyers conviction of a drug offense in august,the government initiated removal proceedings.the immigration judge found sawyers ineligible for cancellation of removal because he was a few months shy of the seven years of continuous residence required under a.see app.to pet.for cert.in.no one doubted that sawyers had by that time held lpr status for five years,as required under a.the board affirmed,relying on its reasoning in escobar.see in re sawyers,no,wl.sawyers petitioned the ninth circuit for review,arguing that the board should have counted his mother years of residency while he was a minor toward a requirement.as in gutierrez,the court of appeals granted the petition and remanded the case to the bia.see fed.appx.
we granted the government petitions for certiorari,consolidated the cases,and now reverse the ninth circuit judgments.
the board has required each alien seeking cancellation of removal to satisfy a requirements on his own,without counting a parent years of continuous residence or lpr status.that position prevails if it is a reasonable construction of the statute,whether or not it is the only possible interpretation or even the one a court might think best.see chevron natural resources defense council,and see also ins,according chevron deference to the board interpretations of the ina.we think the bia view on imputation meets that standard,and so need not decide if the statute permits any other construction.
the board approach is consistent with the statute text,as even respondents tacitly concede.section a does not mention imputation,much less require it.the provision calls for the alien not,say,the alien or one of his parents to meet the three prerequisites for cancellation of removal.similarly,several of a other terms have statutory definitions referring to only a single individual.see,a a the terms admission and admitted mean,with respect to an alien,the lawful entry of the alien into the united states emphasis added a the term residence means the place of general abode the place of general abode of a person means his principal,actual dwelling emphasis added.respondents contend that none of this language forecloses imputation they argue that if the board allowed imputation,t he alien seeking cancellation would still have to satisfy the provision durational requirements just pursuant to a different computational rule.brief for respondent martinez gutierrez in,hereinafter martinez gutierrez brief see brief for respondent sawyers in,hereinafter sawyers brief.and they claim that the board history of permitting imputation under similarly silent statutes supports this construction.martinez gutierrez brief see sawyers brief infra,at.but even if so even if the board could adopt an imputation rule consistent with the statute text that would not avail respondents.taken alone,the language of a at least permits the board to go the other way to say that the alien must meet the statutory conditions independently,without relying on a parent history.
for this reason,respondents focus on a history and context particularly,the provision relationship to the ina former c and its associated imputation rule.section c a predecessor generally allowed the attorney general to prevent the removal of an alien with lpr status who had maintained a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years in t
