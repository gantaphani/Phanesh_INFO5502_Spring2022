the panel granted leonel sandoval petition for review of the board of immigration appeals decision finding him ineligible for cancellation of removal based on his conviction for delivery of a controlled substance under oregon revised statutes a,and remanded.
the panel held that the oregon law is not a categorical aggravated felony,because its definition of delivery includes mere solicitation,and the federal controlled substances act does not punish soliciting delivery of controlled substances.the panel further held that because no commercial element is included in the oregon statute,it is not a categorical match to an illicit trafficking offense.
the panel also held that the modified categorical approach does not apply because the oregon law is indivisible with respect to whether an attempt is accomplished by solicitation.
sandoval was convicted of delivery of a controlled substance under oregon revised statutes a oregon law permits conviction for delivery under this statute based on mere solicitation.because the controlled substances act does not punish soliciting delivery of controlled substances,a can not be a categorical match to an aggravated felony under a a iii.further,because a is indivisible,the modified categorical approach does not apply.therefore,we grant sandoval petition and remand for further proceedings.
leonel sandoval moved to the united states from mexico when he was nine years old.he adjusted to lawful permanent resident status in.his wife of over years and two children are united states citizens.
in,sandoval was convicted of delivery of a controlled substance under oregon law.the indictment identified the controlled substance as heroin.he performed community service at a forest project and was placed on probation for two years.since then,he has not been convicted of any other criminal activity.twelve years later,the government instituted removal proceedings against him.it alleged two grounds for removal based on sandoval conviction that the conviction was an aggravated felony and that the conviction was related to a controlled substance.see a a iii,b i.under the second charge,sandoval could seek cancellation of removal based on his residence and family ties in the united states.but the first charge made him ineligible for such relief.see id.a.accordingly,sandoval argued the government had failed to offer clear and convincing evidence he was convicted of an aggravated felony because oregon statute is broader than a federal controlled substance offense given that it punishes solicitation in addition to actual and attempted delivery.the ij and bia rejected this argument,concluded he was ineligible for cancellation of removal and ordered him removed.
sandoval timely petitioned for review.we have jurisdiction and review sandoval petition de novo.see a d daas holder,cir.see also ins,cir.we do not defer to an agency interpretations of state law or provisions of the federal criminal code.see hoang holder,cir.
to determine whether a state criminal conviction is an aggravated felony,we must follow the categorical approach.see descamps united states.under this approach,we compare the elements of the statute forming the basis of the petitioner conviction with the elements of the generic crime,the offense as commonly understood.id.only if the elements in the petitioner statute of conviction are the same as,or narrower than,those of the generic offense is the petitioner conviction a categorical match.id.
under the categorical approach,we first determine the definition of the generic offense here,an aggravated felony.this requires us to navigate a maze of statutory.holder.we start with the definition of aggravated felony as used in a.
the term aggravated felony includes two federal controlled substance offenses relevant to this appeal illicit trafficking in a controlled substance,which includes any drug trafficking crime.a b.only felonies qualify as illicit trafficking offenses or drug trafficking crime s.see lopez gonzales.a felony means an offense punishable by more than one year under federal law.see a see also moncrieffe holder,lopez,at in sum,we hold that a state offense constitutes a felony punishable under the controlled substances act only if it proscribes conduct punishable as a felony under that federal law.
the elements of an illicit trafficking offense are not statutorily defined.see.but the supreme court has said an illicit trafficking offense includes some sort of commercial dealing.lopez,at see also,at.
the elements of a drug trafficking crime are more readily determined.drug trafficking crimes include felonies punishable under the controlled substances act.see a b c.because heroin is a federally controlled substance,see a b,c sched.i b,knowingly distributing or possessing with intent to distribute heroin violates the controlled substances act,see a.doing so is a felony,a crime punishable by more than one year of imprisonment under federal law.see b c.accordingly,because distributing heroin is a drug trafficking crime,we must consider the meaning of distribute.
the term distribute means deliver.see.and deliver means the actual,constructive,or attempted transfer of a controlled substance or a listed chemical,whether or not there exists an agency relationship.id.accordingly,one may commit a drug trafficking crime by actually delivering,attempting to deliver or possessing with intent to deliver heroin.
because sandoval argues the oregon statute under which he was convicted criminalizes solicitation,we must next determine whether generic attempted delivery also includes solicitation.the controlled substances act does not define the term attempt.see.nevertheless,as the government concedes,mere solicitation of controlled substances does not constitute attempted delivery under federal law.see united states,cir.en banc,superseded on other grounds as stated in holder,cir.see also ins,cir,at.the controlled substances act does not mention solicitation,unlike attempt and conspiracy,at quoting,at see also,at prescribing felony punishment for attempting or conspiring to deliver a controlled substance.this is unsurprising,as solicitation is the act or an instance of requesting or seeking to obtain something.solicitation,black law dictionary ed.while strongly corroborative of intent to commit a crime,such a request does not cross the line between preparation and attempt.see,united states yossunthorn,cir.ordering drugs from a known supplier was not an attempt when there was no agreement as to essential details regarding the transaction.
therefore,there are two federal offenses that may qualify as aggravated felonies for the purposes of this case.the first is an illicit trafficking offense that must contain a commercial dealing element and be punishable as a felony under federal law.the second is a drug trafficking crime for delivery of heroin satisfying the following elements knowing or intentional delivery,attempted delivery,conspiracy to deliver or possession with intent to deliver heroin.the latter offense may not be accomplished by merely soliciting delivery,offering delivery of heroin.the next question is whether sandoval oregon statute of conviction matches either federal definition.
sandoval was convicted of delivering a controlled substance.his indictment identifies the controlled substance as heroin and cites oregon revised statutes.the only portion of that statute proscribing delivery of heroin states 
i t is unlawful for any person to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance.any person who violates this subsection with respect to a a controlled substance in schedule i,is guilty of a felony.
or.stat.a.the term deliver means the actual,constructive or attempted transfer of a controlled substance from one person to another.id.a person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime when the person intentionally engages in conduct which constitutes a substantial step toward commission of the crime.id.
under oregon law,solicitation even without possession is a substantial step toward committing the crime of attempted delivery under ors.state sargent,or.app.see also state lawrence,or.app.and,taking a substantial ste
