opinion of the court 
lek berishaj,an ethnic albanian from montenegro,petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia,which affirmed without opinion the decision of an immigration judge ij denying him asylum and relief under the convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat.under our caselaw,see dia ashcroft,cir en banc,it is the ij decision that we review,no mean task here because the ij opinion is cursory,thinly reasoned,and discusses the case without any reference to the governing legal standards.nonetheless,we understand the ij to have concluded that berishaj testimony regarding past persecution was not credible that,even taking berishaj testimony as true,country conditions in the federal republic of yugoslavia which embraced montenegro at the time of the ij decision had changed such that berishaj could no longer have a fear of future persecution and that berishaj cat claim failed because there was no objective evidence that a return to montenegro would expose him to torture.
reviewing the ij decision under the substantial evidence standard,see id.at,we conclude that the ij rejection of berishaj asylum claim can not stand.first,the ij adverse credibility determination has no basis in the record.second,the ij misapplied the law in concluding that changed conditions in montenegro have obviated any persecution claim that berishaj might once have had.in such a posture,the burden of showing changed country conditions is on the government,see b ii,and we hold that the government must rebut the alien well founded fear of future persecution with specific evidence,which it did not produce.we will therefore grant the petition for review of the decision insofar as it rejected berishaj asylum claim,and his related claim for withholding of removal.we leave it to the agency to make a proper determination in the first instance of the merits of those claims.with respect to berishaj cat claim,the ij decision passes muster though barely,and we will deny the petition for review of the ij cat decision.
as we will explain in greater detail,we think this case to be a particularly apt example of a disturbing trend we often encounter in petitions for review of the bia.in many cases in which country conditions are at issue,the administrative records are grossly,requiring us to engage in the rather artificial exercise of ruling on situations that existed several years in the past,but do not exist today.here,we work from an administrative record in which the most recent country conditions report is over four years.while sec chenery,and the constraints of review of administrative decision making prevent us from supplementing a grossly administrative record,they do not command blindness to the emerging pattern of stale records.considering the rapid,frequent political changes in countries from which asylum and cat applicants usually come,and the potentially dire consequences of sending such an applicant back to his country of origin to face possible persecution or torture on the basis of such a stale report,we call on congress,the department of justice,the department of homeland security,and the bia to improve the structure and operation of the system,so that all may have the confidence that the ultimate disposition of a removal case bears a meaningful connection to the merits of the petitioner claim s in light of contemporary world affairs.
i.the administrative record and the ij decision 
as will become clear,the ij credibility determination rested on his rejection of a fairly narrow slice of berishaj testimony.but we will discuss berishaj testimony in full,because his claims depend on aspects of it beyond the specific testimony on which the ij based his adverse credibility determination.cat claims and questions of changed country conditions are,for the most part,evaluated with reference to documentary evidence of contemporary country conditions questions of corroboration are evaluated with reference to documentary evidence of past conditions.we will therefore address the documentary materials in the record with a focus on both past and contemporary events.to set the context for berishaj testimony,we set forth in the margin a capsule chronology of events in the balkans from to 
berishaj testimony and corroborating affidavit 
berishaj is an ethnic albanian who spent his youth in montenegro,at the time part of yugoslavia in the summer of,he went to kosovo,a neighboring province of yugoslavia,to attend a university that conducted classes in his native albanian tongue.at that time,no university in montenegro conducted classes in albanian.serb forces had taken control in kosovo in,and had officially closed the university,but it continued to function underground,with classes held in private homes in pristina,a major city in kosovo.berishaj uncle,palok,with whom berishaj lived at the time,was one of the leading organizers of the illegal university,and he recruited berishaj to find private homes in which to hold classes.because of his activities,palok was arrested in,and again in,when he was detained and beaten for several days.berishaj was arrested in pristina in the spring of for his assistance to the illegal university he was beaten with a rifle butt and detained overnight.not trusting the serbian doctors at the hospital,berishaj was treated by an albanian doctor practicing illegally,and returned to montenegro a few weeks later.
shortly after returning to montenegro,berishaj was inducted into the army he was sent to serve in serbia,where he spent eleven months.he was easily recognizable as an ethnic albanian,among a predominantly serbian army berishaj is a albanian name indeed,one sali berishaj was the former president of albania.in the army,berishaj served as a tank gunman following a training period in which he learned to operate the tank gun from instructions in serbian.in the tank crew of three or four,berishaj was the lowest in rank,taking orders from serbs in charge of the tank.berishaj did not,in these eleven months,go to war in bosnia.berishaj attributed this to the serbian officers not trusting albanians enough to send them to war.berishaj duties mostly consisted of cleaning the tank gun and guarding the tank.he was beaten at the direction of serbian officers for singing songs in albanian,and he stopped speaking albanian publicly,relying on the serbian he learned while in the army.after completing eleven months of military service,berishaj was discharged.he returned to montenegro,then to kosovo briefly to take university examinations,and then back to his parents home in montenegro.
in december,four policemen apparently military to his parents house at midnight and took him to fight in bosnia.he served again as a gunman,and was ordered to destroy buildings,houses,and shoot at the army and at muslim civilians in bosnia.berishaj explained that he had no choice but to shoot civilians i would either,you know,shoot or the serbians would kill me.ethnic albanians in the army were not trusted to shoot without being under serbian control.for example,berishaj explained,when we were in the tank,you know,using the gun,we would have somebody behind us a serbian with an automatic gun their function was that if somebody does not obey the order to shoot with a gun,they would kill him.berishaj spent two months in the army this time,and escaped during the night in february.he returned to his parents home in montenegro.
fearing that he would be arrested and returned to the army,berishaj crossed illegally from montenegro into albania,where he spent the next fourteen months in hiding at his cousin home.he sought,but was unable to obtain,legal status in albania as a result,the albanian authorities learned of him.his cousin,fearing the albanian police,convinced berishaj to return to montenegro in april.upon returning to his parents home in montenegro,berishaj learned that he was wanted by the police,and he went to reside with his sister,who lived in another village several miles from his parents home.the five months with his sister were spent mostly indoors,as were the following months,which he spent with an uncle in yet another village.
berishaj ultimately was located by the montenegrin police in september,and detained for two days.they asked him why he deserted from the army,and why he did not finish his studies at the official university,the university it was clear that the police knew he had participated in the illegal university.berishaj was released from custody apparently when an uncle fabricated a story about berishaj needing to visit an ill family member and posted bail for him.berishaj returned illegally to albania,where he resided until february,when he was smuggled to belgrade,and from there to france,then brazil,then the united states.
since being in the united states,berishaj has had limited contact with family members in montenegro,fearing that his family would be coerced by the police into revealing his whereabouts.in january,berishaj spoke to his father for the first time since leaving montenegro nearly four years before.his father explained,in berishaj words that once i left,the montenegrin police came three times and checked the house inside out looking for me after i had escaped.at this time,they asked him where is he where can we find him and his response was he did know after i left,my father was telling me that many incidents they came and checked the house inside out three times,and at one point were also guarding the house overnight to see if i would come home.the police stopped searching for berishaj when his father told them that berishaj had left permanently.berishaj also learned from his father that his brother was serving a sentence for helping the kosovar resistance during the war.berishaj sister,a naturalized american citizen,confirmed in an affidavit made in late that she had received similar accounts from their father,brother,and sister regarding police activity at their parents home.
documentary evidence in the administrative record 
contemporary country conditions 
much of the record addresses contemporary treatment of ethnic albanians in kosovo or elsewhere in serbia as this is not especially relevant to the situation in montenegro,we will concentrate only on documentary evidence addressing montenegro.we begin with the state department country reports on human rights practices,issued in february the country report this is the latest country report available in the administrative record.while on the one hand the bia may not hide behind the state department letterhead and place full and uncritical reliance on a country report,ezeagwuna ashcroft,cir quoting li wu lin ins,cir,neither is it permissible for the ij and bia not to address the relevant country report in some detail.the first line of the country report reads is dominated by slobodan milosevic,though it goes on to note that milosevic primary influence is over serbia proper and even there,not in kosovo and less over montenegro.nonetheless,given milosevic control over the serbian army and federal police,the country report establishes that a prime force in the persecution or worse of ethnic albanians was still in power at the time the administrative record was compiled 
on the other hand,the country report represents that montenegro was making progress toward democracy,holding free and fair elections,and that saw even further escape from the federal control of milosevic regime.the country report further states that while the montenegrin government generally respected its citizens human rights,there were reports of extrajudicial killings by federal troops,forcible conscription,and violence and discrimination against minorities.academic freedom is said to have been respected.in early,the government began a program of devolving authority on local government officials in ethnic albanian communities.the yugoslav parliament passed an amnesty for draft evaders and deserters in late,and the montenegrin parliament passed a similar law in late.according to documents in the record from amnesty international,however,there is evidence that at least the latter law was not fully observed,as federal yugoslav authorities and military police controlled the treatment of evaders and deserters.
the country report generally sounds of relative stability and democratic progress,but other parts of the record suggest that events were very fluid in.for example,a series of news articles from the new york times and reports from human rights organizations suggests that paramilitary groups associated with ethnic cleansing of ethnic albanians in kosovo had moved into montenegro,perhaps at the behest of the montenegrin police.
corroborating materials 
we turn now to materials in the record that could corroborate berishaj accounts from the early his time at the illegal university in kosovo and his military service from to.two pieces are worthy of note.first,berishaj story about the operation of the illegal university in kosovo,and police hostility to it,is perfectly corroborated by an amnesty international report from,which is in the administrative record.this report describes the creation in and by ethnic albanians of a parallel educational system using curricula,with lessons held in private homes.the report also describes several specific episodes of police violence against ethnic albanians on account of this parallel educational system.
second,and also in the administrative record before the ij,a article from the newspaper illyria profiles a young ethnic albanian,adem krasniqi,whose experience as a forced inductee into the serbian army closely parallels berishaj.krasniqi was one of many albanian tankers,tank operators or gunmen.in an attack on vukovar,croatia,he was forced to move forward in the first wave the story quotes krasniqi as saying,behind us were the serbian irregulars uniformed as soldiers.anyone trying to desert would be shot.we had two choices.keep firing or get shot from people behind you.krasniqi also describes indiscriminate shelling,and being forced to fire at innocent civilians this is again consistent with berishaj account.
c.the ij decision 
the ij decision which,save for irrelevant introductory and concluding remarks,is recounted in full in the paragraphs that follow begins with his adverse credibility determination 
the case at bar is afflicted by testimony that is incredible in nature.the applicant statements as to how he was recruited and placed in a position of combat by the serbs while at the same time adducing to an attitude of total disdain and bias toward the applicant is just incredulous to the court.this fact is dramatized and magnified by the respondent testimony that although he was despised by the serbs in the army he was placed in command of a tank.the testimony further developed how the applicant learned to operate the tank by reading the instructions in it and how,albeit they were written in a language he did not understand,he was able to familiarize with the operation of the tank in just three months.as fantastic and ludicrous as that statement may appear,the court was dazzled and astounded by the declaration that although he was in control of the tank he had a serbian officer behind his back pointing a gun at him at all times a better script could not have been thought about by kings of comedy like peter sellers or mel brooks.
this ridiculous testimony is not supported by one scintilla of evidence and in addition to be completely absurd it borders in an offensive and arrogant attitude toward the court.the applicant demeanor,throughout the sessions of testimony,was characterized by an arrogant disposition in thinking that he deserves what he is asking for.
the ij next turned to a brief discussion of the conditions in montenegro 
the amount of time this case has been pending has made the respondent claim even weaker.historically,montenegro was considered a satellite or puppet nation of strongman slobodan milosovic.under milosovic regime the respondent position of opposition to service in the serbian army may have had some validity.it was not until very recently that the government of montenegro has taken an independent position with regard to the treatment of ethnic albanians in the region.once the apparent defeat of the milosovic administration,the government of montenegro has shown signs of.this change of events,contrary to the applicant position benefits the respondent and makes his return to montenegro reasonable.montenegro has granted an amnesty to deserters and draft dodgers.nothing in respondent arguments convinces this court that his return to montenegro would place him in any type of danger at the present time.in concluding as i do i have determined that the applicant possibility of any future persecution is nil.respondent attorney arguments that the new administration of elected president vojislaw kostunica is a mirror image of his predecessor is not persuasive nor established.
the final substantive portion of the ij decision reiterates his adverse credibility determination 
the court has stated its opinion earlier as to how skeptical the court is about the applicant claim of past persecution.testimony that has been plagued by fantastic anecdotes and uncorroborated information is very difficult to accept even as plausible.the applicant case is precisely affected by these characteristics and therefore makes it impossible for the court to accord it any credence.
the bia affirmed this decision without opinion.
ii.standard of review 
because the bia affirmed the decision of the ij without opinion,see e,the decision of the ij is the final agency determination,which we are called upon to review.see dia.we have jurisdiction under over this timely petition for review of a final determination of the bia.
we review the agency findings of as the ij credibility determinations,his findings on the cat claim,and his findings regarding changed country b b,which provides that administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.as we explained in dia,we have read this standard to require that the agency support its findings with substantial evidence,as articulated by the supreme court in ins,d.at see also sevoian ashcroft,cir the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act codifies the language the supreme court used in to describe the substantial evidence standard in immigration cases.we concluded in dia that 
the question whether an agency determination is supported by substantial evidence is the same as the question whether a reasonable fact finder could make such a determination based upon the administrative record.if a reasonable fact finder could make a particular finding on the administrative record,then the finding is supported by substantial evidence.conversely,if no reasonable fact finder could make that finding on the administrative record,the finding is not supported by substantial evidence.
iii.berishaj application for asylum 
a.the asylum.the adverse credibility determination 
berishaj applied for asylum and withholding of removal based on past persecution and a fear of future persecution if he is removed to montenegro.in gao ashcroft,cir,we laid out the statutory framework for asylum claims and the relevance of adverse credibility determinations to the asylum inquiry 
a grant of asylum under b of the immigration and nationality act ina allows an otherwise removable alien to stay in the united states.the attorney general may grant asylum to an alien who demonstrates that is a refugee a person unable or unwilling to return to the country of that person nationality or habitual residence because of past persecution or because of a fear of future persecution on account of his race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.see ina b,b requiring asylum applicant conform to definition of refugee a a,a a providing definition of refugee.in order to establish eligibility for asylum on the basis of past persecution,an applicant must show an incident,or incidents,that rise to the level of persecution that is on account of one of the grounds and is committed by the government or forces the government is either unable or unwilling to control.navas ins,cir.
an applicant can demonstrate that she has a fear of future persecution by showing that she has a genuine fear,and that a reasonable person in her circumstances would fear persecution if returned to her native country.elnager ins,cir.aliens have the burden of supporting their asylum claims through credible testimony.abdille ashcroft,cir.testimony,by itself,is sufficient to meet this burden,if credible.a,chand ins,cir.in some cases the ins may require documentary evidence to support a claim,even from otherwise credible applicants,to meet their burden of proof.abdulai ashcroft,cir.
a dverse credibility determinations are reviewed for substantial evidence.balasubramanrim ins,cir adverse credibility determinations based on speculation or conjecture,rather than on evidence in the record,are reversible.salaam ins,cir.generally,minor inconsistencies and minor admissions that reveal nothing about an asylum applicant fear for his safety are not an adequate basis for an adverse credibility finding.ins,cir.the discrepancies must involve the heart of the asylum claim.ins,cir.
gao,at.furthermore,an alien who offers credible testimony regarding past persecution is presumed to have a fear of future persecution.see abdulrahman ashcroft,cir citing an applicant who has been found to have established such past persecution shall also be presumed to have a fear of persecution on the basis of the original claim.
here,if the ij adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence,berishaj asylum claim would arguably fail because the ij refused to credit significant testimony at the core of berishaj story of past being subjected to persecution by serbs on account of his status as an ethnic albanian.we set aside for the time being that the ij failed altogether to address berishaj testimony about how he was treated outside the military.that his civilian could independently support his asylum claim.in light of our conclusion that the ij adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence,we need not address whether the ij adverse credibility determination with respect to berishaj account of his military service could properly be used to reject his accounts of arguable persecution as a civilian.
as noted,we conclude that the ij adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence.in terms of the language we used in gao,the ij credibility determination was based on speculation and conjecture,rather than on evidence in the record.at citing salaam ins,cir.without further elaboration,the ij simply rejected berishaj testimony regarding his military service as just incredulous sic to the court,as fantastic and ludicrous,and astound ing,worthy of kings of comedy like peter sellers or mel brooks.the ij comments are not only intemperate but singularly unhelpful.at best they amount to a finding that berishaj testimony was implausible or inherently improbable when,as we will demonstrate,the testimony appears eminently reasonable.at all events,the ij comments are not tethered to the record,owing what little support they have to hyperbole and appeals to popular utterly inappropriate bases for an asylum decision.
the bia has of course held,and we have agreed,that an adverse credibility determination may properly be based on implausibility or inherent improbability.see in re,wl bia holding that an adverse credibility determination may be appropriately based on inconsistent statements,contradictory evidence,and inherently improbable testimony in view of the background evidence on country conditions dia,at where an ij bases an adverse credibility determination in part on implausibility,such a conclusion will be properly grounded in the record only if it is made against the background of the general country conditions.citing gao,at he ashcroft,cir.as these cases illustrate,however,there must be record support and specific,cogent reasons for such an adverse credibility determination.
the en banc court in dia emphasized exactly this point in rejecting the adverse credibility determination made by the ij in that case 
w hile we defer to the ij on credibility questions,that deference is expressly conditioned on support in the record,nagi el moraghy ashcroft,cir,and d eference is not due where findings and conclusions are based on inferences or presumptions that are not reasonably grounded in the record.id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also abdulrahman,at stating that substantial deference to a finding is to be afforded where it is grounded in evidence in the record.to this end,it is clear that a dverse credibility determinations based on speculation or conjecture,rather than on evidence in the record,are reversible,gao,at,and that an ij must support her adverse credibility findings with specific,cogent reasons.id.at abdulrahman,at see also ashcroft,cir when an ij rejects an applicant testimony,the ij must provide specific,cogent reasons for doing so.he,at t he ij and bia must offer a specific,cogent reason for any stated disbelief.quoting hartooni ins,cir.
if the ij conclusion is not based on a specific,cogent reason,but,instead,is based on speculation,conjecture,or an otherwise unsupported personal opinion,we will not uphold it because it will not have been supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind would find adequate.in other words,it will not have been supported by substantial evidence.
id.at some alterations in original.
none of the ij reasons for finding berishaj incredible withstand scrutiny in light of the record.we address them seriatim.most obviously wrong is the ij conclusion that berishaj testimony about his experience in the military was not supported by one scintilla of evidence.as we have already described,see supra part,there is at least one strikingly similar published account from another ethnic albanian in the serbian krasniqi story as published in illyria.irrespective of illyria reliability vel non as an unbiased source of news from the balkans,the article was in the administrative record and the ij was obliged to address it.moreover,the ij is in no position to comment from his own experience on the plausibility of the cruel practices employed in one of the most heinous conflicts of the modern era.if anything,the tactic of forcing one ethnic minority to kill another is entirely consistent with multiparty ethnic warfare,and there is no substantial evidence on which to conclude otherwise.it seems eminently plausible that the serbians would require the albanians to be the ones to shoot the bosnians,and that they would enforce that role in the manner having a gunman behind each albanian.to describe this as a mel brooks scenario seems to us bizarre.
we also can not understand the ij incredulity at berishaj ability to learn enough serbian to clean and operate a tank gun as a soldier.berishaj testified that he did not find serbian difficult to learn,and that he had to stop speaking albanian suggests that he was effectively immersed in serbian for several months.these are both candid and credible statements that the ij did not address.what is more,even though the ij hearing in january of no more than a year after berishaj arrived in the united states was conducted with an albanian interpreter,berishaj repeatedly demonstrated that he was listening to the questions in english,and not waiting for the interpreter translation.at times,berishaj even responded in english.english is a difficult language to learn,but berishaj apparently has some facility for picking up languages,and this only enhances the credibility of his claim to having learned basic serbian in a few months.in light of all this,we do not see how a reasonable factfinder could conclude that his claim that he learned enough serbian to clean and operate the tank gun was not worthy of belief.
we also note the basic misstatement of the record in the ij description of berishaj never testified that he was placed in command of the tank,or in control of the tank he testified that he was at the bottom of the chain of command.there is no evidence contra.in sum,nothing of the ij adverse credibility determination survives even basic scrutiny,and we can not accept the ij determination as supported by substantial evidence 
the ij also rejected berishaj testimony on the ground that it was plagued by uncorroborated information.to the extent that the ij meant that berishaj account of his military experience could not be squared with the experiences of other ethnic albanians in the serbian army in the,we think our discussion above amply refutes any notion that berishaj experience was implausible.to the extent that the ij complained of the absence of testimonial or documentary materials in the record to support aspects of the factual account given by berishaj,we are at a loss to comprehend the corroborative evidence in this situation would run counter to our precedent,bia precedent,and common sense.
in abdulai,at,we held that the bia may sometimes require applicants to supply corroborating evidence in order to meet their burden of proof.in so doing,we refused to hold invalid the rule of corroboration laid down by the bia in.we explained that contemplates a inquiry an identification of the facts for which it is reasonable to expect corroboration an inquiry as to whether the applicant has provided information corroborating the relevant facts and,if he or she has not,an analysis of whether the applicant has adequately explained his or her failure to do so.abdulai,at internal quotation marks omitted see also mulanga ashcroft,cir.
the ij plainly did not heed even the first step,which is simple common sense there are matters on which it is plainly unreasonable to expect any kind of corroboration.wartime persecution is surely among these,strife,and destruction all conspire to destroy what records there might once have been.evidence documenting military persecution and abuse is rarely made in the first place.testimony is nearly impossible to come by because of death and dispersal in the ranks.the ij had no grounds on which to expect corroboration from berishaj.
changed country conditions 
the ij alternative reason for rejecting berishaj asylum claim was that country conditions in montenegro had improved by to the point that berishaj stories of past if they were longer provided a basis for a fear of future persecution.as we have noted,an alien who offers credible testimony regarding past persecution is presumed to have a fear of future persecution.see b abdulrahman.but b i also provides that 
an immigration judge shall deny the asylum application of an alien found to be a refugee on the basis of past persecution if it is found by a preponderance of the evidence that t here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a fear of persecution in the applicant country of nationality on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion 
the burden of proof in a rebuttal is on the government.b ii.
other courts of appeals have recognized a limitation on the inferences that may be drawn from evidence of changed country conditions.the first,seventh,ninth,and tenth circuits agree that evidence of changed country conditions can successfully rebut an alien fear of future persecution based on past persecution only if that evidence addresses the specific basis for the alien fear of persecution generalized improvements in country conditions will not suffice as rebuttals to credible testimony and other evidence establishing past persecution.the other courts of appeals,including this court,appear to have had no occasion to consider the matter.
as the court of appeals for the ninth circuit has explained,the ins is obligated to introduce evidence that,on an individualized basis,rebuts a particular applicant specific grounds for his fear of future persecution.information about general changes in the country is not sufficient.rios ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted accord krastev ins,cir granting petition for review,noting that the country report relied on by the bia did nothing to rebut petitioner fear from local,not national,authorities in bulgaria gailius ins,cir it is well established that general changes in country conditions do not render an applicant ineligible for asylum when,despite those general changes,there is a specific danger to the applicant.citing fergiste ins,cir kaczmarczyk ins,cir explaining that,though it appropriately rebutted petitioners fear of future persecution in that case,the bia could not use the election of solidarity party members in poland to reject all asylum claims by polish nationals.we agree with these cases and apply their precepts to the case before us.the rule is a natural corollary of the more general proposition that the ij is required to consider the record as a whole in ruling on an alien claim.see,tarrawally ashcroft,cir citing balasubramanrim,at.
to the extent that the ij proposed to proceed on an interpretation of b that departs from the one stated by our sister courts of appeals,the ij offered no reasoning and cited no even the pertinent regulation itself.accordingly,we have no basis on which to conclude that the ij reading and application of the regulation was reasonable and therefore entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,valansi ashcroft,cir quoting,inter alia,lewis ins,cir if we conclude that congress has not directly addressed the question at issue in a statute or its intent is ambiguous,we must defer to the board interpretation of the statute provided it is not an unreasonable one.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
subject to our discussion of the staleness of the country report in the administrative record here,the ij reliance on changed country conditions was only in part supported by substantial evidence.substantial evidence does support the ij conclusion that berishaj could no longer have an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution in the all,as even the state department country report for notes,the war in bosnia ended with the dayton peace accord,and the yugoslav parliament had approved an amnesty for those who had avoided military service between and.while there were scattered reports of forcible conscription,it was clear by that this was the exception.
on the other hand,nothing in the country reports,or elsewhere in the record,rebuts berishaj fear of persecution at the hands of montenegrin police authorities.berishaj testified that the police had come to his parents home looking for him after he had left montenegro,and that his brother had been put in jail.berishaj sister corroborated berishaj account of his parents report of the police searches.the ij extremely general observation that,in the wake of milosevic withdrawal of influence over montenegro,the government of montenegro has shown signs of does nothing to refute berishaj claims of persecution similarly insufficient is the government observation not relied on by the ij,we note that ethnic albanians participate in the political process in montenegro and have won seats in parliamentary elections.there may be specific reasons to think that berishaj fear of persecution is no longer reasonable,but the ij offers none,and we will not scour a page record well over half of which is devoted to documentary materials for evidence unnoticed and unanalyzed by the ij to uphold the ij decision.the burden of proof in a rebuttal is squarely on the government,and no reasonable factfinder could conclude that the government has carried its burden of presenting specific evidence to rebut berishaj presumed fear of future persecution.
in sum,substantial evidence does not support the ij rejection of berishaj claim of persecution by montenegrin police authorities we will therefore grant his petition for review of the ij disposition of his asylum claim.we do not hold that bershaj asylum claim must succeed it may be that his objective fear of future persecution is rebutted by evidence in the record,but we certainly will not mine the record to invent our own reasons to reject berishaj application.it may also be that the events of which berishaj complains do not amount to persecution,but it would be manifestly inappropriate for us,rather than the agency,to undertake that inquiry in the first instance.see ins ventura,d.we discuss in greater detail infra part may be that the passage of considerable time since the original agency disposition will allow the administrative record to be supplemented in a way that sheds more light on bershaj claim for asylum.
b.the trouble with stale administrative records 
it is a salutary principle of administrative law review that the reviewing court act upon a closed record.this modus procedendi secures to an administrative agency the necessary measure of authority and discretion within its sphere of special competence,by preventing undue interference by generalist courts that are charged only with ensuring procedural regularity in the agency actions.this in turn translates to stability and predictability in outcomes in matters within the agency expertise.while the principle yields good results in most cases,in the area of asylum law,where claims are heavily dependent on country conditions,it can become an albatross.more specifically,the dispute often centers on the government assertion,based upon a state department country report,that conditions have so changed from those represented in the asylum application that there is no longer a basis for the alien claim of persecution in the country of proposed removal.
it has become common that those country reports in the administrative record are three or four years old by the time the petition for review comes before us,and they frequently do not fairly reflect what our knowledge of world events suggests is the true state of affairs in the proposed country of removal,or the region embracing it.it almost goes without saying that,in the troubled areas of the planet from which asylum claims tend to come,the pace of change is regimes rise and fall,and conditions improve and worsen for vulnerable ethnic,religious,and political minorities.as a consequence,we become like astronomers whose telescopes capture light rays that have taken millions of years to traverse the cosmos,revealing things as they once were,but are no longer.but unlike astronomers,who can only speculate about what is happening at this moment in a galaxy,we often know very well what has happened in the years since an administrative record was compiled.
as we have suggested above,the review of agency actions is,in theory at least,just,without regard to the merits.that should make it easier,not harder,to judge records.however,in contrast to the traditional administrative law case,this type of review can give rise to potentially devastating consequences to an applicant who faces the possibility of persecution or worse if he is removed.
this case is a good example of how much can change in the time between the creation of the administrative record before the ij and the judgment of this court.on the one hand,slobodan milosevic is now gone from the region,the federal republic of yugoslavia no longer exists,and berishaj native montenegro is now within the recently formed loose federation of serbia and montenegro.on the other hand,berishaj least as of his testimony in early the leaders in power are in practice mirror image s of milosevic.country reports are singularly unenlightening when faced with this kind of situation.
specific to berishaj fear of are looking now to the state department country reports on human rights practices serbia and montenegro,released in february,which we have downloaded from the state department web site the country report we note that police occasionally beat suspects during arrest and detention,but there has been generally improved respect by the police for human rights.recently enacted criminal procedure reforms are aimed toward eliminating arbitrary arrest and detention,and the montenegrin helsinki committee hcm,a recognized monitor,did not record any incidents of arbitrary arrest or detention during.in the cases where arrest did not lead to prosecution,the hcm did not find in contrast to previous years any political,ethnic,or religious motivation by the police.ethnic albanians participate in the political process,and though they are proportionately underrepresented,they do have seats in
