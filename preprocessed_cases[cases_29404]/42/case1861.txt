jorge eduardo appeals his conviction for exporting from the united states into mexico rounds of ammunition in violation of b and c,a,and and.asserts that his guilty plea was not supported by a sufficient factual basis because his offending conduct only amounted to an attempt to export ammunition,rather than actual exportation.he asks that his guilty plea be vacated and the matter remanded so that he may plead anew.we decline to do so,but modify the judgment to reflect conviction for attempted exportation only and affirm the judgment as so modified.
facts and proceedings below 
the facts in this case are undisputed.as reflected by the presentence report psr,to which appellant counsel stated at sentencing he had no objections,on december,special agents from the united states bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice observed,accompanied by his three children,purchase a large quantity of ammunition from the super center store in brownsville,texas.later that day,attempted to return to the republic of mexico via the gateway international bridge.when ice agents inspected the vehicle,denied possession of currency in excess of,firearms,or ammunition.was then referred to the secondary inspection area,at which time admitted to possessing ammunition in the vehicle.agents then discovered undeclared,assorted ammunition hidden in the car.the psr described this series of events by stating attempted to export the ammunition through the gateway international bridge but was detained by ice agents.
in total,the agents found thirty boxes,or rounds,of ammunition twenty boxes of caliber bullets three boxes of magnum bullets three boxes of mm bullets three boxes of automatic bullets and one box of automatic bullets.
after being read his miranda rights,admitted that he had entered the united states from mexico solely to purchase the ammunition,and that he knew it was illegal to export ammunition from the united states to mexico.admitted further that he was hired to purchase the ammunition and export it but refused to disclose who had hired him,taking full responsibility for his actions.claimed that he was to receive approximately for every box of caliber rounds he successfully exported into mexico but,as of that time,was not to receive payment for the other ten boxes of ammunition.
then admitted to previously exporting,one month before,a load of ammunition into mexico from the united states for a payment of approximately.agents corroborated this statement by way of a treasury enforcement communications system search and a receipt found in car for ammunition purchased on that previous date.
on january,the grand jury returned a charging with the offense of knowingly and willfully exporting from the united states to mexico ammunition designated as a defense article on the united states munitions list,without first acquiring a license or written authorization from the state department,in violation of b and c a and and.on february,before a united states magistrate judge,entered a plea of guilty to the offense alleged in the indictment.there was no plea agreement.the magistrate judge then issued his report and recommendation that the district court accept the guilty plea.
on may,the district court in open court adopted the report and recommendation,accepted the guilty plea and found guilty of the offense charged in the indictment,counsel for the government and for appellant each stating they had no objection and appellant personally stating there was no reason his plea should not be accepted.the psr,as to which counsel for each party stated there were no objections,determined that,under a,base offence level was,but three levels were deducted due to acceptance of responsibility.therefore,combined with his category i criminal history,the applicable guideline range was between and months.filed an unopposed motion for a downward departure based upon,comment,which allows a downward departure when the offense is determined to be not harmful,or without the potential to be harmful,to a security or foreign policy interest of the united states.
the district court denied the motion for downward departure for three primary reasons had his children with him at the time he was apprehended had admitted in open court to previously engaging in the same criminal activity,albeit without the knowledge of law enforcement officials and it was a very dangerous act the district court then sentenced to months imprisonment and three years of supervised release 
timely appealed,contending that there was an insufficient factual basis for his guilty plea in violation of federal rule of criminal procedure b,in that the evidence shows only an attempt to export,not a completed exportation as charged in the indictment.
discussion 
standard of review 
guilty pleas are reviewed for compliance with rule.united states reasor,cir united states marek,cir en banc.rule b requires that b efore entering judgment on a guilty plea,the court must determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.the supreme court in mccarthy united states explained 
requiring this examination of the relation between the law and the acts the defendant admits having committed is designed to protect a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the charge,d quoting,notes of advisory committee on criminal rules.
the factual basis for the guilty plea must appear in the record and must be sufficiently specific to allow the court to determine that the defendant conduct was within the ambit of that defined as criminal.united states oberski,cir.historically,any failure in rule procedures surrounding a guilty plea was considered to be irreparable error warranting automatic reversal in,however,rule h was promulgated,and the supreme court has since shown reluctance to overturn pleas unless prejudice can be shown on the record as a whole.see united states vonn,d united states dominguez benitez,d.united states timmreck,d challenge under.
because objects to the rule error for the first time on appeal,this court must review for plain error only.vonn,at marek,at.under plain error review,bears the burden to show that there is an error the error is clear and obvious and the error affects his substantial rights.marek,at.the relief for error is tied to a prejudicial effect,so the error must have had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the verdict.dominguez benitez.at citing kotteakos united states.b.further,even if establishes clear error,we will not vacate the judgment unless the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.marek,at see also united states olano,d.to show prejudice,must show a reasonable probability that,but for the error,he would not have entered the plea.dominguez benitez.at 
because both parties agree that the record lacks a factual basis for guilty plea,the first two prongs of the plain error review are satisfied.in short,contrary to the charge in the indictment to which pleaded guilty the facts are that he attempted to export a defense article from the united states to mexico but did not succeed in doing so there was no evidence he actually or aided and abetted anyone who did so.however,the issue remains whether substantial rights were adversely affected.
the government contends that substantial rights were not affected and he would have entered his plea notwithstanding the rule error of which he now complains.
attempted exportation 
while t o attempt a federal offense is not,of itself,a federal crime,and there is no one general federal statute proscribing all attempts to commit federal offenses,see united states york,cir,it is nevertheless clear that attempted exportation without a license of a defense article on united states munitions list constitutes a federal crime,namely a violation of c.section c provides that a ny person who willfully violates any provision of this section or section of this title,or any rule or regulation issued under either section shall upon conviction be fined for each violation or imprisoned not more than ten years,or both emphasis added,and a,a regulation issued under,provides and at all relevant times provided that it is unlawful to export or attempt to export from the united states any defense article for which a license or written approval is required without first obtaining the required license or written approval emphasis added.indeed,we have on at least two occasions affirmed convictions of violating section by attempted exportation of defense articles on the united states munitions list without a license.united states covarrubias,cir united states,cir.
since such attempted exportation contrary to section is a federal crime,it is obvious that it is a lesser included offense of actual exportation contrary to section.the elements are the same except that the latter offense requires that the defense articles actually leave the united states in order to willfully export ammunition in violation of section one must also attempt to do so one must willfully attempt to cause with the ammunition to cross the border before succeeding in doing so.accordingly,under a charge of exportation contrary to section a defendant may properly be found guilty of attempting to export contrary to section under the provisions of rule c even though attempt is not alleged in the indictment under.c a defendant may be found guilty of an attempt to commit a substantive offense,whether or not the attempt was charged in the indictment,provided an attempt is punishable.united states marin,cir.see also,united states brozyna,cir conviction on indictment alleging acquisition,though proof showed only attempted acquisition,does not violate defendant right to be tried only on charges presented in an indictment because rule c permits a conviction for attempt even when the indictment charges only the completed act united states pino,cir indictment charging distribution of heroin would support conviction on an attempt theory united states remigio,cir the crime of attempt is a lesser included offense of the substantive offense and proof of the substantive crime at trial was proof of the lesser included offense of attempt united states gaskin,cir lafave,substantive criminal law ed c,at the courts are in general agreement that an attempt conviction may be had on a charge of the completed crime.we also have so recognized.see united states york,cir attempt is an offense included in the completed crime.when the facts support conviction of a offense we can generally modify the judgment to reflect the lesser offense without detrimentally affecting the defendant rights 
and dominguez benitez 
both parties call our attention to united states,cir.in,the defendant was charged with knowingly entering and being found in the united states after deportation,contrary to.the defendant pleaded guilty to that charge but argued on appeal the rule evidence showed that he only attempted entry,and could not have been found in the united states since he never actually entered.id.at.under plain error review,this court vacated the guilty plea because the evidence was insufficient to show that the defendant had actually entered 
the appropriate indictment would have been to charge defendant with attempting to enter the united states after previously being deported there is a clear distinction between actual entry into the united states,and attempted entry.citation that distinction being that actual entry has been found by most courts to require both physical presence in the country as well as freedom from official restraint,while attempted entry only requires that the person approach a port of entry and make a false claim of citizenship or alien status.id.
this court held that the government failure to charge the correct offense in the indictment could not be harmless since a n indictment is intended to provide notice to the defendant that allows him to intelligently consider his defense or plea.id.at.this court also found unpersuasive the government argument that even if the factual basis is insufficient none of the defendant substantial rights were affected because a charge of attempted entry provides for the same statutory maximum sentence as a charge of actual entry.id.
it is not clear that the panel regarded attempted entry as a lesser included offense of the charged section offense,as the panel apparently viewed the attempted entry offense as requiring the making of a false claim of citizenship or alien status.id.at.in any event,was decided without the benefit of the supreme court decisions in and dominguez benitez and necessarily must be construed in light of those cases.indeed,the supreme court in dominguez benitez stresses 
t he point is not to a defendant actual decision to plead guilty if it is reasonably probable he would have gone to trial absent the error,it is no matter that the choice may have been foolish.the point,rather,is to enquire whether the omitted rule procedure would have made the difference required by the standard of reasonable probability.dominguez benitez.at.
dominguez benitez holds further 
a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea,on the ground that the district court committed plain error under rule,must show a reasonable probability that,but for the error,he would not have entered the plea.a defendant must thus satisfy the judgment of the reviewing court,informed by the entire record,that the probability of a different result is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.id.at internal citations omitted.
dominguez benitez necessarily modifies our reasoning in by increasing the burden for defendants in situations similar to.as such,must demonstrate both that his substantial rights were adversely affected and that he would not have entered his guilty plea but for the error.
conviction of offense does not affect substantial rights 
as noted,a conviction for an attempt to commit the completed offense charged or a conviction for some other lesser included offense of that charged,may properly be based on an indictment which alleges only the completed offense and does not mention attempt or other lesser included offense of that charged.as stated in united states thompson,cir 
the purpose of requiring a factual basis for a plea as now stated in rule f and as included in the amendment to the rules is to assure the court that the conduct which the defendant admits by his plea of guilty constitutes the offense charged in the indictment or a lesser offense included therein.
here,during the rearraignment,the rule hearing transcript describes the following exchange,with appellant a college graduate engineer under oath under penalty of perjury 
attorney the facts would show,your honor,that on december,customs and border protection officers observed the defendant purchase a large amount of assorted ammunition at a store in brownsville,texas.agents conducted surveillance as the defendant attempted to export the ammunition out of the united states to mexico through the gateway port of entry,brownsville,texas.further inspection of the defendant car revealed three bags hidden underneath a blanket that contained a total of rounds of assorted ammunition.the ammunition is an article that is listed on the united states munitions list.the defendant attempted to export the ammunition without obtaining a license.the defendant acted willfully in exporting the ammunition.the defendant stated that he knew it was illegal to export the ammunition because he had seen the sign at the bridge where it said that it illegal to cross firearms and ammunition to mexico.
the court is that what happened,sir 
the court i going to recommend that your plea be accepted.emphasis added.
plainly,the rule hearing reflects appellant guilt of the offense of attempted exportation contrary to section c.
failure to allege.
contends that because was omitted from the indictment it can not be used to show that attempt to export is a offense and renders the indictment deficient to support a conviction on that basis.however,we conclude that the fact that was not cited in the indictment as one of the regulations violated by conduct is not a sufficient caus
