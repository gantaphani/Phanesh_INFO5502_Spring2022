the petitioner seeks review of the board of immigration appeals bia ruling that she was statutorily ineligible for an extreme hardship waiver based on a finding that her marriage was not entered into in good faith.c a.finding the plain language of the statute does not require a good faith marriage to obtain an extreme hardship waiver,we grant the petition.
background 
tanuja sahai gil waggoner waggoner is a native and citizen of the fiji islands.she entered the united states in april on a nonimmigrant visa.waggoner married a united states citizen,domingo gil,and in june she applied for a transfer in status on the basis of her marriage.in october,the former immigration and naturalization service ins adjusted her status to a conditional permanent resident on the basis of her marriage to a united states citizen,pursuant to a.
in september,waggoner filed a petition to remove the conditions on residence.waggoner reported that she could not file the joint petition and requested a waiver because she was divorced despite the fact that she had entered the marriage to gil in good faith.c.the ins denied the waiver,determining that waggoner had presented no evidence that she had committed to her relationship with gil and thus had entered her marriage in bad faith.on february,the ins terminated waggoner conditional resident status and issued an order to show cause.
at her initial appearance before the immigration judge ij on july,waggoner admitted her citizenship status in the fiji islands and her admission in the united states,but denied the adjustment of her status to conditional permanent resident and the termination of that status on the basis of her bad faith marriage.the ij found that the other allegations were true.
while the case was pending before the ij,waggoner received approval from the ins for adjustment of status based upon her marriage to her second husband,steven waggoner steven.the ins later revoked the approval of the adjustment of status based on the finding that waggoner first marriage was not entered into in good faith.waggoner also filed an amended petition to remove the conditions on her permanent resident status,asserting that she was unable to file a joint petition with gil in conjunction with her first request for adjustment of status because t he termination of my status and deportation from the united states would result in an extreme hardship.c a.the ins also denied this petition,concluding that waggoner was not entitled to the extreme hardship exception because of her first marriage.
the ij held a hearing to address whether waggoner first marriage was in fact a sham.after testimony from waggoner,gil,waggoner mother,and her uncle,waggoner attempted to present testimony from her second husband,steven,that would establish the extreme hardship waiver.the ij refused to admit the testimony,concluding that the waiver was unavailable if the ins proved that the first marriage was a sham.the ij indicated his inclination to conclude that the first marriage was a sham,and waggoner requested an opportunity to file an asylum application based upon problems suffered by native indians in fiji.however,she later waived her opportunity to apply for asylum,noting that at the time the conditions in fiji would not justify such relief.
the ij ordered waggoner deportable after concluding that her first marriage was not entered in good faith.the ij again noted that waggoner had sought an extreme hardship waiver but concluded that even if she could establish such hardship,she was ineligible for the waiver because of her willing participation in a sham marriage.
waggoner appealed the adverse ruling to the bia.she asserted that the ij and ins incorrectly concluded that her marriage rendered her ineligible for the extreme hardship waiver.waggoner also noted that conditions in fiji have changed markedly since april,when respondent declined the opportunity of applying for asylum.the ins objected to the remand,contending that waggoner had failed to submit an asylum application under c currently c.
in november,the bia administratively closed the proceedings so that the ins could decide whether to elect to terminate deportation proceedings and reinstate the proceedings as removal proceedings,which would allow waggoner to apply for cancellation of removal based on her continuous presence in the united states.in february,the government moved to reopen the case after concluding that such repapering was not appropriate in light of waggoner sham marriage.the bia reinstated the proceedings and dismissed waggoner appeal.the bia concluded that waggoner was not entitled to a remand to file an asylum application because she had failed to file an application for asylum and because she had previously waived her right to seek asylum.the bia also concluded that there was insufficient evidence to show that waggoner first marriage was entered in good faith and that,as a result,she was ineligible for the extreme hardship waiver.waggoner petitions this court for review.
ii.analysis 
extreme hardship waiver provision 
the instant question is one of statutory interpretation.waggoner argues that section c a does not require her to prove that her marriage was entered into in good faith to qualify for an extreme hardship waiver.c a.
section facilitates the detection of fraudulent marriages by withholding permanent resident status from immigrants who marry united states citizens unless these couples meet two conditions.olabanji ins,cir.it allows alien spouses of united states citizens to become permanent residents after a conditional status if,within ninety days of the expiration of that period,the alien and spouse file a joint petition to remove the conditional basis and both appear before an immigration official for a personal interview.c.however,if the alien spouse fails to meet these requirements,section c provides three grounds that excuse compliance with section c requirements of a joint petition and personal interview 
the attorney general,in the attorney general discretion,may remove the conditional basis of the permanent resident status for an alien who fails to meet the requirements of paragraph if the alien demonstrates that 
a extreme hardship would result if such alien is removed,
b the qualifying marriage was entered into in good faith by the alien spouse,but the qualifying marriage has been terminated other than through the death of the spouse and the alien was not at fault in failing to meet the requirements of paragraph,or 
c the qualifying marriage was entered into in good faith by the alien spouse and during the marriage the alien spouse or child was battered by or was the subject of extreme cruelty perpetrated by his or her spouse or citizen or permanent resident parent and the alien was not at fault in failing to meet the requirements of paragraph.
in the instant case,the bia denied relief,stating that b ecause of waggoner willing participation in a sham marriage,she is ineligible to receive good faith hardship waivers.waggoner expressly does not challenge the agency determination that her first marriage was not entered into in good faith her position is that the extreme hardship provision,subsection c a,does not require such a showing.
the crux of the matter is whether the first ground,the extreme hardship prong of the waiver provision,implicitly requires that the qualifying marriage be entered into in good faith.although the latter two subsections explicitly contain a requirement that the qualifying marriage be entered in good faith by the alien spouse,the extreme hardship provision does not.
