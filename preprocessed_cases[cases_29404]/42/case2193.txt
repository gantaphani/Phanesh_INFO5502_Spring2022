this case presents an appeal from the board order denying petitioner application for asylum and denying his petition for adjustment of status.we grant but stay the enforcement of the order denying the application for asylum.we reverse the board denial of his petition for adjustment of status and remand that petition for further proceedings.
background 
petitioner is a native and citizen of iran,born on march.he was admitted to the on june,as a visitor.petitioner violated his status by overstaying his visa,and as a result,was placed in deportation proceedings.on october,respondent ordered petitioner to show cause why it should not deport him for remaining in the united states longer than authorized by his visa.appearing before an immigration judge,petitioner admitted the factual allegations in the order to show cause and conceded deportability.petitioner asked for asylum,withholding of deportation,and,in the alternative,for voluntary departure.
in the aftermath of the iranian revolution after the shah was overthrown and the hostages were taken,but prior to their release,petitioner,who was years old at the time,became attracted to the khalq organization mek in the city of ghom the department of state describes mek as follows 
formed in by the children of iranian merchants,the mek sought to counter what it perceived as excessive western influence in the shah regime.following a philosophy that mixes marxism and islam,has developed into the largest and most active armed iranian dissident group.its history is studded with activity,and,most recently attacks on the interests of the clerical regime in iran and abroad worldwide campaign against the iranian government stresses propaganda and occasionally uses terrorist violence.during the the mek staged terrorist attacks inside iran and killed several military personnel and civilians working on defense projects in tehran.supported the takeover in of the embassy in tehran.
press release,dep t of state,background information on foreign terrorist organizations,at http mek,at.mek is a terrorist group currently designated by the secretary of state as a foreign terrorist organization under ina section.press release,dep t of state,report on foreign terrorist organizations,at http.petitioner stated reason for affiliating was the religious nature of the organization that corresponded with his personal upbringing.petitioner asserts that he was never a formal member of mek.however,he distributed flyers in support of an mek senatorial and sold mek newspapers.he personally only knew about mek members the organization at the time had thousands of members.at.petitioner discontinued his association with mek approximately a year later,upon his discovery that mek began resorting to violence.petitioner was arrested in ghom,a year later as part of the widespread campaign by the islamic government against mek.he was charged with possession of a gun and a hand grenade during a demonstration and sentenced to life in prison after a trial in front of a court of islamic justice petitioner vigorously denies these accusations and maintains that he was arrested on a charge designed to punish him for his earlier affiliation with mek originally given a life sentence,petitioner was released on probation after serving five years in various iranian jails.he completed his probation without any major accidents,served in the army for two years,and was able to obtain some employment.petitioner testified that the iranian government did not allow him to complete his high school education and barred him from ever working for the government.there is no evidence to contradict that testimony.
in march of,petitioner,through the assistance of a family friend,secured a passport and an exit permit.he traveled to germany and stayed with a sister there for three months prior to obtaining a visitor visa to enter the petitioner came to the on june.his immediate family in the includes his mother,two brothers and one sister,all of whom are either citizens or permanent residents.he is a beneficiary of an approved immediate relative visa petition filed by his sister on september.he is currently employed based on this approved visa petition,petitioner is now eligible to apply to adjust his status and to become a permanent resident of the 
after hearing all testimony,the immigration judge,on february,denied his asylum,withholding,and voluntary departure applications.the immigration judge found that petitioner lacked credibility based upon his demeanor,lack of responsiveness,and contradictions within his testimony and between his testimony and his application for asylum,petitioner claimed fear of persecution was considerably weakened by his own testimony,including his statements that his life sentence was reduced to five years,that he successfully completed a subsequent probation,that he was able to find employment,and that he completed his military service without incident,petitioner has not suffered past persecution,did not have a fear of future persecution,and thus was ineligible for either asylum or withholding of deportation,and petitioner would not be granted asylum as a matter of discretion even assuming statutory eligibility because of petitioner support for mek tough policy toward the american hostages,and his raising of funds to support and further these policies during a critical period in the detention of the hostages.daneshvar,no,decision of the ij.
petitioner appealed to the board on march.during the pendency of the appeal,on may,he filed a motion to for consideration of his application for the discretionary relief of adjustment of status under ina section.on may,the board affirmed the immigration judge deportation order and asylum and withholding denials,denied petitioner motion to reopen and to remand to apply for adjustment of status,and dismissed the appeal.the board agreed with the immigration judge credibility determination,noting that her finding is given significant weight due to her observational advantages.the board also agreed with the immigration judge denial of asylum and withholding,finding that even if petitioner testimony regarding political imprisonment were true,conditions in iran have changed to such an extent that he no longer has a fear of being persecuted in that country.daneshvar,no,slip op.at bia may.the board also agreed that it was appropriate to deny petitioner asylum in the exercise of discretion based upon his past involvement with mek.finally,the board denied petitioner motion to remand the proceedings to allow him to apply for adjustment of status.the board observed that petitioner was inadmissible under a b i i for having engaged in terrorist activity,including solicitation for membership in the mek.the board concluded that the record provided little apparent positive factors in this case and that the motion should also be denied in the exercise of discretion.daneshvar,no,slip op.at bia may.
petitioner presents four issues on this appeal.first is whether petitioner was deprived of his constitutional right to a full and fair asylum hearing due to questionable translation by the interpreter where the ij based her adverse credibility determination on petitioner testimony.second is whether the adverse credibility determination made by the ij and affirmed by the board is erroneous and not supported by the record.third is whether the board decision denying petitioner application for asylum and withholding of deportation is manifestly contrary to the law,an abuse of discretion and not supported by the record.fourth is whether the board decision denying petitioner motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status permanent residency based on the provisions of a b i i is erroneous,an abuse of discretion and not supported by the record.
constitutional right to a full and fair asylum hearing.
petitioner argues that and evasion noted by the ij in his testimony was due to failure of the interpreter at the hearing on february,to adequately communicate with either petitioner or the ij.petitioner relies on this court earlier finding that an asylum applicant whose testimony was subjected to questionable translation by an interpreter was deprived of his constitutional right to a full and fair asylum hearing where the ij grounded his adverse credibility solely on the applicant testimony.amadou ins,cir.we review de novo the board legal determinations.hamama ins,cir.
in amadou,this court was confronted with a situation where the asylum petitioner and the interpreter spoke different dialects of a west african language,fulani.amadou,at.the immigration judge in that case found that amadou was not credible,citing several inconsistencies in his testimony.id.the board agreed with the immigration judge.this court,however,noted that both the immigration judge and the board were on notice that there was a problem with the interpreter.id.at.the court went on to say that the record indicates that the interpreter faulty translation directly prejudiced amadou because the judge and board denied his application based on the testimony at the hearing.id.the court concluded that since t he immigration judge based her decision to deny amadou applications for asylum,withholding of deportation,and voluntary departure solely on her determination that amadou responses were not credible and since the board of immigration appeals deferred to the judge adverse credibility finding amadou was denied his right to a full and fair hearing id at.
respondent argues that petitioner claim is legally irrelevant because the board denied asylum and withholding,even assuming the truth of petitioner testimony,because he failed to demonstrate a fear of persecution.since,as discussed below,we agree that the board correctly denied asylum on the basis that petitioner failed to demonstrate a fear based on present conditions in iran,we do not address here petitioner argument that inadequate translation caused the adverse credibility ruling.
adverse credibility determination 
petitioner next argues that a detailed review of the record would not support an adverse credibility determination made by the immigration judge and affirmed by the board.although we think that petitioner may have a valid claim that the ij adverse credibility determination was erroneous,we nevertheless choose not to resolve this issue because we are satisfied that petitioner failed to establish that he has a fear of persecution.since on remand bia will exercise its discretion in whether to grant petitioner motion to reopen,we note that a blind of the ij adverse credibility findings in this particular case is unwarranted in light of the questionable quality of the interpreters,and that these findings should be reexamined before forming a basis for a discretionary ruling see,abadi ins,wl,at.cir granting a petition of an iranian asylum seeker and remanding to bia after observing that moreover,untrue statements by themselves are not reason for refusal of refugee status.garrovillas ins,cir quoting turcios ins,cir finding error in the bia adverse credibility determination where the petitioner application stated that he had been shot at,but the petitioner testified at his hearing six years later that he had never been shot at.if discrepancies can not be viewed as attempts by the applicant to enhance his claims of persecution,they have no bearing on credibility.shah ins,cir noting that the adverse credibility finding will not be upheld unless the ij or bia specifically explains the significance of the discrepancy quoting ins,cir.see also bandari ins,cir granting a petition from an iranian applicant and remanding to bia for a discretionary ruling on the grant of asylum and withholding of deportation after noting that a ny alleged inconsistencies in dates that reveal nothing about a petitioner credibility can not form the basis of an adverse credibility finding.zahedi ins,cir finding that ij adverse credibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence in a case of an iranian applicant for asylum,in part,because it was clear that there were significant communication and translation problems concerning dates during the asylum hearing.
asylum claim 
a deportable alien is eligible to seek asylum at the discretion of the attorney general upon proof of a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b a a.a fear must be both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.mikhailevitch ins,cir stating that a n applicant must therefore actually fear that he will be persecuted upon return to his country,and he must present evidence establishing an objective situation under which his fear can be deemed reasonable.citations omitted.the applicant need not,however,show that he probably will be persecuted if he is deported one can certainly have a fear of an event happening when there is less than a chance of the occurrence taking place.id.citations omitted.this court has held that persecution within the meaning of a a requires more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,unaccompanied by any physical punishment,infliction of harm,or significant deprivation of liberty.id.at.this court reviews the board denial of asylum and withholding of deportation under the substantial evidence standard.ins,d.
petitioner argues that his imprisonment from to in iran establishes that he suffered past persecution,giving rise to the presumption under b that he possesses a fear of persecution making him eligible for asylum.respondent argues that even if the claim of imprisonment is assumed to be credible,a preponderance of the evidence establishes that since petitioner imprisonment,conditions in iran have changed enough to where he no longer has a fear of being persecuted in that country on the basis of his past involvement with mek.b i a.we agree with respondent.
as petitioner testified,his original life sentence was eventually reduced to five years.he thereafter served for two years in the iranian military without any incidents.between,when he was released,and,when he left iran,he was only questioned four times and was never physically mistreated during these encounters with the government.petitioner was also able to obtain employment,although his options were limited by his inability to work for the government petitioner strenuously argues that the human rights conditions in iran have continuously deteriorated,citing country reports published by the department of state.although we accept as true the allegations of widespread human rights abuse by the iranian government,we are nevertheless constrained by the statute to reject petitioner claim for asylum because he failed to show a fear of persecution based on his political opinion.see,hamzehi ins,cir we agree with the hamzehis that,by our standards,today living conditions in iran are inhospitable or worse for women and those who would prefer a different political order.however petitioners have not shown the sort of particularized threat of severe harm that would support a fear of persecution.ahmadi board of immigration appeals,wl,at cir we have no doubt that the conditions and human rights in iran are deplorable.the act,though,does not provide asylum eligibility for anyone who may be subject to violence in his home country.citations omitted.we understand that many iranian citizens may live in fear of persecution by the islamic regime.however,the statute requires them to either be members of a particular race,religion,nationality,or social group,or to have the fear based on a political opinion.if we were to accept petitioner theory of eligibility for political asylum,we would have to hold that every iranian citizen has a fear of persecution solely by virtue of living in iran.petitioner has enjoyed as close to a normal life during his eight years in iran after his release,as can be expected of a person living in a totalitarian islamic state.he has presented no credible evidence that he will be singled out for different treatment if he is deported back to iran.as the board explained in an earlier opinion 
this board in turn appreciates the awful circumstances in which the sri lankan government and large numbers of the inhabitants of that country find themselves.but if we were to accept the applicant assessment of human rights violations as constituting persecution under the act,tamils,moslems,and sinhalese alike would all be persecuted in sri lanka.neither the relief of asylum nor of withholding of deportation provides for refuge on account of human rights abuses unconnected to the grounds enumerated in the act,race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.
matter of t,i n,wl bia,citations omitted emphasis added.
withholding of deportation 
the united states code provides that t he attorney general shall not deport any alien to a country if the attorney general determines that such alien life or freedom would be threatened in such country on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.h.as this court has previously noted,a n application seeking withholding of deportation faces a more stringent burden of proof than one for asylum.mikhailevitch,at citing ins,d.because substantial evidence supports the board determination that petitioner is ineligible for asylum,it therefore follows that he can not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of deportation.
motion to reopen 
the attorney general,may in his discretion,adjust the status of an alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the alien makes an application for such adjustment,the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the united states for permanent residence,and an immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application is filed.a.as the supreme court noted,the standard applies to the judicial review of the board determination of motions to reopen.ins abudu,d.the board discretion is broad but it is not unlimited.it may not exercise its discretion in a way that is arbitrary,irrational or contrary to law.babai ins,cir quoting ins,cir.cursory,summary,or conclusory statements are inadequate.zhao dep t of justice,cir.as this court has explained 
in determining whether the board abused its discretion,this court must decide whether the board decision was made without a rational explanation,inexplicably departed from established policies or rested on an impermissible basis,such as invidious discrimination the scope of review is exceedingly narrow because a lack of statutory standards provides the attorney general with unusually broad discretion.at least two courts have held that it is only necessary that the board hear,consider and rationally decide the case before it nevertheless,the bia may be reversed if it fails to actually consider the facts and circumstances respecting each petitioner claim of extreme hardship such a decision would be reversed as arbitrary or capricious.
hazime ins,cir citations omitted.finally,the board denial of relief may be affirmed only on the basis articulated in the decision and this court may not assume that the board considered factors that it failed to mention in its opinion.see,casem ins,cir anderson mcelroy,cir.
the board disposed of petitioner motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status in the following manner 
due to his participation in these same activities,we will deny the respondent motion to remand proceedings to apply for adjustment of status.although he has an approved visa petition based on his relationship to his sister,the respondent is inadmissible to the united states under section a b i i,for having engaged in terrorist activity.engagement in terrorist activities includes solicitation for membership in terrorist organization.section a b iii.as noted above,the mek is designated as a terrorist organization under section of the act therefore the respondent is inadmissible on this ground.further,the record provides very little apparent positive factors in his case and leads us to conclude that the request should be denied in the exercise of discretion.
daneshvar,no,slip op.at bia may.we find that the board erred as a matter of law in its statutory analysis and that it abused its discretion in rejecting petitioner motion to reopen by failing to adequately consider all relevant factors.
section of title defines various categories of inadmissible aliens.one of those categories is involvement in terrorist activities.a b.the board confined its analysis to the provision that provides that any alien who has engaged in a terrorist activity is ineligible to receive a visa and ineligible to be admitted into the united states.a b i i.the immigration judge and the board held that mek was a terrorist organization because it was so designated by the state department.we agree that today mek is a designated terrorist organization.however,mek was not designated as a terrorist organization at the time of petitioner involvement.the importance of this distinction is explained below.
the board found petitioner to be statutorily ineligible for solicitation for membership in a terrorist organization.daneshvar,no,slip op.at.we review questions of statutory interpretation de novo but with due deference to the interpretation by the attorney general and the board.fieran ins,cir citing ins,d chevron,usa,natural res.def.council,d.the statute does prohibit solicitation of any individual for membership in a terrorist organization described in clauses vi i or vi ii.a b iv v aa and bb.those clauses deal with an organization that is designated as a terrorist organization either under or by the secretary of state.id.as discussed above,mek was not a terrorist organization at the time of petitioner conduct under either clause 
the statute does also provide that a terrorist organization is a group of two or more individuals,whether organized or not,which engages in the activities described in subclause i,ii,or iii of clause iv.a b vi iii based on the evidence in the record,we think that bia was correct in finding that mek was a terrorist organization during the as defined by a b vi iii petitioner solicitation for membership in a clause vi iii terrorist organization,however,only renders him ineligible if he can not demonstrate that he did not know,and should not have reasonably have known,that the solicitation would further the organization terrorist activity.a b iv v cc.we find that the board committed a legal error when it failed to consider petitioner evidence regarding his state of mind.
petitioner,at the age of,supported one of the numerous organizations that came to life in the aftermath of the iranian revolution.we would be to classify any minor who sold newspapers for an organization that supported an armed revolt against a tyrannical monarch as a terrorist.to impute such political sophistication to a teenager that apparently even the congress failed to achieve in our minds,would amount to a manifest injustice.furthermore,we are persuaded that petitioner voluntary disassociation from mek merely a year after he joined it,is evidence that he did not originally know in what mek was involved.finally,petitioner testified during the hearing before the ij that he was unaware of mek violent activities until the time he left the group there is no evidence that petitioner himself engaged in any violent acts of terrorism.thus,there is substantial evidence that petitioner is not statutorily ineligible for immigration relief.the burden then shifts to respondent to show otherwise.since petitioner affiliation with mek was very brief,respondent burden will be a heavy one.we note that the board was under the misapprehension that petitioner remained a member of mek until he was imprisoned,and was unaware that petitioner had actually disassociated himself from mek upon learning of mek violent conduct a full year prior to his arrest.respondent,and the board,relied on the state department report that stated a lthough the mojahedin now deny a role in that crisis,they advocated a tough hostage policy in several issues of their own official newspaper mojahed,published in persian in tehran in.dep t of state,bureau of democracy,human rights,and labor,of asylum claims country conditions june,at.ordinarily,we defer to the executive branch in matters affecting immigration.however,in light of the significant factual and legal mistakes committed by the board in this case,as detailed above,we find that no such deference is warranted and that respondent failed to establish that petitioner knew or reasonably should have known about mek activities.
respondent also defends the board decision on the grounds that the board did not abuse its discretion when it found that the record provide d very little apparent positive factors in this case and leads us to conclude that the request should be denied in the exercise of discretion.daneshvar,no,slip op.at.we disagree.
we find a number of factors in the record that may cause the board to find that petitioner motion to reopen should be granted first,the board inexplicably took five years to decide his appeal.see generally casem ins,cir reprimanding bia for failure to consider the effect of a delay on the petitioner son ins,cir noting unconscionable delay between petitioner appeal and bia decision saywack attorney general,civ,wl,at june,discussing bia series of lengthy and unexplained delays.therefore,petitioner has now been in this country for almost ten years.one should hesitate before uprooting him after such a long delay.second,petitioner has a number of his immediate family members in this country,including his mother,a sister,and two brothers,all of whom are either citizens or permanent residents.see,casem,at noting the special regard that congress has for keeping families intact.third,the record indicates that the immediate members of petitioner family have become productive members of this society and petitioner himself is currently employed.fourth,petitioner was an immature teenager when he was associated with mek he lived in a country known for its suppression of all political activity at the time of high political turmoil he was not in tehran at the time of the iranian hostage crisis and he quit mek as soon as he found out about its violent activities.fifth,and last,although we found that petitioner has not established a valid claim for political asylum,we nevertheless can not ignore the ramifications of sending a man to what can only best be described as a lawless country.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we find that petitioner is ineligible for an asylum withholding of deportation.however,we stay the enforcement of the board order as it relates to asylum withholding of deportation because we find that the board committed reversible legal error and abused its discretion in denying petitioner motion to reopen his application for adjustment of status.accordingly,we reverse the board order denying petitioner motion for adjustment of status and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i agree with the majority conclusion to affirm the decision of the board of immigration appeals with respect to denying daneshvar petitions for asylum and withholding of deportation.daneshvar has failed to satisfy the statutory requirements for these forms of relief.
i disagree,however,with the majority decision to reverse and remand the bia order denying daneshvar motion to reopen for adjustment of status.while the majority is correct that daneshvar is not inadmissible to the united states for soliciting membership in a terrorist organization,as that term is defined at a b vi i,the definition of terrorist organization relied on by the bia,daneshvar is nonetheless inadmissible for soliciting membership in a terrorist organization,as defined at a b vi iii.compare a b vi i defining terrorist organization as an organization designated under section by the secretary of state with a b vi iii defining terrorist organization as a group of two or more individuals,whether organized or not,which engages in the activities described in subclause i,ii,or iii of clause iv such as committing or preparing a terrorist activity or gathering information on potential targets for terrorist activity.furthermore,even if daneshvar is not deemed inadmissible under either definition of terrorist organization,it was not an abuse of discretion for the board to deny daneshvar motion to reopen for the reasons stated in the board involvement with the mek at a time when it was particularly strong in its opposition to the united states and the existence of few positive factors in support of granting the motion.
as the majority explained,this court reviews the bia denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.ashki ins,cir.this court has described review under an abuse of discretion standard in the following manner 
abuse of discretion is a phrase which sounds worse than it really is.all it need mean is that,when judicial action is taken in a discretionary manner,such action can not be set aside by a reviewing court unless it has a definite and firm conviction that the court below committed a clear error in judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.there is no exact measure of what constitutes abuse of discretion.it is more than the substitution of the judgment of one tribunal for that of another.judicial discretion is governed by the situation and circumstances affecting each individual case.even where an appellate court has power to review the exercise of such discretion,the inquiry is confined to whether such situation and circumstances clearly show an abuse of discretion,that is,arbitrary action not justifiable in view of such situation and circumstances.
balani ins,cir internal quotation and citation omitted.in reviewing the bia decision to deny a motion to reopen,as the majority notes,this court must decide whether the denial of petitioner motion to reopen deportation proceedings was made without a rational explanation,inexplicably departed from established policies,or rested on an impermissible basis such as invidious discrimination against a particular race or group.id.at.
the supreme court has commented that the attorney general has broad discretion to grant or deny a motion to reopen.ins doherty,d citing ins,d.furthermore,m otions for reopening of immigration proceedings are disfavored for the same reasons as are petitions for rehearing and motions for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.id.this is especially true in a deportation proceeding,where,as a general matter,every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the united states.id.
the bia denied daneshvar motion to reopen his deportation proceedings by finding that he is inadmissible to enter the united states under a b i i for having engaged in terrorist activity and because the record provides very little apparent positive factors in his case.the bia did not abuse its discretion in making this determination.
i agree with the majority that the mek was a terrorist organization,as defined by a b vi iii,during the.in a decision refusing to set aside the state department designation of the mek as a foreign terrorist organization in the,the circuit described the mek activities in the years just prior to daneshvar involvement 
the mek collaborated with ayatollah khomeini to overthrow the former shah of iran.as part of that struggle,they assassinated at least six american citizens,supported the takeover of the embassy,and opposed the release of american hostages.in the mek exploded time bombs at more than a dozen sites throughout tehran,including the society,and the offices of and general motors.from the mojahedin continued their campaign of bombings,damaging such targets as the offices of airlines,shell oil company,and british organizations.
people mojahedin org.of iran united states dep t of state,quoting a cia intelligence research paper dated july alterations in original.the state department characterizes the mek violence in this way 
during the sic,the mojahedin organization was at the forefront of opposition to the shah and in this period assassinated several americans in iran.the mojahedin was in full support of the takeover of the embassy and the holding of our hostages during the hostage crisis in iran.their own published statements show that their position at that time was much more than that of iran leaders.although the mojahedin now deny a role in that crisis,they advocated a tough hostage policy in several issues of their own official newspaper mojahed,published in persian in tehran in.
of asylum claims and country conditions,june,report,at.title a b i i provides that an alien who has engaged in terrorist activity is inadmissible to the united states.to engage in terrorist activity means inter alia to solicit any individual for membership in a terrorist organization described in clause vi iii a b vi iii,unless the solicitor can demonstrate that he did not know,and should not reasonably have known,that the solicitation would further the organization terrorist activity.a b iv v cc emphasis added.
by daneshvar own admission,his involvement with the mek was by no means a passive pursuit.in his testimony before the immigration court,daneshvar stated that from around or until or he sold the mojahed,the mek newspaper that the state department has stated advocated support for the taking of american hostages,supported the mek ideology,and was active in the mek election efforts.daneshvar also testified that he was part of a twenty member committee that produced and distributed flyers in support of mek political candidates therefore,the entire focus of daneshvar involvement with the to his own testimony was aimed at soliciting individuals for membership in this terrorist organization.
since daneshvar actions constitute solicitation of membership in a terrorist organization,he is inadmissible to the united states unless he demonstrates that he did not know,and should not reasonably have known,that his acts of solicitation would further the mek terrorist activities.daneshvar has wholly failed to meet this burden.while the majority,citing factors such as daneshvar age at the time of participation and his solicitation over a one year period of time,concludes that there is substantial evidence that petitioner is not statutorily ineligible for immigration relief,these factors do not demonstrate daneshvar knowledge,or lack thereof,concerning the contribution that his activities made to the organization terrorism efforts.the statute does not craft an exception for persons that solicit membership in terrorist organizations based on the solicitator age or duration of action.rather,the statute only exempts persons under a b iv v cc for reasonably lacking the knowledge that their efforts contributed to the organization terrorist activities.
the majority also claims that daneshvar learned of the mek violent aims around the time that he left the organization.on this point,daneshvar testified,at the time mojahedin and my friend were talking to go against the government with our force.and at the time,i find out if we go that it will like sic bloody war in the country.right before when they take the guns out,i separated from them.again,this evidence does not demonstrate that daneshvar was unaware that his actions furthered the mek terrorist activities.this testimony,if believed,only leads to the conclusion that daneshvar left the mek when he felt the organization was about to confront the iranian government.daneshvar testimony does not indicate that he lacked knowledge of the mek terrorist activities prior to his departure from the group.
furthermore,even if this court were to believe that daneshvar did not know the effects of his solicitation for the mek,declaring daneshvar inadmissible to the united states would nonetheless be appropriate.the statute requires the solicitor to demonstrate both that he lacked actual knowledge that his solicitation would further the organization terrorist activities and that he should not reasonably have known of the effects of his solicitation.as previously discussed,during the very period that daneshvar solicited members on behalf of the mek in the late and early,the organization own newspapers proclaimed the mek support for the holding of american hostages.therefore,it is extremely difficult to accept that daneshvar should not have known he was soliciting members for a terrorist organization,when he willingly distributed literature proclaiming the organization violent policies.
although the majority initially states correctly that the burden for demonstrating daneshvar lack of knowledge concerning the effect of his solicitation rests on him,the majority ultimately places this burden on the ins by remarking that respondent failed to establish that petitioner knew or reasonably should have known about mek activities.the statute clearly places the burden on the,in this demonstrate that he did not know,and should not reasonably have known,that the solicitation would further the organization terrorist activity.a b iv v cc.examining evidence offered by the ins is irrelevant to this court consideration of whether daneshvar solicited individuals for membership in the mek.
finally,the majority opinion lists several factors,such as daneshvar length of stay in the united states,in an attempt to provide positive factors the board could have used as justification for granting daneshvar motion to reopen.while this court could consider these factors if applying de novo review to this issue,under an abuse of discretion standard of review,this court can not substitute its judgment for that of the board.balani,at congress has entrusted to the attorney general of the united states the responsibility of exercising discretion in immigration matters.the courts will not substitute their discretion for that of the attorney general.
therefore,i disagree with the majority apparent conclusion that daneshvar is not inadmissible to the united states.nevertheless,even if one were to decide that daneshvar was not inadmissible through his involvement with the mek,it is important to note that the board also based its decision to deny daneshvar motion on his participation in the mek during the precise time that the organization not only opposed american interests but also argu ed for a prolongation of the detention of the hostages.in addition,the board concluded that there were very little apparent positive factors that favored granting daneshvar motion in the exercise of the board discretion.in its decision,which upheld the denial of daneshvar petitions for asylum and withholding of deportation as well as denied daneshvar motion to reopen,the bia also cited the immigration judge finding that daneshvar lacked credibility because of his demeanor during testimony and inconsistencies within his testimony consequently,the board did not abuse its if daneshvar was not statutorily inadmissible to the united deciding to deny his motion to reopen.i dissent from the majority decision to reverse the bia order denying daneshvar motion to reopen and to remand for proceedings consistent with the majority opinion.
this court takes judicial notice of the fact that today ghom is a city of approximately people located miles southwest of tehran pop.million.
there was a confusion during petitioner testimony about what type of an election he participated in.petitioner did explicitly clarify that he was mistaken when he first said he participated in a presidential election and that he,indeed,participated in a senatorial race.dissent emphasizes that this inconsistency further supports the ij adverse credibility finding.we disagree.for the purposes of his asylum claim,it was irrelevant what type of the election he participated in.and as we explain later in this opinion,an adverse credibility judgment can not be based on an irrelevant inconsistency.on the other hand,for the purposes of his petition for adjustment of status which was not even filed at the time of his testimony,the distinction between a presidential and a senatorial election is significant because,even today,we know nothing about the platform of the senatorial candidate in question.whereas it would be fair to impute the beliefs of a national party like mek to its presidential candidate,we have seen enough diversity in viewpoints among the legislators of the same party in this country to doubt that every mek senatorial candidate shared the same viewpoint as the mek organization itself.
