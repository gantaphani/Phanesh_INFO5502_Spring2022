jose luis flores mejia appeals the sentence imposed on him for his conviction of the offense of reentry after deportation.his appeal raises the issue of what a defendant must do in order to preserve a challenge to the procedural reasonableness of a sentence.at the sentencing hearing,flores mejia made a mitigation argument,based on his cooperation with the government.flores mejia contends that his initial presentation of this argument is sufficient,without more,to preserve his claim that the district court committed procedural error by failing,when it pronounced sentence,to give meaningful consideration to this argument.the government counters that flores mejia failure to object,at a time when the district court could have promptly addressed it,did not preserve the issue for appeal and leaves his claim subject to plain error review.
we have decided that,to assist the district courts in sentencing,we will develop a new rule which is applicable in those situations in which a party has an objection based upon a procedural error in sentencing but,after that error has become evident,has not stated that objection on the record.we now hold that in such a situation,when a party wishes to take an appeal based on a procedural error at sentencing such as the court failure to meaningfully consider that party arguments or to explain one or more aspects of the sentence imposed that party must object to the procedural error complained of after sentence is imposed in order to avoid plain error review on appeal our panel holding in united states sevilla,cir differs from our holding today and is superseded.
flores mejia,a citizen of mexico,pled guilty to one count of reentry after deportation,in violation of a.this illegal reentry was in fact flores mejia sixth illegal entry into the united states.flores mejia had an extensive criminal record with prior convictions,including several for repeated assaults on his wife.as his attorney admitted at sentencing,this man has an atrocious record.based on a criminal history category of vi and an offense level of,including a level enhancement for a prior violent crime,his guidelines range was to months in prison.
in his sentencing memorandum,flores mejia raised several grounds for downward departures and variances.at issue here is his argument that he cooperated with the government by providing information regarding a homicide and a prostitution ring.at the sentencing hearing,the district court heard argument on a number of flores mejia grounds for mitigation and denied them.the parties then addressed flores mejia argument that his cooperation warranted a reduced sentence.both the government and defense counsel made proffers on the issue.the government argued that the homicide in question had already been solved and that the information about the prostitution ring did not involve involuntary sex trafficking or children and so it fell outside the ordinary purview of federal law enforcement.for those reasons,the government asserted that the cooperation did not warrant a variance.following this colloquy,the district court stated okay,thanks.anything else there was no reply from either party instead each side summed up its position on sentencing.on completion of the summations,the district court proceeded to sentence flores mejia to months in prison.defense counsel did not at that time object to the court failure to rule on the request for variance based on the alleged cooperation,nor did she point out the district court failure to explicitly address or give further consideration to that argument.
flores mejia appealed,contending that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to sufficiently consider his argument that his attempts at cooperation warranted a lower sentence.based on our decision in sevilla,a divided panel of this court agreed.united states flores mejia,app x cir.we then granted en banc review.
ii.preserving a claim of procedural error for appeal 
in united states gunter,cir,we set forth a threestep framework for sentencing.first,a district court must calculate a defendant guidelines sentence as it would have before united states booker,d.gunter,at.second,a district court must formally rule on the motions of both parties and state on the record whether they are granting a departure and how that departure affects the guidelines calculation,and take into account our circuit case law,which continues to have advisory force.id.citation,quotation marks and alterations omitted.third,a district court is required to exercise its discretion by considering the relevant a factors in setting the sentence it imposes regardless whether it varies from the sentence calculated under the guidelines.id.internal citation,quotation marks,and alterations omitted.
to satisfy step three,the district court must acknowledge and respond to any properly presented sentencing argument which has colorable legal merit and a factual basis.united states begin,cir.failure to give meaningful consideration to any such argument renders a sentence procedurally unreasonable which,when appealed,generally requires a remand for resentencing.id.internal citation omitted.
this error of failure to give meaningful consideration must be brought to the district court attention through an objection.if a defendant fails to preserve the error for appeal by objecting,the authority of the court of appeals to remedy the error is strictly circumscribed.puckett united states,d.however,rule b of the federal rules of criminal procedure provides for limited relief a plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court attention.
the issue in this appeal is whether,in order to preserve the objection for appeal and to avert plain error review,a defendant must object after the sentence is pronounced to the district court failure to meaningfully consider his argument in sevilla,we held that the district court failure to address those issues when sentence was pronounced did not require sevilla to them to avert plain error review of these omissions.sevilla,at.however,for the reasons that follow,we now hold that a defendant must raise any procedural objection to his sentence at the time the procedural error is made,when sentence is imposed without the court having given meaningful review to the objection.until sentence is imposed,the error has not been committed.at the time that sentence is imposed,if the objection is made,the court has the opportunity to rectify any error by giving meaningful review to the argument.
we are adopting this new rule for several reasons.first,we are dealing with a procedural objection to the sentencing process.we must appreciate the difference between a challenge to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence and a challenge to its procedural reasonableness.while a substantive objection to the sentence that a court will impose is noted when made and need not be repeated after sentencing,a procedural objection is to the form that the sentencing procedure has taken,a court failure to give meaningful review to a defendant substantive arguments.see united states judge,cir.unlike a substantive objection to a sentence,a procedural defect in a sentence may not occur until the sentence is pronounced,and,unless the objection is meaningfully dealt with earlier,no challenge to the sufficiency of the court explanation can be made until that time.simply put,a defendant has no occasion to object to the district court inadequate explanation of the sentence until the district court has inadequately explained the sentence.thus,the procedural objection can be raised for the first time only after the sentence is pronounced without adequate explanation 
second,we are satisfied that there are compelling reasons why objecting to procedural error after the sentence is pronounced would promote judicial efficiency.objecting when sentence is pronounced permits the quick resolution of such errors.as the supreme court observed,errors are a constant in the trial process,and when a defendant contemporaneously objects,the district court can often correct or avoid the mistake so that it can not possibly affect the ultimate outcome.puckett,at citation and quotation marks omitted see also united states merced,cir t he sentencing judge,not the court of appeals,is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under a in the individual case.internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states tomko,cir en banc.contemporaneous objection also advances the public interest because r equiring the error to be preserved by an objection creates incentives for the parties to help the district court meet its obligations to the public and the parties.united states villafuerte,cir.by encouraging defendants to make objections before the court which is best equipped to resolve the errors efficiently and effectively,we are promoting better sentencing practices.
third,requiring that the procedural objection be made at the time of sentencing prevents sandbagging of the court by a defendant who remains silent about his objection to the explanation of the sentence,only to belatedly raise the error on appeal if the case does not conclude in his favor.see,puckett,at.
our new rule is consistent with the holdings of most other circuit courts of appeals that have ruled on the issue.the first,fifth,sixth,eighth,ninth,tenth,and circuit courts of appeals all require a defendant to object when sentence is pronounced if a district court makes the procedural error of failing to adequately explain a sentence.see,united states davila gonzalez,cir united states mondragon santiago,cir united states vonner,cir en banc united states rice,cir united states rangel,cir united states romero,cir united states wilson.
only the fourth circuit court of appeals does not consistently require the challenge to be raised immediately following the imposition of the sentence by the district court.united states lynn,cir.the court in lynn reasoned that rule does not require a litigant to complain about a judicial choice after it has been made.id.at quoting united states bartlett,cir in reaching its decision,the court in lynn warned that r equiring a party to lodge an explicit objection after the district court explanation would saddle busy district courts with the burden of sitting through an objection probably formulaic in every criminal case.lynn,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
under the rule we adopt,there will of course be an objection to a district court failure to give meaningful consideration to a procedural error in sentencing but it is hardly a significant impediment to the efficient administration of justice.sentencing is a complex process,and a district judge at sentencing must meet numerous requirements.an objection at sentencing,even if sometimes,serves the important purpose of reminding the judge of these requirements and allowing the judge to immediately remedy omissions or clarify and supplement inadequate explanations.the rule adopted in lynn and in sevilla imposes a greater burden on busy district courts by depriving them of contemporaneous notice of errors and of the opportunity to correct them.the burden of sitting through an objection at sentencing pales in comparison to the time and resources required to correct errors through a lengthy appeal and resentencing our strong interest in judicial economy,heightened in these times of fiscal restraint and judicial budgetary concerns,weighs heavily in favor of a rule under which the defendant must contemporaneously object to concerns regarding the procedural reasonableness of a sentence.
for these reasons,we hold that,in a criminal prosecution,unless a relevant objection has been made earlier,a party must object to a procedural error after the sentence is pronounced in order to preserve the error and avoid plain error review 
iii.the merits of the appeal 
we have determined that,in order to preserve for appeal the issue of the lack of meaningful consideration of his argument on mitigation,flores mejia should have objected after sentence was pronounced.he did not,and thus,under the rule we now adopt,he did not preserve the issue for appeal.an unpreserved issue is reviewed for plain error.an error is plain if it is clear or obvious,affects substantial rights,and affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states dragon,cir quoting united states olano,d.an error affects substantial rights when it is prejudicial,that is,when it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.id.quoting olano,at see also united states marcus,d.
because defendants sentenced before the issuance of this opinion had not been warned that they had a duty to object to the sentencing court procedural error after sentencing,we will not apply this new rule retroactively and will,instead,review for abuse of discretion.applying that standard,we have held that a district court abuses its discretion when it fails to give meaningful consideration to an argument advanced by the defendant.
although it a close issue,we conclude that the court question ok,thanks.anything else is not on this record sufficient to reflect that meaningful consideration was given to flores mejia cooperation argument.the circumstances here are very near those we faced in sevilla,in which we held that the district court general statement that it had considered all the a factors was not enough to show meaningful consideration of a specific argument.while the question put by the district court here,in the context of the colloquy as a whole,might be read to reflect that the court had heard and considered the specific argument about cooperation,there was no specific ruling provided by the court or any other effort to address the argument.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we will vacate the sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.
i agree with the majority that it would be unjust to employ the court new rule retroactively,and that we must therefore apply the rule articulated in united states sevilla,cir,to the case at hand.furthermore,i agree that the record before us does not suggest that the district court meaningfully considered flores mejia cooperation argument.therefore,i concur in the decision to remand for resentencing.
but like the dissenters,i continue to believe that sevilla should be applied not just to those sentenced before today opinion,but also going forward.as judge greenaway notes in his compelling opinion,such an outcome is dictated by the plain language of rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.
in our system of jurisprudence,we examine our principle,consider the facts and the law and make decisions.the venerable principle of stare decisis requires reexamination not when we come up with a better mouse trap but when there is a principled basis for change.see arizona rumsey,d a ny departure from the doctrine of stare decisis demands special justification.planned parenthood of se.pennsylvania casey,d the obligation to follow precedent begins with necessity,and a contrary necessity marks its outer limit at the other extreme,a different necessity would make itself felt if a prior judicial ruling should come to be seen so clearly as error that its enforcement was for that very reason doomed.indeed,the very point of stare decisis is to forbid us from revisiting a debate every time there are reasonable arguments to be made on both sides.morrow balaski,cir smith,concurring.
our court,in a unanimous precedential opinion,adopted a procedure for district courts to follow at sentencing a scant six years ago.see united states sevilla,cir.now,without intervening supreme court precedent and without a majority of our sister courts,we not only reexamine but indeed create a new procedure that flies in the face of federal rule of criminal procedure,with no compulsion or mandate to do so.
in its attempt to promote judicial economy,the majority ignores the plain language of rule,misreads the state of the law of our sister circuits and invokes a fundamental change to our sentencing procedures that is both unwarranted and difficult to square with the supreme court jurisprudence.for this reason,i respectfully dissent
