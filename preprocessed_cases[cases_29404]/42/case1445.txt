mohammad arif sardar appeals the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia,affirming the immigration judge ij denial of his application for asylum and withholding of deportation,and denying his motion to reopen the proceedings for consideration under article of the united nations convention against torture cat.for the reasons elaborated below,we will deny the petition for review in its entirety.
shardar is a native and citizen of bangladesh who entered the united states on august,using a false passport.shardar applied for asylum in,alleging he was persecuted on the basis of his political opinion for his membership in the jatiyo political party.jatiyo is the party of army chief of staff general ershad,who seized power and declared himself president in december.in the face of widespread opposition,ershad was forced to resign in december,and in a february election the bangladesh nationalist party bnp won a parliamentary plurality and formed the government.
the primary basis for shardar asylum claim stems from events surrounding his participation,on january,in an allegedly peaceful demonstration in jatrabari in bangladesh.shardar was arrested and charged with having weapons and explosives,allegations that shardar stated were c ompletely false.at.shardar testified that following his arrest,he was held in jail and beaten with canes and kicked in the face.while he was beaten his interrogators shouted,ershad time is over.now is,is bnp time.id.at.shardar claimed he was forced to confess that he had weapons and explosives,and to proclaim that he would never be with the party again,in order to stop the beatings and save his life.id.at.
after three days in the police station and almost six days in jail,shardar went before a judge.shardar father paid for a lawyer.the judge,whom shardar described as pretty nice,id.at,released him on bail of local taka,which his father paid.following his release,shardar father took him to a private medical clinic for nineteen days.
shardar then went to work for a chinese restaurant in dhaka,bangladesh.he testified that the police came looking for him on several occasions,and therefore he had to leave the job,his home,and his wife.id.at.shardar conceded,however,that the police came after a warrant was issued for his arrest because of his failure to appear in court.id.at.
in addition to shardar testimony,documentary evidence was introduced,including a police report and charge sheet pertaining to his arrest,the record of proceedings in the court of chief metropolitan magistrate,and an arrest warrant issued on may,providing that shardar after having posted bail,abscond ed,id.at.shardar also submitted letters from the clinic where he was treated following his release,his lawyer,an associate from the jatiyo party,and an accounting firm.see id.at.
of particular relevance is the police report,which characterizes the protestors as violent and suggests shardar was a leader in the hostile activities.the report explains,in pertinent part 
t hey were delivering defamatory,detractive and slanderous slowgans sic against the present gov ernment we then and there made an importunate entreaty to them not to deliver such types of slowgans sic for which they got infuriated and being armed with deadly weapons made a sudden invasion on us.they exploded some bombs at the spot one after another.many padestrians sic were lethally injured.we to control this predicament sic situation used tear gas to disperse them but they became more furious and begun sic to throw brickbats on us.we having found no other way advanced with fortitute sic to arrest them and.arif sardar sic accussed arrested by us,under whose leadership this occurrence was occurred and the other skedaddled from the spot 
on july,the immigration judge ij denied shardar application for asylum and withholding of removal,while granting the application for voluntary departure.the ij concluded that although the respondent is credible,he has in no way met his burden of proof.id.at.the ij explained that t here is a complete grand canyon of difference between persecution and a fear of prosecution.id.the ij rejected the suggestion that the only reason he was arrested was because he was a supporter of the jatiya party.id.at.rather,the ij pointed to the documentary evidence that the demonstration was violent.noting that shardar had failed to file newspaper articles or other objective evidence supporting his account of the demonstration,the ij explained that i t is equally plausible,in fact more plausible than not given the evidence supplied by the respondent,that the respondent had been involved in inciting a demonstration that turned violent and that the police were mad as could be.id.at.
the ij noted that shardar did not provide evidence that the judicial process might be corrupted rather,the state department report indicates that members of the jatiyo party enjoy the same judicial rights as other bangladeshis.the state department bangladesh profile of asylum claims and country conditions state department profile provides,in pertinent part 
there is some evidence that prominent jatiyo party members and or supporters were harassed by the bnp government between and.these individuals were able to defend themselves in court actions and have the same judicial rights as other bangladeshis.the harassment experienced by some high level jatiyo party members is not sufficient to justify the conclusion that jatiyo party membership in itself accounted for severe mistreatment.
the ij concluded that while arguably shardar was persecuted in the past when he was beaten at the police station,the changed circumstances rebut or defeat any potential presumption of a fear of future persecution.id.at.the ij elaborated that t he obvious and evident changed circumstances are that the respondent was released on a bond and obviously the police did respect the respondent and left him alone the fact that the police came by later in time looking for the respondent is clearly all because the respondent failed to appear in court and the police were executing a warrant id.the ij also referenced the state department profile for the proposition that country conditions for people who are in the jatiya party have radically changed.id.at 
on march,the board of immigration appeals bia,exercising jurisdiction under b,affirmed the ij decision.the bia explained that shardar had failed to meet the burden of proof for establishing asylum because 
w hile violence is a feature of the political process in bangladesh,we have no reason to conclude that the prosecution the respondent may face if he returns to bangladesh is politically motivated,and there is no reason to find that he would be unable to establish his claimed innocence.
moreover,the bia denied shardar request to reopen the proceeding for consideration under the cat,concluding that he had failed to establish prima facie eligibility for relief under the convention.id.however,the bia agreed that shardar should be entitled to voluntarily depart.id.at.
this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a.we conclude that the bia properly denied the petition for asylum and the petition to remand the proceedings for consideration under the cat.
shardar argues that the bia erred in denying his application for political asylum,particularly since the ij found his testimony credible.the attorney general has discretion to grant asylum if the petitioner demonstrates that he meets the immigration and nationality act ina definition of refugee that he is unable or unwilling to return to his home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a see dia ashcroft,cir.
a showing of past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of a fear of future persecution.mulanga ashcroft,cir citing b abdulrahman ashcroft,cir.the presumption,however,is rebutted where the government establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the applicant could reasonably avoid persecution by relocating to another part of his or her country or that conditions in the applicant country have changed so a
