pablo appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,buchwald,convicting him,after a guilty plea,of violating by unlawfully entering the united states after having been removed in the district court,moved to withdraw his guilty plea and dismiss the indictment.he argued that he was prejudiced by the fundamental unfairness of his removal proceeding and thus his removal properly could not form an element of the criminal offense to which he had pled guilty.
the district court held that the removal proceeding was not fundamentally unfair because could not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by any deficiencies in the proceeding.the district court concluded that there was no reasonable likelihood that would have escaped removal even if he had appealed the removal order and been granted a new hearing.based on this holding,the district court denied motion to withdraw his guilty plea and his motion to dismiss the indictment.the district court then sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of months with two years supervised release,and imposed a mandatory assessment of.as part of its sentencing calculation,the district court enhanced offense level by sixteen,concluding that his prior conviction in new york state of attempted robbery in the third degree constituted a violent felony under sentencing guidelines b a.
on appeal,contends that his removal proceeding was fundamentally unfair because it suffered from procedural flaws and thus he is entitled to relief on collateral review.he also claims that the district court incorrectly enhanced his sentence.we find no merit in either claim.
in order to obtain relief on collateral review,had to demonstrate prejudice resulting from procedural flaws in his removal proceeding.the district court correctly determined that he had failed to do so.the district court also did not err in enhancing sentence.therefore,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
is a citizen of the dominican republic.he illegally entered the united states prior to and remained here until.on april,was arrested for attempted robbery in the third degree.he was released on bail but failed to appear at a scheduled court conference.in late,was arrested for selling cocaine to an undercover narcotics officer.he avoided prosecution for the narcotics charges by pleading guilty to disorderly conduct.he also pleaded guilty to attempted robbery in the third degree and attempted bail jumping in the first degree in connection with the robbery.on december,he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year.
about one week later,immigration and naturalization service ins officers visited and interviewed the incarcerated.at the second of these visits he was given ins form,entitled,notice of rights and request for disposition.although the notice of rights was printed in english,an ins officer read it to in his native spanish.the notice of rights provided,in pertinent part you have the right to a hearing before the immigration court to determine whether you may remain in the united stated sic upon your request,the officer who gave you this notice will provide you with a list of free legal organizations that may represent you for free or for a small fee.although the box for i request a hearing before the immigration court is marked,refused to initial next to the box to indicate his assent to that request and also refused to sign the form.
on january,the ins served with ins form,a notice to appear at an ins removal hearing.the notice to appear charged with being in the united states without being admitted or paroled by an immigration officer.the form was printed in english,although an ins officer read it to in spanish.the notice to appear informed that he would be provided a list of qualified attorneys who might be available to represent him without charge.a review of immigration indicates that the ins officers failed to include this attorney list with the notice to appear.the notice to appear also provided at the conclusion of your hearing,you have a right to appeal an adverse decision by the immigration judge.requested an immediate hearing.
the ins transferred him from new york city to york,pennsylvania for his immigration hearing.on january,signed a form entitled,request for expedited order.the form presents a series of questions in both english and spanish,although only the english answers on form are circled.by the circled answers,expressed his desire to be removed from the united states,stated that he did not intend to ask the immigration judge to redetermine his bond,that he had not yet been seen by an immigration judge,and had not yet been ordered removed.
on january,appeared before immigration judge walter durling with approximately twelve other aliens as part of a group deportation or removal hearing.at the beginning of the hearing,the judge addressed the group as follows 
good.okay.now i the only one talking.if you talk and i do,i not talking to you.i postpone your case and have you reappear next month.this way we can get this over with as quickly as possible and you can be on your way.now it my understanding that all you gentlemen are here today because you going to,you willing to accept orders of deportation.it the only thing i doing today.if you think that this hearing is for something else,kindly raise your hand.no one has raised their hand.now by being here today at this particular hearing you are giving up certain rights that you would otherwise have had.you are giving up your right,first of all,to be represented by a lawyer at no expense to the united states government you are giving up your right to have the united states government prove to me that you unlawfully in the united states.you are also giving up your right to have me,the judge,figure out if there is any way for you lawfully to remain in this country now my decision today will be a final decision,you will not have a right to appeal my order,you do not have it by being here today.now after telling you all of these rights that you are giving up,is there anyone here that wants to change their mind just raise your hand if you want to change your mind.
none of the aliens raised a hand.
the immigration judge then proceeded to question the members of the group individually.the judge asked if he was a citizen or national of the united states,when he had last entered the united states and whether he had been inspected by an immigration official at the time of this entry.disclosed that he had been convicted of attempted robbery and bail jumping.when the judge told that he was going to be deported,asked,how long will it take,like what i want to do is to leave it sic right away.on february,was removed from the united states to the dominican republic.
on or about october,an ins special agent arrested pursuant to an indictment charging him as a deported alien who has reentered the country in violation of a and b.on january,fernandez antonia entered a guilty plea before the united states district court for the southern district of new york.on june,requested and received time from the district court to pursue possible claims of legal deficiencies in his removal order.he then moved to withdraw his guilty plea and dismiss the indictment.on november,the district court denied both motions.on january,the district court sentenced to a term of imprisonment of months and two years supervised release.
timely filed this appeal.
discussion 
on appeal,argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and denying him an evidentiary hearing under federal rule of criminal procedure e despite his substantiated claim of legal innocence,the trial judge erred in denying his underlying motion to dismiss the indictment based on his collateral attack of the prior deportation order,and his prior conviction for attempted robbery in the third degree does not constitute an aggravated felony under guidelines b a and therefore he should not have received a upward adjustment in his offense level.
motion to withdraw the guilty plea 
motions to withdraw guilty pleas before sentencing are governed by federal rule of criminal procedure e.united states torres,cir.e states that the court may permit the plea to be withdrawn if the defendant shows any fair and just reason.a defendant does not enjoy an unfettered right to withdraw his guilty plea.united states williams,cir.we review a district court denial of a defendant motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion.united states hernandez,cir per curiam citing united states maher,cir.
in determining whether a fair and just reason exists to justify withdrawal of a guilty plea,a district court should consider the time lapse between the plea and the motion and whether the government would be prejudiced by a withdrawal of the plea.united states grimes,cir per curiam quoting torres,at.however,the government need not demonstrate prejudice where the defendant fails to show sufficient grounds to justify withdrawal of the plea.torres,at.
the district court allowed that motion to withdraw his plea was neither a strategy for delay nor prejudicial to the government.however,the district court determined that its decision on the motion would depend on the validity of underlying claim that the removal proceeding was fundamentally unfair.the district court then determined that claim of prejudice resulting from flaws in the removal hearing did not constitute sufficient grounds to merit a withdrawal of his plea.
claims that the district court erred in collapsing his motion to dismiss the indictment into his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.he argues that the district court should have ruled on the viability of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and then returned the case to a pretrial stage where could then conduct a hearing or a factfinding inquiry to attempt to prove the prejudice necessary to dismiss the indictment.this argument is without merit.
the notice of motion addressed to the district court stated that would move the district court for an order i withdrawing fernandez previously entered guilty plea and ii dismissing the indictment against.the memorandum of law in support of motions is titled memorandum of law in support of pablo pretrial motions and the substance of the memorandum in fact,of the pages devoted to argument is headed this court should dismiss the indictment because fernandez deportation is invalid.
blames a confused method of proceeding for his decision to address both the guilty plea and the dismissal of indictment arguments in the same motion.he argues that it resulted in the district court giving short shrift to his argument for dismissal of the indictment.it appears,however,that the district court gave more than adequate attention to arguments regarding the allegedly inadequate removal.in fact,the district court assumed that the procedural violations alleged by rendered the removal order inadequate.it then attempted to ascertain what possible prejudice had befallen because of these assumed procedural inadequacies.
admitted sole basis for withdrawing his guilty plea was the alleged invalidity of his removal.if the district court assumed that the removal proceeding was procedurally flawed and yet found that it was not fundamentally unfair,the court justifiably could not have granted the motion to withdraw the guilty plea.see,united states crown,wl,at,aff,cir.it is therefore appropriate to determine the adequacy of the district court holding with respect to the merits of motion to dismiss the indictment.because we hold that the district court was correct in its assessment of motion to dismiss the indictment,there could have been no fair and just reason for to withdraw his guilty plea and the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.see.e.
ii.motion to dismiss the indictment 
argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment.specifically,he argues that the district court incorrectly limited its consideration solely to the issue of whether there was a reasonable likelihood that he could have escaped deportation.
we review de novo the district court denial of motion to dismiss the indictment,as it entails mixed questions of law and fact.see fdic providence,cir noting that mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed de novo united states,cir implicitly employing a de novo review in a collateral challenge united states fares,cir same see also united states,cir explicitly employing a de novo standard of review in a collateral challenge.
although the supreme court has not specifically delineated the procedural safeguards to be accorded aliens in deportation or removal hearings,it is well settled that the procedures employed must satisfy due process.see shaughnessy united states ex rel.mezei.a liens who have once passed through our gates,even illegally,may be expelled only after proceedings conforming to traditional standards of fairness encompassed in due process of law.d ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.doe simon,cir quoting morrissey brewer,d.because removal proceedings are civil rather than criminal,various due process protections normally associated with criminal trials are not required.see ins,d united states valdez,cir.
in united states,d,the supreme court held that an alien could collaterally challenge the validity of a deportation order when the order is being used to form the element of a criminal offense and the alien has been denied any possibility of judicial review.see id.at.the court alluded to procedural defects that are so fundamental that they may functionally deprive the alien of judicial review,but refused to delineate what those procedural defects might be.id.at.
congress effectively codified the holding in by amending as follows 
a n alien may not challenge the validity of a deportation order unless the alien demonstrates that the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.
d.the requirements are conjunctive,and thus must establish all three in order to succeed in his challenge to his removal order.
argues that the immigration judge violated established ins rules by failing to ascertain properly whether he made a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel or his right to appeal an adverse decision.he also argues that the immigration judge erred in not instructing him that he would have been eligible for discretionary relief.contends that these failings satisfy the first two requirements of d,and the district court assumed as much.we need not decide whether his contention is correct,because we hold that he has failed to meet the final requirement,a showing that the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.d.
an alien is entitled to a new deportation hearing whenever he shows on direct appeal that a regulation is promulgated to protect a fundamental right derived from the constitution or a federal statute,and the ins fails to adhere to it.waldron ins,cir see also montilla ins,cir.this is true even if the rules provide more procedural protections than would be required under the fifth amendment due process clause.see id.at citing morton ruiz,d.no showing of prejudice to the alien is required.see waldron,at.
argues for just such a rule on collateral review.he argues that if he can demonstrate that his removal proceeding suffered from a fundamental procedural flaw,his removal order should automatically be invalidated.such a result is contrary to principles established by circuit precedent.
for an alien to succeed in collaterally attacking his deportation order,he must show not only that he was effectively deprived of his right of direct appeal,but also that the administrative proceedings were fundamentally unfair in some respect that would have entitled him to relief on direct appeal.fares,at accord,at.
in united states fares,we explained that the supreme court in did not inquire specifically whether the alien in that case had been prejudiced by the procedural inadequacies of the he
