this appeal arises from a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia or board to dismiss a motion by petitioner,cornel viorel scorteanu scorteanu,to reopen deportation proceedings pursuant to section c of the immigration and nationality act ina or act,c,alleging ineffective assistance of counsel for the reasons discussed below,the board order of dismissal is affirmed.
background 
petitioner scorteanu is a native and citizen of romania,of hungarian ethnicity,who entered the united states at chicago,illinois on june,as a visitor for pleasure.his visa authorized him to remain in the united states until december.on september,petitioner applied for asylum.the chicago asylum office referred his application to an immigration judge ij.petitioner was served with an order to show cause osc,dated september,charging deportability as an overstay under section a c i of the ina.during the pendency of his merits hearing,petitioner married a united states citizen.
petitioner retained attorney ronald muresan muresan to represent him in his asylum case.on april,scorteanu appeared with muresan before an ij for a master calendar hearing where petitioner renewed his asylum application and the ij scheduled an individual merits hearing for november.on november,muresan informed petitioner by telephone that the immigration court had rescheduled the merits hearing and would send muresan a written notice of a new date.attorney muresan received a letter,dated november,by certified mail from the immigration court,advising that scorteanu deportation hearing was rescheduled for march.muresan never advised petitioner of the new hearing date,nor did he file the requested notice of petitioner change of address with the immigration court.in the months that followed,scorteanu contacted muresan several times regarding notice of a new hearing date and,each time,muresan informed petitioner that he would notify petitioner when he received the new hearing date.
unbeknownst to scorteanu,during this period,muresan was suspended and eventually disbarred from the practice of law.muresan did not advise petitioner of this development nor inform the immigration court of his suspension.as a consequence of muresan representation,petitioner did not receive a copy of the hearing notice and neither scorteanu nor muresan attended the march,merits hearing where,consequently,petitioner was ordered deported in absentia to romania.during and muresan fraudulently advised scorteanu that his asylum case was still pending before the immigration court.in early,scorteanu learned from members of the romanian community in michigan that muresan had been disbarred.
scorteanu then turned to attorney mosabi hamed.previously,after his marriage to a united states citizen,petitioner had retained hamed to handle his immigrant petition for alien relative.throughout,scorteanu kept in contact with hamed regarding his asylum petition even though hamed was not petitioner attorney of record for those proceedings.hamed continued to advise scorteanu that he had inquired into petitioner asylum case and assured him that it was still pending 
on january,scorteanu retained new counsel.as a result of his new counsel inquiry with the immigration and naturalization service ins,petitioner learned of the in absentia order of deportation of march,in late march of nevertheless,scorteanu waited until february,to file a motion to reopen deportation proceedings with the immigration court.for that proceeding scorteanu submitted his own affidavit and an affidavit from former attorney muresan detailing his ineffective assistance of counsel.
in denying scorteanu motion to reopen,the ij determined in her march,order that petitioner had exceeded the statutory time limit of days for filing a motion to reopen based on exceptional circumstances pursuant to ina c a.see matter of,int.bia.the ij further observed that attorney muresan acknowledged receipt of notice for the march,deportation hearing met the statutory requirements of the act.see ina a.finally,the court addressed,sua sponte,the effect of muresan fraud,noting even assuming arguendo that the petitioner had some basis to assert a claim for tolling of the days,more than that period elapsed between actual notice of the entry of the court order and the filing of the instant motion.
scorteanu petitioned for review of the ij denial before the bia on april.the bia returned a dismissal of petitioner appeal on november.the board noted that petitioner motion was filed well beyond the day statutory time limit pursuant to c a of the act.the board also addressed the ij sua sponte consideration of the possibility of equitable tolling of the day time limit,observing that such equitable relief was unavailable when a party,such as the petitioner,failed to exercise due diligence on his own behalf,filing the recision motion almost a year after actual notice.scorteanu then perfected this timely appeal.
jurisdiction over this petition is conferred upon this court by section of the immigration and nationality act,as it existed immediately prior to april,the effective date of the illegal immigration reform and responsibility act of iirira.
ii.analysis 
the court reviews the denial of a motion to reopen deportation proceedings for abuse of discretion.see ins doherty,d ashki ins,cir see also ins abudu,d.
pursuant to section c of the act,the ij and the bia are permitted as a matter of discretion to rescind an in absentia order of deportation under limited circumstances.see sharma ins,cir.an in absentia order of deportation may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he or she did not receive notice in accordance with the requirements in section a of the act.c b.alternatively,an in absentia order may be rescinded upon a motion to reopen filed within days of the date of the deportation order if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances as defined in subsection f of this section.c a.thus,in seeking recision of an in absentia deportation order,the burden rests on the movant to demonstrate either improper notice or exceptional circumstances.see giday ins.
scorteanu has,first,averred that section c b of the act permitted him to file a motion to reopen the in absentia order of deportation at any time because he failed to receive notice of the hearing.petitioner has specifically contended that the language of section c b requires notice of a scheduled deportation hearing to the alien while making notice to the alien attorney insufficient,because section c b refers to notice to the alien,rather than to the alien or the alien counsel.a brief examination of the applicable statutory language reveals the inadequacy of petitioner contention.
section c b of the act directs that an in absentia,
order may be rescinded only 
b upon a motion to reopen filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with subsection a or the alien demonstrates that the alien was in federal or state custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien.
c b.the referenced subsection a of the act provides as follows 
in deportation proceedings under section 
a written notice shall be given in person to the alien or,if personal service is not practicable,written notice shall be given by certified mail to the alien or to the alien counsel of record,if any,in the order to show cause or otherwise,
b in the case of any change or postponement in the time and place of such proceedings,written notice shall be given in person to the alien or,if personal service is not practicable,written notice shall be given by certified mail to the alien or to the alien counsel of record,if any 
petitioner has admitted that attorney muresan,his then counsel of record,received proper certified notification of the march,hearing.because c b provides for reopening of in absentia proceedings only as a remedy for improper service,relief under this section is unavailable to scorteanu.see dobrota ins,cir maintaining that makes clear that a n alien does not have to actually receive notice of a deportation hearing in order for the
