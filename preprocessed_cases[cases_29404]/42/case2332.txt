abdul khan is a native and citizen of pakistan who entered the united states with his family in.they remained here after their visitors visas expired,and in khan applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.his family members are derivative applicants.an immigration judge ij heard the claims and denied relief,concluding that khan asylum application was untimely and the delay was not excused by extraordinary circumstances that khan failed to show he had suffered politically motivated persecution in pakistan and that khan had failed to show a clear probability that he would be persecuted or tortured if he returned to pakistan.
the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed.khan then moved to reopen,presenting what he characterized as new evidence about his physical and mental condition that he claimed undermined the ij decisions.the bia declined to reopen the case.khan asks us to review each of these decisions.
we dismiss in part and deny in part the petitions for review.under a,we lack jurisdiction to review the bia determinations that khan asylum claim was untimely and the delay was not excused by extraordinary circumstances.the real id act of,a ii,stat,permits judicial review of constitutional claims or questions of law khan challenges to the immigration agency timeliness and extraordinary circumstances determinations address only factual and discretionary issues and therefore lie outside our review jurisdiction.see vasile gonzales,cir.we also conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency denial of withholding of removal and protection against removal under the cat.finally,to the extent we have jurisdiction to review the denial of khan motion to reopen,we conclude that the bia did not abuse its discretion in determining that khan new evidence was neither new nor material.
background 
khan is a mohajir,a term used to describe pakistanis of indian descent.because mohajirs faced difficulties competing with other pakistanis for jobs and political influence,some mohajirs joined the mohajir quami movement mqm,an organization ostensibly devoted to expanding the influence of its members.khan joined the mqm in and assumed an active role in the organization he assisted the party by distributing flyers,making speeches,transporting voters to polls,raising funds,and displaying political signs.
beginning in the early,some elements of the mqm began turning to violence as a means of achieving the organization goals.khan brother,a former mqm member,was beaten by the organization when he refused to follow mqm orders to kidnap a political opponent he later fled to england.the mqm violent turn and the mistreatment of his brother prompted khan to resign from the organization he told mqm members he needed to care for his ill father.nevertheless,khan continued to provide monthly financial support to the mqm.
khan first came to the united states in june after the pakistani government falsely arrested him and detained him for nearly two days khan returned to pakistan days later when he learned his father had suffered a heart attack.upon his return,mqm members began harassing him.for example,when khan explained that he needed to care for his ailing father,an mqm member threatened to kill khan father.later,in december,khan and his family were carjacked by men khan said he recognized as mqm members.khan was warned not to report the crime to the police,but he did so anyway.
the cumulative impact of these events prompted khan to make arrangements to leave pakistan.he quit his job in december and came to the united states by himself in february to prepare for his family relocation.however,khan returned to pakistan in march because his youngest daughter was ill.back in pakistan,khan asked police about the progress of the investigation into his stolen car.he believes mqm members saw him go to the police,and in may khan was abducted by the mqm and held for nearly three days.during his detention,his captors accused him of reporting their activities to the police,severely beat him and threatened to kill him,and warned him never to speak to the police again.for emphasis,they showed him a box containing severed fingers.khan family notified authorities about his abduction,but khan never filed a complaint about the kidnapping with the police or reported it to the medical personnel who treated his injuries after his release.
this incident finally convinced khan to move his family to the united states.khan entered this country in june with his wife and two daughters,and they overstayed their visitors visas.khan had little trouble obtaining numerous jobs,renting an apartment,and supporting his family.but khan friends noticed that his experiences in pakistan caused him to develop symptoms of depression,avoid social contact,and have difficulty making decisions.
one of khan friends urged him to apply for asylum based on his mistreatment by the mqm,but khan waited several years to pursue that option.in june the attorney general announced the national security registration system,which required aliens from certain countries including pakistan to register with immigration officials.see registration and monitoring of certain.this development prompted khan to apply for asylum,and in march several months before he was required to register and nearly five years after arriving in the united states he submitted an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection against removal under the cat.
in may an ij denied all of khan applications.the asylum claim had been filed well beyond the time limit established by a b,and the ij rejected it as untimely.khan asserted that he did not know about the deadline and that his poor mental depression and fear of being returned to his ability to timely file for asylum.he argued that these were the sort of extraordinary circumstances that should excuse the late filing under a d,but the ij disagreed.turning to khan claim,the ij questioned the credibility of certain aspects of khan testimony but nonetheless accepted it the ij held that the attacks were not sufficiently severe to be considered persecution and were not motivated by khan political beliefs.the ij also rejected khan claim of an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution.finally,the ij concluded that khan had not shown it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he were removed to pakistan.accordingly,the ij entered an order of removal.the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision,and khan filed a petition for review.
while khan petition for review was still in the briefing stage,he asked the bia to reopen his removal proceeding based on what he claimed was new with additional mental health his allegation that his mental anguish should excuse his untimely asylum application.khan also argued that the reports addressed the ij skepticism about the credibility of certain aspects of his testimony.the bia denied the motion to reopen,holding that the new evidence was merely repetitious and did not provide a basis for upsetting the ij determinations.the bia noted that the ij had accepted khan testimony about the assaults and the medical reports did not undermine the ij alternative conclusion that the attacks were not motivated by political opinion.khan filed a petition for review of this decision as well,and we ordered the petitions consolidated.
ii.discussion 
asylum claim 
khan first challenges the immigration agency failure to reach the merits of his asylum claim.the ij dismissed khan asylum application because it was not filed within a year after khan arrived in the united states as required by a b.the ij had the discretion to ignore this deadline if khan established that his delay was due to extraordinary circumstances,id.a d,but the ij did not think khan presented sufficiently compelling circumstances to excuse his nearly delay.the bia affirmed.khan challenges the agency determination that he lacked extraordinary circumstances for the untimely filing,arguing that the ij did not give appropriate weight to the evidence showing khan suffered from a serious mental disability because of his mistreatment while in pakistan.
the problem for khan is that we lack jurisdiction to review the ij timeliness determination.under a,we have no jurisdiction to review any decision the agency makes under a,including decisions relating to whether the applicant has demonstrated extraordinary circumstances excusing a delay in filing an asylum application.the real id act of preserved our jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law.see a d.but as we explained in vasile gonzales,factual determinations such as whether the asylum application was filed within the deadline and discretionary decisions such as whether the alien has demonstrated extraordinary circumstances justifying the delay do not fall within the exception to the jurisdictional bar for constitutional claims or questions of law under a d.see id.at.
khan urges us to reconsider our holding in vasile.he argues that vasile,which discussed the exception created by the real id act,gave insufficient attention to the legislative history of the act.a closer look at that legislative history,khan claims,demonstrates that congress intended the term questions of law to encompass not only questions of statutory interpretation but also questions concerning the application of law to a set of mixed questions of law and fact.
we decline khan invitation to revisit vasile.section a d provides an application for asylum of an alien may be considered if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the attorney general either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period.emphasis added.the terms may and to the satisfaction of strongly indicate that decisions under a d are,as we said in vasile,inherently discretionary and not reviewable.at.every circuit to consider this issue save one has agreed with our interpretation 
far from supporting khan interpretation,the legislative history accompanying the real id act confirms our reading of the statute.see,at.the house conference report discussing the real id act describes what the term questions of law meant in the statutory provision that would become a d.the report indicates that although congress had considered adding the word pure before questions of law,the modifier was left out because it was understood that a question of law is a question regarding the construction of a statute and therefore t he word pure adds no meaning,at.the report also explains that this provision was designed to permit judicial review over those issues that were historically reviewable on and questions,not discretionary or factual questions.id.
khan suggests nonetheless that congress was trying to incorporate more than constitutional and questions into the phrase questions of law.accepting that congress wanted to maintain judicial review of claims historically reviewable on habeas,khan seizes upon language from ins cyr,d,stating that habeas relief was traditionally available for detentions based on errors of law,including the erroneous application or interpretation of statutes.id.at.emphasis added.the legislative history does suggest that congress drew on cyr when adopting the provision that would become a d,but not for the point khan makes.the conference report indicates congress sought to address the supreme court concern in cyr that the elimination of judicial review over legal issues would raise serious constitutional problems there is nothing to suggest,however,that the phrase questions of law as that term is used in a d includes mixed questions of law and fact.to the contrary,the conference report mentions mixed questions of law and fact as follows when a court is presented with a mixed question of law and fact,the court should analyze it to the extent there are legal elements,but should not review any factual elements,at.
we acknowledge that the line between legal we can discretionary or factual we occasionally difficult to draw.in many cases,such as this one,we can determine our lack of jurisdiction fairly readily because it is clear we are being asked to review either factual determinations or the manner in which the agency weighed the various factors that inform the exercise of its discretion.see,ogayonne mukasey,cir accord xiao ji chen dep t of justice,cir.some discretionary determinations do present underlying,reviewable questions of law,such as those in which the agency is alleged to have applied the wrong legal standard.see tariq keisler,cir recognizing that we retain jurisdiction to determine whether the ij erred in requiring exceptional circumstances instead of extraordinary circumstances.but the jurisdictional bar can not be overcome by trying to shoehorn a factual or discretionary determination into the question of law category or claiming that a question of law exists simply because the agency failed to apply the law,as khan does here vasile,at see also chen,at w hen analysis of the arguments raised by the petition for judicial review reveals that they do not in fact raise any reviewable issues,the petitioner can not overcome this deficiency and secure review by using the rhetoric of a constitutional claim or question of law to disguise what is essentially a quarrel about or the exercise of discretion.
because khan presents a challenge that is merely an objection to the ij factual findings and the balancing of factors in which discretion was exercised,we lack jurisdiction to review it chen,at dismissing for lack of jurisdiction a similar challenge to an untimeliness determination.khan claim that his mental anguish constituted an extraordinary circumstance preventing him from filing a timely asylum application raises no legal issue it is,instead,a quintessentially factual and discretionary issue see,ogayonne,at zeqiri mukasey,cir pavlyk gonzales,cir sokolov gonzales,cir vasile,at.
and cat claims 
there is no jurisdictional bar preventing us from reviewing the ij decision to reject khan and cat claims.where the bia affirms and adopts the decision of the ij,as it did in this case,we review the ij decision as supplemented by the bia.binrashed gonzales,cir.our examination of the agency decision is limited to determining whether its conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.sankoh mukasey,cir.under this extremely deferential standard,we will uphold the agency decision if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.binrashed,at internal quotation marks omitted.reversal is warranted only if the evidence compels a different result,and we will not overturn the agency findings just because we might have reached a different conclusion.balogun ashcroft,cir.
an alien is entitled to withholding of removal under the ina if he can show a clear probability that his life or freedom would be threatened because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b a aung gonzales,cir.similarly,an alien is entitled to protection against removal under the cat if he can show it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if removed.aung,at.although these standards are the same,both impose a more stringent test than the fear standard employed in asylum cases.see firmansjah gonzales,cir.
there are two ways that an alien can show he is entitled to withholding of removal.first,he can show that he was subject to past persecution,which triggers a rebuttable presumption of future persecution.see b irasoc mukasey,cir.second,in the absence of any evidence of past persecution,an alien can show that it is more likely than not that he will suffer future persecution if removed.see b binrashed,at.we have said that persecution entails punishment or the infliction of harm for political,religious,or other reasons that this country does not recognize as legitimate.de souza ins,cir.and while persecution can be established from a single particularly vicious incident,see dandan ashcroft,cir,not every example of mistreatment rises to the level of persecution,see nakibuka gonzales,cir an asylum applicant need not show that her life or freedom were th
