petitioner javier perez palafox perez palafox,a citizen of mexico and a lawful permanent resident,petitions for review of the decision of the board of immigration of appeals bia vacating the withholding of removal relief granted to perez palafox by the immigration judge ij.the bia concluded that perez palafox was not eligible for withholding of removal because his conviction for transportation of methamphetamine in violation of california health safety code a constituted a particularly serious crime.
as we later explain,we have jurisdiction pursuant to a to review the bia determination that perez palafox committed a particularly serious crime.see pechenkov holder,cir.because the bia did not engage in improper factfinding,we deny the petition for review.
background 
perez palafox is a native and citizen of mexico who was admitted to the united states as an immigrant at the age of six.sixteen years later,on april,perez palafox was convicted in a california state court of the felony offense of possession for sale of a controlled substance in violation of california health safety code cal.h s code and sentenced to three years probation,with the first days to be spent in county jail.five days after his conviction,perez palafox obtained the status of lawful permanent resident.
on april,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued a notice to appear nta alleging that perez palafox was removable pursuant to a a iii,as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.on september,an ij issued an in absentia order of removal against perez palafox after he failed to appear at his scheduled removal proceeding.
on november,an ij denied perez palafox motion to reopen seeking recision of the in absentia order.on february,the bia granted perez palafox appeal,finding that perez palafox established exceptional circumstances for his failure to appear,and remanded the case to the immigration court for further proceedings.
on april,an ij found perez palafox removable as charged in the nta.perez palafox applied for cancellation of removal,asylum,and withholding of removal,based on mental and physical disabilities stemming from a brain injury incurred in.the government did not oppose perez palafox application for withholding of removal,and withholding of removal was granted.
one year after he was granted withholding of removal relief,perez palafox was convicted by guilty plea in a california state court of the felony offense of of a controlled substance in violation of cal.h s code a he was sentenced to three years imprisonment.
the government subsequently filed a motion to reopen for the purpose of terminating perez palafox withholding of removal relief.an ij granted the motion to reopen.during the reopened proceedings,the government relied on conviction documents and the police report for perez palafox conviction to establish that perez palafox had been convicted of a particularly serious crime.
the ij acknowledged that a drug trafficking offense is presumptively a particularly serious crime.however,the ij found that the government failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that perez palafox conviction in for transportation of a controlled substance was for a drug trafficking offense.the ij concluded that the police report should not be considered because there was no plea colloquy reflecting that the report constituted a factual basis for perez palafox guilty plea.the ij found that the conviction documents did not establish that perez palafox was convicted of a drug trafficking offense.consequently,the ij denied the government motion to terminate the prior grant of withholding of removal relief.
following the government appeal,the bia remanded the case to the immigration court for further proceedings.the bia determined that the ij correctly concluded that perez palafox conviction was not presumptively a particularly serious crime.the bia noted that due to her conclusion,the ij was required to apply the analysis articulated in matter of n a m,i n bia,to assess whether perez palafox conviction constituted a particularly serious crime.the bia interpreted its holding in matter of n a m as permitting consideration of all reliable information once the elements of the offense were found to bring the crime within the realm of a particularly serious crime,including information outside the confines of the record of conviction.the bia found that,in conducting her analysis,the ij failed to give appropriate consideration to the police report,which contained potentially dispositive evidence that was not part of the ij factfinding.also,the bia noted that the ij acknowledged information that perez palafox was in possession of three drugs as well as other things when he was stopped,but made no findings about these additional items or their impact on her assessment.
the ij,in declining to consider the facts set out in the police report,relied on a case that no longer states the law.the ij followed morales gonzales,cir,as amended,which held that ijs should limit their inquiry to the record of conviction and sentencing information in determining whether a crime was particularly serious.id.at.however,anaya ortiz holder,cir,decided three years later,enlarged the scope of inquiry that the bia could require ijs to pursue.in that later case,we deferred to the bia in instructing ijs that all reliable information may be considered including information outside the confines of a record of conviction.id.at quoting matter of n a m,i n at.thus,the bia concluded that the ij should consider the facts in the police report,and remanded the case to the ij to enable the ij to conduct a analysis of all relevant information.petitioner does not challenge this conclusion,and we express no opinion here as to whether a police report may be considered reliable information.alphonsus holder,cir questioning if certain aspects of a police report might not be reliable evidence.
during the remanded proceedings,the police report was admitted into evidence and considered.the report provided the observations and opinions of arresting police officer carlos silva officer silva.officer silva reported that he found the following items in a bag on perez palafox person methamphetamine,marijuana,cocaine,a digital scale,and nine empty clear plastic bags.
perez palafox admitted that when he was arrested he was in possession of a bag of methamphetamine,a bag of cocaine,and a bag of marijuana.perez palafox also acknowledged that he was in possession of a digital scale and empty plastic bags,but stated that those items belonged to his brother.perez palafox conceded that he did not pay for the drugs,and that he had sold drugs in the past,but maintained that he did not possess drugs for sale at the time of his arrest.
after considering this evidence,the ij again denied the government motion to terminate the prior grant of withholding of removal.the ij held that perez palafox conviction was not presumptively a particularly serious crime pursuant to matter of y l,i n op.att y,because a conviction under cal.h s code a is not categorically a drug trafficking aggravated felony,as the statute prohibits the transportation of a controlled substance for personal use as well as for sale and the conviction documents in the record failed to establish that perez palafox conviction constituted a drug trafficking aggravated felony.
because perez palafox conviction was not presumptively a particularly serious crime,the ij conducted the analysis outlined in matter of n a m,to examine the nature of the conviction,the type of sentence imposed,and the circumstances and underlying facts of the conviction.
after considering the police report and perez palafox testimony,the ij found that the government again failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that perez palafox conviction constituted a particularly serious crime.the ij interpreted perez palafox statement that he had purchased the drugs immediately prior to his arrest as proof that the drugs were packaged in the plastic bags by the dealer who sold the drugs to perez palafox,and did not support a finding that perez palafox intended to sell the drugs.
