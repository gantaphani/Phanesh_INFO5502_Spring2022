this appeal presents the question of whether a conviction for trafficking in counterfeit goods or services in violation of the trademark counterfeiting act of,is a conviction for an offense relating to counterfeiting,pursuant to section a r of the immigration and nationality act ina,a r we conclude that it is.
petitioner yong wong park is a native and citizen of the republic of korea.he was admitted to the united states as an immigrant on or about february.on february,park pleaded guilty in the united states district court for the southern district of new york to one count of trafficking in counterfeit goods or services from at least february through october,in violation of on july,he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of months.
after his conviction,the department of homeland security dhs initiated removal proceedings.in a notice to appear,the dhs charged park with removability under ina a a i,a a i,for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years after admission for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed.app.at a hearing on april,park admitted the factual allegations in the notice to appear,but denied the removal charge and filed a motion to terminate proceedings.the parties presented argument on whether the crime for which park was convicted qualified as a crime involving moral turpitude.on june,the immigration judge ij determined that park conviction was not for a crime involving moral turpitude,and granted his motion to terminate.the dhs appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia.in an order dated april,the bia vacated the ij decision,finding that park was removable as charged.the bia remanded for further proceedings.
park then filed with the bia both a motion to stay scheduled removal proceedings before the ij and a motion to reconsider the bia april,decision.in a june,decision,the bia determined that park sought reconsideration because he believed the bia had not yet decided whether his crime was committed within five years of admission,as required under ina a a i,a a i.as the bia had decided this issue in its april,order,it denied park motions.
on june,park again moved before the bia both to stay the proceedings before the ij and to reconsider its june,decision.on july,the bia denied the motion to stay proceedings,but granted the motion to reconsider.noting that the question of whether park crime was committed within five years of admission was neither presented to nor decided by the ij in the first instance,the bia modified its earlier finding of removability.without changing its finding that park conviction was for a crime involving moral turpitude,the bia ordered that the parties be afforded the opportunity to litigate the time period issue before the ij.
before the ij,park applied for cancellation of removal under ina a,a.the dhs lodged a notice of additional charge of deportability,charging park with also being removable under ina a a iii,a a iii for having been convicted at any time after admission of an aggravated felony as defined in ina a r,a r an offense relating to counterfeiting,for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.park denied removability under the original and amended charges,and the parties presented argument on the issues of whether the crime involving moral turpitude was committed by park within five years of his admission to the united states,and whether park was removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony.
on august,the ij ordered that park be removed.after finding that park was not removable pursuant to ina a a i,a a i,because he did not commit the crime involving moral turpitude within the time period prescribed by that provision,the ij found that park was,however,removable pursuant to ina a a iii,a a iii,for having been convicted at any time after admission of an aggravated felony as defined in ina a r,a r.she also noted that the government was well within its right to amend the notice to appear and lodge additional charges during the pendency of proceedings.app.
in determining that park conviction was for an offense relating to counterfeiting,the ij began by observing that ina a r,a r does not define counterfeiting by referring to any particular statute or provision in any penal code or law.app.consequently,the ij reasoned that a wide variety of activity,such as counterfeiting in money,counterfeiting in false seals or trademarks or other copyright activity,can all fall within the definition of counterfeiting as long as an offense relates to counterfeiting.app.
next,the ij invoked an instance where this court considered the identical provision at issue a r,a r and our conclusion that by using the term relating to,congress evidenced an intent to define the listed offense in its broadest sense.app.quoting drakes zimski,cir.the ij continued to quote our analysis that u nless the words relating to have no effect,the enumerated crime must not be strictly confined to its narrowest meaning.app.quoting drakes,at.
having concluded that ina a r,a r,covers a range of activities beyond the act of counterfeiting itself,the ij proceeded to employ the formal categorical the statutory elements of the offense rather than the particular facts underlying the order to determine whether a violation of is a conviction for an offense relating to counterfeiting.the ij explained that in order to support a conviction under,the government must prove both that a defendant intentionally trafficked or attempted to traffic in goods or services,and that the defendant knowingly used a counterfeit mark on or in connection with such goods or services.app.she reasoned that although this statute is not directed at the act of counterfeiting,by criminalizing the knowing use of a counterfeit mark in connection with trafficking or attempting to traffic in goods or services,the statute seeks to discourage counterfeiting through the criminalization of the use of its end product.app.quoting ins,cir.the ij thus concluded that the offense criminalized by was one which related to counterfeiting within the meaning of ina a r,a r.
because park conviction was for an offense relating to counterfeiting because the conviction took place after park admission as a permanent resident in and because park was sentenced to a term of confinement of more than one year,the ij found park removable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony.app.see also ina a a iii,a a iii.in addition,because the ij found park had been convicted of an aggravated felony,she found him ineligible for cancellation of removal.app.see also ina a,a.lastly,the ij determined that there was no evidence to indicate that park was eligible for any other form of relief from removal and ordered him removed to the republic of korea.
park timely appealed to the bia.on march,the bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion,pursuant to its streamlining regulations,rendering the ij decision the final agency determination.app.see e.
although this court lacks jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony,a c,we have jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction,that is,to determine whether park has been convicted of an aggravated felony and thus,whether a c even applies.see drakes,at.in addition,per a d and a,we have jurisdiction to review the question of law park raises.
the government urges us to apply the principles of chevron natural res.def.council,d to this case,instead of engaging in de novo review of the ij decision.however,as we have previously discussed,while w e usually afford deference to decisions of administrative agencies when we are reviewing the agency determination of a statute the agency is charged with administering,legal issues that turn on a pure question of law not implicating the agency expertise do not raise the same concerns under chevron.patel ashcroft,cir see also drakes,at.for example,while we are mindful of the fact that chevron deference applies in general to the attorney general interpretation of the ina,see ins,d,as we observed in patel,the concerns motivating that deference are larg
