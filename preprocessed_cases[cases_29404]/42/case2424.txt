soon after getting married,the petitioners fled their home country of cameroon and sought asylum in the united states because the bride mother the point of death the bride be circumcised.irene agbor refused,calling the process of female circumcision a violent ritual mutilation of the female genitalia.her husband,terry agbor ebai,agreed and opposed the practice.but an immigration judge,relying on general country report information suggesting that female circumcision is not ubiquitous in cameroon,concluded that their fears of future persecution were unreasonable.the board of immigration appeals affirmed in a separate opinion,and this petition for review followed.both the ij and the bia disregarded critical evidence in the petitioners favor,and their reasons for discounting the petitioners fears are problematic.we therefore vacate the underlying decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
we draw upon the petitioners asylum application and testimony at an immigration hearing in relaying these background facts agbor and ebai were married in the summer of in a traditional cameroonian ceremony.agbor was years old at the time.shortly after the wedding,agbor traveled from her new town of mamfe to visit her parents in their village,dequa.both mamfe and dequa are in the southwest province of cameroon.her mother told her that it was time to do their tradition in other words,circumcision,which in the west is commonly referred to as female genital mutilation fgm agbor did not want to be circumcised,so she stalled for time,saying she would need to talk to her husband first.when she returned home,ebai rejected the idea of circumcision as well,saying he would not accept the situation.
when agbor and ebai did not follow up with agbor mother,both her parents paid the couple a visit in mamfe,again insisting that in our tradition when a girl gets married she must be circumcised.after arguing the matter for several hours,agbor parents left.they returned a few weeks later accompanied by a witch doctor.this caught the young couple testified that a witch doctor had killed several members of her village by ebai was able to forestall a decision by saying they would wait until after they registered their marriage.two weeks after they did so,agbor parents returned and made an ultimatum if agbor refused to be circumcised,they would again bring the witch doctor,who would poison them,killing ebai and rendering agbor infertile.at this point the petitioners sought the aid of the local police.as agbor testified in response to a question whether she sought help from the government yes sir.i went to the police.the police said it is do want to intervent sic to our tradition.that is our culture that is going on.they do want to intervent sic.indeed,the police refused even to fill out a police report on their behalf.agbor also testified that the government has not wiped out the practice of fgm,which is common in some areas,saying,they do do anything to stop it.
true to their word,agbor parents returned after a few weeks with the witch doctor in full regalia.the spectacle drew a crowd,and agbor and ebai used the commotion to escape,taking all their spare cash with them.they traveled seven to eight hours by car to stay with a daniel,an acquaintance of ebai from the business community.both men were involved in supply,although they were not business partners.daniel had read about the petitioners story in a cameroonian newspaper called the herald the article,entitled couple flees from female circumcision to an unknown destination,was introduced into the record.for apiece,daniel provided them with passports and airplane tickets to the united states.
after they filed for asylum,an immigration hearing was held at which both petitioners testified.they also introduced written evidence a series of human rights reports from various organizations a doctor slip confirming that agbor has not been circumcised letters from agbor brother and sister and from a friend congratulating her on her escape to america and a letter from an american social worker who grew up in cameroon and confirmed the common practice of fgm in agbor tribe.
the immigration judge written decision denying asylum and other relief references none of these materials,except to quote selectively from the human rights reports and to question the validity of the newspaper article because it contained a typo and some infelicitous writing.the ij rejected the asylum claim for several reasons.first,she held that the petitioners failed to show that the government had condoned fgm,noting instead that reports indicate that the government supports various ngos efforts to eradicate the practice.second,the reports indicate that in cameroon,fgm is usually practiced on young girls,not women of marrying age,and on muslims,not christians like agbor.third,the ij viewed agbor as having contradicted herself by saying on the one hand that she had witnessed her sister circumcision,and on the other that she had never heard of fgm until her mother approached her after the wedding.and fourth,the ij questioned whether the couple could safely relocate to another part of cameroon.
the bia affirmed in a separate opinion.it focused solely on three points fgm is not widespread in cameroon it is usually practiced on young girls and muslims rather than adults and christians and the government has taken steps to combat the practice,making concrete and strong efforts in its campaign.
ii.analysis 
where,as here,the bia issues its decision in a separate opinion,we review that decision,rather than the ij.awe ashcroft,cir.and our review is deferential if reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence supports the decision,we must affirm it.see sina gonzales,cir.the administrative findings of fact made below are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude otherwise.b b gomes gonzales,cir.
under the familiar standard,a petitioner may demonstrate that she is a refugee,and hence eligible for asylum,by showing that she is unable or unwilling to return to her home country because of persecution or a fear of future persecution on account of certain specified factors,such as membership of a social group.a a,b a gomes,at.the case law is quite clear that women who fear being circumcised should they return to their home countries are members of a discrete social group for purposes of the statute.in re kasinga,bia see uanreroro gonzales,cir balogun ashcroft,cir abay ashcroft,cir.
the parties and the bia analyzed both whether agbor suffered past persecution and whether she has a fear of future persecution.since she has not yet been circumcised,but rather bases her claim on a fear that she will be circumcised if returned,we think that the matter is more appropriately analyzed as a claim of a fear of future persecution.compare mohammed gonzales,cir holding that individual who had been circumcised had shown past persecution.to succeed,agbor and ebai must therefore show that they subjectively fear returning to cameroon,and that that fear is objectively reasonable.see boci gonzales,cir.the bia three reasons for concluding that the petitioners fear is objectively unreasonable do not withstand scrutiny.
the bia first reason,that fgm is not widely practiced in cameroon,is true as far as it goes,but it is also so.the most recent state department country report,of which we may take notice,giday gonzales,cir,makes the same point,but immediately goes on to say that fgm continues to be practiced in three of the country ten provinces,including the southwest province,which is where the petitioners live.see dep t of state,country reports on human rights practices.this is consistent with agbor testimony that the women in her village all undergo circumcision.the report also states that in parts of the southwest province,fgm is still common in its most brutal form,infibulation.id we have emphasized before that the most probative evidence regarding the prevalence of fgm is,rather than,because the incidence of fgm often varies significantly from state to state.see balogun,at.by favoring the general cameroon over the specific
