muhammad anwar anwar was charged with and convicted of conspiring to defraud the government by aiding and abetting others to enter into fraudulent marriages between and,in violation of,and aiding and abetting a foreign national and a united states citizen in the act of entering into a fraudulent marriage for the purpose of evading immigration laws,in violation of c.the district court sentenced anwar to six months imprisonment and three years supervised release.anwar appeals,raising multiple errors.finding no reversible errors,we affirm.
background 
at trial,the jury heard testimony relating to anwar solicitation of female employees and acquaintances,from approximately to,to marry pakistani men for the purpose of allowing the men to evade united states immigration laws.six,amy gauthier gauthier,mary tucker tucker,essie cooper cooper,keeley hoyt ali hoyt ali,sherry ali ali,and kayleen nazir nazir testified anwar approached them and asked if they would marry pakistani men.the women understood the proposed marriages were not intended to be legitimate marital relationships,but instead would be green card marriages,marriages for the purpose of helping the foreign nationals remain in the united states by evading immigration laws.with respect to tucker,cooper,hoyt ali,ali,and nazir,anwar allegedly assured the women they would be taken care of financially in exchange for marrying pakistani men.
amy akhtar,a united states citizen,testified anwar asked her to marry his nephew,tariq,who lived in pakistan.akhtar later married tariq after knowing him for only five or six hours.the couple neither consummated the marriage nor lived together following the wedding.following akhtar marriage to tariq,anwar allegedly asked akhtar several times to begin working on tariq immigration paperwork.when akhtar expressed her reluctance to do so,anwar allegedly told her to file the paperwork and then divorce tariq after he came to the united states.
the jury also heard testimony relating to anwar conduct between late and early in aiding a fraudulent marriage between amanda reinier reinier and hamid bashir bashir.reinier testified that in january anwar asked her to marry bashir,who,according to reinier and bashir marriage certificate as well as bashir immigration documents,was born in pakistan.reinier agreed to do so.after knowing one another for less than two weeks,reinier and bashir married on february,in south dakota,a state that has no waiting period for entering into marriage.at the time reinier married bashir,she had no intention of living with him as a spouse.rather,her purpose was to allow bashir to obtain a green card and residency in the united states.in exchange for marrying bashir,anwar allegedly told reinier she would receive a truck.anwar later made the down payment on the truck.
following reinier and bashir wedding,anwar allegedly began asking reinier when she would file the necessary immigration paperwork,instructing her how to make the marriage appear legitimate by living with bashir.reinier ultimately signed the requisite paperwork on bashir behalf.after reinier joined the military in about march,reinier realized her marriage to bashir was wrong and wanted to end it.anwar allegedly advised reinier if she filed for divorce,bashir immigration status would not be affected.reinier annulled the marriage in october.
gauthier,reinier sister,also testified regarding the reinier and bashir marriage.according to gauthier,after reinier wedding anwar asked her to write a letter in support of bashir application,allegedly telling her too many pakistani people had submitted support letters to the immigration and naturalization service ins and reinier would get in trouble if gauthier did not sign the letter.gauthier subsequently filed the letter of support.
over anwar pretrial objection,the government was allowed to present evidence concerning anwar romantic involvement with leanne roof roof and with ali.saqib chudarry chudarry,a native of pakistan,testified anwar stated he had arranged marriages between various individuals,including a man named unis hamid unis and anwar own girlfriend,roof.cheryl stempien stempien,roof aunt,testified she attended a wedding between a man named unis and roof sometime in the,even though roof and anwar were involved in a personal relationship both before and after the wedding.both during and immediately after the wedding,stempien allegedly heard anwar promise to pay roof to marry unis.finally,ali testified she was in a romantic relationship with anwar between and,and that during the course of their relationship,anwar allegedly asked ali ten to twenty times to marry various pakistani men so the men could get green cards.
the jury returned a guilty verdict on both counts of the indictment.with regard to count,the jury found anwar conspired to commit marriage fraud with five individuals roof,reinier,gauthier,bashir,and akhtar.additionally,the jury found five overt acts were committed in furtherance of the conspiracy anwar asked akhtar to marry his nephew,tariq,in pakistan,and akhtar did so after knowing tariq for a few hours anwar repeatedly asked akhtar to complete the ins paperwork to allow tariq to enter and remain in the united states anwar knowingly and unlawfully aided and abetted the marriage of reinier,a united states citizen,and bashir for the purpose of allowing bashir to remain in the united states and evade immigration laws bashir and reinier were married on or about february,for the purpose of allowing bashir to evade immigration laws and following the marriage of bashir and reinier,anwar continually directed reinier to complete the ins paperwork to allow bashir to evade immigration laws.with regard to count,the jury found anwar guilty of aiding and abetting the commission of marriage fraud on or about late and early.
following the verdict,the district court denied anwar motion for a new trial and motion for judgment of acquittal.anwar appeals,asserting insufficient evidence supported the convictions,the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence,the district court erred in admitting evidence of his romantic relationships,the district court erred in admitting prejudicial federal rule of evidence b evidence of his other solicitations and failing to give a limiting instruction before final jury instructions,prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of a fair trial,the government improper contact with and intimidation of a defense witness denied him the opportunity to call the witness,the district court erred in refusing to give his preferred jury instruction,the district court failure to consult defense counsel before responding to a request from the jury violated his constitutional rights,and cumulative trial errors warrant a new trial.
ii.discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
anwar first contends there was insufficient evidence to support the jury findings of guilt on both counts.jury verdicts are not lightly overturned.united states hood,cir citation omitted.we will reverse the jury verdict for insufficient evidence only if no reasonable jury could have found anwar guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.united states,cir.in doing so,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,resolving any evidentiary conflicts in the government favor.united states lee,cir citation omitted.
under the guidance of this strict standard of review,see united states,cir,we conclude the evidence was sufficient to support anwar convictions.with regard to the conspiracy charge,the jury reasonably could have concluded there was an agreement among anwar,male pakistani foreign nationals,and female united states citizens to enter into fraudulent marriages to evade immigration laws.as evidence of anwar intent to evade immigration laws,anwar solicited several women to enter into green card marriages with various pakistani men for the purpose of helping the men remain in the united states,and assured the women they would be taken care of financially in exchange for marrying the foreign nationals.furthermore,ample evidence supports the jury finding anwar conspired with akhtar,roof,reinier,bashir,and gauthier.the government presented evidence concerning anwar solicitation of akhtar,roof,and reinier to marry pakistani men for the purpose of helping the men obtain residency in the united states akhtar marriage to anwar nephew,tariq,in pakistan after knowing tariq for only five to six hours reinier marriage to bashir for the purpose of allowing bashir to remain in the united states and evade immigration laws anwar repeated requests to akhtar and reinier to submit the requisite immigration paperwork for their new husbands and gauthier letter in support of bashir immigration paperwork,filed pursuant to anwar request.
we reach the same conclusion with regard to anwar conviction for marriage fraud.again,sufficient evidence supports the jury verdict on the charge of aiding and abetting the commission of marriage fraud between reinier and bashir anwar asked reinier to marry bashir,and reinier agreed to do so at the time of the marriage,reinier had no intention of living with bashir as a spouse reinier purpose in marrying bashir was to allow him to obtain a green card and united states residency anwar inquired when reinier would file bashir immigration paperwork,and instructed her how to make the marriage appear legitimate and anwar advised reinier that bashir immigration status would not be affected if she filed for divorce.thus,we find no basis for disturbing the jury verdict.
verdict against the weight of the evidence 
anwar next argues the jury verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence,thus warranting a new trial.in determining whether to grant a motion for a new trial on the ground the verdict is contrary to the weight of the evidence,t he district court need not view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict it may weigh the evidence and in so doing evaluate for itself the credibility of the witnesses.united states walker,cir quoting united states lincoln,cir.if,after doing so,the court determines the evidence preponderates sufficiently heavily against the verdict that a serious miscarriage of justice may have occurred,it may set aside the verdict,grant a new trial,and submit the issues for determination by another jury.id.at.the district court denial of anwar motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence will be affirmed absent a clear and manifest abuse of discretion.united states frank,cir quoting united states,cir.
our review of the record leads us to conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying anwar motion for a new trial.simply put,anwar convictions do not evince a serious miscarriage of justice such that we must reject the jury verdict or the district court sense of justice.walker,at.
alleged trial errors 
admission of anwar relationships 
anwar contends the district court erred in admitting evidence regarding his personal relationships with roof and ali,arguing the evidence should have been excluded under federal rules of evidence and b.we review de novo the district court interpretation and application of the rules of evidence,and review for an abuse of discretion the factual findings supporting its evidentiary ruling.united states claybourne,cir citation omitted.
we conclude the district court did not err in admitting such evidence.contrary to anwar argument,evidence of his romantic associations with roof and ali was admitted not under rule b,but rather as substantive evidence of the conspiracy to commit marriage fraud.specifically,the district court found the evidence was relevant to the issue of whether roof and ali marriages to other pakistani men were fraudulent.we are not persuaded by anwar contention there was no evidence that having the alleged affair meant that anwar would not want his paramour to enter into a true marriage.anwar told chudarry he had arranged marriages between unis and anwar girlfriend,roof.according to stempien,anwar promised to pay roof to marry unis and was in a romantic relationship with roof both before and after her wedding to unis.furthermore,while intimately involved with ali from to,anwar asked ali approximately ten to twenty times to marry different pakistani men.such evidence certainly is relevant and makes it more likely than not the women marriages or proposed marriages to other pakistani men were not for a legitimate purpose.
additionally,we agree with the district court determination the relevance of roof and ali relationships with anwar was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.unfair prejudice means an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis.united states adams,cir citation omitted.however,evidence of anwar personal involvement with roof and ali does not appear to be so inflammatory on its face as to divert the jury attention from the material issues in the trial.id.at citation omitted.accordingly,we find no error on this issue.
admission of anwar solicitations of fraudulent marriages under rule b 
anwar next assigns as error the admission of evidence concerning his solicitations of tucker,hoyt ali,cooper,ali,gauthier,and nazir to marry foreign nationals for the purpose of evading immigration laws.the district court initially admitted the testimony as substantive evidence of the conspiracy,yet noted if the court had erred in its ruling,the testimony also was admissible under rule b.anwar argued the evidence was inadmissible,and,even if admissible,he was entitled to a rule b cautionary instruction before each woman testimony.his request was denied.at the close of the evidence,however,the district court held the evidence was admissible only under rule b for the purpose of showing anwar intent to commit the offenses charged,and instructed the jury in this regard during final jury instructions.on appeal,anwar reasserts his previous objections to this evidence.
giving great deference to the district court determination in balancing the prejudicial effect and probative value of evidence of other crimes or acts,we will reverse the district court evidentiary decision only when the evidence admitted clearly has no bearing on any issue involved.claybourne,at internal quotation omitted.the district court acted within its discretion in admitting evidence of anwar solicitations of other fraudulent marriages if the evidence is relevant to an issue other than anwar character,it is similar in kind and not overly remote to the crime charged,it is supported by sufficient evidence,and the potential unfair prejudice of the evidence does not substantially outweigh its probative value.united states jackson,cir citing united states green,cir.
again,anwar claim of error fails.first,anwar prior acts of solicitation of american women to marry pakistani men so the men could enter or remain in the united states are relevant to anwar intent to commit the charged conduct.second,his prior bad acts are similar in kind to the crimes charged.anwar was charged with conspiring to commit marriage fraud and aiding and abetting the commission of marriage fraud.his prior acts involved asking women to marry foreign nationals so the men could remain in the united states and evade immigration laws,and assuring the women they would be taken care of financially for entering into such a marriage.also,the between and not overly remote,given anwar was charged with engaging in a marriage fraud conspiracy between and november.while proximity in time is a factor in deciding whether to admit rule b evidence,we have held that there is no fixed period within which the prior acts must have occurred.jackson,at quoting united states baker,cir.third,there is sufficient evidence the alleged acts occurred.the district court found the testimony of the six women was credible,thus satisfying the government burden to establish the alleged acts occurrences by clear and convincing evidence.see united states callaway,cir citation omitted.fourth,the probative value of the evidence is not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.evidence of anwar prior bad acts was probative of his intent to commit the charged conduct and was not so inflammatory as to divert the jury attention from the material issues.adams,at.after carefully reviewing the record and giving great defer
