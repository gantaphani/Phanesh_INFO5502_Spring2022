petitioners christian palma et petition for review of a supplemental decision and order of respondent national labor relations board nlrb or the board following compliance proceedings with respect to the remedies to be ordered for violations of the national labor relations act nlra by their former employer,mezonos maven bakery,mezonos.it having been conceded,for purposes of the compliance proceedings,that petitioners were undocumented aliens,the board ruled that awards of backpay to the petitioners are precluded by the supreme court decision in hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,hoffman plastic,interpreting the immigration reform and control act of irca,and the board therefore refused to approve an order of the administrative law judge alj recommending that petitioners be awarded backpay.petitioners contend that the board erred in interpreting the majority opinion in hoffman plastic to apply to aliens such as petitioners,who had not procured their jobs through the use of fraudulent documentation,and that the board erred in rejecting,without explanation,the alj reinstatement order recommending that mezonos be required to offer petitioners conditional reinstatement petitioners reply brief on petition for review at.with respect to petitioners latter contention,the board argues that the absence of a board order for,or discussion of,conditional reinstatement is not error because the alj order did not include a recommendation for that relief.for the reasons that follow,we deny the petition insofar as it seeks awards of backpay we grant the petition to the extent that it seeks a remand for the board to consider issues relating to the request for conditional reinstatement.
background 
most of the facts are no longer in dispute.petitioners and several others collectively,the discriminatees are former employees of mezonos they engaged in protected concerted labor activity,for which they were unlawfully discharged in.the merits of the unfair labor practice charge alleging that the discharges violated the nlra were resolved by a stipulation and order,on which a judgment was entered by this court in judgment or judgment the relief to be ordered for the violations was to be conclusively determined after later proceedings.the judgment provided,to the extent pertinent here,that mezonos was to make petitioners whole with respect to the amount of backpay due,if any,judgment b emphasis added,and that mezonos was to offer petitioners 
unconditional reinstatement except that mezonos may avail itself of a compliance proceeding and therein attempt to establish that one or more of the alleged discriminatees is not entitled to an unconditional offer of reinstatement,
id.a emphasis added.
a.the compliance proceedings and the alj decision 
in the ensuing compliance proceedings,commenced by an nlrb compliance specification and notice of hearing compliance specification that sought backpay and unconditional offers of reinstatement,mezonos contended that hoffman plastic precluded awards of backpay reinstatement in this case because petitioners were not legally authorized to work in,or to be present in,the united states.mezonos asserted that it had in fact offered in to reinstate petitioners if they produced documentation sufficient to comply with irca and that none of them had presented proper documentation.
from the beginning of the evidentiary hearing before the alj,mezonos sought to examine the discriminatees as to their immigration status.counsel for the discriminatees maintained that mezonos should be prohibited from questioning them on that subject and the first such witness refused to answer any questions touching on his immigration status,invoking his fifth amendment privilege against see compliance hearing transcript,tr,at.the alj ruled the questioning appropriate,and he adjourned the hearing in order to request,pursuant to c of the board rules and regulations,authorization to require the discriminatees to answer such questions.before a response to that request was received,however,the nlrb general counsel was allowed to foreclose such questioning by conceding,for purposes of the compliance proceedings,that the discriminatees were undocumented aliens 
f or the purposes of this proceeding,and only this proceeding,the general counsel will proceed on the assumption that the discriminatees are undocumented.we have decided not to contest the issue of the discriminatees immigration status in this proceeding for the purposes of expediting this matter.
alj order granting motion to amend compliance specification and withdrawal of the section c request,dated june,at quoting motion of the general counsel.accordingly,the compliance hearing continued on the assumption that the discriminatees were undocumented aliens.the alj inquired whether that assumption altered the general counsel request for a remedy tr,and he was informed that the requested relief was modified to include conditional,rather than unconditional,reinstatement see id.at.
following the conclusion of the hearing,the alj issued his decision recommending that petitioners be awarded backpay.see alj supplemental decision dated november,alj decision.the alj began by stating that 
t he general question presented is whether undocumented workers who are not legally authorized to work or be present in the united states but are nevertheless covered and protected by the national labor relations act act are entitled to a backpay remedy.
the specific question to be decided is whether undocumented workers who have not engaged in fraud or criminal activity in violation of irca in obtaining or continuing their employment are entitled to backpay where their employer,in violation of that statute,hired and retained them knowing that they were undocumented.
alj decision at emphases added.the alj answered both questions in the affirmative,finding this case materially different from hoffman plastic because the alien in hoffman plastic had violated irca by procuring his employment by presenting the employer with fraudulent documents,and the employer was unaware of the fraud,see id.at.
the alj discredited mezonos president testimony that petitioners had been asked to produce documentation before they were hired,and he found that regardless of whether the employees were asked for documentation and did not produce it,mezonos violated irca by hiring them and continuing to employ them without receiving the proper documentation.alj decision at.the alj also credited the testimony of the petitioners over that of mezonos president with respect to the events after petitioners discharges,finding that mezonos had not made valid offers to reinstate petitioners if they presented proper documentation.see id.at.
the alj noted that the compliance specification alleged that the backpay period for petitioners began on the date of their discharge and continued to run in the absence of a valid offer of reinstatement,see id.at,and that the general counsel argued that no valid offer of reinstatement had been made,see id.the alj noted that the board in the past had ordered an employer who had hired employees,knowing they were undocumented aliens,to offer them immediate and full reinstatement if,within a reasonable time,they provided documentation satisfying irca and he found that hoffman plastic did not preclude such an order of conditional reinstatement.see alj decision at.the alj stated that the limited concession that petitioners here were undocumented d id not answer the question concerning mezonos obligation,first to validly offer reinstatement and then to leave those offers open for a reasonable time within which they must present proof of documentation.those obligations have not been met.id.and because a n employer offer of reinstatement must be specific and unequivocal in order to toll backpay,and valid offers of reinstatement have not yet been made to the discriminatees,the alj found that backpay has not been tolled,id.at.
quoting extensively from the dissent in hoffman plastic,the alj concluded that the backpay remedy is necessary to make labor law enforcement credible,alj decision at internal quotation marks omitted,and is effective in deterring future conduct,without which,employers have more,not less incentive to hire undocumented workers,id.at.
having concluded that mezonos did not make valid offers of reinstatement to the discriminatees sufficient to toll its obligation to pay backpay,the alj proceeded to calculate the amount of backpay due each discriminatee and entered an order accordingly.see id.at.the text of his recommended order,id.at,was as follows 
the respondent,mezonos maven bakery,its officers,agents,successors,and assigns,shall make the employees named in the attached appendix whole by paying to them the sums set forth in the column entitled net backpay for each of the employees,with interest on such amounts to be computed in accordance with new horizons for the retarded,nlrb,minus tax withholdings required by federal and state laws.
order dated november,alj order.the alj decision noted that in the absence of timely exceptions,the findings,conclusions,and recommended order shall,as provided in of the board rules,be adopted by the board and all objections to them shall be deemed waived for all purposes.alj decision at.
b.the decision of the board 
in a supplemental decision and order dated august,and reported at nlrb decision,the board declined to adopt the alj order.the board did not disturb the alj findings that mezonos violated irca by hiring and continuing to employ petitioners without obtaining the required documentation,and that petitioners had not violated irca because they had not obtained their jobs by presenting fraudulent documents.see nlrb decision at.however,the board concluded that the holding in hoffman plastic nonetheless precluded awards of backpay to petitioners as undocumented aliens.
although the employee at issue in hoffman plastic had violated irca and his employer had not,the board stated that hoffman plastic holding is categorically worded with no distinction based on the identity of the irca violator,id.at,and concluded that that decision broadly precludes backpay awards to undocumented workers regardless of whether it is they or their employer who has violated irca,see id.at the hoffman plastic court worded its holding in irca terms,it invoked irca policy grounds,and it otherwise made clear that which party violated irca was immaterial to its holding.the board noted that r egardless of which party violates the law,the result is an unlawful employment relationship,nlrb decision at,and found its interpretation consistent with hoffman plastic view that any employment relationship between an employer and an undocumented worker contravened explicit congressional policies,id.internal quotation marks omitted.the board concluded that an award of backpay would trench upon policies underlying irca by legitimizing that relationship and that such a remedy was therefore beyond the limits of the board remedial discretion.id.at quoting hoffman plastic,at.
having determined that petitioners can not be awarded backpay,the board reversed the alj order and dismissed the general counsel compliance specification.the board did not discuss whether mezonos should be required to offer to reinstate petitioners if they would provide documentation.
petitioners moved for reconsideration of the board ruling denying them backpay their motion did not mention any issue of reinstatement.the board denied the motion in an order dated november.this petition for review followed.
ii.discussion 
in support of their petition for review,petitioners contend that the board erred in its interpretation of hoffman plastic as categorically barring backpay for undocumented workers,and they argue that both that interpretation and the board failure to explain its decision to deny conditional reinstatement require a remand.the board opposes the petition on the grounds that its interpretation of hoffman plastic was correct and that its silence on the subject of reinstatement was appropriate,given that the alj order had not recommended conditional reinstatement and no party argued to the board that the alj erroneously failed to recommend that relief.
we conclude that the board interpretation of hoffman plastic was correct but we remand this matter to the board for consideration of issues relating to petitioners requested remedy of conditional reinstatement.
hoffman plastic,irca,and backpay 
in hoffman plastic,the employer hoffman had hired an alien,jose castro,who presented to hoffman documents that appeared to verify his authorization to work in the united states but that,unbeknownst to hoffman,were fraudulent.after hoffman violated the nlra by discharging castro and others for activities,the board ordered that hoffman cease and desist from further violations of the nlra and offer reinstatement and backpay to the affected employees.hoffman plastic,at.despite the admission by castro at a subsequent compliance hearing that he had obtained his job by using false documents and was not authorized to work in the united states,the board eventually ordered that hoffman pay castro backpay.see id.at.the supreme court reversed that decision,noting that when the board chosen remedy trenches upon a federal statute or policy outside the board competence to administer,the board remedy may be required to yield,id.at.
the hoffman plastic court began its opinion by stating as follows 
the national labor relations board board awarded backpay to an undocumented alien who has never been legally authorized to work in the united states.we hold that such relief is foreclosed by federal immigration policy,as expressed by congress in the immigration reform and control act of irca.
hoffman plastic,at.
in exploring the interplay between the nlra and irca,the court described at some length its decision in sure tan,nlrb,which had been decided two years before the enactment of irca and had dealt with the potential conflict between the nlra and federal immigration policy,as then expressed in the immigration and nationality act ina,stat,as amended,et,hoffman plastic,at.in sure tan,
t wo companies had unlawfully reported to the immigration and naturalization service ins in retaliation for union activity.rather than face ins sanction,the employees voluntarily departed to mexico.the board investigated and found the companies acted in violation of a and of the nlra.the board ensuing order directed the companies to reinstate the affected workers and pay them six months backpay.
we affirmed the board determination that the nlra applied to undocumented workers,reasoning that the immigration laws as presently written expressed only a peripheral concern with the employment of illegal aliens,at quoting de canas bica.for whatever reason,congress had not made it a separate criminal offense for employers to hire an illegal alien,or for an illegal alien to accept employment after entering this country illegally.sure tan,at.therefore,we found no reason to conclude that application of the nlra to employment practices affecting such aliens would necessarily conflict with the terms of the ina,at.
with respect to the board selection of remedies,however,we found its authority limited by federal immigration policy.see,at in devising remedies for unfair labor practices,the board is obliged to take into account another equally important congressional objective quoting southern nlrb.for example,the board was prohibited from effectively rewarding a violation of the immigration laws by reinstating workers not authorized to reenter the united states.sure tan,at.thus,to avoid a potential conflict with the ina,the board reinstatement order had to be conditioned upon proof of the employees legal reentry.ibid.similarly,with respect to backpay,we stated t he employees must be deemed unavailable for work and the accrual of backpay therefore tolled during any period when they were not lawfully entitled to be present and employed in the united states.ibid.i n light of the practical workings of the immigration laws,such remedial limitations were appropriate even if they led to t he probable unavailability of the nlra more effective remedies,at.
