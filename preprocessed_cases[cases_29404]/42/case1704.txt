this case involves a question of first impression do aliens denied temporary resident status under the amnesty provisions of the immigration reform and control act irca,retain a right to judicial review of that decision given the amendments to that statute by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,stat.we conclude that the amended statute does preserve a right to limited judicial review and therefore,when reviewing a final deportation order,the courts of appeal continue to have jurisdiction to review an amnesty denial.possessing jurisdiction,we find that the immigration and naturalization service ins committed no error in denying the applications for amnesty and ordering the removals at issue in this case.accordingly,we deny the petition for review.
in may,aldo orquera,his wife gladis orquera,and their adult children,ariel orquera and ariadna orquera the orqueras,each filed applications to become lawful temporary residents under irca.that statute provides for amnesty and adjustment to lawful status for an applicant who demonstrates that he has resided continuously in the united states in unlawful status since january,see a a,has been physically present in the united states continuously since november,see a a,and is otherwise admissible as an immigrant,see a.ariadna orquera applied as an alien who illegally entered the prior to january,the others applied as aliens who entered the united states as nonimmigrants prior to january,and whose authorized stay expired before such date or whose unlawful status was known to the government as of january.
in their applications for amnesty,the orqueras submitted that they entered the united states using visitor visas issued in that expired in,and that they were therefore unlawfully present in the united states on january.the ins,however,discovered some evidence that the orqueras,in addition to their visas,had been accredited,as consular employees or family of such employees,with visas.the ins accordingly requested that the orqueras submit evidence that they were not legally present as consular employees or family with visas.
in,finding their additional submissions lacking,the director of the ins regional processing center denied the orqueras applications for amnesty.the orqueras appealed the director denials on a number of grounds.
in,the ins legalization appeals unit lau affirmed the denials.although the decision as to each application varied slightly,in essence the lau concluded that aldo orquera had been granted nonimmigrant status,and his family received derivative status as a result of his employment by a foreign government.the lau found that orquera had not demonstrated that he ceased to be recognized by the department of state as being entitled to such classification prior to january,or that his qualifying employment had terminated by that date,and that he,and by extension his family,had therefore failed to show that they were in unlawful status,as required for eligibility under the amnesty program.
on april,the orqueras requested that the ins commence removal proceedings against them.in their letter to the ins,the orqueras attorney explained that they sought commencement of removal proceedings to challenge the denial of their applications for amnesty.under f a,an alien may obtain judicial review of a denial of an application for amnesty only in review of a final deportation order thus,after the ins denied their applications for amnesty,the orqueras could not immediately seek judicial review,but instead had to wait until they were subject to a removal order.reno catholic soc,d.
on june,the ins commenced removal proceedings against the orqueras.on november,the orqueras appeared before an immigration judge they stated that they sought to appeal the legalization amnesty decision knowing that this court does not have jurisdiction over it,but nevertheless,having to come here before you to be able to proceed to the next level at which we can have the case reviewed on the merits.the orqueras admitted that they were removable and the judge entered orders of voluntary departure and removal.
the orqueras then appealed the orders of removal to the board of immigration appeals bia.although the orqueras recognized that the bia did not have jurisdiction to review the denials of their applications for amnesty,they submitted a brief to the bia that argued the merits of their amnesty claim in order to supplement the record for the fourth circuit court of appeals as this court has jurisdiction to review these applications.the orqueras argued that aldo orquera had accepted unauthorized employment in violation of the conditions of his visa prior to january,that the government knew of this unauthorized employment,and that the orqueras were therefore in unlawful status as required by the amnesty eligibility rules.the bia dismissed the orqueras appeal,finding it had no jurisdiction to review the propriety of the service decision to deny an alien temporary resident status and ordered the orqueras to depart the united states voluntarily within days from the date of the order,february.
the orqueras then petitioned for review of their orders of removal to this court.once again,they contend that ins should have granted them amnesty in may and that,if they had been granted amnesty,they would now be lawfully present in the united states and so not subject to removal.our decision whether to uphold the orders of removal and deny the petition for review accordingly turns on whether ins properly denied their applications for amnesty.before addressing this question,however,we must determine if we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal.
separate provisions of title govern our jurisdiction to review a final order of removal generally and,in the course of such review,to look back and review a prior amnesty denial provides us with jurisdiction to review a final order of removal and f a provides us with jurisdiction to review the denial of amnesty in certain limited circumstances.the parties agree that f a empowers us with jurisdiction to review the amnesty denials in this case.the parties can not,however,create subject matter jurisdiction or waive its absence.see ins.of ireland,compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d n o action of the parties can confer subject matter jurisdiction upon a federal court.thus the consent of the parties is irrelevant.we therefore undertake an independent analysis of our jurisdiction to review the amnesty denials at issue here.
irca provides at the outset of its judicial review subsection that t here shall be no administrative or judicial review of a determination respecting an application for adjustment of status under this section except in accordance with this subsection.f.thus,a court can review the denial of an application for amnesty only as provided in subsequent jurisdictional provisions set forth in irca at f a c.
section f a governs judicial review of individual amnesty denials.from the time of the enactment of irca in until its amendment by iirira,f a provided 
limitation to review of deportation.there shall be judicial review of such denial only in the judicial review of an order of deportation under section of this title.
f a prior to iirira amendment emphasis added.section set forth the scope of judicial review of orders of deportation generally the procedure prescribed by,and all the provisions of chapter of title providing for appellate review of final agency orders shall apply to,and shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for,the judicial review of all final orders of deportation.
prior to the iirira amendment,a significant body of case law considered the interplay between the judicial review provisions of f a and what is often referred to as the exclusive review scheme of irca.ultimately the supreme court held that these judicial review provisions generally mean that district courts do retain jurisdiction to hear challenges to the processes and procedures adopted by the ins in administering irca,provided that such review does not encompass the denial of any individual application and that the claims are ripe but courts of appeal have exclusive jurisdiction to review amnesty denials in individual cases in the course of review of a final order of deportation.see,mcnary haitian refugee,d catholic soc,d.
in,with its enactment of iirira,congress overhauled numerous sections of the immigration and naturalization act,et,and insulated from judicial review many of the executive discretionary decisions iirira repealed and replaced it with instituting new,and more restrictive,judicial review provisions governing review of orders of deportation.see reno,d congress passed iirira which,inter alia,repealed the old scheme set forth in and instituted a new and significantly more restrictive one in.in doing so,congress left the reference to in f a in place,but added the phrase emphasized below 
limitation to review of deportation.there shall be judicial review of such denial only in the judicial review of an order of deportation under section of this title as in effect before october.
f a emphasis added.we must determine whether courts of appeal continue to have jurisdiction under f a to review amnesty denials when,and not,governs review of the underlying order of deportation.
we review questions of statutory construction de novo.ramey director,office of workers compensation programs,cir.see generally salve regina college russell,d discussing de novo review of state statute.the first step of statutory interpretation is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning by looking to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil,d.
turning to the language of f a,two possible interpretations emerge upon examination of the statutory text.the first of these would preserve judicial review the status quo interpretation and the second would bar judicial review the interpretation.
the parties adopt the status quo interpretation and contend that by preserving the reference to and adding the language as in effect before october,congress amendment to f a in iirira resurrected by reference,thereby maintaining judicial review consistent with the exclusive review scheme previously set forth in f and the parties argue that the amendment to f a adding the language as in effect before october,functions to freeze in place the previously existing scope of judicial review and does not require that the order of deportation being considered actually be subject to review under,the order of deportation does not have to arise from deportation proceedings begun before april,such that it is actually governed by the old judicial review provisions of.
in f a,the phrase as in effect before can reasonably be read in conjunction with under in this manner legislators frequently employ this phrasing to preserve through incorporation by reference a concept,definition,or specific analytic structure set out in a repealed or preamendment statute.see,a a ii if a foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation every person who is a united states shareholder shall include in his gross income a the sum of ii his pro rata share determined under section a as in effect before the enactment of the tax reduction act of of the corporation previously excluded subpart f income emphasis added b the amount of the credit allowable under subsection a shall be reduced by an amount equal to percent of the aggregate amount allowed as a specific exemption under as in effect before its repeal by the tax reform act of with respect to gifts made by the decedent after september.emphasis added.
under the status quo interpretation,therefore,the text of f a employs as in effect before and under to place two limits on review of an amnesty decision.namely,section f a provides that courts can review an amnesty decision only in the context of an order of deportation,and to the extent that,preserved by the as in effect language,permits review of an order of deportation.
however,the phrase as in effect employed in conjunction with under can also be used to indicate that an order must actually arise under or be subject to the referenced statute section,b a the attorney general shall grant parole under section d of this title to any alien who is a i child of an alien granted relief under section b or section a of this title as in effect before the title effective date in section of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of emphasis added.this suggests another possible interpretation of f f a the which use of the phrasing under and as in effect before would function to refer the reader back to orders of deportation actually subject to judicial review set forth in the judicial review section.
section f a provides that there shall be judicial review of an amnesty decision only in the judicial review of an order of deportation under section of this title as in effect before october.emphasis added.because provides a scheme for judicial review,the specification in the text that review is available only as to an order of deportation under could indicate that a court must,in the first instance,be reviewing an order of deportation that is subject to judicial review pursuant to the provisions of.see generally webster third new international dictionary ed defining under as meaning in or into a condition of subjection,regulation,or subordination.see also ardestani ins,d finding that the most natural reading of the equal access to justice act,which defines adversary adjudications as adjudications under section of the administrative procedure act,is that proceedings must be subject to or governed by to fall within the definition of adversary adjudication emphasis added.
pursuant to the interpretation,f a would be read to mean that courts can review amnesty denials only when an individual is subject to an order of deportation,judicial review of which is actually governed by if an alien is not subject to an order of deportation actually subject to review pursuant to,then f a does not provide for judicial review of that alien amnesty denial.this would effectively preclude judicial review under f a.
confronted with two plausible readings of f a,we examine the statutory text in its broader context to discern whether an interpretation of that text makes sense of the statutory scheme as a whole,at,d interpreting the meaning of g of iirira.when we engage in this examination,it becomes clear that the interpretation,which would permit no judicial review of amnesty denials,creates two problems with respect to the broader statutory scheme.
first,interpreting f a to preclude judicial review would render the phrase as in effect before october,highly curious,and quite possibly surplusage.this is so because neither that phrase an amending parenthetical to f a nor the repeal of applies to aliens against whom the ins commenced deportation proceedings before april.see iirira c a providing that the amendments made by this subtitle shall not apply to an alien who is in deportation proceedings before the title effective date.since the amending parenthetical applies only to aliens whose deportation proceedings commenced after april,it applies only to those aliens whose orders of deportation are subject to.see iirira c and note to.because the amending parenthetical does not apply to any individual subject to an order of deportation governed by,it does not provide continued judicial review of amnesty denials to any aliens.
under the interpretation,f a sole function is to establish the rule that only individuals subject to orders of deportation reviewable pursuant to can obtain judicial review of amnesty denials.however,the addition of the amending parenthetical does not in any way change,limit,or further this result.indeed,the statute would have been more clear that review was only available to such individuals had congress never added the parenthetical.in sum,under the interpretation,the addition of the amending parenthetical does not seem to have any function.in light of judicial reluctance to read a statute to create surplusage,ratzlaf united states,d,and our charge to make sense of the statutory scheme as a whole,at,this argues against adopting the interpretation 
second,interpreting f a to bar review of amnesty denials would significantly negate a portion of a related statute enacted by congress in.see legal immigration family equity life act,stat,f.the life act permits qualified members of three class action suits to apply anew or in some cases for the first time for amnesty.id.the statute provides that the provisions of subparagraphs a and b of section f of the immigration and nationality act f shall apply to administrative or judicial review of a determination under this section or of a determination respecting an application for adjustment of status under section of the immigration and nationality act filed pursuant to this section.id.f.
we recognize the possibility that in certain instances a qualified class member may be subject to deportation proceedings commenced before april,and that review of that class member deportation order would continue to be governed by such that the class member would still have access to f a review under the interpretation.but congress incorporation by reference of f a surely demonstrates a belief that f a would provide judicial review for all class members covered by the life act and the expectation appears to have been that a good number of life act applicants were not subject to deportation proceedings beginning before april.otherwise,there would seem to be little reason for congress to expressly incorporate the confidentiality provision of provision designed primarily to protect aliens not yet in deportation the life act.the confidentiality provision evidences obvious concern for class members whose illegal status was still unknown to the ins,and who were not,therefore,already subject to orders of deportation 
put simply,in congress incorporated f a into the life act as a mechanism for providing judicial review for all individuals qualified to proceed through the amnesty process under that act.congress,therefore,understood f a to provide for judicial review of amnesty denials,and this understanding is entitled to significant weight.seatrain shipbuilding shell oil,d explaining that,although views of a subsequent congress as to the meaning of a statute can not overrule the unmistakable intent of the enacting one,they are entitled to significant weight.furthermore,t he general rule is that prior and later statutes dealing with the same subject matter should as far as reasonably possible be construed in harmony with each other so as to allow both to stand and to give force and effect to each.singer,at.the interpretation would create a discontinuity between irca and the life act thus,it is disfavored.
for these reasons,we believe that although when viewed narrowly both interpretations of f a are plausible,the interpretation does not make sense when viewed in light of the statutory scheme as a whole.the status quo interpretation,however,fits comfortably within the broader statutory landscape.this,without more,would likely tip the scales in favor of finding that f a provides for judicial review.see robinson,at.when analyzing statutory language,courts should reference the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.emphasis added.
the scales are not,however,weighted evenly in the present case.we conduct our analysis here subject to the presumption favoring interpretations of statutes that allow judicial review of administrative action haitian refugee,at.see also ins,d for the ins to prevail it must overcome the strong presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action catholic soc,at.declining to impute to congress an intent to preclude judicial review of the legality of ins action in an amnesty proceeding entirely because we will find an intent to preclude such judicial review of administrative action only if presented with clear and convincing evidence.internal quotations marks and citations omitted.we perceive no clear and convincing evidence that congress intended to preclude judicial review of amnesty determinations.to the contrary,all evidence suggests that congress added the parenthetical amendment to f a to ensure continued judicial review.
finally,we note that this conclusion avoids possible retroactivity concerns caused by stripping individuals of their latent right to judicial review,see cyr,at,without running counter to the intent of iirira.although iirira did limit judicial review in many respects,the theme of the legislation was protecting the attorney general discretionary decisions from judicial review,at.m any provisions of iirira are aimed at protecting the executive discretion from the,that can fairly be said to be the theme of the legislation.relief under irca is mandatory,not discretionary.the statute provides that the attorney general shall adjust the status of an alien if the alien meets the statutory requirements.a emphasis added.thus,our holding that f a provides judicial review going forward does not conflict with iirira theme.
for the above reasons,we conclude that courts of appeal continue to have jurisdiction to review amnesty determinations in individual cases,even when that review is sought pursuant to an order of deportation subject to.we therefore turn to address the merits.
the orqueras challenge the determination that they failed to show that they were in unlawful status because they were lawfully present in the united states pursuant to visas.orquera family comes under the umbrella coverage of his status as an visa holder and we therefore focus on the treatment of his application.
principally,the orqueras contend that the ins erred in interpreting its regulations to deny their applications for amnesty.congress has circumscribed our review of denials of amnesty applications,providing that 
j udicial review of an amnesty denial shall be based solely upon the administrative record established at the time of the review by the appellate authority and the findings of fact and determinations contained in such record shall be conclusive unless the applicant can establish abuse of discretion or that the findings are directly contrary to clear and convincing facts contained in the record considered as a whole.
the appellate authority in this case is the lau.moosa ins,cir we review the decision by the appellate authority,the lau,not that of the initial adjudicatory entity,the legalization director.we must regard the lau findings of fact and determinations as conclusive,unless the orqueras establish either that the lau abused its discretion,or that those findings are directly contrary to clear and convincing facts contained in the record considered as a whole.f b.
the lau concluded that,under the relevant regulation,an visa holder was not in unlawful status as of january,unless prior to that date the employment underlying the issuance of the visa had terminated,or the secretary of state had withdrawn recognition of the visa.the lau relied on ins regulations that identify categories of aliens eligible to file for amnesty,including 
a nonimmigrant who entered the united states for duration of status is one of the following classes,a,g,or,whose qualifying employment terminated or who ceased to be recognized by the department of state as being entitled to such classification prior to january,and who has thereafter continued to reside in the united states in unlawful status.
b emphasis added.applying this regulation to orquera,the lau concluded that orquera had failed to show that he was eligible for amnesty because he had not submitted evidence demonstrating that his qualifying employment terminated or that the state department had ceased to recognize his status as an visa holder prior to january.
the orqueras do not argue or point to any evidence in the record that would indicate that as of january,orquera did not have an visa,that his qualifying employment terminated,or that the secretary of state no longer recognized his visa.thus,the lau findings are certainly not directly contrary to clear and convincing facts contained in the record considered as a whole.
however,the orqueras apparently do contend that the lau abused its discretion in misinte
