khan hearing before the ij 
on november,an ij conducted a merits hearing in khan removal proceedings,at which khan testified.we describe khan testimony and evidence.
khan was born on december,in the village of shah dheri,in the swat district in pakistan.khan had a wife and seven children who,at the time of the hearing,had remained in pakistan but no longer resided in shah dheri instead,they lived with relatives in other towns.
the taliban became active in khan area of pakistan in,while khan was away working on a ship.when khan returned to shah dheri in january,he found that the taliban were forcing local residents to cut their hair and grow long beards,and that they were brainwashing young people via radio broadcasts.khan also stated that the taliban were kidnapping children to secure ransom money from their families.
khan testified that the taliban in fact blew up his daughter school in january.the taliban believed that girls should not attend school and that english should not be taught in schools.khan said that he kn e w the taliban was responsible for destroying this school because there is no one else who would have done it.he conceded that the taliban did not target his daughter school specifically because his daughter went there.khan view was that the taliban philosophy was completely wrong and very bad for the future generation.
khan testified that after returning home in january,he started secretly urging his neighbors in the village to make sure not to lose your freedom to taliban and not to allow your children to be influenced by them.khan also claimed that he went to the local police station ten to twenty times to report taliban activities that community members described to him,and that the police initially arrested taliban members based on this information,but later became ineffective.
khan learned from a friend that the taliban had held a meeting in a mosque where they discussed plans to blow up the local police station.upon learning this information,khan informed to the police and they thanked him polite ly the police then called the army,which put that area under surveillance and secure d it.khan conceded that the presence of the army improve d the situation in shah dheri,though he said the taliban remained secretly active.
khan testified that after he disclosed this taliban plot to the police,someone threw a letter attached to a stone at his house.khan submitted this letter into evidence with a translation it stated 
from taliban 
notice in the name of siraj ahmad 
you are getting informed by this notice and letter.that you do not pay money to local taliban nor do you feed them for one time meal.and you speak against us.and you are gathering with local police and army and spying on us.limit your actions,and quit that.if you did not quit that we will bomb you and your children.then you will know.there is no need for writing more.that is all.
from taliban commander shah dherai 
khan testified that the taliban had learned that he was speaking against them through their many spies,but also stated that he was initially careless in his activities concerning the taliban,and became more secretive after receiving the letter.khan took the letter to the police,who attempted to investigate,but they told khan that without knowing who had sent the letter they could not issue a bench warrant or take other action.
khan claimed that he continued attempting to unite the people and get a group against the taliban,but that his activities were ineffective because the people were afraid.on the morning of march,someone threw a grenade at khan house.khan heard a noise,awoke,and found the undetonated grenade,but it did not explode.khan called the police,who came to his home and collected the undetonated grenade.later that day,the police filed a report concerning the incident that khan submitted into evidence.the report recorded that a hand grenade had been recovered from the veranda of khan house,and that the grenade was thrown by some unknown terrorists.the report stated that the case had been registered and was being investigated.khan testified that the police took statements from witnesses,but were ultimately unable to catch the perpetrator of this attack because he remained unidentified.
khan testified that after this incident,he concluded that the they the taliban are not leaving me alone.he testified that over there once a person is a target that person is gone,most of the targets are destroyed.khan therefore decided to rejoin the ship on which he worked,and left pakistan on april.however,upon arriving in new york en route to rejoining his ship in bermuda,khan said he changed his mind and decided to stay in the united states because if he rejoined his ship,he would be with the ship for ten months and then he would go back home and it would be the same situation.khan admitted he left his wife and children in pakistan and came to the united states less than a month after,by his account,his family was put at risk by the undetonated grenade.he said he left because the danger to him was greater than the danger to his family,and if he had not left,his family would have starved.
khan has relatives living in islamabad and karachi.he claimed,however,that even if he relocated within pakistan,the taliban would find him because t he entire pakistan is in the hand of the taliban.when about this statement,khan backtracked and admitted that the taliban was secretly active in places such as islamabad and karachi,but not in control.he also conceded that the taliban can not find his children because they are with his other relatives in islamabad.
as for khan wife,she was living with her brothers in a village five kilometers away from shah dheri.khan testified that on one occasion,when his wife returned to their house in shah dheri,callers identifying themselves as commanders of the taliban called the house four or five times and told her you have to give us money.he also testified that they threaten ed her that we would kidnap your kids.khan stated that the objective of these callers was to get money.according to khan,a couple months later,the same people shot his house at night khan did not explain how he knew who shot his house,and he had stated in an affidavit only that his wife found bullet holes on the outside wall of their house.khan also conceded that the area around shah dheri was a war zone.
khan testified that after he left pakistan,the taliban blew up the police station in shah dheri.however,he conceded that the pakistani army took control of the swat area in and,where they were essentially at war with the taliban,and that the taliban was only secretly active staying in the mountains in the area.khan also admitted that neither his wife nor his children had been physically harmed by the taliban since he had left pakistan.
khan submitted,as corroborative evidence,a translated letter from his wife which stated that the taliban want ed to kill khan very soon and that they had threatened khan family and several times attacked our home.importantly,the affidavit did not mention the grenade incident,any threatening telephone calls,their house being shot at night,or that the taliban had blown up the local police station.specifically,it did not mention the threat supposedly made to khan wife to kidnap her children.khan attempted to excuse these omissions by claiming that the letter was written by the elderly people of the village who know the situation at the area and his wife just signed it.khan also submitted his own affidavit in support of his application,which failed to mention that the taliban had blown up the local police station 
b.the ij denial of khan application,and the bia affirmance of the ij decision on appeal 
on november,the ij denied khan claims for relief.the ij declined to make an adverse credibility finding regarding khan,but noted concerns about his credibility the ij did find that khan petition failed because of his failure to provide corroborating evidence or acceptably explain why he had not provided such evidence 
the ij also made independent findings to support denial.the ij noted that though khan application was purportedly based on his membership in a particular social group,he had not identified the social group to which he claimed to belong.to the extent khan asylum application was based on membership in the group of informants to the police,the ij concluded that informants do not constitute a particular social group.the ij also concluded that insofar as khan application was based on his political opinion,he had provided no evidence that the taliban knew he held this opinion.
importantly,the ij denial of khan application for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection was also based on grounds independent of any concerns about khan credibility and corroboration.the ij decision also went beyond the conclusion that khan had not shown his past or future mistreatment was or would be on account of his political opinion or membership in a particular social group.
the ij found that even if it credited the respondent testimony fully,it would find that he is not the victim of past persecution.the ij concluded that the threatening letter and the undetonated grenade incidents had not resulted in any harm and did not rise to the level of past persecution.in addition,the ij found that khan was victimized by the taliban and not by the government of pakistan,and that t he government does not appear to have been unable or unwilling to control the taliban.
as for khan alleged fear of future persecution,the ij found that khan did not have an objectively reasonable fear of returning to pakistan even i f his testimony had been credited fully.the ij noted that khan wife and children had remained in pakistan and had not been harmed.the ij also stated that in,the pakistani army had occupied the swat valley,where khan village was located,and that in any event neither karachi nor islamabad was controlled by the taliban,so that khan could relocate within pakistan to avoid persecution.finally,the ij determined that there was no connection between khan fear of future persecution and the pakistani government.because khan claim for asylum failed,the ij rejected his claim for withholding of removal.the ij also denied his cat claim because h is fear extends only to the taliban.
khan appealed to the bia,which dismissed his appeal on december.the bia affirmed the ij findings as to credibility and corroboration,and the bia also affirmed the ij determination that the respondent did not establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution even assuming that the respondent was credible.the bia noted the paucity of specific information about khan purported assistance to the police and about the motive for any mistreatment by the taliban.it found that the threatening letter and undetonated grenade thrown at khan house did not amount to past persecution,given that khan did not in response move out immediately,and that khan fear of future persecution was not,since his family continued to live in pakistan and had not been harmed.the bia also found that the record does not show that the respondent would not be able to relocate in pakistan or that the pakistani government would not assist or protect the respondent from the taliban.the bia affirmed the denial of khan claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection.
where the bia issues its own opinion,we review both that opinion and any portion of the ij opinion that the bia adopted.ouk gonzales,cir.we review the bia determinations under the deferential substantial evidence standard,id.at,which means we will uphold these determinations unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary,b b.
to be eligible for asylum,an applicant must be a refugee,id.b a,who is unwilling or unable to return to his home country due to persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,id.a a.a showing of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of a fear of future persecution.nelson ins,cir.
on petition for review,khan argues that the bia erred in failing to accord him a rebuttable presumption of credibility,and in rejecting his argument that his persecution was or would be on account of his imputed political opinion.as said,the ij and bia decisions rested on alternate grounds as well,independent of these grounds,and we do not address these arguments 
khan also argues that the bia erred in concluding that the pakistani government could protect him from the taliban his past treatment did not rise to the level of persecution his fear of future persecution was not and he could reasonably relocate within pakistan to avoid persecution.because we reject khan argument that the agency was compelled to find a government nexus that could support a finding of persecution,we need not address the agency finding that khan past treatment did not rise to the level of persecution.though the lack of a government connection also dooms khan claim of a fear of future persecution,we conclude that the agency finding that no such fear existed was independently supported by substantial evidence,including its determination that khan had not demonstrated he could not reasonably relocate within pakistan.
a.the bia determination that khan had not established the pakistani government would not assist or protect him 
khan first argument is that no reasonable person could find he had failed to meet his burden to show a connection between his mistreatment in the swat valley in and the pakistani government.persecution always implies some connection to government action or inaction,harutyunyan gonzales,cir,and violence by private citizens,absent proof that the government is unwilling or unable to address it,is not persecution,butt keisler,cir.as we explained in burbiene holder,cir,where a government is making every effort to combat violence by private actors,and its inability to stop the problem is not distinguishable from any other government struggles,the private violence has no government nexus and does not constitute persecution.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we have been particularly unwilling to overturn a finding of no government connection where the local authorities have appropriately responded to incidents of violence.see ortiz araniba keisler,cir.
khan claims that he presented compelling evidence of pakistan inability to protect him from the taliban.in reality,khan testified that the pakistani police responded to his information about taliban activities by arresting taliban members and calling on the pakistani army to secure the area,and he conceded that this improve d the situation.he also testified that after the taliban sent him a threatening letter and threw a grenade,which did not detonate,at his house,the local police wrote reports,took witness statements,and attempted to investigate,but were stymied by the fact that the identities of the perpetrators remained unknown.khan also conceded that the pakistani army took control of the
