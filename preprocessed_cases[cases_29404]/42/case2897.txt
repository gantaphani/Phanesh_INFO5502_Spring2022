maricella bosibore onsongo,a citizen of kenya,petitions for review of a board of immigration appeals bia decision affirming the immigration judge ij denial of onsongo application for asylum,withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture cat.onsongo submitted the application after the immigration and naturalization service ins charged her with being removable for overstaying a visitor visa.for the reasons discussed below,we deny onsongo petition.
background 
onsongo was the sole witness to testify before the ij.according to her testimony at the may hearing,onsongo has five children and formerly was married to john nyangeri,a kenyan man and the father of her children.her children and nyangeri still live in kenya,and she has kept in regular contact with nyangeri while in the united states.in,onsongo joined the democratic party dp,an opposition party in kenya dedicated to protecting human rights,and served as treasurer of the local branch.kenyan government officials routinely harassed her and other members of the dp.in police arrested onsongo and her brother at their farm,beat them,and left them in jail for two weeks under horrible conditions.in,police arrested onsongo at the store she owned and operated,beat and raped her,and left her in jail for seven days before releasing her.onsongo store was burned down as well,an act she believed was committed by government officials.two days after her release from prison in,onsongo registered her marriage to nyangeri,with whom she had been in a relationship since.five days later she applied for a united states visitor visa.onsongo told consular officers that she was coming to the united states for a visit,but she did not tell them she was fleeing kenya.
on,onsongo testified that the group to which she belonged was democratic party human rights,a human rights organization separate from the dp.according to onsongo,she was involved in creating this organization in order to put it with the democratic party so that we can have more money possibly.the group engaged in various activities to oppose abuses by the kenyan government,including looking after people who were harassed by the government,fighting for people lives,collecting money for eventual action against the government,and holding strategy meetings.the group also had political candidates run under its name,although it was not a political party.
upon questioning from the ij,onsongo said the name of the organization was actually human rights africa hra.however,throughout onsongo testimony and in her corroborating evidence,the group is referred to by many different names onsongo claimed to be one of the original hra members since its inception in.she feared persecution upon her return to kenya on account of her past involvement in hra opposition activities,despite the fact that the dp has been part of the kenyan government ruling coalition since and the leader of the dp,mwai kibaki,is now the president of kenya.
onsongo corroborating evidence at the first hearing included two letters.the first was an april,letter from an unnamed chief of location,chief stating that since onsongo had been a member of the group fighting for the human rights.the second was a letter from onsongo kenyan lawyers stating that she used to belong to human rights group.onsongo also submitted a document from the senior resident magistrate court at nakuru detailing a criminal proceeding stemming from her arrest.according to the court document,onsongo had been arrested in august,along with many other people,while participating in an illegal meeting she had organized as an official of the said human rights group.the court document also indicated that the chief had testified against her in the proceeding 
at the end of the hearing,the ij expressed concern about significant gaps in onsongo testimony and about the authenticity of some of the supporting documentation.consequently,the ij requested that the ins determine the authenticity of the court document.the ij continued the hearing to allow onsongo to produce objective corroboration of the existence of hra,of her membership and leadership roles in the dp and hra,and of the abuse she suffered related to her dp membership.
at the october continued hearing,onsongo new corroborating evidence included a different april,letter from the chief and a letter from the chairman of hra confirming onsongo membership and position as treasurer in human right sic kenya chapter.the evidence also included a dp membership card,with onsongo name misspelled,and an original members list for african human rights kenya chapter that included onsongo name.the ij expressed continuing concern about the authenticity of the documents.he also noted that many of onsongo documents from different people and organizations apparently had been sent from the same post office box in kenya.in explanation,onsongo stated that the chief,the dp,hra,and her husband all shared box.as for the two april,letters from the chief,onsongo said she could not offer an explanation to address the ij concerns,which included suspicion that the letters were signed by two different people.onsongo attempted no explanation to address the ij concerns about her other corroborating evidence.finally,she said that she had simply neglected to contact the dp for evidence that the ij had requested to corroborate the existence of hra and her involvement in hra and the dp.the ins did not provide forensic evidence on the authenticity of the court document,and the issue was not addressed at the second hearing.
in his written opinion,the ij concluded that this is an incredible claim,deserving of no credence.he noted onsongo shift in testimony from her role in the dp to her role in hra and her failure to produce objective corroboration of her prominent role in either group or of the identity and activities of hra.the ij also found that much of onsongo corroborating evidence ha d all the hallmarks of fraud.specifically,he noted that the court document contained numerous misspellings and,and bore more than a passing typographical resemblance to the letter from onsongo lawyers.he also found it suspicious that the chief,who testified against her in the criminal proceeding,would then write to support her application for asylum.the ij was equally concerned about the authenticity of the letters from the chief because they gave no name for the chief,vaguely referred to a human rights group,were dated the same day,had slightly different signatures,and one was notarized by the commissioner of oats while the other was not.he was also suspicious about the letter purportedly from the chairman of hra because the letterhead had a different name for the human rights group than did the body of the letter.finally,the ij noted that the return envelopes from the chief,hra,the dp and onsongo husband all bore the address box,the same box as onsongo last residence and business mailing addresses.as a result,the ij concluded that onsongo claim was not credible.
in addition to the adverse credibility finding,the ij concluded that even if onsongo had established past persecution based on a protected ground,the dp ascendance to a position in kenya ruling coalition and kibaki position as president of kenya suggested that she would no longer have a fear of future persecution in kenya.this was particularly so because onsongo had reported to kibaki when he was dp president and she was local dp treasurer.accordingly,the ij denied asylum,withholding of removal and cat relief.the bia found no clear error in the ij adverse credibility finding and did not discuss the alternative finding 
ii.discussion 
the attorney general has discretion to grant asylum to a refugee,defined as an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to her home country because of past persecution or a fear of future persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group or political opinion.falaja gonzales,cir see a,b.as the wording of the statute indicates,the alien must show not only persecution or a fear of persecution,but also that such persecution is on account of one of the five protected grounds.hassan ashcroft,cir see also gomez gonzales,cir to reverse the finding that the alleged persecution was not based on a protected ground,it is necessary that the record compel the finding that a protected ground motivated the persecution.
we defer to the ij findings of fact and disposition of the case unless the record evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the petitioner eligible for asylum,withholding of deportation,or relief under the convention against torture.habtemicael ashcroft,cir quoting ins,d see also b b.we must affirm the ij decision if it is supported by substantial evidence in the record,and we defer to the ij credibility finding when it is supported by specific,cogent reasons for disbelief.gonzales,cir.in this case,we conclude that the ij adverse credibility finding was not erroneous because onsongo inconsistent testimony,her suspect corroborating evidence,and her failure to provide additional,specifically requested corroborating evidence all support the finding.
first,the ij offered specific,cogent reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record for his finding that onsongo testimony was not credible.although an ij may not base an adverse credibility determination on speculation or conjecture,cao gonzales,cir,he may base an adverse credibility finding on the implausibility of an alien testimony,as long as the ij gives specific and convincing reasons for disbelief,mamana gonzales,cir.this court considers whether a reasonable factfinder would be compelled by the record to credit the disputed testimony.id.at.while minor inconsistencies and omissions will not support an adverse credibility determination,inconsistencies or omissions that relate to the basis of persecution are not minor but are at the heart of the asylum claim.jalloh gonzales,cir quoting kondakova ashcroft,cir.
onsongo argues that it was unreasonable for the ij to focus almost entirely on the technical area of the relationship between the dp and hra to the exclusion of her other testimony and to require her to explain the fairly complex relationship between the two groups and her role in them she also argues that the ij engaged in speculation when he concluded that her testimony on these issues was not credible.we find these arguments unconvincing.far from being a technical or peripheral detail,onsongo testimony on these issues goes to the basis of her past persecution and fear of future persecution and,thus,the heart of her asylum claim.in addition,rather than speculating about the basis of her past persecution and fear of future persecution,from very early in the first hearing the ij repeatedly asked onsongo for clarification as to whether she was involved in the dp or hra,what the relationship was between the organizations,and why she was using different names for hra.when onsongo explanations failed to resolve the inconsistencies in her testimony,the ij continued the hearing to give her an additional opportunity to explain and support her testimony.he properly discredited the testimony when onsongo additional explanations failed to provide sufficient clarification.see fofanah,at upholding an adverse credibility finding that was based on inconsistencies and inadequacies in the most critical portions of petitioner testimony jalloh,at upholding an adverse credibility finding where the petitioner had not presented convincing explanations for discrepancies and inconsistencies.
onsongo further argues that the ij erred by not identifying specific areas of her story that were clearly false,and contends that her story was plausible.we reject these arguments because an ij need not find testimony clearly false before making an adverse credibility determination,so long as the determination is supported by specific,cogent reasons.further,even if onsongo can reconstruct a plausible version of her account from the record,that fact does not compel the conclusion that the ij erred in finding her testimony implausible.krouchevski ashcroft,cir holding that where credibility determinations are concerned,a reviewing court should not supersede an agency finding simply because an alternative finding could also be supported rejecting petitioner post hoc interpretations of his testimony.thus,substantial evidence in the record supports the ij finding that onsongo testimony was not credible 
second,substantial evidence in the record supports the ij finding that onsongo corroborating evidence was not credible because it bore hallmarks of fraud.an ij may base an adverse credibility determination upon submission of fraudulent documents if the petitioner fails to offer a legitimate explanation for the suspected fraud.ambroise gonzales,cir per curiam see bropleh gonzales,cir affirming an ij adverse credibility finding based in part on the submission of a fraudulent document.
onsongo argues that the ij erred in concluding that her corroborating evidence bore hallmarks of fraud because the ins failed to provide forensic evidence to support the conclusion.however,forensic evidence of fraud is not necessary where,as here,the documents bore readily identifiable indications of fraud.see,bropleh,at noting that an ij finding that the petitioner had altered his passport did not require a forensic expert where the passport had been selectively burned in an area where evidence of a visa application would be found.
in concluding that onsongo corroborating evidence was not reliable,the ij identified irregularities that were clearly evident from the face of her supporting documents the use of box by numerous people and same box that onsongo listed as her mailing address striking typographical similarities between documents purportedly from different sources numerous errors and misspellings in the court document the use of many different names for hra,including a different name in the heading and the body of a letter supposedly from the chairman of hra and different signatures on two letters dated the same day,supposedly sent from the same unnamed chief.onsongo attempted explanations for only two of these concerns she speculated that the different signatures on the letters from the chief may have been the result of a practice of different people in the office signing such letters,and she claimed that numerous people and organizations used box.we agree with the ij that onsongo explanations were unconvincing.onsongo explanation about the letters was admittedly speculation and did not address the many other questionable aspects of the letters.likewise,her explanation that private individuals and major political parties share the same post office box is not plausible.further,onsongo made no effort at the hearing to allay the ij concerns that her other corroborating evidence also contained indicators of fraud,and she makes no effort to confront these concerns on appeal.thus,the record supports the ij finding that onsongo corroborating evidence was not credible.
third,substantial evidence in the record supports the ij finding that onsongo failed to produce specifically requested corroborating evidence.this court has recognized that it is often difficult for petitioners to obtain documentation from their home country.ombongi gonzales,cir.however,lack of corroboration,particularly from friendly sources,combined with other credibility issues,can provide support for an adverse credibility finding.see also hoxha gonzales,cir noting that corroborative evidence is not required to support an asylum application,but failure to present corroborating evidence that should be readily accessible to the alien is a reasoned factor for the ij to consider in assessing credibility.
onsongo argues that the ij erred in basing the adverse credibility finding on her failure to produce the specific evidence requested because she did present additional corroborating evidence that supported her story.she contends she produced the best corroborating evidence she could,and simply could not obtain the exact documentation the ij required.however,even assuming the evidence onsongo did submit objectively corroborated her testimony,the ij properly found that evidence unreliable as discussed above.as for the
