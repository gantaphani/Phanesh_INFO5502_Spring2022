factual and procedural background 
airport interview 
thu is a native and citizen of burma,which is also known as the union of myanmar.he arrived in new york at john kennedy airport on september,with a false passport,after having made stops in singapore and germany.although his native language is burmese,thu was interviewed in english at the airport by an officer of the united states customs and border protection an asylum officer because he said that he spoke english and a little japanese.app.at.when asked why he was visiting the united states,thu stated,i want to escape burma for me and my family.i can not do anything in burma because i have no military friends and the military controls all the jobs.id.in response to whether the burmese government threatened him,thu replied,if i go back to burma,they will hurt me sometime.id.in response to whether he had ever been arrested,thu answered no.the final questions at the interview were documented as follows 
q.why did you leave you r home country or country of last residence 
i do not like the laws and rules in burma.
do you have any fear or concern about being returned to your home country or being removed from the united states 
yes i am afraid to return to burma.
would you be harmed if you are returned to your home country or country of last residence 
a.the police hurt me last time.
do you have any questions or is there anything else you would like to add 
app.at.although thu indicated that the burmese police hurt him last time,the asylum officer did not further pursue that subject.
credible fear interview 
thu was detained at the elizabeth detention center in elizabeth,new jersey,where he was interviewed by another asylum officer on september.during that interview,which was intended to aid in determining whether thu had a credible fear of future persecution,thu spoke burmese and was assisted by an interpreter.early in the interview,he revealed that he had a cousin named thu hein who lived in miami,florida.the asylum officer notes go on to indicate that thu spoke about why he feared returning to burma.he said that his father had been arrested in,imprisoned for three and years,and tortured for being an elected member of the national league for democracy nld political party.although thu said that he was not himself a member of the nld,he did participate in in demonstrations against the burmese government.those demonstrations took place in japan,and thu distributed leaflets,protested when the prime minister of burma came to japan to speak at the burmese embassy,and wrote a letter to president george bush asking for the united states to intervene and help the people in burma.
thu claimed that he illegally returned to burma in early.he stated that he could not return to burma legally,or return to his hometown to work,because he was afraid the government would be aware of his political activities in japan.app.at.thu left burma again in september because he feared getting arrested after a friend who returned to burma with him in was arrested on the basis of political activities in japan.regarding his fear of arrest because of his own political activities in japan,thu stated 
after my friend arrest i got scared and left the country.therefore,if i go back i will be arrested and imprisoned for protesting against the government in japan.my prison time would be up to years.i was afraid to be active in burma because of what happened to my father and my friend.however,i was active in japan.i can not go back to burma.
in sum,thu explained his fear of returning to burma as being based on,first,the imprisonment and torture of his father for engaging in political protest in burma,second,his own political activities in japan,and,third,the arrest of his friend for engaging in political activities similar to his in japan.at the end of the credible fear interview,the asylum officer found that thu had established a c redible fear of persecution,and that t here is a significant possibility that the assertions underlying thu claim could be found credible in a full asylum or withholding of removal hearing.app.at.
asylum application 
on october,thu filed an asylum application.on the application,thu indicated that he was not fluent in english.thu also recounted his father imprisonment,and stated that when he was in japan he supported and worked with members of the nld.while explaining his father political involvement,thu also stated that thu hein,whom he had earlier said was his cousin but whom he now identified as his brother,was interrogated and briefly detained in burma by government officials.thu hein fled burma in and received political asylum in the united states in.
thu was in thailand in when his father was arrested.he described his travels and activities after that 
i returned to burma for a brief period and then went to singapore where i remained for years.in i returned to burma where i worked as a car broker.i got married in and had a daughter in.i was active in underground groups beginning in when i helped organize and spread information about what the burmese government was really doing.i was fearful of being arrested so i moved around a lot and did remain at home with my wife that often.
thu then described,for the first time,his own arrest in burma 
in july while distributing leaflets in bo kyaw market in yangon i was arrested by local police in civilian clothes who noticed what i was doing.i was handcuffed and taken away in their car to the local police station in mingala tun nyunt toownshsip sic.i was detained for two weeks.after arriving at the police station i was interrogated.i did not answer their questions so they became angry with me.they punched me in the face and chest,they kicked me in my back and shoulders with their boots and they threw glass at me.after two weeks i was released after signing a statement that i would no longer engage in political activities.
by using a fake name,thu obtained a burmese passport in and left burma for japan in november.thu stayed in japan until january.as described in his credible fear interview,thu was involved in political protests against burma while in japan,and he participated in nld meetings and prepared pamphlets and leaflets describing the human rights abuses in burma.thu said he secretly returned to burma in january because he missed his wife and daughter.
in september,thu learned that two fellow activists,who had returned with him to burma from japan,had been arrested and imprisoned.these activists had demonstrated with thu at the burmese embassy in japan and had worked with him in the underground movement in burma after they returned.fearing for his safety,thu fled burma on september,headed for the united states.
immigration hearing 
on january,thu participated in an immigration hearing.he testified in burmese and had the aid of a translator.at the outset of the hearing,he amended his written statement to add two details and to correct the spelling of his daughter name on direct examination,thu again explained the circumstances of his arrest and imprisonment,which he indicated resulted from his distributing leaflets for the nld.thu described how he was arrested by three policemen in civilian clothing who transported him by car to a police station.upon arrival,they asked him why he was distributing the literature and who had asked him to distribute it.while he was being interrogated,two police recruits hit him with their fists and kicked him in the back.thu said he remained imprisoned for two weeks.
thu also recounted his activities in japan with the burma democratic action group bda political party.his lawyer submitted into evidence a letter dated december,on bda letterhead by nyi zaw the zaw letter,political adviser to the bda,that stated that thu was a bda group member when he was in japan,and that thu and zaw were very strong supporters of nld moments sic in japan.app.at.the letter also states that thu and zaw helped to organize and participate in burmese movements in japan together.id.
thu then described how he left japan in to return to burma.he stated that because he missed his family,he decided to risk being arrested in burma for his activities in japan.direct examination ended with thu stating that if he were to return to burma,he would be arrested,just as his two fellow activists were arrested prior to his departure.
during,the lawyer for the department of homeland security dhs focused on thu representations in his asylum application that he returned to burma for a brief period after his father arrest in thailand.app.at.the dhs lawyer asked a series of questions implying that,if thu father arrest made thu afraid of the burmese government,thu would not have returned to burma right after that arrest.thu responded that he did not return to burma,but instead went directly from thailand to singapore because once the military took power,he was not able to go back to burma.when asked to explain why his written statement stated that he returned to burma,thu said that he used a dictionary when reading the statement for accuracy and must not have understood the sentence clearly,as he thought it implied that he was not able to go back to burma at that time.
when the dhs lawyer and ij demanded more explanation for this perceived discrepancy,thu stated that perhaps the misstatement was due to mistranslation or to his own misunderstanding.the ij asked how it could be due to a mistranslation,and thu stated that perhaps the written statement reflected a mistranslation by the asylum officer or interpreter.that response rightly struck the ij as odd,since the statement was not prepared by the asylum officer but by thu and his lawyer.the ij clarified with thu which document was being referred to and that the written statement had been provided by thu and his lawyer,not an asylum officer.thu responded that,either way,the information in the statement was incorrect because he did not return to burma prior to moving to singapore.apparently unsatisfied with thu response that the written statement contained a mistake,the ij then instructed the dhs lawyer to ask thu a third time why the statement was different from his testimony.upon being asked a third time,thu stated that w hen i read that sentence,my understanding of the sentence is that the situation in burma was so deteriorating that i could not go back to burma,that was what i understand.app.at.
thu was also asked on why he had indicated during his airport interview that he had never been arrested in burma.thu stated that he was confused during the questioning and thought that the time frame he was being questioned about was between january and september.he also stated that he was very excited during questioning and his english was not good.furthermore,thu stated that he was afraid of the officer from within his heart,and feared that,if he mentioned being arrested,the officer would not like his answer.app.at.
thu also testified that he was afraid to disclose the arrest during his credible fear interview.thu explained that he disclosed the arrest in his asylum application and at the hearing because he had met with his lawyer and his lawyer had told him that he should disclose everything.
finally,thu was asked why he had stated in his credible fear interview that thu hein was his cousin,instead of his brother.he answered,i was afraid that because of me he might be in trouble.that was why i did not mention him as my blood brother so if we are not brothers,then if something happened to me happen sic then i will be the only person that have to face that problems sic.app.at.
e.the ij decision 
at the conclusion of the january,hearing,the ij denied thu claims and ordered him removed.the ij based her decision on a finding that thu was not credible in his testimony.in particular,the ij was troubled by the discrepancy between thu testimony and his written statement about whether he had returned to burma in.the ij found it completely incredible that thu could interpret a statement,i returned to burma,as anything other than saying i returned to burma.app.at.the ij disbelief was also based on thu having made amendments to his written statement at the beginning of his hearing but not changing the statement about returning to burma the ij acknowledged that on redirect there was testimony that,one week before trial,thu met with his lawyer to discuss his case and clarified that he had not returned to burma prior to moving to singapore from thailand.the ij,however,stated that i do have to rely on what happened a week before the hearing.i am entitled to rely on what the respondent told me under oath at the beginning of the hearing on january of.app.at.
the ij also noted thu failure to disclose the arrest during his airport interview and credible fear interview.she described the arrest as the centerpiece of any past persecution claim since that would have been the only time the respondent suffered any personal problem with the burmese government.app.at.according to the ij,thu explanation that he was afraid to disclose the arrest at the airport interview would have been plausible if thu had not also failed to mention it at his credible fear interview,where,with a translator,he was told to disclose all significant events and that the information would be kept confidential.the ij viewed the lack of documentation about the arrest as important,suggesting that some documents or statements should have been forthcoming from his family in burma to corroborate his arrest.
the ij further found that if she ignored the arrest and the credibility issues associated with thu testimony about it,and focused only on his activities in japan with the bda and the nld and the subsequent arrest of his fellow demonstrators upon returning to burma from japan,those political activities and consequences were not enough to establish a fear of persecution.as support for that finding,the ij reasoned that there was no proof that the burmese government knows or cares that thu demonstrated outside of the burmese embassy in japan and supported the bda.furthermore,the ij said,because thu had no corroborating evidence to show that his fellow demonstrators were arrested,their arrest could be fictional,and,even if the arrests did occur,that did not mean that thu would be arrested if he returned to burma.the ij concluded that,if she were to assume that thu was arrested in and later worked with the bda in japan,thu case would be stronger,and she could find that he had established a fear of future persecution.
the ij also denied thu application for withholding of removal.she reasoned that thu failure to show a fear of persecution,which is the standard for receiving asylum,meant that he necessarily also failed to meet the higher standard necessary for withholding of removal.the ij denied thu claim under the cat because she found that he was not credible or persuasive in showing that it is more likely than not that the burmese government would torture him upon his return.
f.the bia decision 
on june,the bia dismissed thu appeal.the bia held that the ij had identified inconsistencies in thu testimony that were not convincingly explained and that the ij credibility determination was therefore not clearly erroneous.the bia specifically noted thu failure to reveal his arrest during the airport interview and credible fear interview as being a significant omission,and mentioned thu inability to corroborate his arrest by having family members in burma send pertinent documentation.
thu now petitions this court for review of the bia decision.
