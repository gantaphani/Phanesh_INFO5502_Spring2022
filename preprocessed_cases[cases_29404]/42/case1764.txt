the petitioner seeks review of a removal order,contending that his prior conviction for filing a false federal tax return did not constitute a removable offense.we deny the petition for review.
joel pleaded guilty to violating by knowingly filing a false tax return the department of homeland security thereafter instituted removal proceedings,charging that was removable pursuant to a a iii for having been convicted of an aggravated felony within the meaning of a m.subsection m defines an aggravated felony as an offense that i involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds or ii is described in section of title relating to tax evasion in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds.the immigration judge ordered removed,and the board of immigration appeals affirmed the removal order.
contends that his tax offense is not an aggravated felony as defined by subsection m i.he first asserts that subsection m i does not apply to any federal tax offenses because subsection m ii specifically identifies tax evasion,and only tax evasion,thereby reflecting congressional intent that no other tax offense qualifies as an aggravated felony.he additionally argues that,even if m i includes knowingly filing a false federal tax return,there is no competent evidence that the amount of loss was or more.
we are not the first court to consider whether a federal tax offense other than tax evasion may constitute an aggravated felony under a m.a divided panel of the third circuit concluded in lee ashcroft that it may not the ninth circuit reached the opposite conclusion in kawashima gonzales expressly rejecting the majority reasoning in lee.the arguments supporting each opposing view have been cogently considered by the third circuit in the majority and dissenting opinions in lee and by the ninth circuit in kawashima.we agree with now justice alito and the ninth circuit construction of subsection m i.
the text of subsection m i is straightforward and unambiguous.the term aggravated felony means an offense that i involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds willfully and knowingly signing and filing a false federal tax return unquestionably involves fraud or deceit,and courts have concluded that the federal government is a victim within the meaning of m i the difficulty in construing m i is the immediately succeeding subsection or ii is described in section of title relating to tax evasion in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds.the third circuit concluded that this more specific reference to tax evasion and the juxtaposition of the two subsections rendered subsection m i less than plain and unambiguous.that court turn ed to the traditional tools of statutory construction,concluding that subsection m ii would be mere surplusage if subsection m i included tax offenses because the government has not identified,and we are unable to envision a case where a conviction for tax evasion would not involve fraud or deceit,and that the principle that the specific governs the general also favors the interpretation that subsection m ii identifies the only removable tax offense,tax evasion,while subsection m i does not apply to tax offenses.the third circuit also reasoned that for congress to select tax evasion as the only aggravated tax felony,justifying removal of an alien who committed it,while sparing lesser tax felons,is thoroughly consistent with the history and structure of criminal tax offenses.in support of this conclusion,lee cites the supreme court decision in spies united states characterizing tax evasion as the capstone of tax law violations,the climax of this variety of sanctions and the serious and inclusive felony.the third circuit decided that congress intent is clear,and t o the extent that any ambiguity lingers,we note that there is a longstanding principle of construing any lingering ambiguities in deportation statutes in favor of the alien.
we are persuaded,however,that congress did not intend to single out tax evasion under for inclusion among aggravated felonies to the exclusion of all other tax felonies.we also conclude that subsection m i is unambiguous.congress may well have seen subsection m ii as a necessary addition to subsection m since neither fraud nor deceit is a specific element of the crime of tax evasion under as both the dissent in lee and the ninth circuit recognized moreover,it is difficult to discern why congress would want only a violation of involving or more to constitute an aggravated felony,but not tax felonies involving fraud and deceit and the same amount of loss to the government fisc.although the maximum term of imprisonment for a violation of is five years,while the maximum prison term for a violation of is three years,both are serious crimes carrying the same maximum fines.
we respectfully part company with lee in this regard,including its reliance on spies united states the third circuit reasoned that in spies the supreme court described the felony defined in former b as the capstone of tax law violations,and t hus,for congress to select tax evasion as the aggravated tax felony,justifying removal of an alien who committed it,while sparing lesser tax felons,is thoroughly consistent with the history and structure of criminal tax offenses.the spies decision focused on the acts necessary to make out the felony under section b of the revenue act of and those which may make out the misdemeanor under section a.the two provisions were similarly worded the supreme court references to tax evasion as the capstone and the climax of this variety of sanctions must be considered in this context,as distinguishing the elements of the misdemeanor offense from those of the felony offense,not as comparing felony tax evasion with other felony tax offenses.indeed,was not enacted until,eleven years after spies was decided in.
the supreme court recently quoted the capstone statement that appears in spies regarding but also noted that,criminalizing the willful filing of a tax return believed to be materially false is a related provision.the court further observed in boulware that it is arguable that the nature and character of the funds received can be critical in determining whether has been violated,even if proof of a tax deficiency required under is unnecessary.the court did not resolve the question,and of course,the court was not construing a m.but the court discussion does support our conclusion that the capstone argument advanced by the third circuit does not have the import that our sister court ascribes to it.
other circuit courts have noted,correctly,that under some circumstances,a conviction for a violation of may merge into a conviction under as a lesser included offense but the corollary is that merger is not always appropriate.section is a separate offense that is separately punishable from a violation of,unless there is also a violation of and the violation was incidental thereto.
there is no indication in the tax code that,which addresses tax evasion,is the preferred means of prosecuting felony tax offenses.we can not agree that congress intended to exclude tax offenses involving fraud and deceit from a m i when it included a specific reference to in m ii.
accordingly,a conviction under for filing a false tax return constitutes an aggravated felony for purposes of a m if that offense involved a loss of or more.
contends there is no evidence that his tax offense involved or more because the judgment of conviction does not mention the amount of actual loss.he asserts that it was error to rely on the investigation report psr,prepared in the tax offense proceedings,as evidence of the amount of loss in his immigration proceedings.asserts that the psr must be excluded under the categorical approach of examining prior convictions and that the psr admission into evidence and reliance upon it was problematic for a number of other reasons.we first consider the pertinence of the categorical approach.
the judgment in the tax offense prosecution does not reference any amount of loss,and the plea agreement in that criminal case was not made part of the record in the immigration proceedings.however,the psr prepared in connection with tax offense conviction states that plea agreement determined the total amount of loss to be for the years and detailed the amounts of loss for each of those years.
this court had occasion to consider whether use of a psr was proper in determining the amount of loss under a m i in james gonzales james had pled guilty to one count involving a transaction with a credit union in the amount of only we held that s ince aiding and abetting bank fraud does not itself define a monetary threshold,we look beyond the statute to the record of conviction.we cited the third circuit decision in singh with approval for the proposition that we are not confined to the formal categorical approach of taylor united when determining if an offense involved loss to the victim or victims in excess of.as explained in this court decision in james and the third circuit decision in singh,an amount of loss suffered by a victim is rarely an element of a criminal offense it seems highly unlikely that congress intended for a m i to apply only to convictions under statutes that included a monetary loss to a victim in excess of as an element of the offense.for example,congress itself has not included monetary loss to victims in defining a number of crimes involving fraud or deceit,such as bank fraud a conviction may be obtained for bank fraud under by proving the statutory elements.the amount of loss to the victim is a matter that is considered for sentencing purposes.as a matter of statutory construction,its seems that congress intended for the inquiry under a a iii and a m to be whether,as a categorical matter,the alien was convicted of an offense that involves fraud or deceit as an element of the offense or that the offense necessarily entails fraud or deceit the requirement that the offense was one in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds is a factual matter to be determined from the record of conviction,but the amount of loss is not required to be an element of the conviction itself.
we do not quarrel with the dissent observation that we have applied the categorical or modified categorical approach in the immigration context we have done so,however,when determining the nature or elements of the offense of but not the amount of loss the categorical and modified categorical approaches are standards for establishing the fact of prior convictions,turning on the basis of trial or plea.they are the supreme court pragmatic conclusion about the best way to identify generic convictions,while respecting congress adoption of a categorical criterion that avoids subsequent evidentiary enquiries into the factual basis for the earlier conviction.the modified categorical approach accordingly restricts the documents that may be consulted to determine whether a conviction was for a generic offense,and the focus is,properly,on the conviction.
when the amount of loss to a victim is not an element of an offense,the focus should not be limited to the conviction itself.the amount of loss is relevant in a criminal prosecution primarily,if not exclusively,to sentencing.when a tribunal subsequently examines,for collateral purposes like those here,the amount of loss resulting from an offense,the reason for applying the modified categorical approach does not fully obtain our inquiry should be guided by the statute that initiates that inquiry.the immigration and nationality act provides that the government has the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that,in the case of an alien who has been admitted to the united states,the alien is deportable.the act further specifies,no decision on deportability shall be valid unless it is based upon reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence.we should determine,therefore,whether there was clear and convincing evidence that prior conviction involved an amount of loss greater than and whether the evidence establishing that the conviction involved such a loss was reasonable,substantial,and probative.these are the standards that apply in determining whether the bia erred in relying on the psr to determine the amount of loss.
we recognize that there is disagreement among the circuit courts as to how the amount of loss involved in a prior criminal conviction may be ascertained in civil removal proceedings.the ninth circuit has held that the amount of loss must be admitted by a defendant or found by the trier of fact in the prior criminal prosecution similarly,the second circuit permit s the bia to remove only those aliens who have actually or necessarily pleaded in the underlying criminal proceedings to the elements of a removable offense,including the requirement our court has construed the statute differently,and we believe correctly,in james 
based on the facts of this case,there is clear and convincing evidence that the psr accurately reflected the amount of loss.an addendum to the psr reflects that had no objections to the psr.the psr additionally states that a probation officer interviewed regarding the report and that agreed with the chart in the report showing the tax losses by year,including a loss of for.the district court adopted the psr factual findings.does not dispute that he agreed to the facts set forth in the psr including,specifically,the fact that the amounts of loss for each year were part of the plea agreement and that they totaled in excess of for each year.failure to object to these facts in the psr,his admission that they were correct,and the district court adoption of these facts is clear and convincing evidence that the loss to the government was in excess of.
the dissent cites several decisions in support of its conclusion that the bia can not consider a psr in determining the amount of loss.the first decision on which the dissent relies is gonzales from this court but that case had nothing to do with an amount of loss.the issue was whether a prior kansas conviction was a crime of violence within the meaning of b,specifically,whether intentionally causing physical contact with another person with a deadly weapon in a rude,insulting or angry manner clearly involves a substantial risk that physical force against another person may be used.
the dissent cites the second circuit decision in department of homeland security,but as discussed above,that circuit has chosen to treat the amount of loss essentially as an element of the underlying conviction.this circuit has not.
the eleventh circuit held in obasohan attorney general also cited by the dissent,that an amount of loss must be charged and proven or admitted by the defendant in the underlying criminal proceedings.although the breadth of that decision is not entirely clear,that court would apparently permit the bia to rely on a restitution order if a defendant admitted the amount of loss the first circuit held in conteh gonzales,cited by the dissent,that the bia could rely on a restitution order to determine the amount of loss when the district court made an explicit finding of the amount of loss as part of its final judgment,even though that finding may have been based in part on facts in the psr 
in the final analysis,our circuit precedent is clear,and with respect,we disagree with the dissent.the psr could be considered under the circumstances presented here,particularly given that admitted in the underlying criminal proceedings that the amounts of loss reflected in the psr were correct.
contends that there must be proof that the amount of loss exceeded in a single tax year.even assuming arguendo that this is a correct proposition of law,the threshold was met.
he asserts that the psr was inadmissible because removal proceedings are prosecutorial in nature and that use of a psr is incompatable with the purpose of the report as a sentencing and correctional tool.he additionally asserts that the psr is confidential and can not be accessed without leave of court.made no attempt during the immigration proceedings to seek an injunction or order from the district court to maintain the confidentiality of the psr.he did not identify any provisions of the psr that would jeopardize his own privacy or the government interest in maintaining the trust of witnesses by keeping the psr confidential.there was no abuse of discretion in admitting the psr.
the record contains evidence that supports the bia conclusion that is an aggravated felon,and we will not vacate that determination.
we deny the petition for review.
i respectfully dissent and would grant the alien petition for review.in my opinion,the majority incorrectly decides two important res nova immigration law issues.first,the majority joins the less meritorious side of a circuit split,giving no weight whatever to the ina designation of tax evasion as the sole tax offense explicitly named as an aggravated felony the majority does not even attempt to explain away the sharp clash between its statutory construction and the traditional principle of construing uncertain statutes in favor of aliens.second,and more grievous,the majority refuses to follow our circuit precedents that have consistently applied the supreme court modified categorical approach in removal cases instead,it approves the bia looking outside the record of the alien conviction to find an aggravated felony based upon a paper trial of underlying facts contained in his psr.in so doing,the majority creates a circuit split from the four circuits unanimously holding such use of psrs is improper under the modified categorical approach and it disregards the numerous decisions of our own prior panels consistently applying the methodology in sentencing cases.the majority second decision is particularly unfortunate because it exposes aliens in this circuit to the potential of unfair practices,inequality of justice,and deportations based on constructive paper trials without juries rather than on records of judicial convictions.
joel was born march,in mexico.he immigrated to the united states more than thirty years ago and has been a permanent resident alien since april,since then,he has lived in houston,texas sugarland,texas new york city round rock,texas austin,texas hutto,texas and pflugerville,texas,where he currently resides.after moving to the united states,arguelles lived with laverne clancy for thirteen years.together they have one daughter,who is currently a student at baylor university in waco,texas.in,arguelles married pearl lavenia whidden pfeffer.together they have two children,ages five and two,who live with them in their,house.arguelles has two children from a previous marriage,one of whom lives with them.
since,arguelles has been a masonry contractor.the record indicates that arguelles has been financially successful in that capacity and that he regularly employs a number of individuals.although the details of the size of his work force and his employees wages or salaries are not disclosed in the record,the psr states that in the tax year he reported a taxable income of upon which he paid the correct amount of in income taxes.
on april,arguelles was charged by criminal information in the united states district court for the western district of texas with one count of filing a false income tax return for the tax year in violation of.on may,arguelles pleaded guilty in accordance with a written plea agreement to the charge against him.he was then sentenced on july,to a term of months of imprisonment,to be followed by a supervised release term of one year,but he was not fined or ordered to pay any restitution.
on account of this conviction,the department of homeland security dhs initiated removal proceedings against arguelles pursuant to a a iii for having been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined by a m.during the proceedings,arguelles admitted to all of the allegations contained in the dhs notice to appear except that he specifically denied that his conviction resulted in a loss to the victim,in this case the government,of more than.the dhs did not introduce the written plea agreement into the record of this removal proceeding in order to prove that the amount of loss exceeded the dhs did file the charging document,a criminal information,and the judgment of conviction into the record,but neither of these instruments discloses how much arguelles underpaid his federal income taxes.the criminal information simply states that he underpaid his taxes by a substantial amount.the judgment of conviction merely adjudges him guilty of violating by making a subscribing a sic false return on april.the only document in the record that provides any indication of how much arguelles underpaid his federal income taxes is the psr arguelles objected to the inclusion of the psr into the record of his immigration proceedings,but the ij admitted it and both the ij and the bia relied on statements in the psr to conclude that arguelles conviction had resulted in a loss amount that exceeded.both the ij and the bia also rejected arguelles argument that a conviction for filing a false tax return under can not qualify as an aggravated felony under a m i.
accordingly,the ij deemed arguelles removable for being convicted of an aggravated felony and ordered arguelles removed to mexico.the bia affirmed the removal order.as a consequence of being removed for conviction of an aggravated felony,arguelles will be permanently barred from to the united states.see a a i ii.
in his petition for review,arguelles his argument that no conviction under for filing a false tax return can qualify as an aggravated felony under a m.as the majority points out,this issue has split the only two circuit courts that have addressed it thus far.compare kawashima gonzales,cir holding that a violation of in which the tax loss to the government exceeds constitutes an aggravated felony under a m i,with ki se lee ashcroft,cir reaching the opposite conclusion,but see id.at alito,dissenting.although,in my view,we need not step into this crossfire to properly resolve the matter before us,i nevertheless note my belief that the third circuit majority reasoning appears to be in familiar statutory interpretation principles.as explained in great detail by the third circuit majority in ki se lee,the juxtaposition of subsections m i and m ii one a general provision encompassing offenses involving fraud or deceit,and one a specific provision focused solely on federal tax evasion,both enacted simultaneously in,at the very least,an ambiguity as to whether other tax offenses,such as violations of,are covered under the more general m i.see id.at.the supreme court and this circuit have consistently recognized the longstanding principle of construing any lingering ambiguities in deportation statutes in favor of the alien.ins,d see also ins cyr,d same ins errico,d s ince the stakes are considerable for the individual,we will not assume that congress meant to trench on his freedom beyond that which is required by the narrowest of several possible meanings of the words used.quoting fong haw tan phelan.martinez mukasey,cir quoting and explaining that t his canon of construction,comparable to the rule of lenity in criminal cases,is based on the drastic nature of removal gonzales,cir smith,dissenting though the majority finds this weight of authority insufficient,it might at least,out of comity,acknowledge the merit of the competing position by applying the longstanding principle of construing any lingering ambiguities in deportation statutes in favor of the alien.while the majority here may not agree with the third circuit view of m i,in light of the weighty discussion of statutory history,construction,and interpretation presented in both ki se lee and kawashima,i believe,at minimum,this issue requires more encompassing analysis than that offered in the majority opinion before this circuit aligns itself with either the third or ninth circuit position and creates a for now on this aggravated felony issue,which has such serious consequences for aliens and their families 
title,section a a iii of the united states code renders removable a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission.title,section a m i of the united states code defines aggravated felony as,inter alia,an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds.arguelles was convicted of deceit or fraud in connection with filing a false tax return in violation of,which provides 
any person who w illfully makes and subscribes any return,statement,or other document,which contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury,and which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter shall be guilty of a felony and,upon conviction thereof,shall be fined not more than in the case of a corporation,or imprisoned not more than years,or both,together with the costs of prosecution.
assuming arguendo the applicability of a m i to violations of,arguelles does not contest that his conviction under this statute involves fraud or deceit within the meaning of the removability provision.he contends,however,that his record of conviction fails to establish that the loss to the victim of his crime exceeded.in particular,he argues that it was error for the ij to consult the psr,which indicated that the loss to his victim,the government,was,because it should not have been considered part of his record of conviction.i agree that relying upon these materials to prove that arguelles was convicted of a fraud involving a loss greater than violated the modified categorical approach to determining aliens removability based on criminal convictions.
my conclusion necessarily follows from our circuit precedent in this area.we have stated that t o determine whether an alien guilty plea conviction constitutes an aggravated felony for removal purposes,we apply a categorical approach,under which we refer only to the statutory definition of the crime for which the alien was convicted rather than attempt to reconstruct the concrete facts of the actual criminal offense and ask whether that offense necessarily fits within the ina definition of an aggravated felony.gonzales,cir see also fortes mukasey,cir unpublished omari gonzales,cir citing reno,cir nguyen ashcroft,cir.we do not consider the underlying facts that resulted in the alien conviction.fortes.at citing,at.
we adopted this methodology in the immigration context because of its analogous roots in taylor united states,d,and shepard united states,d,two sentencing cases in which the supreme court described the basic structure and underlying rationales of the modified categorical approach.see,at dep t of homeland,cir.among the considerations that led the taylor court to conclude that a categorical approach to prior convictions was necessary were concerns about the practical difficulties and fairness problems that would arise if courts were permitted to consider the facts behind prior convictions the taylor court noted that a approach to prior convictions would potentially require federal courts to relitigate a defendant prior conviction in any case where the government alleged that the defendant actual conduct fit the definition of a predicate offense.taylor,at.see also tokatly ashcroft,cir noting fundamental principle that in determining whether a prior conviction constitutes a predicate offense,we must avoid the enormous problems of past convictions,especially in cases where the defendant pleads guilty and there is no record of the underlying facts quoting united states,cir.the taylor court also recognized the unfairness that could result if a factual approach was applied to prior guilty plea convictions 
i n cases where the defendant pleaded guilty,there is often no record of the underlying facts.even if the government were able to prove those facts,if a guilty plea to a lesser,nonburglary offense was the result of a plea bargain,it would seem unfair to impose a sentence enhancement as if the defendant had pleaded guilty to burglary.
however,as we explained in,the categorical approach is not absolute.at.if the statute of conviction defines multiple offenses,at least one of which does not describe an aggravated felony,we apply a modified categorical approach,under which we may also examine certain additional documents if contained in the record framing the guilty plea conviction to determine whether the conviction was necessarily for a particular crime defined by the statute that meets the aggravated felony criterion.id.citing shepard united states,at.omari,at see also dickson ashcroft,cir in reviewing a conviction under a divisible statute,the categorical approach permits reference to the record of conviction for the limited purpose of determining whether the alien conviction was under the branch of the statute that permits removal.in the case of guilty plea convictions under such a divisible statute,we may consider,in addition to the language of the statute,the charging document,written plea agreement,transcript of plea colloquy,and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.omari,at quoting shepard,at.the use of these documents is permitted because they are considered sufficiently conclusive and reliable to establish the facts to which the alien actually pleaded guilty.see shepard,at.stating that evidence of facts should be confined to records of the convicting court approaching the certainty of the record of conviction.documents not of that kind,including police reports and complaint applications,may not be considered.omari,at.
if the documents that we may consider under the modified categorical approach are insufficient to establish that the petitioner was necessarily convicted of an aggravated felony,we must find that the government has not met its burden of proving that the conduct for which the petitioner was convicted constitutes a predicate offense,and the conviction may not be used as a basis for removal.tokatly,at see omari,at same.
the analogous statutory structures in the sentencing and deportation contexts,as well as the reasoning of taylor and shepard,justify the use of the categorical approach to determine removability vel non.see,at citing ming lam sui ins,cir.l ike the burglary sentencing enhancement,the immigration and nationality act ina,a a iii,rendered removable an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony,not one who has committed an aggravated felony.id.citing sui,at.moreover,nothing in the legislative history suggested a factfinding role for the bia in ascertaining whether an alien had committed an aggravated felony,just as,in taylor,nothing suggested such a role for the sentencing court in evaluating the factual basis of a prior burglary conviction.id.at.further,the practical evidentiary difficulties and potential unfairness associated with looking behind the offense of conviction are no less daunting in the immigration than in the sentencing context.id.finally,given the exception in taylor,when a statute of conviction criminalizes both conduct that would constitute a removable offense and conduct that would not,ijs might appropriately consult an indictment or jury instructions to determine the basis of an alien conviction,but ijs can not look behind the record of conviction to reach their own determination as to whether the underlying facts constitute a conviction for an aggravated felony.see sui,at quoting lewis ins,cir.
accordingly,like the second circuit and others,this court has applied the modified categorical approach as a inquiry first,we determine if the statute is divisible,such that some categories of proscribed conduct render an alien removable and some do not second,we consult the record of conviction to ascertain the category of conduct of which the alien was convicted,at omari,at.
in the present case,the statute criminalizing fraud or deceit in connection with filing a false tax return,is a divisible statute.the provision encompasses deceit or fraud by which the perpetrator files a tax return that he does not believe to be true and correct however,under a m i,such fraud is only a removable offense when the loss to the victim exceeds.thus,the statute proscribes some conduct that is not causing a loss between and some conduct that is or fraud causing a loss greater than that we consult the record of conviction to determine which of the two types of conduct actually underlay arguelles conviction.
under the modified categorical approach,which our removal circuit precedents have heretofore followed,we have concluded that the bia consultation of the psr as proof of the specific facts underlying the petitioner prior conviction was improper.see,at omari,at psr not considered part of the record of conviction.in,we held that a sentencing factor notation is not the type of documentary evidence to which this court or the bia may refer,under the modified categorical approach as prescribed by shepard,to determine the nature of an alien guilty plea conviction.at.we further concluded that u nlike the charging document,the guilty plea,or the factual basis for the plea confirmed by the defendant,sentencing reasons and factors do not simply define the charge and the defendant guilty plea,but,instead,frequently refer to facts neither alleged nor admitted in court.id.at.other than for its possible use to prove the existence of a conviction,see c b vi such a report simply is not a part of the formal record of conviction.id.at.this conclusion is further supported by our sentencing cases,in which we have consistently said that a district court may not rely on the psr characterization of the offense for enhancement purposes.see united states,cir,cert.denied,d holding that shepard does not permit court to consider factual narrative in probation officer psr united states,cir,cert.denied,d same shepard,at.precluding the use of a police report to prove the underlying facts of the putative predicate offense.moreover,that arguelles may not have objected to the psr factual and the district court adopted them for sentencing purposes are irrelevant to determining whether arguelles conviction was for removable,as opposed to,conduct because the psr typically describes conduct that demonstrates the commission of an offense even if the alien was never convicted for that activity and may contain inaccurate,unproven,and inadmissible facts dickson,at emphasis in original.
accordingly,the government argument that a psr is properly considered among the record of conviction materials,such that the ij could rely upon the loss amount it described,is foreclosed by.omari,at psr not considered part of the record of conviction.the ij therefore improperly relied on statements set forth in arguelles psr to establish the loss amount for the tax year.accord,at the government argument that a psr is properly considered among the modified categorical approach permissible materials,such that the ij could rely upon the loss amount it described,is foreclosed by dickson ashcroft,cir,where we rejected a virtually identical claim.obasohan attorney,cir holding that an ij was not entitled to rely on loss amounts that were alleged only in a psr conteh gonzales,cir we reject the government argument the bia consultation of the psi report as proof of the specific facts underlying the petitioner prior conviction was improper.other than for its possible use to prove the existence of a conviction,such a report simply is not a part of the formal record of conviction.emphasis in original citations omitted ashcroft,cir holding that a psr is insufficient evidence to show that an alien conviction constitutes an aggravated felony citing united states,cir en banc.
finally,the majority holding was not,as the majority states,compelled by james gonzales,cir.james,in my opinion,does not represent a clear holding on anything in particular,but should be restricted as precedent to its facts and reconsidered en banc.there,the panel affirmed the bia determination that the loss to james victims exceeded for purposes of satisfying a m i monetary threshold,but its conclusion was based on a mixture of factors,including some not present in this case,such as an indictment that charged a scheme of aiding and abetting,with three counts totaling,and a restitution order in an amount that exceeded.nowhere does james hold that it is appropriate to deviate from the modified categorical approach to determine whether the amount of loss under a m i exceeded,and it certainly does not state that statements contained in a psr,without more,are sufficient under the modified categorical approach to reach such a determination as to the amount of loss.furthermore,james does not even address any of the authorities or principles discussed in this dissent.it is that we are not bound to follow our dicta in a prior case in which the point now at issue was not fully debated.cent.cmty.coll.katz,d citing cohens virginia,wheat.rather,intelligent discussions of the relevant supreme court cases and principles,plus the holdings in,omari,and our sentencing cases,are more persuasive to me because those sources deal directly with what i have discussed in this dissent.
in sum,as a result of the government failure purposeful or otherwise to place the plea agreement into the immigration record,we are left with an insufficient record of conviction by which to conclude that arguelles was necessarily convicted of an aggravated felony and is now subject to removal.i would thus grant arguelles petition for review and vacate the bia order of removal.however,because the use of psrs in the a m i context was heretofore a res nova issue in our circuit,i would also remand for the purpose of allowing the ij to determine whether documents that are properly considered part of the record of conviction,including those with which the government may now wish to supplement the record,establish that arguelles was convicted of a removable offense.
for these reasons,i respectfully dissent.
