defendant appellant arturo albino loe was convicted by jury trial of being a deported alien found in the united states.he raises various evidentiary and confrontation clause challenges to his conviction and a challenge to the imposition of a sentencing enhancement for a prior crime of violence.we affirm.
in challenging his conviction,albino loe contends,among other things,that the admission into evidence during his criminal trial of a notice to appear,the document filed by the government to initiate removal proceedings before an immigration judge,violated his rights under the confrontation clause.we disagree,concluding that the statements made in a notice to appear are not testimonial.
in addition,albino loe argues that the district court erred in calculating the advisory range under the sentencing guidelines by applying an enhancement for a previous conviction for a crime of violence.albino loe does not dispute that he was previously convicted of attempted murder and kidnaping under california law.he contends,however,that those california convictions should not qualify as crimes of violence under the applicable categorical approach because california does not provide for an affirmative defense of voluntary abandonment to a charge of attempt,though that defense is available in most jurisdictions and under the model penal code.albino loe acknowledges that our court has previously held that a variation in affirmative defenses does not affect whether a conviction qualifies under the categorical approach,but he argues that these precedents are irreconcilable with the supreme court recent decision in moncrieffe holder,d.we disagree and hold that our precedents on that subject remain valid.
background 
albino loe is an alien previously convicted of various crimes in california,including attempted murder and kidnaping.removal proceedings were initiated against him in september,and he was ordered removed as an aggravated felon.he was physically removed to mexico on june.one month later,on july,albino loe was arrested in the united states near the mexican border.he was then charged with being a deported alien found in the united states in violation of.
at trial,the first government witnesses were the border patrol usbp agent who arrested him and the agent who booked him.they identified him in court,and the booking agent testified to taking his fingerprints on a card that was then admitted into evidence.they testified regarding albino loe admissions concerning his alienage and his illegal presence in the united states.
usbp agent suzanne clark was the third government witness.she testified that she was familiar with immigration proceedings and that she was the custodian for the government permanent immigration record the a file containing all immigration documents related to albino loe.she testified as to albino loe unique alien registration number the a number.she further testified that she had reviewed his a file in preparation for testifying.
based on the photographs contained in the a file,agent clark identified albino loe as the subject of the a file she reviewed.the defense objected to this identification as to foundation.lack of personal knowledge.the objection was overruled and,on,it was made clear that agent clark had never met nor had any kind of personal contact with albino loe.
agent clark further testified about deportation procedures,from the initial notice to appear through the process that would be required to apply for permission to reenter after deportation.through her,the government introduced four documents from albino loe a file,including the notice to appear and the warrant of removal,each authenticated as originals or true and correct copies thereof by a certification from a department of homeland security official who did not testify.the certifications each stated that the records being authenticated relat ed to immigration matters in file no.a,pertaining to arturo albino loe aka arturo albino.the defense objected to introduction of these documents on confrontation clause grounds,among others.the documents were admitted into evidence over these objections.
agent clark also testified that the only way a deported alien can reapply for permission to reenter the united states is through form i,and that she looked for but found no form i in albino loe a file.she further testified that she looked through the usbp computer linked automated information maintenance system claims and did not find any application or anything to do with this individual requesting permission to come back.the defense elicited testimony from agent clark that a deported individual could later discover that he was a citizen and come back by simply applying for a passport or following some process other than filing form i.
the final two witnesses were the immigration and customs enforcement agent who physically removed albinoloe to mexico in and a fingerprint technician.the agent testified about the process of physically removing an alien after an order of removal is entered against him.he also testified that he affixed albino loe fingerprint to albinoloe warrant of removal,admitted into evidence as one of the a file documents during agent clark testimony.the fingerprint technician testified that he compared albinoloe fingerprints obtained after his arrest to the fingerprints on the notice to appear and the warrant of removal from the a file and found a match.
albino loe did not call any witnesses.the jury found him guilty.
in calculating albino loe advisory range under the sentencing guidelines,the district court imposed a level sentencing enhancement for a prior crime of violence under b a based on his prior california convictions for attempted murder and kidnaping.including the enhancement,albino loe was sentenced to months imprisonment.
on appeal,albino loe challenges his conviction and sentence.we have jurisdiction to review albino loe conviction and sentence under and 
ii.albino loe conviction 
albino loe most substantial challenge to his conviction is his confrontation clause argument against the admissibility of the notice to appear.he also raises a confrontation clause challenge to the admissibility of the certifications of authenticity for the a file documents,as well as evidentiary challenges to the admissibility of agent clark identification of albino loe and her testimony regarding form i.we are unpersuaded by any of albino loe arguments.
we review alleged confrontation clause violations de novo.united states bustamante,cir.we generally review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.see united states morales,cir.even where evidence was improperly admitted,we may nevertheless affirm if the error was harmless.see id.
a.the confrontation clause and notices to appear 
the main dispute relates to whether the statements concerning albino loe alienage contained in the notice to appear are testimonial under crawford washington,d.the notice to appear was the document used by the government to commence the removal proceeding against albino loe in immigration court.it contains allegations by the government that albino loe was an alien,not a citizen of the united states.crawford held that the confrontation clause bars admission of testimonial statements unless the declarant is unavailable to testify and the defendant previously had an opportunity to the declarant.id.at.the person who prepared albinoloe notice to appear did not testify at his criminal trial and was not subject to.
although the supreme court in crawford did not define what makes a statement testimonial,it noted that a core class of testimonial statements may be defined as ex parte testimony or its functional equivalent that is,material such as affidavits or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially.id.at citation omitted.since crawford,the supreme court has noted that a statement in a public or business record is not testimonial where the record was not created for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial.melendez diaz massachusetts,d.more recently,the supreme court has also noted that a document created solely for an
