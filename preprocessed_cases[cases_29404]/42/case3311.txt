when a defendant collaterally attacks the validity of a prior deportation order in a prosecution,he must show that he exhausted his administrative remedies,that the deportation proceedings improperly deprived him of the opportunity for judicial review,and that entry of the prior deportation order was fundamentally unfair.see d.as we explain below,we have generally found that where an alien was deprived of the opportunity to exhaust his administrative remedies,satisfying d,he also has shown that he was deprived of the opportunity to seek judicial review,satisfying d.here,gonzalez villalobos has shown that he exhausted his administrative remedies by appealing the immigration judge ij adverse ruling to the board of immigration appeals bia.however,he has failed to show that an error or obstacle related to his deportation proceedings improperly deprived him of the opportunity for judicial review,as required by d.because subsections d,d,and d must all be satisfied either directly or constructively,we affirm the denial of gonzalez villalobos motion to dismiss and his conviction without addressing the merits of his argument that the alleged prior deportation proceeding was fundamentally unfair.
factual and procedural historya.
the events surrounding the underlying deportation in this case occurred more than twenty years ago in march,gonzalez villalobos was arrested in yakima,washington,for possession of a controlled substance cocaine with intent to deliver.he was eventually convicted of this offense in the superior court of washington,county of yakima,in july.in connection with gonzalez villalobos arrest,agents from the immigration and naturalization service ins assisted the local police with the service and execution of a search warrant at his house a few days after the arrest,an ins agent prepared form i,record of deportable alien,in which he recorded gonzalez villalobos immigration status and the events surrounding his arrest.the i contained an number ending in.the next day,ins served gonzalez villalobos with an order to show cause,alleging that he was deportable as an alien in the united states who entered without inspection.when ins could not locate gonzalez villalobos,it administratively closed the deportation proceeding in january.as it turned out,gonzalez villalobos was incarcerated in federal prison,where he was serving a sentence for being an alien in possession of a firearm gonzalez villalobos completed his federal sentence in december and upon his release he was taken into custody by ins.a few weeks later,ins released him from custody because it determined that he was a class member in a pending class action.the agency then cancelled the pending order to show cause.
after his release from ins custody,gonzalez villalobos applied for legal status through the special agricultural worker saw program in may.see ins assigned gonzalez villalobos saw application a different number,ending in.it denied his saw application in november on the ground that his state drug conviction rendered him ineligible for the program.gonzalez villalobos appealed,and the ins legalization appeals unit affirmed the denial of his application in february.apparently unaware of the appeals unit ruling,gonzalez villalobos visited an ins office in november to inquire about the status of his saw application.while there,he was detained by ins agents,who immediately completed a second i,reciting gonzalez villalobos conviction record and detention history.this i had the same number as the one prepared in,ending in.the next day,ins issued an order to show cause,alleging that gonzalez villalobos was deportable as an alien who had been convicted of a controlled substance offense.
at a deportation hearing in april,gonzalez villalobos argued that ins agents wrongfully discovered his conviction record by looking through the saw file.he argued that when he went to check on his legalization application and the current status of it,they reviewed the computer and the file and asked him to wait there.they made a phone call and subsequently,from across the hall,where the deportation section and the legalization office are in the same building across the hall,came the agent from ins.
gonzalez villalobos requested a suppression hearing so that he could question the ins agents on how they obtained his criminal history record.in response,the ij asked the government attorney to assure him as an officer of the court that the evidence did not result from a sting operation being operated by the investigative arm of the service in conjunction with the legalization office.the government attorney informed the court that he was not offering any evidence that came from the saw legalization file.the ij then denied the request for a suppression hearing,stating that the evidence submitted by the service was totally independent of the legalization process.she further concluded that gonzalez villalobos was not eligible for any relief and accordingly entered a deportation order.the ij also informed gonzalez villalobos and his attorney of the right to appeal her ruling to the bia.gonzalez villalobos timely appealed,primarily challenging the ij denial of his request for a suppression hearing.
the bia subsequently dismissed gonzalez villalobos appeal,finding that he had not carried his burden of justifying the need for a suppression hearing.gonzalez villalobos then applied for a stay of deportation,which ins denied in april.the record does not reflect whether he filed a petition for review in the ninth circuit,but it does reflect that he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the western district of washington.upon filing the petition,he sought a temporary restraining order enjoining his deportation.he was deported to mexico,however,on april.shortly afterwards,gonzalez villalobos agreed to dismiss the petition and withdraw the motion.
the events leading to gonzalez villalobos current prosecution are fairly straightforward.at some point after being deported,gonzalez villalobos returned to the united states.he was located in yakima county in july,and a few weeks later,he was arrested and charged with being an alien in the united states after deportation,in violation of.the parties agree that the deportation order,affirmed by the bia in,was the alleged prior deportation.gonzalez villalobos moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the deportation order was invalid because the ij had erred in denying his motion for a suppression hearing.the district court denied the motion,finding that even if the ij had erred in denying gonzalez villalobos motion,he could not establish prejudice.gonzalez villalobos then entered a conditional guilty plea,preserving his right to appeal the district court denial of his motion to dismiss.following entry of the judgment and commitment order,gonzalez villalobos timely appealed.he argues that the underlying deportation order was fundamentally unfair,and therefore invalid,because it was based on conviction records that the ins agents unlawfully discovered in his saw file,and because the ij did not grant an evidentiary hearing on how the agents obtained those records
