after masis tadevosyan was ordered removed from the country for an immigration violation,he married an american citizen and applied for a visa and adjustment of status.the board of immigration appeals bia refused to reopen his removal proceedings.our question is whether in doing so,the bia improperly relied on the fact of the department of homeland security dhs opposition to his motion,rather than on the merits of the motion,or otherwise abused its discretion in deciding the motion.we grant the petition for review of the bia decision and remand for further proceedings 
background 
tadevosyan,a native of iran and citizen of armenia,entered the united states in may on a visa permitting him to remain in the country until later that year.after he overstayed the visa expiration date,he was placed in removal proceedings,and an immigration judge ordered his removal to armenia.
tadevosyan appealed the removal order to the bia.while his appeal was pending,tadevosyan married lyubov smolyanyuk,a united states citizen.smolyanyuk filed an petition for a visa for tadevosyan.
the bia then affirmed the removal order.tadevosyan filed a timely motion to reopen,asking the bia to allow him to pursue adjustment of status through the pending i petition filed by his wife.attached to the motion were copies of the i petition an i application for adjustment of status and two i affidavits of support,one from smolyanyuk and a second from a joint sponsor,norik abrahamian smolyanyuk affidavit represented that she and tadevosyan had not earned any income in the prior tax year abrahamian attested that his income in the last tax year was.abrahamian attached photocopies of his federal and state tax return forms,which showed an adjusted gross income of,and certified under penalty of perjury in the affidavit that the federal income tax return was a true copy of the return filed with the internal revenue service.abrahamian did not include copies of his federal forms,but did submit with his california tax return a schedule w cg,which contained the same information as his w forms.
dhs opposed tadevosyan motion to reopen.it argued that tadevosyan had not shown that the i petition had been approved and thus that there was a visa available for tadevosyan at this time.dhs further contended that tadevosyan had not submitted sufficient evidence to establish that he was not a public charge,because the joint sponsor has not provided any proof,such as forms w,letters,paycheck stubs,or financial statements,to support the income stated on his federal income tax return.error in original.dhs did not address abrahamian submission of the schedule w cg.
the bia denied tadevosyan motion to reopen on march,stating,
in this case,the record reflects that respondent does not have an approved immediate relative visa petition,and the dhs opposes his motion in light of the absence of evidence to establish that he is not inadmissible as a public charge.in this regard,as noted by dhs counsel,while the respondent has provided affidavits of support from his wife and a joint sponsor,his wife currently has no income and the joint sponsor neglected to submit supporting documentation for the reported income on his income tax return.as such,consistent with matter of velarde,i n bia,the dhs opposition is sufficient to require a denial of the respondent motion.
while the appeals before this court were pending,the united states citizenship and immigration service uscis approved the i visa petition smolyanyuk filed on tadevosyan behalf.
ii.discussion 
the bia denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider is reviewed for abuse of discretion.salta,cir citing singh,cir.the bia abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily,irrationally,or contrary to the law,and when it fails to provide a reasoned explanation for its actions.movsisian ashcroft,cir citations omitted.we hold that whether we read the bia decision as based purely on the dhs opposition or as reaching the merits of the public charge issue,it abused its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.
at the time that the bia rejected tadevosyan motion,it was addressing motions to reopen to pursue adjustment of status applications based on an unadjudicated visa petition filed by a united states citizen or lawful permanent resident spouse under the standards set forth in matter of velarde pacheco,bia en banc.velarde replaced an earlier policy,established in matter of arthur,bia,uniformly to deny such motions.velarde,at.
in velarde,the bia held that,even if an i was still pending,
a properly filed motion to reopen may be granted,in the exercise of discretion,to provide an alien an opportunity to pursue an application for adjustment where the following factors are present the motion is timely filed the motion is not numerically barred by the regulations the motion is not barred by matter of shaar,i n bia,or on any other procedural grounds the motion presents clear and convincing evidence indicating a strong likelihood that the respondent marriage is bona fide and the service either does not oppose the motion or bases its opposition solely on matter of arthur 
id.at.the bia noted that this decision did not require immigration judges to reopen proceedings pending adjudication of an i visa petition in every case in which the respondent meets all five of the aforementioned factors,and that there may be another valid reason for an immigration judge to deny the motion,even if these five factors are met.id.at.only the fifth velarde factor is at issue here.
most of the bia members who did not join the majority opinion in velarde understood its articulation of the fifth factor to require denial whenever the service opposed the motion to reopen,unless solely based on arthur.board member pauley,in his dissent,joined by six other members of the board,stated,as i read the opinion,the service is required only to register its opposition to the alien motion.the service is not required to state the ground s for its opposition.id.at.he observed that,as a result,if dhs wishes to preserve the status quo ante,it need only adopt a policy of filing a opposition to motions to reopen that would previously have been barred under matter of arthur id.at.in concurring with the result of the majority,board member rosenberg emphatically rejected the degree of deference extended to dhs under the fifth condition articulated in the majority opinion.id.at.she refused to believe that dhs opposition is an appropriate condition that,as a rule,should result in denial of a motion to reopen,because the bia role is to engage in impartial and independent adjudications,not to rubberstamp the preferences of dhs.id.she noted that the bia certainly may consider any substantive objections to reopening offered by the service,but such objections should not constitute an insurmountable barrier to granting a motion to reopen.id.
the bia as a whole later recognized that the fifth factor in velarde can be read to be dispositive,and it was so understood by at least some board members at the time.matter of lamus pava,bia collecting citations.as a result,in applying velarde,the bia accorded controlling weight to the opposition of the dhs in at least some cases.id.
in,after the bia third decision in this case,the ninth circuit rejected the notion that the bia could properly accord dispositive weight to dhs opposition to motions to reopen.see ahmed mukasey,cir.ahmed found persuasive the reasoning of the second and sixth circuits concluding that the dhs should not be able to block unilaterally a motion to reopen.id.at citing melnitsenko mukasey,cir sarr gonzales,cir.accordingly,ahmed held that when the dhs opposes a motion to reopen for adjustment of status,the bia may consider the objection,and may deny the motion based on the merits of the dhs objection,but it may not deny the motion based solely on the fact of the dhs objection.id.emphasis added see also melnitsenko,at.thereafter,in,the bia brought its own law into harmony with the circuit court cases,by clarifying that the fifth velarde factor should not grant dhs veto power over an otherwise approvable velarde motion,and the mere fact of a dhs opposition to a motion,in
