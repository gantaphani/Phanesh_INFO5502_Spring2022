background 
unless otherwise noted,the facts in this case are not in dispute.
issuance and revocation of the crba.
hizam was born in in yemen to a naturalized citizen father and a yemeni mother.in,hizam father submitted an application for a crba and passport for hizam to the embassy in,yemen.a crba is issued by a consular officer to document a citizen born abroad,and has the same force and effect as proof of united states citizenship as certificates of naturalization or of citizenship.see also delineating the circumstances under which an individual born abroad acquires citizenship at birth.hizam father truthfully stated in the application that he had arrived in the united states in,and was physically present in the united states for approximately seven years at the time of hizam birth in october.the consular officers granted the application and issued a crba and passport to hizam.
there is no dispute that the consular officer issued the crba and passport to hizam in error.citizenship of a person born abroad is determined by law in effect at the time of birth.drozd immigration and naturalization,cir.at the time of hizam birth,the child of a united states citizen born outside of the united states was eligible for citizenship if the parent was present in the united states for at least years at the time of the child birth.g supp.iii.however,the law had changed by the time hizam father sought a crba on hizam behalf.the amended law required the parent to be present in the united states for just five years.g.it appears that the consular officer erroneously applied the rule in granting hizam a crba.
after receiving a crba and passport,hizam traveled to the united states to live with his grandparents.hizam attended elementary,middle and high school in dearborn,michigan.he became fluent in english and did well in school,where he was a member of his high school swim team.hizam began working while in high school,and worked two jobs to support himself while attending college in the united states.he graduated from davenport university in with a degree in business administration.he eventually moved to the bronx,new york,to live with his brothers.during his residence in the united states from through,his passport was renewed twice without incident.in,hizam traveled to yemen,where he married,and subsequently had two children.between and,hizam traveled back and forth regularly between the united states and yemen,where his wife and children reside.at the time he commenced this litigation,hizam worked at the family business,moe deli,in new york.he is the primary caretaker for one of his brothers,a minor,and is pursuing a master in business administration at mercy college.
in,hizam applied for crbas and passports for his two children at the embassy in,yemen.officials at the embassy told hizam there was an issue with his passport,and retained his passport for about three weeks.after his passport was returned,hizam returned to the united states.in april,while hizam was in the united states,the state department notified him via letter that his crba and passport were wrongly issued due to department error.the letter stated that while t his error was evident from your crba application,there is no indication that your father fraudulently obtained citizenship documentation for you,and there is no evidence of fraud on your part.it concluded that u nfortunately the department of state lacks authority to create a remedy that would in some way confer citizenship on anyone absent a statutory basis for doing so.subsequent letters from the department of state informed hizam that his crba had been cancelled,and his passport revoked,and requested that he return those documents,which he did in may.
ii.district court proceedings 
in october,hizam filed suit against the department of state in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,seeking a declaratory judgment affirming his status as a national of the united states.in his complaint,hizam alleged three principal causes of action that the state department wrongly denied him his rights and privileges as a national pursuant to the state department lacked the authority to cancel his crba because the plain language of did not authorize cancellation due to error committed by the agency,and,in any event,did not apply retroactively and the state department was equitably estopped from revoking his crba and passport given that he rightfully relied on his citizenship for more than twenty years.
in its answer,the state department asserted that neither it nor the district court was authorized to grant the relief hizam sought,as hizam did not acquire citizenship at birth,or satisfy the statutory requirements for naturalization,and as a matter of law the district court lacked authority to confer citizenship upon him.furthermore,the state department asserted that because hizam was not a citizen,it had authority to revoke the documents showing proof of such citizenship,and hizam was not entitled to their reissuance.
both parties moved for summary judgment.in july,the district court issued an order granting hizam motion for summary judgment.the district court agreed that hizam was not a citizen,and that the federal courts may not order an alien naturalized by exercise of their equitable powers.hizam clinton,civ.jcf,wl,at july.the district court concluded that hizam does not,however,seek to be naturalized by court order.rather,he seeks a declaratory judgment finding that the state department exceeded its authority when it cancelled his crba and an order compelling its return.id.
