the immigration and naturalization service ins brought removal proceedings against eritrean citizen hanna fessehaye.she filed an asylum claim and application for withholding of removal,but obtained no relief.she then brought a motion to reopen her case.see c.in pertinent part,she alleged changed circumstances in that she had become a jehovah witness and consequently feared persecution because of her religious affiliation if sent back to eritrea.she also asserted that,if returned to eritrea as a failed asylum seeker,she would suffer persecution.the board of immigration appeals the bia or board denied her motion to reopen.in its view,she had failed to present sufficient evidence to make out a prima facie case for relief.fessehaye now petitions for review of that decision.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we grant the petition and remand the case to the bia for further proceedings.
backgrounda.facts 
fessehaye was born in the ethiopian province of tigray,but relocated to the province of eritrea to work as a teacher.in the,eritrea became independent following an referendum.fessehaye became a citizen of eritrea by voting in that referendum.tensions between the newly independent nation and ethiopia escalated into armed conflict between and animosity between the two countries continues to this day.
on august,fessehaye entered the united states on a tourist visa.she remained in the country beyond the expiration date of that visa.in october,she married ghebregziabher ghebremedhin,another eritrean citizen who also had entered the united states on a tourist visa and had remained beyond its expiration.the couple has two children who are citizens of the united states,a son born in and a daughter born in.
in,the ins brought removal proceedings against ghebremedhin he conceded that he was subject to deportation,but sought asylum.his asylum application was based on past persecution and a fear of future persecution because he is a jehovah church that is subject to widespread persecution and distrust in eritrea.the immigration judge ij denied his asylum application,and the bia affirmed.ghebremedhin appealed to this court.
meanwhile,fessehaye applied to the ins for asylum.in her application,she claimed to have a fear of persecution.she based this claim on the fact that her life history involved connections with both ethiopia and eritrea,two sovereign countries that have been at war and now coexist in an environment of continuing distrust.fessehaye claimed that she faced persecution if returned to ethiopia because she had voted in the eritrean referendum and had become an eritrean citizen.similarly,she believed that she would be persecuted if returned to eritrea because she was a native of tigray,a province that remained part of ethiopia.following a hearing,the ij denied fessehaye request for asylum and her petition for withholding of removal in february.the bia affirmed without opinion in november.
motion to reopen 
fessehaye did not seek review of the bia decision,but instead filed a timely motion to reconsider the board denied that motion.she then filed a timely motion to reopen,see c and included supporting evidence and an updated asylum application as required by c in her motion to reopen,fessehaye essentially raised four grounds for reopening.we shall discuss each of her submissions and the bia resolution.
first,fessehaye submitted that,in light of our decision in nwaokolo ins,cir,her daughter would be subject to female genital mutilation if she returned to eritrea with her mother.in support of this claim,fessehaye attached the state department report on human rights practices in eritrea,see at dep t of state,eritrea,in country reports on human rights country report.the board rejected this claim on the ground that the asserted danger was not new and had been available at the time of her hearing.the board further found no statutory basis to maintain a claim based on the fear of future harm to a child and thus determined that fessehaye could not make out a prima facie case on this asserted basis for asylum.
second,she claimed that she had adopted her husband religion and was a practicing jehovah witness.because of this conversion,she feared religious the same religious persecution that her husband had asserted as the basis for his asylum claim.in support of her motion to reopen,fessehaye included her own affidavit in which she stated that she had been an orthodox christian before her marriage,but had decided to convert to jehovah witness after her marriage and participation in her husband religious events.the affidavit further stated that fessehaye had not completed the final ritual for full membership in the faith,and thus the church elders could not provide additional evidence of her conversion within the time limit for filing a motion to reopen.see c.her affidavit continued to detail the persecution faced by jehovah witnesses in eritrea,which she feared would be visited upon her and her children if she returned to the country she cited the persecution of jehovah witnesses described in the country report.the bia rejected this claim because it determined that fessehaye had failed to present sufficient evidentiary materials in support of her conversion.in particular,the board found insufficient her single affidavit because,in its view,affidavits from her husband or church elders attesting to her jehovah witness faith could have been obtained easily.
third,fessehaye contended that the state department had a report unavailable at the time of her asylum eritrean citizens who return to the country after failed attempts to obtain asylum abroad are subject to investigation and are allowed to enter only on a basis.at see id.at country report.d applications to return from citizens living abroad who have been declared ineligible for political asylum by other governments,are considered on a basis.she claimed that,because she had sought asylum in the united states,she would be investigated upon her reentry to eritrea this investigation would in turn lead to her arrest or detention because it would reveal her religious beliefs,as well as her criticism of the eritrean government for forcing her mother out of the country in addition to the country report,fessehaye also attached an amnesty international press release that detailed the treatment of former asylum seekers who returned to eritrea.in rejecting this contention,the board believed that the country report and the amnesty international press release were insufficient evidence that fessehaye faced persecution as a former asylum seeker.
fourth,fessehaye reasserted in her affidavit,although not in her motion,a ground raised in her previous asylum application that eritrean authorities maintained a policy of arresting ethnic ethiopians and deporting them to ethiopia.she argued that new reports continued to be published detailing this practice.at.the bia dismissed this contention as mere speculation,unsupported by the country reports or other evidence.
fessehaye now seeks review of the denial of her motion to reopen.more specifically,she asks that we review the board decision with respect to her contentions that she has a fear of persecution because of her religious conversion,her failed attempt to seek asylum and the possibility of further deportation to ethiopia.she does not challenge the bia determination of her derivative female genital mutilation claim.
before oral argument in this case,our court rendered its decision on ghebremedhin appeal.ghebremedhin ashcroft ghebremedhin i,cir.in ghebremedhin i,we noted that ghebremedhin presented evidence of persecution so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could agree with the bia decision denying him asylum.id.at.we thus reversed the bia and remanded with instructions to the board to grant his asylum application.id.we subsequently modified the opinion by remanding to the agency for further proceedings consistent with ghebremedhin ghebremedhin ashcroft ghebremedhin ii,cir.having determined that ghebremedhin presented evidence so compelling that no reasonable factfinder would have denied his application,we must now resolve his wife appeal.
discussiona.standard of review 
the board authority to grant or deny a motion to reopen is discretionary we therefore review deferentially its decision for abuse of discretion motions to reopen are comparable to motions for rehearing or for a new trial,and thus are strongly disfavored.selimi ashcroft,cir citing ins doherty,d see also xu yong lu ashcroft,cir.but granting deference to administrative tribunals does not mean we have clothed their rulings with that kind of power expressed in the maxim the king can do no wrong.zhao united states dep t of justice,cir.a tribunal abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily or capriciously and in such cases no deference is due.id.
in reviewing fessehaye claims,we are mindful of the substantive and procedural changes to the immigration laws recently enacted by congress through the real id act.see emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense,the global war on terror,and tsunami relief,division id act of,stat.as relevant here,the real id act modified the standard of review for orders of removal,id.e,a change that applies to all cases in which the final administrative removal order is or was issued before,on,or after the date of passage,id.h.we turn to that provision to assess its impact on our review of fessehaye claims.
section e amends b by adding the following sentence no court shall reverse a determination made by a trier of fact with respect to the availability of corroborating evidence,as described in section b b b b,c b c b,or b b,unless the court finds,pursuant to section b b,that a reasonable trier of fact is compelled to conclude that such corroborating evidence is unavailable.given the language employed by congress in this section,we do not believe that new provision applies to our review of the denial of fessehaye motion to reopen in its current posture.by its terms,section e effect does not apply to review of motions to reopen under c.furthermore,section e dictates the standard of review to be applied when the trier of fact has made a determination as to the necessity of corroborating evidence.however,the bia does not act as a trier of fact when it decides whether to grant or deny a motion to reopen.thus,the standard of review set forth in the real id act has no direct application to our present review.
under c,an applicant may file,within ninety days of the order of removal,a motion to reopen asylum proceedings based on new facts.a motion to reopen seeks fresh consideration on the basis of newly discovered facts or a change in circumstances since the hearing charles gordon et,immigration law and procedure a see canaveral toban ashcroft,cir.the statute provides little guidance on the form or sufficiency of a motion to reopen it simply directs that the motion shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted,and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.c b.the applicable regulations largely repeat this statutory language a motion to reopen proceedings shall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.c.the bia may deny a motion to reopen based on the petitioner failure to establish a prima facie case for the underlying relief sought and failure to introduce previously unavailable,material evidence.awad ashcroft,cir quoting doherty,at.
we agree with the bia that fessehaye application to reopen based on the eritrean government policy of deporting ethnic ethiopians fails to introduce previously unavailable,material evidence.the sole support for this was not argued in the motion to reopen a statement in the affidavit accompanying her motion that new reports continue to be published of the government arrest of returning eritreans and the continuing deportation repatriation of ethiopians from eritrea to ethiopia.at.she failed to attach such new reports to her motion,and indeed the materials that she did attach seem to indicate the opposite.see id.at country report.d by the government had repatriated more than ethiopians to ethiopia however,all of these persons were repatriated voluntarily see also at country report.d the government stated publicly on several occasions that it had not adopted a policy of deporting all ethiopian nationals from the country.after august,forced,mass deportations stopped at country report.d there were no reports of the forced return of persons to a country where they feared persecution.
however,we reach a different conclusion as to the bia decision to deny reopening on fessehaye religious conversion claim.in determining that fessehaye evidence in support of her conversion was insufficient,the bia found 
that her motion to reopen is not appropriately supported by affidavits from her husband or religious leaders or any other evidentiary materials to support her assertion that she is,in fact,a jehovah witness even though such affidavits could easily have been obtained and presented.
at.although the board decision thus makes clear that it believed that fessehaye submissions were inadequate,the decision does not explain why the board viewed her evidence as insufficient.
fessehaye sought to reopen her case and to apply for asylum based on her religious conversion.to be eligible for asylum,fessehaye had to demonstrate that she was a refugee under a a.see b.among other things,a refugee is a person unable or unwilling to return to her country because of a fear of persecution on the basis of religion.id.a awad,at.in asking the board to reopen its earlier determination,fessehaye claims that she had a fear of persecution because she was a practicing jehovah witness.
the procedures for establishing eligibility for asylum are described in.whether fessehaye attempted to establish prima facie eligibility by demonstrating a fear of persecution under b i or under the per se category in section b iii it is clear that she met most of the requirements.we already have noted the difficult circumstances facing jehovah witnesses in ethiopia.indeed,in ghebremedhin case,we considered state department reports and his testimony and determined that no reasonable factfinder could conclude that he lacked a fear of persecution.ghebremedhin i,at fessehaye has demonstrated that,if she is a practicing jehovah witness,she has good reason to believe that she will be singled out for persecution upon her return to eritrea.see b i petrovic ins,cir.she also has presented a pattern and practice of persecution of an identifiable group,to which s he belongs,such that her fear of persecution is reasonable.capric ashcroft,cir see b iii.
the qualification,if she is a practicing jehovah witness,thus remains the only issue in this case.in this respect,we note that fessehaye submission complied with the evidentiary requirements of c that she state new facts that are supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.on a motion to reopen that is based simply on paper submissions,as opposed to testimony,the bia is required to accept the facts stated in the alien affidavit unless they are inherently unbelievable.ordonez ins,cir.
in our view,fessehaye clearly supplied evidence of the quality and quantity that the board reasonably could expect.fessehaye provided an affidavit regarding a new fact,her decision to convert to her husband faith,and also explained therein why official confirmation of the conversion could not be submitted within the given time limits.there is nothing inherently unbelievable about fessehaye claim to have adopted the religion of her spouse.nor is there some other basis on which to question the veracity of fessehaye statements regarding her conversion for instance,fessehaye affidavit does not contain internal inconsistencies that call into question the veracity of her statements,nor is the affidavit at odds with other materials that fessehaye submitted in support of her motion to reopen.
nevertheless,the bia took the view that fessehaye uncorroborated affidavit failed to establish that she is a practicing jehovah witness.we must conclude,however,that,on this record,requiring corroboration of her faith commitment in order to establish prima facie eligibility was arbitrary and capricious and constituted an abuse of discretion.the regulations provide that,in deciding an asylum application on the merits,t he testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.a.under the plain language of the rule,there is no blanket requirement for an asylum seeker to offer additional affidavits before her prima facie burden is satisfied.
the question becomes what more could fessehaye reasonably have been expected to present to the bia by way of evidence to establish her conversion in evaluating the board use of that criteria,we have made it clear that the touchstone must be the reasonableness of such a criterion in the circumstances presented by the particular case.see gontcharova ashcroft,cir capric,at.we wrote in balogun ashcroft,cir 
t he corroboration requirement should be employed reasonably.it is always possible to the petitioner as to what evidence would be most cogent,and,consequently,there is a distinct danger that,in practice,the corroboration requirement can slip into could have speculation about what evidence the applicant could have brought in a environment.
to enable us to conduct our review,we have required that the bia explain its decisions to require corroborating evidence.such an explanation should include,at a minimum an explicit credibility finding an explanation of why it is reasonable to expect additional corroboration and an account of why the petitioner explanation for not producing that corroboration is inadequate.gontcharova,at see also ashcroft,cir.in this case,the bia made no determination that fessehaye lacked credibility.nor did it provide any explanation as to why it was reasonable to expect additional affidavits beyond the conclusory statement that such affidavits could easily have been obtained.at.fessehaye explained to the board that she could not obtain affidavits from church elders because she had not completed the conversion process the bia failed to come to grips with that explanation and failed to explain why fessehaye explanation was inadequate 
we never have held that an applicant affidavit alone is insufficient to establish membership in a certain group.indeed,one religion is inherently a personal experience not reasonably subject to verification,in re,bia,and we have expressed concern about the board requiring more evidence of conversion than reasonably can be expected,especially in the absence of a finding that the alien is not credible,muhur ashcroft,cir noting that many authentic believers,including members of churches with more structure than jehovah witnesses,would fail a test based on objective indicators like knowledge of church doctrine bastanipour ins,cir holding that it was inappropriate to question a claimed conversion from islam to christianity when there was no reason to question the applicant sincerity and when apostasy was itself an offense under islam c c there is no presumption of credibility,however,if no adverse credibility determination is explicitly made,the applicant or witness shall have a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal.but see najafi ins,cir distinguishing bastanipour and noting that word of conversion is not enough.
there is no question that ghebremedhin is a practicing jehovah witness.where,as here,the movant credibly claims to have converted to her spouse religion,we see no necessity,absent exceptional circumstances,for the board to require further corroboration.see limsico ins,cir requiring bia to accept as true facts in applicant affidavit unless statements were inherently unbelievable.we must conclude that,in imposing such a requirement on fessehaye in this case,the board abused its discretion.
finally,fessehaye argued for the reopening of her case because she feared that she may be arrested and detained as a result of her religious conversion,because of her criticism and opposition to the government of eritrea for forcing her mother from eritrea,and because she applied for asylum in the united states.at.her first argument fundamentally is a repeat of her claim to fear persecution based on her new faith for reasons considered above,we hold that fessehaye offered new evidence and made out a prima facie case on this ground that warrants reopening her case.
however,her second argument,that she fears persecution as a critic of the eritrean government,fails for two reasons.first,her claimed religious conversion and status as a former asylum seeker both arose after the bia denied her first asylum claim,but there is no evidence that her criticism of the eritrean government occurred after the bia first decision.her claim therefore does not constitute previously unavailable,material evidence.awad,at.indeed,fessehaye did not mention her alleged criticism of the eritrean government in her initial asylum application rather,she introduced evidence of her mother persecution to establish that the government had a pattern of persecuting her family.second,fessehaye presented no evidence with her motion to reopen establishing that she actually criticized the government for its treatment of her mother.indeed,the only evidence she offered is a statement in the motion and affidavit unlike the religious conversion claim,a claim both uniquely unsuited to by immigration officials and also corroborated by her husband faith,there is no evidence that fessehaye was a government critic.she thus may not rely on her claimed past criticism of the eritrean government as a ground for reopening.
the third argument,a fear of persecution because fessehaye unsuccessfully sought asylum,does raise new ground.but to be eligible for asylum on this ground,fessehaye still must establish a prima facie case by demonstrating a fear of persecution under b i.we may assume for the moment that her status as a former asylum seeker qualifies her for membership in a particular social group as described in b i a.however,fessehaye difficulty lies in establishing a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution on this basis if she were to return to her country.b i b.
she attempted to meet her burden under the reasonable possibility prong by pointing to a statement in the country report indicating that the right of return for eritreans who have been declared ineligible for political asylum by other governments is considered on a basis.at country report.d.she also attached a press release from amnesty international purporting to offer further support.however,neither the country report nor the amnesty international press release establish fessehaye prima facie eligibility.the country report merely notes that fessehaye situation will be considered individually it does not indicate a reasonable possibility that she will be denied entry.
additionally,the amnesty international press release does not provide support for this particular claim.the press release notes only that eritreans were detained after being deported from malta,that the were among a group of that arrived in malta,and that about half that number had applied for asylum.at.this does not evidence a policy of detaining or denying entry to failed asylum seekers.in fact,it appears from the press release that the primary targets of detention in eritrea are those who are suspected of opposition to the government or having evaded military service.id.at.we are certain that fessehaye may not seek relief as a member of the former of these two categories,as we have said that there is no evidence that fessehaye was an opposition leader.but the press release mention of the persecution of those who have evaded mandatory military service,in light of our discussion of fessehaye conversion and the tenets of her faith,provides further evidence establishing fessehaye prima facie eligibility for asylum on that ground.
conclusion 
the tendered evidence of religious conversion is previously unavailable,material evidence and makes out a prima facie showing of eligibility,and fessehaye is entitled to a hearing.the board clearly abused its discretion in requiring more evidence before reopening fessehaye case.therefore,we grant the petit
