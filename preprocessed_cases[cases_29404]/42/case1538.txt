in june,agustin,an illegal alien from mexico,was placed in expedited removal proceedings when immigration officials from the department of homeland security dhs determined that his conviction for second degree assault in maryland constituted an aggravated felony.see b.did not contest the dhs charges against him and was removed to mexico in november.soon after,again entered the united states illegally he was subsequently discovered and indicted for illegal reentry by a deported alien in violation of a,b.the district court granted motion to dismiss the indictment under d,concluding that the underlying removal order was invalid because dhs failed to explain to in his native language either the removal charges against him or his right to contest the charges or obtain legal representation.see united states,supp.
the government appeals,arguing that even assuming the administrative removal proceedings were procedurally defective,can not establish prejudice.the government contends that even if dhs had provided a translation of the removal charges and his right to contest them,it would not have made a difference he still would have been removed to mexico.
for the reasons that follow,we agree with the government and reverse the order of the district court dismissing the indictment.we remand this case to the district court with instructions that the indictment be reinstated.
removal to mexico and subsequent indictment for illegal reentry in violation of a,b 
agustin is a native of mexico who entered the united states without authorization prior to.in january,pled guilty under maryland law to a theft offense involving less than.see.code,crim.law.in may,he pled guilty under maryland law to second degree assault,see.code,crim.law,for which he was sentenced to months imprisonment,with all but days suspended,and given months probation.
the office of immigration and customs enforcement ice took notice of following his assault conviction and initiated expedited removal proceedings against him.under b,an alien who is not a permanent resident and who has been convicted of an aggravated felony is amenable to expedited administrative removal proceedings.see b.expedited removal proceedings are governed by dhs regulations set forth in.see b proceedings before the attorney general under this subsection shall be in accordance with such regulations as the attorney general shall prescribe.
in contrast to standard removal proceedings,expedited removal proceedings do not involve a hearing before an immigration judge.rather,a dhs immigration officer determines whether the alien is removable as an aggravated felon under a a iii,and,upon finding the alien removable by clear,convincing,and unequivocal evidence,issues a final administrative removal order without referring the case to an immigration judge,d.significantly,aliens subject to expedited removal are barred from discretionary forms of relief such as voluntary departure.see b ins,cir.noting that alien removed pursuant to b is categorically barred from receiving any form of discretionary relief an alien subject to expedited removal can not administratively appeal an adverse decision to the board of immigration appeals,see generally b,but has a period to apply for judicial review under,b.
in the fall of,immigration officials placed in expedited removal proceedings.ice agents prepared a form notice of intent to issue a final administrative removal order noi,charging that was removable because both the assault offense and the theft offense qualified as aggravated felonies under a a iii.more specifically,the government charged that the maryland conviction for second degree assault constituted a crime of violence,and therefore an aggravated felony,under a f,and that the maryland theft offense constituted a theft offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year,and therefore an aggravated felony under a g.
the noi also contained a section explaining the alien rights and responsibilities,including the right to legal representation and the right to contest the charges 
you may choose to be represented at no expense to the united states government by counsel,authorized to practice in this proceeding.if you wish legal advice and can not afford it,contact legal counsel from the list of available free legal services provided to you.
you must respond to the above charges in writing within calendar days of service of this notice or calendar days if service is by mail.in your response you may request,for good cause,an extension of time rebut the charges stated above with supporting evidence request an opportunity to review the government evidence admit deportability designate the country to which you choose to be removed in the event that a final order of removal is issued 
you may seek judicial review of any final administrative order by filing a petition for review within calendar days or you may waive such appeal 
the noi was in english.an immigration officer personally served with the noi on october,and explained the form to him in english.
on the reverse side of the noi form,there are three boxes presenting the alien options in response to the charges set forth in the noi.the first box is an acknowledgment of receipt of the noi,which was signed by and witnessed by the immigration officer who served the noi.the second box states,i wish to contest and offers,in checkbox fashion,several possible bases for the alien to contest removal.the third box states,i do not wish to contest.signed under the following language contained in the third box 
i admit the allegations and charge in this notice of intent.i admit that i am deportable and acknowledge that i am not eligible for any form of relief from removal.i waive my right to rebut and contest the above charges and my right to file a petition for review of the final removal order.
indicated on the form his preference that he be removed to mexico.in november,he was removed to mexico.
returned almost immediately,unlawfully crossing into arizona in july.authorities did not discover until,when he was arrested in maryland for driving under the influence and for resisting arrest.this time,however,rather than placing him in removal proceedings,the government charged him with a federal crime.in october,was indicted for being present unlawfully in the united states after having been removed,in violation of.
motion under d to dismiss his indictment for illegal reentry 
moved to dismiss the indictment,claiming that it was based on an invalid removal order.see d.under d,a defendant charged with illegal reentry is permitted to collaterally attack a prior removal order.to prevail,the defendant must show that the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.id.because t hese requirements are listed in the conjunctive,a defendant must satisfy all three in order to prevail.united states el shami,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.when the defendant satisfies all of d requirements,the district court must dismiss the illegal reentry charge.see id.
the government argued that could not satisfy d exhaustion requirement because on the noi form he expressly waived the right to contest the charges against him or seek judicial review of the removal order.likewise,the government maintained that could not establish,as required by d,that he was improperly deprived of judicial review.an alien subject to an administrative order of removal entered after expedited proceedings is permitted to seek judicial review under a d.see b.in response,a native spanish speaker who understood almost no english,argued that the waiver was invalid because neither the charges nor the waiver language set forth on the noi form were translated into spanish or read to him by a spanish translator.
the district court found it patently clear that in did not read or understand english to an extent sufficient to enable him to comprehend the noi or the waiver form,which were written in english,or to make a knowing and informed decision on the basis of forms that he could not read,supp.at.thus,the district court concluded that waiver was invalid.
once the district court determined that the waiver was invalid,it concluded in turn that was excused from having to show that he had exhausted his administrative remedies and that he had been deprived of judicial review,following an approach embraced by some appellate courts.see,united states,cir.united states sosa,cir.the government does not contest the district court ruling that the waiver was invalid or that the invalid waiver excuses his burden to show that he exhausted available administrative remedies and suffices to show that the deportation proceedings improperly deprived him of the opportunity for judicial review,supp.at.accordingly,for purposes of this appeal,the first two requirements of d were satisfied by,and we focus solely on the final requirement for collaterally attacking an order of removal under d that the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.d.
offered three reasons why the removal order was fundamentally unfair.first,he contended that the entry of the removal order was fundamentally unfair because his convictions under maryland law for assault and theft of less than did not constitute aggravated felonies under descamps united states,and united states royal,cir,and he was therefore not removable as charged.second,contended that because his offenses were not aggravated felonies,immigration officials should have advised him in that he was eligible for voluntary departure from the united states which,unlike removal,can not be a predicate for an illegal reentry conviction.see united states,cir.per curiam i f defendant had departed voluntarily instead of being removed,he would not now be liable under for illegal reentry following removal,because he would never have been removed.finally,argued that the removal order was fundamentally unfair because the government failure to provide a spanish translation of the charges in the noi deprived him of a meaningful opportunity to seek voluntary departure or otherwise challenge his removal order.in response,the government argued that maryland offenses qualified as aggravated felonies in and that therefore he was removable subject to expedited removal proceedings and ineligible for voluntary departure.
the district court agreed with that the entry of the removal order was fundamentally unfair as required by d.specifically,the district court determined that the government failure to provide a spanish translation of the charges against him deprived him of a fundamental due process right to the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner,supp.at internal quotation marks omitted,under the standard articulated in united states el shami,cir.reasoning that a competent translator is necessary to ensure the fairness of proceedings to applicants who do not speak english,supp.at internal quotation marks omitted,the district court concluded that was not afforded the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner,el shami,at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court explained 
t he facts indisputably show that,to the extent had any opportunity to be heard,the proceedings were conducted in a language he did not speak,and ended with him making an uncounseled,unknowing waiver of his ability to challenge the charges against him,either via available administrative remedies or upon petition for judicial review.
supp.at.thus,the court concluded that because due process rights were abridged in the removal process,the entry of the order of removal was fundamentally unfair.
finally,the district court considered whether suffered any prejudice,correctly recognizing that u nder the fundamental fairness prong of a collateral attack on a prior removal order,a defendant must establish that the deficiencies in the deportation proceedings caused him actual prejudice.id.at quoting el shami,at.the district court concluded that had been afforded a fair and meaningful opportunity to be heard on the charges against him,there was a reasonable probability that he would have ultimately been granted voluntary departure.the district court explained that,although would have remained removable on other grounds,i am satisfied that there is a reasonable probability that an immigration judge would have granted a request for voluntary departure,in lieu of deportation.id.at.to reach this conclusion,the district court applied current law rather than the law as it was understood at the time of his removal in.the district court held that under current law,maryland assault conviction did not constitute an aggravated felony and that therefore had been eligible for voluntary departure.accordingly,the court granted motion and dismissed the indictment.
the government appeals the district court order and seeks reinstatement of the indictment.in considering the district court grant of a motion under d to dismiss an indictment,we review the court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see united states woolfolk,cir.
we focus our attention on the fundamental fairness requirement of d.to demonstrate fundamental unfairness in the entry of the removal order,a defendant must show that his due process rights were violated by defects in his underlying deportation proceeding,and he suffered prejudice as a result of the defects.el shami,at internal quotation marks omitted.we consider each prong below.
due process 
t he due process clause applies to all persons within the united states,including aliens,whether their presence here is lawful,unlawful,temporary,or permanent.zadvydas davis,see shaughnessy united states ex rel.mezei,a liens who have once passed through our gates,even illegally,may be expelled only after proceedings conforming to traditional standards of fairness encompassed in due process of law.an alien may not be deprived of his life,liberty or property without due process of law,meaning that before his expulsion,he is entitled to notice of the nature of the charge and a hearing at least before an executive or administrative tribunal.kwong hai chew colding.due process requires,at a minimum,that an alien be given notice of the charges against him,a hearing before an executive or administrative tribunal,and a fair opportunity to be heard.el shami,at internal quotation marks omitted thus,an alien subject to expedited removal is entitled to the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
such a meaningful opportunity does not exist,however,when the alien does not understand the proceedings without the aid of a translator.a alien has a due process right to an interpreter at her deportation hearing because,absent an interpreter,a speaker ability to participate in the hearing and her due process right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard are essentially meaningless.nazarova ins,cir.see marincas lewis,cir.a competent translator is critical to ensure the fairness of proceedings to applicants who do not speak english.an alien due process right to a meaningful opportunity to be heard would be pointless in a removal proceeding wherein the alien and could not understand each other.see marincas,at.
the district court concluded that was denied an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner,el shami,at internal quotation marks omitted,based on abundant evidence that required translation assistance in order to understand the noi,the waiver,and legal proceedings,supp.at.thus,in view of the fact that the proceedings were conducted in a language he did not speak,and ended with him making an uncounseled,unknowing waiver of his ability to challenge the charges against him,id.at,the district court found that established that his due process rights were violated by a defect in his removal proceedings.
the government concedes that the expedited removal proceedings in this case did not comport with due process on the alternative basis that in failing to provide with a spanish translation of the noi,the dhs failed to comply with its own procedures 
the service must either provide the alien with a written translation of the notice of intent or explain the contents of the notice of intent to the alien in the alien native language or in a language that the alien understands.
b v.the government allows that dhs failure to adhere to its own regulations was a violation of due process that enabled to establish the first prong of d fundamental unfairness requirement.
for the reasons stated by the district court,we agree that dhs failure to afford a spanish translation of the charges in the noi and his rights rendered removal proceedings defective and abridged his due process rights.accordingly,we turn to the prejudice inquiry.see united states gomez,cir.once a due process or a qualifying regulatory violation has been established,we evaluate the third prong of d that the deportation order was fundamentally unfair as a prejudice inquiry.
to establish fundamental unfairness under d,a defendant must show that he suffered actual prejudice as a result of the due process violations in the removal proceedings.see el shami,at a defendant has to show under the fundamental unfairness requirement that the deficiencies in the deportation proceedings caused him actual prejudice.for to meet the actual prejudice requirement,he must demonstrate that,but for the errors complained of,there was a reasonable probability that he would not have been deported.id.this is not a generalized showing of prejudice rather,the defendant must link the actual prejudice he claims to have suffered to the specific due process violation at issue.see united states,cir.defendant must show both a fundamental procedural error and prejudice resulting from that error.emphasis added,at explaining that a defendant must demonstrate that prejudice resulted from the asserted procedural defect emphasis added.
the district court concluded that but for the errors complained of,the lack of a spanish translation of the noi charges against him or an explanation of his right to challenge the charges and obtain legal counsel there was a reasonable probability that would have been granted voluntary departure,thereby avoiding deportation and prosecution under,supp.at.the court conclusion presupposed that once successfully challenged the classification of his prior state convictions as aggravated felonies and established eligibility for discretionary relief,there was a reasonable probability that an immigration judge would have granted him voluntary departure on the basis that the positive equities of case outweighed the negative ones.id.at.
we can not agree.as explained below,the district court prejudice analysis necessarily rests on the flawed conclusion that had challenged the charges set forth in the noi in,the conviction for assault in maryland would not have been considered an aggravated felony.but circuit precedent at the time of administrative removal in tells us otherwise.
framework for determining if an offense constitutes an aggravated felony under the immigration and nationality act 
when the government alleges that a state conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony under the ina,we generally employ a categorical approach to determine whether the state offense is comparable to an offense listed in the ina.moncrieffe holder,see nijhawan holder.although the categorical approach was first introduced in the context of criminal law,it has a long pedigree in our nation immigration law.etienne lynch,cir.quoting moncrieffe,at.under this approach we look not to the facts of the particular prior case,but instead to whether the state statute defining the crime of conviction categorically fits within the generic federal definition of a corresponding aggravated felony.moncrieffe,at internal quotation marks omitted.the reason is that the ina asks what offense the noncitizen was convicted of,not what acts he committed.id.at quoting a a iii.an alien actual conduct is irrelevant to the inquiry,as the adjudicator must presume that the conviction rested upon nothing more than the least of the acts criminalized under the state statute.see id.at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
in a limited class of cases,of course,it is appropriate for a court to look beyond the fact of conviction in deciding whether an offense constitutes a violent felony.see taylor united states.this modified categorical approach,applies to state statutes that contain several different crimes,each described separately.moncrieffe,at.in such cases,a court may determine which particular offense the noncitizen was convicted of by examining the charging document and jury instructions,or in the case of a guilty plea,the plea agreement,plea colloquy,or some comparable judicial record of the factual basis for the plea.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
at the time of removal in,this circuit had nearly ten years of precedent applying the modified categorical approach to determine whether a given maryland assault conviction constituted a violent crime.in,we considered whether a conviction for common law assault in maryland constituted a crime of violence for purposes of the career offender guideline set forth in.see united states kirksey,cir.we concluded that a maryland assault conviction was not categorically a crime of violence because an assault is an attempted battery and,in turn,a battery under maryland law embraces a wide range of conduct,including kissing without consent,touching or tapping,jostling,and throwing water upon another.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,because it was unclear whether the conduct encompassed in the crime of battery categorically constitute d the use of physical force against the person of another to the degree required to constitute a crime of violence,we held that under taylor we were obligated to look beyond the definition of the crime to examine the facts contained in the charging document,id.at.
shortly thereafter,the en banc court affirmed this approach in united states coleman,cir.en banc,which applied the modified categorical approach to determine whether a assault conviction under maryland law was a violent felony for purposes of the armed career criminal act acca.noting that it was unable to conclude that a maryland conviction for assault is per se a violent felony within the meaning of e b i,the en banc court concluded that the district court properly looked beyond the fact of conviction and the elements of the offense to determine whether the particular offense of which coleman was convicted was a violent felony.id.at.in particular,we affirmed the district court consideration of the probable cause affidavit which set forth facts showing that coleman offense involved the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the victim.id.at.
and again,in,we reaffirmed under kirksey and coleman the propriety of looking past the fact of conviction and the definition of the offense to determine if a maryland assault conviction was a violent felony under the acca.see united states simms,cir.in simms,we concluded that the defendant maryland assault conviction constituted a violent felony for purposes of the acca based on the information set forth in the charging papers.see id.at.we rejected the argument that the supreme court decision in shepard united states,undermined coleman and kirksey because shepard specifically prohibited consideration of police reports or complaint applications,shepard,at.because the victim application was explicitly incorporated into maryland statement of charges against simms,simms,at,we concluded that shepard does not call into question our prior decisions because shepard specifically allows reference to the charging document,id.at.
even after,this court continued to apply the modified categorical approach to maryland assault convictions in these circumstances.see united states donnell,cir.united states taylor,cir.united states alston,cir.united states harcum,cir.harcum and alston,in particular,are illustrative of this court approach.in harcum,the defendant alleged predicate violent felony was a conviction for assault in violation of.code,crim.law.we
