background 
factual background 
ceraj initially fled from albania in november of.he filed an application for refugee status while in yugoslavia in.at that time,ceraj stated that he had left albania because 
m y aunt fled from albania years ago.h er son was sentenced to years imprisonment because of that,and he was confined.our family was discredited and mistreated.without freedom,democracy,religion,threatened and without right to education and to free choice of employment,i decided to escape from albania.
the former immigration and naturalization service the ins,now the department of homeland security denied ceraj application for refugee status in november of,finding that he had not been persecuted.
in april of,while still living in yugoslavia,ceraj allegedly reentered albania to participate in a demonstration against the albanian government.ceraj was arrested by the police during the demonstration and held for three days,during which time he claims that he was beaten.but he did not disclose this information during the interview regarding his refugee application in may of.according to ceraj,he feared that he would be sent back to albania if the american authorities knew that he had reentered the country once before.
ceraj returned to albania in,began farming with his father,and married.the democratic party was in control of the albanian government at the time.in early,ceraj and his wife allegedly participated in at least four demonstrations against the government and its leader,sali berisha.at one of the demonstrations,ceraj claims that the police broke his arm and injured his back.in march of,ceraj and left albania and used fraudulent documents to gain admission into the united states at new york city.
ceraj filed an application for asylum in august of.in that application,ceraj stated that he was seeking asylum because of his political and religious views.he claimed that he was constantly activ e in the demonstrations that took place during the fall of the communist regime in albania and cited his involvement in the april protest.ceraj said that he was arrested because he and most of the young people of shkodra were trying to take down the statute of the enver hoxha.he also stated that he was involved with the organizations that were trying to stop pyramid schemes in early and that he was beaten several times and threatened with arrest or death.the application further indicates that ceraj was a member of a demokratik sic party of albania since april.according to the handwritten notes prepared by the asylum interviewer,ceraj duties and responsibilities as a party member included distributing leaflets.
ceraj filed a supplemental application for asylum in late october of.an affidavit accompanied this application and provided more details regarding ceraj asylum claim.according to this latest application,ceraj feared returning to albania because of his political beliefs which are and his membership in a family in northern albania.ceraj claims that he is well known to the communist party of albania and many members of the current socialist government.he also makes reference to his membership in the roman catholic minority population in northern albania.
ceraj supplemental application lists three instances in which he was allegedly mistreated by the albanian authorities.first,ceraj claims that he left albania in because he had been targeted by the communist secret police for listening to radio programs such as voice of america and vatican voice.the secret police allegedly broke ceraj radio and told him that they would take other measures if he did not stop listening to the radio and encouraging others to do likewise.ceraj felt that he would be arrested and executed if he continued his behavior.he in fact claims that ten days after the incident with the radio,the secret police told him that he would be killed.the supplemental application is the first time that any mention is made about this specific incident.according to ceraj testimony during the hearing,he did not mention the radio incident during his initial refugee application in because the interpreter in that situation was from kosovo.ceraj also claimed that he might not have understood the question.
contrary to his asylum application in,ceraj alleges that he was not a member of the democratic party before he left albania because the party had yet to be organized.he acknowledges,however,that he was active in seeking to bring about the end of the communist regime and to form a new political structure.ceraj testified before the ij that he had never been a member of any political party and that he was for freedom,just that.
the second alleged instance of mistreatment by the albanian authorities set forth in ceraj supplemental application was his arrest at the demonstration in april of.in the affidavit accompanying ceraj application,he provides details about how he swam across the buna river into albania the night before the demonstration with his cousin and three other men.during his testimony before the ij,however,ceraj repeatedly changed the number of people who swam with him.he initially stated that there were three people,then four,then five who swam across the river.ceraj also was unclear about whether his brother was among the persons involved in this incident.
after the men arrived in albania,they hid in a hay wagon and rode to the demonstration.ceraj claims that the demonstration was peaceful until the police attacked the protestors.he was arrested and held without being charged for three days,during which time ceraj claims that the prisoners were beaten and abused.in his supplemental asylum application,ceraj acknowledges that he failed to disclose his return to albania during his process in,but claims that he did so because he was afraid they would send him back to albania.
the final allegation of mistreatment that ceraj lists in his supplemental application is the injuries he claims to have suffered in while protesting against pyramid schemes perpetrated by the albanian government.specifically,ceraj states that he and his wife participated in at least four demonstrations in shkodra,and that on one of these occasions his arm was broken and he received a back injury.ceraj contended in his supplemental application that he was directly identified by the police and beaten with sticks.but he never sought formal medical treatment for his broken arm,which casts considerable doubt on the veracity of this alleged injury.
during his testimony before the ij,ceraj stated his belief that the police from his area would kill him if he returned to albania.he alleges that some of the police officers currently working in the area were the officers who had initially confronted him about listening to prohibited radio programs.his mother has also allegedly told him not to return to albania because the police would kill him.
procedural background 
both ceraj and applications were addressed at a merits hearing in march of.the ij determined that ceraj had filed a frivolous asylum application and that his testimony was not credible.this caused the ij to deny ceraj request for relief and to order both ceraj and his wife removed.the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision in a per curiam order with additional commentary.ceraj and his wife timely appealed the bia order.this court denied their motion to stay their removal pending resolution of the present appeal.

substantial evidence supports the ij finding that ceraj asylum application was frivolous 
an alien who knowingly made a frivolous application for asylum despite receiving notice of the consequences,shall be permanently ineligible for any benefits of the asylum laws.d.the implementing regulation provides that an asylum application is frivolous if any of its material elements is deliberately fabricated.a finding of frivolousness requires 
notice to the alien of the consequences of filing a frivolous application,a specific finding by the ij or the bia that the alien knowingly filed a frivolous application,sufficient evidence in the record to support the finding that a material element of the asylum application was deliberately fabricated,and an indication that the alien has been afforded sufficient opportunity to account for any discrepancies or implausible aspects of the claim.
lazar gonzales,cir.moreover,b ecause of the severe consequences that flow from a frivolousness finding,the preponderance of the evidence must support an ij finding that the petitioner knowingly and deliberately fabricated material elements of the claim.id.second and third alterations in original quoting in re yl,bia.
the ij found the following incidents in ceraj asylum application to be fabrications the account of persecution for listening to the prohibited radio programs,and the account of swimming back into albania to participate in a demonstration.as the ij explained,although ceraj now claims that the radio incident was the cause of his initial flight from albania,he did not mention it in his refugee application or in his asylum application,and i t was mentioned until several years later when his current lawyer helped him file the most recent application.this information is material to ceraj claim because ceraj alleges that the same people who persecuted him for this listening still are in power today.the ij also based his finding of fabrication on the fact that ceraj admitted that he lied about not returning to albania in his initial application for refugee status and could not accurately recount how many people swam back to albania when he allegedly attended the demonstration in.
in adopting the ij finding,the bia held that there are sufficient inconsistencies,which are in the record,to support a determination that material aspects of the lead respondent claim,as detailed in his most recent asylum application and in his testimony during the instant proceedings,were deliberately fabricated.the bia did not make any specific supplemental findings related to frivolousness,but noted that ceraj received adequate warning of the consequences of submitting a frivolous application and subsequently failed to offer explanations for the discrepancies that the ij found in the various applications.
we find ourselves in agreement with the bia that ceraj received adequate warning about the consequences of filing a frivolous application for asylum.at the commencement of the hearing in march of,the ij explicitly told ceraj that his two applications really are,when read together,one long continuous application.the ij further informed ceraj that he might have to explain why the two applications may be different,but ceraj would be given the opportunity of correcting anything in it that wrong.ceraj was then informed of the consequences of filing a frivolous application,and the ij explained that the application would be deemed frivolous if ceraj lied about something that was important to his application,and when he lied,he knew he was not be ing truthful.the ij then asked ceraj if he had been over the application and using a competent translator,and ceraj said that he had.ceraj stated that there was nothing in the application that he wished to change.the record also indicates the ceraj received a written warning about the consequences of filing a frivolous application at the commencement of the hearing.
ceraj argues on appeal that the ij warning was not sufficient because it came too late and ceraj was not offered the opportunity to withdraw his application.specifically,ceraj contends that because he received no warning when he filed his application,the warning during the hearing should be inoperative with respect to that document.the ij,however,explicitly told ceraj that his two applications would be treated as one continuous application and that he would have to address any discrepancies between the two documents.ceraj offers no legal support for his argument that he should have been told he could withdraw his application.the governing regulation simply states that a finding of frivolousness shall only be made if the immigration judge or the board is satisfied that the applicant,during the course of the proceedings,has had sufficient opportunity to account for any discrepancies or implausible aspects of the claim.
after careful review,we conclude that the preponderance of the evidence supports the ij determination that ceraj knowingly and deliberately fabricated a material element of his application.we specifically believe that sufficient evidence supports the ij finding that ceraj fabricated his claim of mistreatment for listening to prohibited radio stations.the radio incident appears for the first time in ceraj supplemental asylum application filed in.there is no mention of the incident in either ceraj refugee application or his asylum application.during his testimony before the ij,ceraj attempted to explain these omissions by blaming the translators for failing to include the radio incident when they transcribed his account.ceraj,however,also indicated that he had read his answers on both applications and approved them before he signed.
the radio incident is material to ceraj asylum claim because it presents the only example of direct and targeted personal mistreatment of ceraj by the albanian authorities.as the most colorable claim of past persecution,ceraj allegation that he was beaten for listening to prohibited radio programs is essential to his asylum claim.
we are less confident about the ij additional finding of frivolousness with respect to ceraj claim that he swam back into albania to participate in a demonstration.although ceraj made inconsistent statements concerning how many people were with him during that incident,this inconsistency could conceivably have been the product of a failed memory rather than a deliberate and knowing falsification.at the same time,however,he admitted lying on his refugee application,in which he denied ever having returned to albania after seeking refugee status in yugoslavia,and then attempted to excuse that falsehood by attributing it to fear that he would be sent back to albania if his application established that he had returned voluntarily once before.
the ij noted that ceraj lied about staying in yugoslavia over a period of time,yet the ij still concluded that ceraj never swam back into the country to participate in th e demonstration.although these two conclusions appear to be contradictory,we have no need to agree or disagree with the ij additional finding of frivolousness because one material fabrication is enoug
