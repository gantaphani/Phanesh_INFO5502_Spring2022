defendant,john demjanjuk,appeals from the district court order revoking defendant citizenship,due to defendant illegal procurement of such citizenship,and allowing his naturalization to be set aside pursuant to a.because we find that plaintiff,the united states of america government,sustained its burden of proving through clear,unequivocal and convincing evidence that defendant,in fact,served as a guard at several nazi training and concentration camps during world war ii ww ii,we concur with the district court that he was not legally eligible to obtain citizenship under the displaced persons act of dpa.dpa,stat.we therefore affirm the district court order.

united states demjanjuk,no,dist.lexis setting aside demjanjuk,on the basis of the findings of prosecutorial misconduct in demjanjuk.
subsequently,on may,the government filed a second complaint in the district court,seeking to denaturalize defendant on the ground that he illegally procured his united states citizenship.the first claim alleged defendant unlawful admission into the united states,in violation of a,and was based on his alleged persecution of civilians during wwii,in violation of the dpa,stat.the second claim alleged defendant unlawful admission into the united states,again in violation of a,and was based on defendant alleged membership or participation in a movement hostile to the united states,in violation of the dpa,stat.the third claim charged defendant with illegally procuring a certificate of naturalization by making willful misrepresentation to immigration officials,in violation of a.
defendant filed an omnibus motion to dismiss the complaint,which was denied by the district court in a memorandum opinion and order on february.defendant thereafter applied for a writ of mandamus directing the district court to dismiss the denaturalization proceeding on april,this court denied that request.defendant then filed a counterclaim,alleging that plaintiff tortured and harassed him and his family this was dismissed by the district court on july,in a memorandum opinion and order.
the case was tried without a jury on the government claims of defendant illegal procurement of united states citizenship,on may.on february,the district court released findings of fact and conclusions of law,united states demjanjuk,wl,demjanjuk.a,and a supplemental opinion,united states demjanjuk,wl,demjanjuk.b.the district court entered judgment revoking defendant citizenship and naturalization,and ordering defendant to surrender and deliver his certificate of naturalization and any passport or other documentary evidence of citizenship to the attorney general,within ten days.
defendant filed motions for judgment to amend findings,to alter or amend judgment,for a new trial,and for relief from judgment under.b these motions were all denied by the district court in an order on march.
on may,defendant filed a notice of appeal of the district court orders and judgments from july,february,and march.on february,plaintiff filed a motion to strike or for leave to file surreply,seeking to strike defendant reply brief.on february,this court denied the motion for leave to file a surreply.in addition to the instant appeal,this court will rule on the motion to strike defendant reply brief in the instant opinion.
in demjanjuk,this court set forth the factual background for the various cases involving defendant.we therefore recite only those facts most relevant to the appeal before us.john demjanjuk is a native of the ukraine,a republic of the former soviet union.demjanjuk was conscripted into the soviet army in and then captured by the germans,during wwii,in.later that year,after short stays in several german pow camps and a probable tour at the trawniki ss training camp in poland,demjanjuk became a guard at the treblinka concentration camp in poland.demjanjuk was admitted to the united states in under the displaced persons act of and became a naturalized united states citizen in.defendant denied that he was a ukrainian guard at treblinka who was known as ivan or iwan grozny,that is,ivan the terrible.he has resided in the cleveland,ohio area since his arrival in this country.
in the current proceeding,the government alleges that demjanjuk persecuted civilians at trawniki,oksow,majdanek,sobibor and flossenburg concentration camps,but not treblinka,as alleged in earlier denaturalization proceedings.defendant was identified,in previous proceedings,as well as in the current one,by the trawniki camp identification card which contained defendant picture.the trawniki card,the government exhibit,is a german dienstausweis or service identity card,identifying the holder as guard number.
one of the main issues before this court is whether demjanjuk was guard.there are seven wartime documents in evidence that plaintiff alleges identify defendant.three forensic experts testified that forensic testing revealed no evidence to doubt the authenticity of the seven wartime in archives in russia,ukraine,lithuania and the former west demjanjuk name and other identifying information.at.

the district court below issued findings of fact and conclusions of law determining that the government sustained its burden of proving that the trawniki service pass identifying defendant presence at the nazi training camp was authentic within the meaning of.a,b,admissible under,the ancient document exception to the hearsay rule admissible under,the public records and reports exception to the hearsay rule and as a foreign public document under.under such proof,defendant service as a guard at a nazi training camp,and subsequent concentration camps,would make him ineligible for a visa under the dpa and,and therefore,unlawfully admitted,rendering his citizenship illegally procured and subject to revocation under.
defendant now asserts that the district court abused its discretion by admitting the trawniki service pass and relying on its identifying features to determine that defendant was present in the trawniki nazi training camp in poland during wwii.defendant asserts that the government submitted only two documents identifying defendant as a nazi guard the trawniki pass and a kgb protocol of the interrogation of ignat danilchenko,a former concentration camp guard.at.defendant claims that if these two pieces of evidence fail to accurately identify him,then the subsequent identifying war documents add no further identifying information.the government argues that there are in fact seven wartime documents that identify defendant by his surname,three of which include defendant birth date and place.at.one of those three,the trawniki service pass,also includes defendant photograph,nationality,father name,facial shape,eye color,hair color,and reference to an identifiable scar on defendant back.
defendant allegation of inadmissible hearsay 
as discussed above,defendant now bases his objections to the trawniki service pass admissibility on hearsay,under.because defendant did not object on this ground at trial,this court can only deem it inadmissible if,as a matter of plain error,the evidence inadmissibility should have been apparent to the trial judge without objection,or if the evidence strike s at fundamental fairness,honesty,or public reputation of the trial.evans,at quoting united states causey,cir,cert.denied,d.based on the district court findings of facts and having considered both parties briefs,we find that the trawniki service pass was not erroneously admitted by the district court.
defendant argument that the district court erroneously relied on the truth of the information asserted on the service pass,because it contained double hearsay,is without merit.defendant argues that the four elements of identifying information on the service pass name,date of birth,place of birth and nationality,are derived from statements by the german clerk who issued the card and the allegedly unknown pow who was to be labeled guard.
federal rule of evidence b governs the admissibility of ancient documents.the rule states that a document is admissible if it a is in such condition as to create no suspicion concerning its authenticity,b was in a place where it,if authentic,would likely be,and c has been in existence years or more at the time it is offered.the question of whether evidence is suspicious,and therefore inadmissible,is within the trial court discretion.united states kairys,cir.although rule b requires that the document be free of suspicion,that suspicion goes not to the content of the document,but rather to whether the document is what it purports to be.id.therefore,whether the contents of the document correctly identify the defendant goes to its weight and is a matter for the trier of fact.see also kalamazoo river study group menasha,cir.
the district court admitted the service pass into evidence,stating that it was authenticated under.b,and satisfied six additional evidentiary rules,including two hearsay exceptions.defendant fails to demonstrate how the district court erred in recognizing the alleged violation of double hearsay under,when the service pass was already admitted under two hearsay,the ancient document rule,and the public record exception.hearsay within hearsay,or double hearsay,should not be excluded from admissibility if each separate hearsay component conforms to an exception to the hearsay rule.shell parrish,cir.this court need not analyze whether the district court would have deemed both sources of information contained in the service pass admissible under defendant double hearsay allegation,because the admission of the service pass,as identification of the defendant,was already admitted under several other evidentiary rules,and was not so objectionable that it should have been apparent under a plain error analysis.united states price,cir citing united states rodriguez,cir.
defendant allegation of unauthenticated inadmissible evidence 
additionally,defendant argues that the district court erroneously admitted the service pass as an authenticated document under.b,based upon the expert testimony of sydnor.sydnor testified that the service card was found in the vinnitsa archives in the ukraine however,because sydnor had never been to the vinnitsa archives,defendant argues the testimony regarding the service pass origin was not based on personal knowledge.the government argues that defendant allegation of the service pass admissibility must also be reviewed under a plain error analysis because,although defendant objected to the admission of the service pass under.b,he previously argued that the document substantive content was unreliable and now,on appeal,argues that the government failed to prove its origin.in the district court findings of fact,there was uncontradicted testimony stating the origin of the service pass.demjanjuk,wl,at.defendant has not objected to this element of the service pass authentication until now therefore,this court should use a plain error analysis in determining its admissibility.evans,at.
again,defendant fails to establish that the district court so obviously erred in admitting the service pass in opposition to defendant proof of origin objection,because the service pass was also admitted on six other evidentiary bases.defendant is not,however,challenging the other evidentiary bases upon which the district court admitted the service pass therefore,defendant objection as to its origin,even if meritorious,would be moot as there is overwhelming evidence to the contrary.see united states holloway,cir commenting on whether the district court erred in excluding certain evidence when there was an admission of evidence of substantially the same nature stating w e need not decide whether the district court ruling was erroneous or whether this is a reviewable issue because if any error occurred it was harmless because similar evidence would have been cumulative see also united states mclernon,cir we need not decide whether to adopt a secondary issue standard,however,because our finding that the primary issues involved whether the defendant was entrapped as a matter of law into violating and the jury finding of not guilty on every other charge renders cummulative any error in the inclusion of the secondary issue.therefore,the district court ruling that the service pass was sufficiently authenticated by the supporting circumstantial evidence showing that the document in question is what it was purported to be was not clearly erroneous and its admissibility should stand.see.b.this is so particularly because defendant did not appeal all of the additional grounds upon which the evidence was admitted.
defendant allegations of the district court erroneous findings of fact 
having deemed defendant hearsay argument to be without merit,this court determines that the government would still prevail based upon the district court factual findings that the court reliance on the service pass as identification evidence was not clearly erroneous.defendant argues that because denaturalization proceedings require a much higher burden of proof,the government case is insufficient in light of the quantum of reliable of evidence that has been required in previous cases.defendant brief at citing denaturalization proceedings against individuals not admitting to service for the germans,where the government used wartime documents that contained consistent,verifiable or unchallenged identifying information pertaining to the defendants,usually supported by corroborative evidence see kairys,at cir defendant identification card verified defendant thumb print and expert testimony identified the signature on the card as that of the defendant see also united states hajda,cir documents supported by testimony of sister and father in earlier trial stating that defendant had served in the ss.
here,the district court found that the government has proven by clear,convincing,and unequivocal evidence that defendant assisted in the persecution of civilian populations during world war ii,based on evidence that the trawniki service pass was an authentic german wartime document issued to defendant sufficiently identifying him and establishing his presence at the nazi training camp between and.demjanjuk.a,wl.
despite defendant arguments,the record before us does in fact support the district court findings of fact,specifically regarding the trawniki service pass.there is sufficient testimony from expert witnesses to corroborate the accuracy of the contents of the service pass,in conjunction with the additional six wartime documents that corroborate defendant identity.some of the characteristics that appear on the service pass and are not disputed by defendant,such as his name,birth date,town of birth,father name,and nationality,also appear on other documents identifying defendant as guard.these additional documents also list specific characteristics of defendant,such as his name,birth date,and place of birth.as the district court stated in its supplemental opinion,demjanjuk.b,defendant has attacked the authenticity of the documents on various grounds,but the expert testimony of the document examiners is devastating to d efendant contentions t he court is convinced that the trawniki service identity pass,for a person named iwan demjanjuk is authentic.demjanjuk.b,wl.defendant tries to raise doubt as to the identity of the person on the service pass,designated as guard,but he offers no evidence to support his assertion.see kairys,at holding that the trial court was not clearly erroneous in determining that there was sufficient evidence to properly identify the defendant as the nazi guard pictured on the defendant alleged identification card,and although the district court primarily relied on the defendant fingerprint on the card,there was other testimony and personal documentation that further supported the association.given the credibility determination made with respect to the identification elements of the government case,this court agrees with the government that the district court factual findings were not clearly erroneous.
the court discretion in admitting expert testimony to further identify defendant 
defendant contends that the district court erred in relying on sydnor testimony,which served to confirm defendant identity,arguing that the court failed to make a preliminary assessment of the reliability of sydnor archival search methodology before considering his substantive testimony.the government argues,and this court agrees that this argument is particularly ironic,inasmuch as defendant repeatedly relies on sydnor testimony to support points beneficial to his defense which require expert testimonial corroboration.defendant brief at.nevertheless,defendant argues that the court failure to make a preliminary reliability determination of sydnor archival search method was erroneous,and in violation of daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d explaining that part of a trial court gatekeeping function under.when,for example,scientific opinion testimony is offered,is the determination of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid.defendant asserts that sydnor method of research was not reliably proven to be complete,and states that exculpatory evidence may not have been obtained,as was the case in defendant previous denaturalization proceeding.demjanjuk,cir.
this court reviews the admission or exclusion of expert evidence for an abuse of discretion.joiner,d see also united states jones,cir.a trial judge has broad discretion in the matter of the admission or exclusion of expert evidence,and the court action is to be sustained unless manifestly erroneous.jones,at quoting parenthetically salem united states lines,d.this discretion is particularly broad in a bench trial.eng g henderson glass,cir stating that the issue of whether a witness is qualified to testify as an expert is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge and particularly so in a bench trial.
federal rule of evidence provides the requirements for admitting expert testimony 
if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise,if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
in the instant action,following voir dire,which included a lengthy inquiry into sydnor methodology,the district court responded to defendant objection that sydnor failed to follow an acceptable method of searching for archival documents.the court went on to commend defendant objection,but explained that it would permit sydnor to testify based on his qualifications,and further explained that 
this does not mean the court has to accept his testimony to any extent.obviously,if a person who has been qualified as an expert has employed techniques in a particular case that are not as valid as other techniques might have been,those factors mitigate against the acceptance of their testimony.the court is perfectly capable of making those determinations based upon the examination and of the witness.
defendant now argues that the district court prevented him from inquiring into that which daubert requires the validity and reliability of the methodology underlying the proposed this case the methodology pertaining to performing archival searches.
daubert,at.
the government relies on berry school dist.of benton harbor,d,to assert a court discretion as to the admissibility of evidence,when weighed by a trier of fact,and subsequently disregarded as inadmissible or unpersuasive.the government also asserts that whether an expert correctly applied an uncontroversial methodology is a question of the evidence weight before the trier of fact.here,neither party contends that the methodology was original or controversial.on the contrary,defendant states that it is the same methodology used in the previous denaturalization proceeding,which was subsequently overturned,due in part to withheld and unearthed exculpatory evidence.
this court has previously analyzed the requirements of daubert,and its preliminary reliability analysis requirement.first tennessee bank national barreto,holding that the decision to admit the defendant expert testimony was not an abuse of discretion,dismissing plaintiff
