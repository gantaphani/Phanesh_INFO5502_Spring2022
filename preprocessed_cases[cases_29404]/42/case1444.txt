opinion of the court 
khaimraj singh,a guyanan national,petitions for review of a final order of removal grounded upon the determination that he is an aggravated felon on account of his conviction for touching the breast of his cousin,who was under sixteen years of age.the offense of conviction was,unlawful sexual contact in the third degree,which provides 
a person is guilty of unlawful sexual contact in the third degree when the person has sexual contact with another person or causes the victim to have sexual contact with the person or a third person and the person knows that the contact is either offensive to the victim or occurs without the victim consent.
the question presented on this petition for singh has been convicted of the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor,a a turns on whether we must apply the formal categorical approach announced in taylor united states,d.under that approach,an adjudicator must look only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses,and may not consider other evidence concerning the defendant prior crimes,including,the particular facts underlying a conviction.id.at.if we apply the formal categorical approach,singh has not been convicted of the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor because does not contain an element specifying the age of the victim.if we do not apply the formal categorical approach,singh has been convicted of the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor because the victim of his sex offense was,indeed,a minor.
our jurisprudence in the aggravated felony cases in not a seamless web.in order to resolve the appeal we have found it necessary to analyze and synthesize this body of case law,and we do so at length,see infra part.as will appear,a pattern emerges,causing us to conclude that,while the formal categorical approach of taylor presumptively applies in assessing whether an alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony,in some cases the language of the particular subsection of a at issue will invite inquiry into the underlying facts of the case,and in some cases the disjunctive phrasing of the statute of conviction will similarly invite inquiry into the specifics of the conviction.but in this case,neither a a nor.invite inquiry into the facts underlying singh conviction.therefore,because taylor s formal categorical approach applies to singh case,we will grant the petition for review.
factual background and proceedings before the immigration judge and board of immigration appeals 
singh is a native and citizen of guyana.he was admitted to the united states in june as an immigrant.about ten years later,he touched the breast of his cousin,who was under the age of sixteen.for this,the state of delaware charged him under,unlawful sexual contact in the second degree.apparently as part of a plea agreement with the state prosecutor,singh pled guilty to the lesser included offense of,unlawful sexual contact in the third degree.on may,the delaware superior court imposed a suspended sentence.
this conviction,the government asserts,renders singh an aggravated felon under a a,which provides that sexual abuse of a minor is an aggravated felony under a a iii,an alien convicted of an aggravated felony is removable.the immigration judge ij agreed with the government position,noting that the sentencing order of the delaware court reflects clearly,under special conditions of probation,note victim is under years of age.citing which defines the age of majority as,the ij explained that the victim was under years of age and,consequently,would be classified as a minor.the ij then looked to for the definition of sexual abuse,which includes sexually explicit conduct 
the term sexually explicit conduct includes touching of one breast under a.consequently,the court finds that the respondent has engaged in sexually explicit conduct of a child.likewise,the court would find that the respondent conviction,notwithstanding the fact that the age of the victim is not specifically designated in the statute,has indeed engaged in sexual abuse of a minor as defined in title.
the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion.see e under a c and our decision in drakes zimski,cir,we have jurisdiction to consider our jurisdiction over this timely petition for review of a final decision of the bia.
ii.standard of review 
this case turns on a question of statutory,the meaning and application of the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor.as we noted in patel ashcroft,cir,there is some confusion surrounding the proper standard of review in cases such as this.patel,which was an aggravated felony case,discusses at length the role of chevron deference in cases interpreting the immigration and nationality act ina generally,and the aggravated felony statute of a in particular.in our most recent aggravated felony case,we described the scope of our chevron deference thus 
the first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.valansi ashcroft,cir quoting marshak treadwell,cir.if the statutory meaning is clear,our inquiry is at an end.id.if the statutory meaning is not clear,we must try to discern congress intent using the ordinary tools of statutory construction.see ins,d.if,by employing traditional tools of statutory construction,we determine that congress intent is clear,that is the end of the matter.valansi,at quoting bell reno,cir.if we are unable to discern congress intent using the normal tools of statutory construction,we will generally give deference to the board interpretation,so long as it is reasonable.id.
lee ashcroft,cir.
canvassing the dozen aggravated felony cases decided by this court,one indisputable and surprising pattern emerges we have never affirmatively deferred to an interpretation by the bia or an ij of a,of whether the crime at issue constitutes an aggravated felony.many times we have not even discussed chevron deference to the bia,irrespective of whether we ultimately agreed or disagreed with the board.see munroe ashcroft,cir wilson ashcroft,cir bovkun ashcroft,cir united states graham,cir.we also have suggested that we conduct de novo review because the question goes to our jurisdiction.see nugent ashcroft,cir valansi,at citing cases.twice we have declined to reach the question of deference because we concluded that our result would be the same on deferential review as it would on plenary review.see patel,at drakes zimski,cir.in two cases,we acknowledged that we must defer to the bia if the statute meaning is ambiguous,but both times we held that the bia interpretation conflicted with the statute plain meaning.see lee,at valansi,at.in yet another case we affirmatively held that the bia interpretation of,which is incorporated by reference in the aggravated felony statute,a f,was not subject to the general principles of chevron,but that,even if it was,the specific interpretation at issue was unreasonable and therefore not entitled to deference.see francis reno,cir.finally,two decisions appear to be more deferential to the bia.in gerbier holmes,cir,we found the bia interpretation persuasive hardly a strong general endorsement,while in steele blackman,cir,we stated that if a statute administered by the ins is ambiguous,and the bia has provided a reasonable interpretation of its language,we must simply ask whether the bia construction is a permissible one.even in steele,however,we looked more closely into the bia interpretation,finding it troublesome,but we assume d its validity because even the bia own interpretation of the statute did not support its disposition of the case.at.
why then have we never found it necessary and appropriate to defer to the bia or ij interpretation of a first,as we explained in francis,the interpretation and exposition of criminal law is a task outside the bia sphere of special competence.see at see also drakes,at chevron natural resources defense council,d deference is not required where the interpretation of a particular statute does not implicate agency expertise in a meaningful way but presents instead a pure question of statutory construction for the courts to decide.quoting sandoval reno,cir quoting ins,d alteration in original.second,we have been mindful,as in nugent,at,and valansi,at,that although the statute is part of title,and not title,of the united states code,it nonetheless controls our jurisdiction via a c and we normally consider jurisdictional matters de novo.
moreover,here the ij offered no reason for his decision not to apply taylor s categorical approach the bia,by affirming without opinion,gave no considered and authoritative interpretation of the statute and now on petition for review,the government entire position on deference consists of a single citation to an admittedly vague comment from this court in patel,at s ome deference is still required under chevron,even though we are reviewing a purely legal question such as the bia interpretation of a criminal statute.under all these circumstances,we conclude that the ij summary application of a a it can hardly be described as a reasoned not entitled to deference.as we have done in previous cases,however,we will here expressly reserve decision on whether some bia interpretations of a are entitled to deference.
iii.discussion 
some of our cases interpreting a have employed the rule of taylor,described there as the formal categorical approach,at.see,francis,at.taylor addressed the meaning and application of the term burglary in e,which imposes enhanced sentences on defendants convicted under the statute,g,when the defendant has three prior convictions for specified offenses,including burglary.taylor s analysis can be readily imported here,because a is similar to e in that it too enumerates offenses,conviction of which places an alien in the category of aggravated felon.taylor put the general issue in interpreting this sort of statute as follows 
whether the sentencing court in applying e must look only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses,or whether the court may consider other evidence concerning the defendant prior crimes.the courts of appeals uniformly have held that e mandates a formal categorical approach,looking only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses,and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.
at.citing the practical difficulties and potential unfairness to a defendant of a factual approach,id.at,the taylor court adopted the formal categorical approach.
the facts of taylor provide an apt illustration of the principle at work taylor had been twice convicted of second degree burglary in missouri.under missouri law,second degree burglary encompassed several discrete sets of statutory elements.as the court explained,all seven offenses required entry into a structure,but they varied as to the type of structure and the means of entry involved.id.at.compared with the definition of generic burglary adopted by the court convict ion of any crime,regardless of its exact definition or label,having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into,or remaining in,a building or structure,with intent to commit a crime,id.at.all variants of missouri second degree burglary qualified under the federal sentencing enhancement statute.since the formal categorical approach does not permit looking beyond the literal elements of the statute,to the facts supporting the convictions,the court could not say that taylor had been previously convicted of crimes encompassing the elements of generic burglary.see id.at.accordingly,the court remanded for further development on the question of which of the missouri second degree burglary statutes were the bases for taylor prior convictions.id.the inquiry was limited to the statute of conviction,however,as the formal categorical approach generally requires the trial court to look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.id.the taylor court also acknowledged that,under limited circumstances,resort to the charging instrument may be permissible the formal categorical approach may permit the sentencing court to go beyond the mere fact of conviction in a narrow range of cases where a jury was actually required to find all the necessary elements.id.
the questions presented in this case are readily apparent does taylor s formal categorical approach apply to sexual abuse of a minor under a a,and if it does,does a conviction under.nonetheless qualify as a conviction for sexual abuse of a minor we find it more efficient to address the second question first.
under the formal categorical approach of taylor,does a conviction under.qualify as a conviction for sexual abuse of a minor 
the government first argues that,even under the formal categorical approach,a conviction under.is a conviction for sexual abuse of a minor.to evaluate this argument,we follow the supreme court approach in taylor,where it first construed the term burglary in the federal statute,at,and then compared the elements of the missouri statutes to the federal definition,id.at.the ij looked to,and to define sexual abuse of a minor.while we have no quarrel with this approach,it is unnecessary for our purposes to give a comprehensive definition of sexual abuse of a minor,and we reserve decision on that question.it is sufficient to say that sexual abuse of a minor entails some conduct involving a minor,someone under the age of eighteen.
this is enough to defeat the government argument,for says nothing whatsoever about the age of the victim.in full,the statute under which singh was convicted reads 
a person is guilty of unlawful sexual contact in the third degree when the person has sexual contact with another person or causes the victim to have sexual contact with the person or a third person and the person knows that the contact is either offensive to the victim or occurs without the victim consent.
since a finding of the age of the victim is not required for conviction,does not appear to be an aggravated felony or at least not the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor.
in the face of the literal and unambiguous text of,the government argues that the statute nonetheless criminalizes sexual abuse of a minor.of course it is irrelevant that sexually abusing a minor may be sufficient for conviction under the statute what matters is whether such conduct is necessary for such a conviction.the government seems to argue that the overall statutory scheme in delaware establishes that sexual abuse of a minor is necessary for a conviction under.even assuming that appeals to statutes other than the statute of conviction are within the bounds of the formal categorical approach,we still can not agree with the government position.
a provides the delaware family court with exclusive original criminal jurisdiction over unlawful sexual conduct in the third degree against a child under.similarly.b a defines sexual offender as a person who has been convicted of any sexual offense upon a child under years of age under,the government would have us read these provisions as definitions of.we do not agree.there are at least two problems with the government approach.first,against a child and upon a child,in.a and.b a,respectively,are better read not as definitions of ann.tit,but rather as qualifications or limitations on the convictions that are intended to be within the scope of the jurisdictional and sex offender statutes.unless these phrases are read as qualifiers,they are not,in b a,simply omit upon a child under years of age if the statutes referred to already incorporate such a notion 
a second and independent problem with the government proposed reading is that it leads to absurdities elsewhere in the statutory scheme.for example.are the gamut of traditional sex offenses under delaware law,from misdemeanor sexual assault to first degree rape.adopting the government argument would imply not only that is an offense against a child,but also that are as well.this would have the astonishing result that all sex offenses in delaware as delaware does not define any general sex offenses outside this list require that the victim be a child.these problems only reinforce our conclusion from the plain meaning of the statute.does not include as an element that the victim be a minor,and accordingly,under the formal categorical approach of taylor,singh does not stand convicted of sexual abuse of a minor.
does the formal categorical approach of taylor apply to the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor 
because the ij decision can not stand if we apply taylor s formal categorical approach,we must turn to the government fallback argument that the formal categorical approach does not apply to sexual abuse of a minor under a a.if the government is free from the strictures of the formal categorical approach,we would simply review the ij decision under the deferential substantial evidence standard,evaluating whether the factual record before the ij could fairly support the conclusion that singh was convicted of sexual abuse of a minor.see dia,at describing the substantial evidence standard.as the record supports this,singh concedes that,as a factual matter,he was convicted for touching the breast of his minor would dismiss the petition if the formal categorical approach did not apply here.but for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the formal categorical approach does apply.
our prior aggravated felony jurisprudence 
we have decided a dozen cases implicating a,and at times we have applied the formal categorical approach of taylor,and at other times we have not.in the latter instances,though we have never explicitly considered and rejected taylor s approach,our decisions can not be fairly read as employing the formal categorical approach.the question here,then,is whether sexual abuse of a minor under a a is more akin to those provisions of a to which we have applied the formal categorical approach,or to those to which we have not.we begin with a comprehensive survey of this court aggravated felony jurisprudence.the united states supreme court has not decided any case involving a,so we consider only our own cases in this survey.three of the twelve cases we have decided,see supra part ii,do not even implicitly involve the question whether to use taylor s formal categorical approach thus,in the sections that follow,we address the other nine cases,which all explicitly or implicitly take a position on taylor s applicability.
cases employing the formal categorical approach of taylor 
we expressly invoked and applied taylor s formal categorical approach in francis.there,the question presented was whether a state misdemeanor conviction for vehicular homicide is a crime of violence within the meaning of,at,which is incorporated by reference in the definition of aggravated felony,a f.we concluded that the petitioner conviction was not a crime of violence under,and therefore that he was not an aggravated felon.although we were able to reach this result on an analysis of that did not implicate taylor,francis,at,we also held in the alternative that,under the formal categorical approach,francis conviction did not satisfy b requirement that a crime of violence be one that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
we explained that under the formal categorical approach,
we must look to pennsylvania definition of homicide by vehicle.provides 
any person who unintentionally causes the death of another person while engaged in the violation of any law of this commonwealth or municipal ordinance applying to the operation or use of a vehicle or to the regulation of traffic except section relating to driving under influence of alcohol or controlled substance is guilty of homicide by vehicle,a misdemeanor of the first degree,when the violation is the cause of death.
francis,at.we continued 
on its face,homicide by vehicle is certainly not an offense that by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.b.the bia acknowledged that involves a range of behavior that may or may not fall under b.
the categorical approach does permit the sentencing court to go beyond the mere fact of conviction in a narrow range of cases where a jury was actually required to find all the elements of the relevant generic offense.taylor,at.here,the criminal complaint stated 
southbound on route in the vicinity of comly street the defendant unintentionally caused the death of the decedent harry rutter,driver of vehicle,by operating a chevrolet caprice.license adb,while his operating privilege was suspended,and in such a manner as to cause a eight vehicle accident between four cars,one van,and three tractor trailers and a near miss by a tanker truck carrying gallons of gasoline,causing the deaths of two people and injuring a third.
emphasis added.
francis was therefore charged with the unintentional conduct,of operating an automobile in such a manner as to cause a car accident resulting in two deaths.
id.at some citations omitted.
as francis predicate violation of the law for purposes of.was driving with a suspended license,and not something that by its nature,involves a substantial risk of physical force,b,we could not agree with the bia that his offense was a crime of violence.significantly,we disagreed with the bia conclusion that francis conduct involved a substantial risk of physical force because it was reckless,stating it may well have been reckless.however,recklessness was not charged,and he was not convicted of an offense requiring that mens rea.francis,at.in sum,the bia reasoned from the facts supporting francis conviction,but we felt constrained to grant the petition for review by applying taylor s formal categorical approach and confining our inquiry to the statute of conviction,illuminated by the charging instrument.
three other,gerbier,and wilson apply taylor through their use of the hypothetical federal felony or hypothetical federal conviction approach this method was developed by the bia in applying a b,which categorizes as an aggravated felony illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as defined in section of title,including a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title.in steele,our first case to examine the hypothetical federal felony approach,we explained it this way 
section c of title defines drug trafficking crime as meaning any felony punishable under the controlled substance act,the controlled substance import and export act s or the maritime drug law enforcement act accordingly,the bia finds within this category of aggravated felony convictions any federal conviction for a violation of one of the specified statutes that is a felony conviction under federal law,a conviction for an offense punishable by imprisonment for over one year.see.more relevant for present purposes,the bia understands this category to encompass convictions for state offenses,however characterized by the state,if those offenses would be punishable under one of the three specified federal statutes if federally prosecuted,so long as the hypothetical federal conviction would be a felony under federal law,would be punishable by a term of imprisonment of over one year.
this hypothetical federal conviction approach require s a comparison between the elements of the state drug offense and the elements of a federal drug provision referenced in c matter of davis,wl bia.since the basis for the incapacities under the immigration act is convict ion of an aggravated felony,a,the board looks to what the convicting court must necessarily have found to support the conviction and not to other conduct in which the defendant may have engaged in connection with the offense.thus where,as here,the service is relying on a state misdemeanor conviction,the requirements of this category of aggravated felony convictions are satisfied only by proving a conviction that includes all the elements of a felony offense for which an alien could be convicted and punished under the cited federal laws.matter of barrett,wl bia.
steele,at some alterations in original.the hypothetical federal felony approach is essentially the formal categorical approach of taylor,as applied to a specific federal statute.
though we did not actually approve the hypothetical federal felony approach in steele,we accepted it arguendo,because even it did not support the bia proposed hypothetical federal felony required a finding of an additional,prior drug conviction,a prior conviction that,though existing in fact,had not been proven in the course of steele state criminal proceedings.id.at.we thus granted steele petition for review.a little over a year later,in gerbier,we did adopt the bia hypothetical federal felony approach to a b.at.but as in steele,gerbier status as a recidivist had not been litigated or otherwise decided in his state criminal proceeding,and we therefore granted his petition for review.id.at.
in wilson,the third case in our trilogy,we again granted the petition for review.there,the proposed hypothetical federal a,which is the general federal felony criminal prohibition on unauthorized manufacture,distribution,and possession with intent to distribute of controlled an escape clause making distribution of a small amount of marihuana for no remuneration a misdemeanor.see b d and b.wilson had possessed with the intent to distribute a small amount of marijuana,a misdemeanor under stat.ann.b wilson,at.he argued to this court that,because his state conviction did not necessarily imply that he sought remuneration for his distribution,it could not therefore be shown that his conduct would have been a felony under federal controlled substance might have been able to invoke the escape clause.id.
the government countered that wilson conviction was for possession,not distribution though both distribution and were included in new jersey law,see supra note,and that he therefore would not have been eligible for the escape clause.we rejected the government invitation to look beyond the new jersey statute itself,citing steele and gerbier for the proposition that in evaluating whether a state violation is analogous to a federal felony,we look to the elements of the statutory state offense,not to the specific facts.wilson,at.since the state statutory elements would be satisfied by proof of either distribution or possession with intent to distribute,we can not draw the federal analogy by presuming that the statute only covers possession.id.at.wilson may thus represent the zenith of our faithfulness to taylor.
two other cases also follow taylor s formal categorical only silently in the case of bovkun or weakly in the case of drakes.although we did not cite taylor in bovkun,we plainly followed the formal categorical approach.there,the petitioner had been convicted of making terroristic threats under pennsylvania law and the government sought to classify him as an aggravated felon under a f incorporating by reference,for committing a crime of violence.bovkun argued that mere public inconvenience would not qualify as a crime of violence,but we rejected his argument because it confused the actus reus of the offense threat to commit a crime of violence and the mens rea with intent to or reckless disregard of.bovkun,at.we held that it was the actus reus of the state offense that had to be aligned with the federal statute,and on that basis we concluded that a pennsylvania conviction for making terroristic threats was a crime of violence as defined in.
finally,in drakes,we considered a r,which classifies as an aggravated felony an offense relating to forgery.though the facts were not entirely clear,the petitioner had been convicted of forgery under delaware law in connection with providing a false name to the delaware state police during a traffic stop as noted above,see supra part discussing taylor s approach,taylor requires both interpretation of the federal statute describing the offense,and a comparison with the statute of criminal conviction.though most of our aggravated felony cases have turned on the second step,drakes concentrated more on the first.in drakes,we discussed at length the meaning of forgery in a r.see at.upon determining that congress evidenced an intent to define forgery in its broadest sense,id.at,it became easy to conclude that.came within the wide sweep of the offenses described in a r,see drakes,at.thus drakes only briefly touched on taylor s second formal categorical approach as we have been discussing it.
cases not employing the formal categorical approach of taylor 
we turn now to the cases in which we did not confine ourselves to the formal categorical approach of taylor.all three such,munroe,and valansi concerned a m i,which defines as an aggravated felony an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds.in all three cases,the relevant criminal statute did not include a loss greater than element.see nugent,at quoting.a munroe,at citing stat.ann.valansi,at quoting yet in these cases we expressly rested our holding on the underlying facts about the amount of loss involved in nugent,at,the bad check at issue was in the amount of and thus insufficient to support the aggravated felony classification in munroe,at,several bad checks written by the petitioner totaled in excess of and thus were sufficient to support the aggravated felony classification.
valansi,in which the petitioner had embezzled over in cash and checks in her capacity as a bank teller,at,bears further discussion.the monetary threshold was clearly reached in valansi.see at valansi does not dispute that her conviction satisfies the monetary requirement.the case turned instead on whether valansi crime involve d fraud or deceit.in an extensive discussion of,the court focused on the mens rea requirement that had been judicially imposed on the statute the embezzler must do so with the intent to injure or defraud the bank.valansi,at citing united states schoenhut,cir citing united states schmidt,cir.we held that this disjunctive mens rea intent to defraud or intent to injure the statute with one foot in a m i and one foot out 
the plain meaning of a m i defines an aggravated felony as an offense that has fraud or deceit as at least one required element.some but not all convictions under qualify as an aggravated felony under that definition a conviction for embezzlement with specific intent to defraud qualifies as an offense involving fraud or deceit,and thus an aggravated felony a conviction with only the specific intent to injure does not.
valansi,at.
under a strict reading of taylor s formal categorical approach,this would be the end of the story,because a conviction under does not necessarily establish fraudulent intent any more than singh conviction under.necessarily establishes sexual abuse of a minor because,after all,some but not all convictions under.involve a minor victim.the valansi panel went on,however 
we have cautioned that where a criminal statute on its face fits the ina deportability classification,t o go beyond the offense as charged and scrutinize the underlying facts would change our inquiry from a jurisdictional one into a full consideration of the merits.such an approach would fly in the face of the jurisdiction limiting language of iirira.drakes,at.however,in this case we have determined that the criminal statute does not fit squarely within the ina deportability classification because some,but not all,of the convictions under qualify as offenses involving fraud or deceit.because we are unable to determine from the face of the statute whether valansi conviction is among those that qualify as an aggravated felony,we must take the additional step of examining the underlying facts to determine whether valansi pled guilty to an offense involving fraud or deceit.
valansi,at alterations in original.ultimately,we concluded that 
i n valansi case,the specific intent to defraud was not established.it appears that valansi was counseled to avoid admitting to that intent,and the plea colloquy fails to pin down the mens rea element sufficiently for us to conclude that valansi acted with the intent to defraud rather than to injure her employer.
id.at.accordingly,we granted the petition for review.
in dissent,judge scirica concluded that embezzlement under is always a crime of fraud or deceit,and therefore had no need to analyze the distinction.while this seems more consistent with the formal categorical approach of taylor,judge scirica dissent still relies on the plea colloquy to establish that valansi committed embezzlement,and not abstract ion,purloin ing,or misappli cation,and the factual record to establish the fiduciary relationship between valansi and her employing bank necessary to satisfy his definition of embezzlement.both steps are beyond the strict scope of taylor s categorical approach.thus,whatever disagreements there were within the panel in valansi,all agreed that the case required a look beyond the literal elements of.
c.a governing principle 
our survey complete,the question we now pose is whether these applying taylor,some be reconciled under a governing principle.we believe that they can.as taylor itself demonstrates,there are two facets to these cases the federal statute enumerating categories of crimes on the one hand the enumerating statute,and the criminal statute of conviction,whether federal or state,on the other the statute of conviction.while taylor s formal categorical approach presumptively applies in comparing the two,under certain conditions,both the enumerating statute and the statute of conviction can require a departure from the formal categorical approach.
in the case of the enumerating statute,a departure from the formal categorical approach seems warranted when the terms of the statute invite inquiry into the facts underlying the conviction at issue.the qualifier in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds in a m i is the prototypical expresses such a specificity of fact that it almost begs an adjudicator to examine the facts at issue.this principle explains our holdings in nugent and munroe.another example would be an enumerating statute specifying crimes committed within the last two years.such a statute could not be read to cover only crimes which have within the last two years as an element instead,a court would read within the last two years as a limiting provision on crimes that would otherwise qualify.
in contrast,cases interpreting relatively unitary categorical forgery drakes,burglary taylor itself or crime of violence francis and bovkun do not look to underlying facts because the enumerating statute does not invite any such inquiry.likewise,the hypothetical federal felony trilogy steele,gerbier,and wilson asks only whether the elements of a federal criminal statute can by satisfied by reference to the actual statute of conviction this presents no invitation to depart from taylor s formal categorical approach and examine the underlying facts.
though we have little case law on point,the contrast we have described appears to be mirrored in the references in a to the duration of sentences.correcting for the scrivener error in a g,we held in graham,at,that that section specifies theft and burglary offenses for which the term of imprisonment imposed is at least one year.this obviously invites an inquiry into the sentence actually imposed on the alien,rather than a categorical inquiry into the statutory punishment for the offense.similarly,provisions like a s,which classifies as an aggravated felony certain obstruction of justice offenses for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year,invites inquiry into the alien actual sentence.see graham,at.in contrast,provisions like a j,which classifies as an aggravated felony certain racketeering and gambling offenses for which a sentence of one year imprisonment or more may be imposed,seem to direct inquiry toward the statutory sentencing scheme,not the alien actual sentence.see graham,at.
turning to the statute of conviction,there are also cases where a look into the underlying at least the charging called for.valansi is a good example of such a case there,the statute of conviction was phrased in the mens rea of either intent to defraud or intent to injure would suffice for,in our view,called for an exploration of which of the alternative elements was the actual basis for conviction.statutes phrased in the disjunctive are akin to,and can be readily converted to,statutes structured in outline form,with a series of numbered or letter elements.see,statutes cited supra notes.such statutes may sometimes more clearly invite further inquiry into exactly which subsection the defendant violated.the exercise of analyzing disjunctive statutes for an invitation to further inquiry is much more difficult than that described in the preceding paragraphs,for it poses the vexing question of how far below the judgment or plea colloquy the court may look.the cases are few and the jurisprudence is not clear.however,in the hope that it may shed some light on this troublesome area,we will do our best to analyze the problem.
we have used a numbered subsection of such a statute as a statute of conviction for purposes of the taylor inquiry.see wilson,at citing stat.ann.b,which specifically criminalizes marijuana.in wilson,however,the numbered paragraphs of b were distinct offenses carrying separate penalties,not alternate types of conduct that constituted the same offense.the lesson there is that sometimes disjunctive parts of statutes of conviction represent distinct offenses,with distinct punishments.where different crimes with different penalties are involved,under the categorical approach,further inquiry is clearly invited into which particular crime the petitioner was actually convicted of.
in other statutes,disjunctive wording or outline formatting simply describes variations of the same offense,with no difference in punishment and no distinction on the judgment of conviction.even here,though,further inquiry might be warranted,as we found in valansi,because the face of the statute might not make clear whether the conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony.it is not clear that only those disjunctions reflected in the penalty or the judgment of conviction are relevant for the purposes of a where some variations of the crime of conviction meet the requisites and others do not,we have thus allowed further inquiry to see which variation was actually committed.
taylor itself,in some ways,provides an example.taylor was convicted of burglary under some section of.the court remanded for consideration of whether he was convicted under,or.taylor,at.these seven separate statutory sections,each of which contained different factual predicates for the same crime with the same penalty,are in practice very similar to a single statute defining a crime,with seven numbered subsections containing alternate factual predicates.and in taylor,the supreme court found that this division invited further inquiry.
since any statute that is phrased in the disjunctive can be readily converted to outline form,it would be strange to think that congress intended the application of the categorical approach to turn on the typography used by the statute drafters.commonly,the best way to resolve the question raised by a conviction under a statute phrased in the disjunctive,or structured in outline form,will be to look to the charging instrument or to a formal guilty plea as we did in valansi,for example.but even in such cases,we have not taken the further step of looking to facts outside the charging instrument or further plea we leave for another day the question whether statutes phrased in the disjunctive invite such inquiry beyond a charging instrument or a formal plea.
as suggested above,our jurisprudence is not a seamless web.in wilson,we did not conduct any further inquiry into the underlying facts of the conviction,even though the statute at issue was phrased in the disjunctive.as discussed above,the petitioner had been convicted under stat.ann.a,which made it unlawful t o manufacture,distribute or dispense,or to possess or have under his control with intent to manufacture,distribute or dispense,certain substances.despite this disjunctive phrasing,we declined to examine whether wilson had engaged in distribution or possession with the intent to distribute.subject to our discussion in the margin this may be in tension with our earlier decision in valansi.but there may also be other cases in which a statute phrased in the disjunctive would
