after expedited proceedings authorized by the immigration and nationality act ina,the department of homeland security dhs ordered petitioner eddy etienne removal,on the grounds that he is an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony.see a a iii,b.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that we have jurisdiction to hear etienne petition for review but that his argument that his conviction does not constitute an aggravated felony is without merit.accordingly,we deny the petition for review.
etienne entered the united states from his native country of haiti in,initially residing here as an undocumented immigrant.in,etienne pleaded guilty to the crime of conspiracy to violate the controlled dangerous substances law of the state of maryland.see at.after his release from state prison,etienne continued to reside in the united states without documentation.
following an earthquake in haiti in,etienne applied for temporary protected status tps,a lawful immigration status,based on the potential risk of harm if he were to return to haiti.dhs granted not only etienne initial application for tps,but also his application for renewal the following year.when etienne sought another renewal of his tps in february of,however,dhs rejected his application.
shortly thereafter,dhs initiated expedited removal proceedings against etienne by serving him with a notice of intent to issue a final administrative removal order notice of intent.the notice of intent,part of dhs form i,informed etienne that he was charged with being deportable under the ina for being an alien convicted of an aggravated felony his maryland conspiracy conviction.the notice of intent also informed etienne that he would be removed pursuant to expedited procedures,without the benefit of a hearing in front of an immigration judge ij.finally,the notice of intent indicated that etienne had ten calendar days to respond to the charges against him by filling out the response section of form i and returning it to dhs.he responded the same day.
etienne checked two boxes indicating that he wished to contest his removal and that he was attaching documents in support of his rebuttal and request for further review.at.etienne did not,however,actually attach any documents to the notice of intent before returning it to dhs.of particular relevance here,etienne did not indicate in any manner that he believed his maryland conspiracy conviction did not constitute an aggravated felony.
on march,after concluding that etienne was deportable under the ina,the deciding dhs officer issued a final administrative removal order for etienne removal to haiti.upon etienne request,an asylum officer held a hearing and determined that etienne did not qualify for withholding of removal.an ij affirmed the asylum officer determination,and etienne removal proceedings reached administrative closure.etienne then turned to this court,timely filing this petition for review 
in his petition for review,etienne argues for the first time that his conviction for conspiracy under maryland law does not constitute an aggravated felony under the ina,and that dhs therefore erred in finding him removable.before addressing etienne petition on the merits,however,we must determine whether etienne failure to raise this argument in the dhs administrative proceedings deprives us of jurisdiction.the jurisdictional issue and the merits issue are questions of law,which we consider de novo.see omargharib holder,cir kporlor holder,cir.
we first consider whether we have jurisdiction over etienne petition for review.a court may review a final order of removal against an alien only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.d.when an alien has an opportunity to raise a claim in administrative proceedings but does not do so,he fails to exhaust his administrative remedies as to that claim.see massis mukasey,cir.
here,etienne argues that dhs expedited removal procedures allow aliens to contest only the factual basis for their removal,and not to raise legal arguments.thus,etienne contends,he had no opportunity during administrative removal to challenge the classification of his maryland conspiracy conviction as an aggravated felony,and therefore he has not failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.
the question of whether dhs expedited removal procedures provide an alien with the opportunity to challenge the legal basis of his or her removal and thus whether we have jurisdiction to hear such a challenge when a petitioner fails to raise it before one that has split our sister circuits.compare malu,cir no jurisdiction,with valdiviez hernandez holder,cir per curiam jurisdiction lies as we explain below,we join the fifth circuit in holding that,in expedited removal proceedings,an alien has no opportunity to challenge the legal basis of his removal.the ina requirement therefore does not deprive us of jurisdiction to consider such a challenge in the first instance on appeal.
the ina declares that a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.a a iii.generally,when an alien is charged with removability for having been convicted of an aggravated felony,the ina requires that the alien be afforded a hearing before an ij,where the alien may contest the factual or legal basis of his removability.see,c.but for aliens like etienne who have not been lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent residence,the ina authorizes an expedited removal process,without a hearing before an ij.see b.instead,a dhs officer,who need not be an attorney,presides over this expedited removal process.see a.
under the relevant regulations,dhs initiates an expedited removal by serving an alien with form i,notice of intent to issue a final administrative deportation order.see id.b.the contents of the notice of intent are spelled out in the regulations it must notify the alien of the allegations of fact and conclusions of law underlying dhs preliminary determination that the alien is removable,and it must inform the alien of dhs intent to issue a final administrative removal order without a hearing before an ij.id.b i.the notice of intent must also inform the alien,among other things,that he or she may rebut the charges within calendar days of service.id.
once dhs has served an alien with the notice of intent,using standardized form i,the alien must choose whether to file a response.form i itself guides the alien response process through a series of checkboxes on the back of the form.etienne completed form i shows the range of possible responses 
if the alien chooses to respond,the first choice the alien must make is between two mutually exclusive boxes centered on the response form.the first allows the alien to indicate that he or she w ish es to c ontest to r equest w ithholding of r emoval.id.the second indicates the opposite that the alien d o es n ot w ish to c ontest to r equest w ithholding of r emoval.id.
if the alien checks the first box,there are two additional options that clarify whether the alien wishes to contest deportability,request withholding of removal,or both.if the alien wishes to contest deportability,he or she must check the box that states i contest my deportability because attach any supporting documentation.id.indented beneath that checkbox are four more checkboxes,only three of which logically complete the statement.those three options each present a specific factual challenge to the basis of expedited removal i am a citizen or national of the united states i am a lawful permanent resident of the united states and i was not convicted of the criminal offense described above.id.the fourth checkbox,found directly below and aligned with the three factual challenges,reads i am attaching documents in support of my rebuttal and request for further review.id.the form does not offer a specific checkbox for an alien who wishes to raise a legal challenge to his or her removal.
if the alien responds and contests removability,the deciding dhs officer must determine whether the alien deportability is nonetheless established by clear,convincing,and unequivocal evidence.d i.if so,the officer must issue a final removal order.id.if,however,the deciding service officer finds that the record of proceeding,including the alien timely rebuttal,raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding the preliminary findings,the dhs officer may either obtain additional evidence from any source,including the alien or initiate full removal proceedings before an ij.id.d ii a.if the additional evidence cures any genuine issue of material fact,and if the officer concludes removability by clear,convincing,and unequivocal evidence,the officer must then issue a final removal order.id.d ii b.but if the officer finds that the alien is not amenable to expedited removal,the officer shall terminate the expedited proceedings and shall,where appropriate,initiate full removal proceedings before an ij.id.d iii.
the parties dispute here turns on their interpretation of d iii,which requires the deciding dhs officer to terminate expedited proceedings if the alien is not amenable to expedited removal and to refer the matter to an ij where appropriate.according to the government,this provision authorizes a dhs officer presiding over an expedited removal proceeding to consider an alien legal challenge to removability,and therefore obligates the alien to raise any such challenge before dhs or forfeit that claim for failing to exhaust administrative remedies.etienne,on the other hand,contends that this provision refers only to the possibility that the dhs officer may be unable to establish the factual basis for an alien removability by clear,convincing,and unequivocal evidence,leaving the alien not amenable to expedited removal,but potentially amenable to removal under full proceedings before an ij,which require a lower factual burden of proof.
etienne approach finds support in valdiviez hernandez holder,cir per curiam.considering the same issue,the fifth circuit held that the relevant statutes and corresponding regulations did not provide the alien with an avenue to challenge the legal conclusion that he does not meet the definition of an alien subject to expedited removal.id.at.even though the fifth circuit acknowledged that the notice of intent included conclusions of law,the court reasoned that the response process is geared toward resolving only issues of fact.id.
the government instead points to malu,cir.in malu,the eleventh circuit recognized that the relevant regulations require the notice to the alien to include both allegations of fact and conclusions of law that the alien may rebut and reasoned that it would be nonsensical to limit the alien rebuttal to allegations of fact.id.at quoting b i.thus,the court held that an alien must exhaust all administrative remedies by rebutting the the conclusion of law that she is an aggravated the department.id.
we conclude that the fifth circuit approach,advanced by etienne,is more consistent with the language and structure of the expedited removal regulations.crucially,such a reading is more consistent with form i,the form dhs must provide to aliens in expedited proceedings for aliens to respond to the charge of removability.
first,the language of the expedited removal regulations,read in context with the ina and associated regulations,seems to indicate that only factual challenges to an alien removability may be raised in expedited removal proceedings.the procedures that are explicitly available to the deciding dhs officer after an alien responds to the notice of intent contemplate a genuine issue of material fact that the officer may attempt to cure by gathering additional evidence.d.if the additional evidence enables the officer to conclude deportability by clear,convincing,and unequivocal evidence,he must then issue a final removal order.see id.of course,all of these potential challenges are to be raised to the presiding dhs officer,who,significantly,is not required to be an attorney or have any specialized legal training.
it is true that d iii requires an officer to transfer proceedings to an ij where appropriate,but this provision might merely refer to a scenario where a genuine issue of material fact can not be cured by the dhs officer.the deciding dhs officer could not then unequivocally find that the alien is removable.an ij,however,might still be able to conclude the alien is removable,under a lower standard of proof,after holding a hearing to resolve the factual dispute.when an ij orders removal after holding a hearing,the evidence must still be clear and convincing,but it need not be unequivocal.compare id.d,with c a.
second,form i offers no obvious opportunity to raise a legal challenge.e xhaustion of administrative remedies means using all steps that the agency holds out,and doing so properly.woodford ngo,d first emphasis added citation omitted.here,form i holds out the steps individuals in expedited removal proceedings may follow to respond to dhs allegations,and those steps do not include an option to contest legal determinations.form i contains several checkboxes for an alien to lodge factual challenges to his or her removal.but it offers no checkbox for lodging any specific legal challenges,a legal challenge in general,or other unenumerated challenges.
the fact that form i has a checkbox that reads i am attaching documents in support of my rebuttal and request for further review does not,as the government argues,create a procedure for aliens to raise any other challenges,including legal challenges.in fact,my rebuttal appears to directly refer to the three factual challenges listed directly above that checkbox.in light of the contents of form i,we can not say that dhs expedited removal procedures offer an alien the opportunity to challenge the legal basis of his or her removal.
the above discussion should likewise make plain the limits of our holding.nothing in our opinion prevents dhs from changing the form i to make it clear that dhs wishes to require aliens to raise legal arguments in expedited removal proceedings.such a change would provide clear notice to aliens of their right to raise legal issues in a manner that the present form does not.the opportunity to raise a legal challenge would then become,as we have earlier noted,one of the steps that the agency holds out and therefore an administrative remedy that must be exhausted.woodford ngo,d.
because the notice of intent,form i,expressly prompts aliens to raise only factual challenges to removal,we hold that etienne was not required to raise his legal challenge to removal in order to meet the exhaustion requirement of ina d,d.we therefore have jurisdiction to consider etienne petition for review.
having determined that we have jurisdiction to consider etienne petition for review,we now turn to the merits of his legal challenge.dhs found etienne deportable under the ina for being an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony,a drug conspiracy under maryland law.the ina definition of aggravated felony includes many types of crimes,including illicit trafficking in a controlled substance,a b,and conspiracy to commit another aggravated felony,whether in violation of federal or state law,id.a u.
the parties agree that the categorical approach applies to determining whether a crime qualifies as an aggravated felony under the ina.their dispute instead turns on whether,under the categorical approach,the term conspiracy in a u is defined as it was at common law or by the prevailing contemporary meaning of the term,which requires proof of an overt act.etienne argues that,because the crime of conspiracy under maryland law does not require proof of an overt act,his conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony.in arguing that the definition of conspiracy does not apply,etienne chiefly relies on taylor united states,in which the supreme court declined to adopt the definition of burglary for purposes of the categorical approach,d.
as we explain below,we find nothing in this context to rebut the presumption that congress intended to incorporate the meaning of conspiracy when it included that term in the ina.we therefore hold that a conspiracy conviction need not require an overt act as an element for the conviction to qualif
