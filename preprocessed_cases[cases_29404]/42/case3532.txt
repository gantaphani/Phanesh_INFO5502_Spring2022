background 
is a native and citizen of mexico.he became a lawful temporary resident under the special agricultural workers saw program on november.see ina.at the time,he was twenty years old.
after entering the united states,had problems with alcohol and drugs.on march,he was convicted of two california state misdemeanors,receiving known stolen property and hit and run with property damage.on july,he was convicted of a third california misdemeanor,taking a vehicle without consent or vehicle theft.the government did not place documentation of these misdemeanor convictions in the record during his removal proceeding.however,admitted to the facts underlying these convictions in that proceeding.
under the terms of the saw program,if a lawful temporary resident is convicted of three or more misdemeanors,the attorney general has the authority to terminate lawful temporary resident status and to deny adjustment to lawful permanent resident status.see a.the exercise of this power is permissive rather than mandatory.id.the attorney general did not terminate lawful temporary resident status.as long as maintained lawful temporary resident status,the saw program provided for automatic adjustment to lawful permanent resident status.see a,d.maintained lawful temporary resident status and automatically adjusted to lawful permanent resident status on december.
on december,pled guilty to burglary in california based on acts committed on june.he was sentenced to days imprisonment and years probation.the government placed documentation of the conviction and plea in the record during removal proceeding.
during the,began to turn his life around.he was married on october.he participated in a inpatient treatment program for alcoholism in late november and early december.he and his wife had a daughter on november,approximately one year after he was released from prison on the burglary conviction.he became an active member of his church and several groups.in january,he got a job in an auto body shop in bellingham,washington.he attended bellingham technical college and graduated in march with a degree in auto refinishing.in december,the owner of the auto body shop where he had been working reported that had been a good worker,writing in a letter,he is a very dedicated productive employee.he is also a very dependable hard working family man.
was at a convenience store in ferndale,washington,near bellingham,on october,when a border patrol agent approached him and asked for his identification.the agent determined that was possibly removable and placed him in detention.
on november,was served with a notice to appear charging that he was removable under a a ii,which provides that an alien is removable if he has been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct.the bases for this charge were misdemeanor convictions for receiving known stolen property and for taking a vehicle without consent or vehicle theft.on december,was served with an additional notice to appear,this one charging that he was removable under a a i,which provides that an alien is removable if he has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude punishable by at least one year imprisonment and committed within five years of the date of admission.the basis for this charge was burglary conviction.
on january,the ij found removable based on his burglary conviction.the ij did not rely on his two misdemeanor convictions to support his finding of removability.the ij pretermitted application for cancellation of removal because he failed to satisfy the requirement of seven years continuous residence under a.although had been physically present in the united states for more than seven years,under iirira provision his continuous residence terminated on june,the date of the burglary to which he had pled guilty.see d.the bia affirmed the order of removal on october.the bia found removable based both on his misdemeanor convictions and on his burglary conviction.the bia noted that the ij had not relied on the misdemeanor convictions,but wrote,b ecause the respondent,through counsel,admitted to the facts underlying these charges,we sustain these charges.
for reasons not apparent from the record,was not actually removed.in january,after release from ins custody,he moved with his family to escondido,california.in april,he got a job with first class collision,another auto body shop,where he has worked ever since.the vice president of first class collision wrote a letter to lawyer in june describing as an excellent employee.
on october,moved the bia to reopen his proceedings on the ground that the supreme court decision in ins cyr,decided in,gave him the right to apply for relief under c.the bia reopened proceedings and remanded to an ij to determine whether was eligible for c relief under cyr.on september,the ij held that was not eligible for c relief.the ij assumed that misdemeanor convictions were based on guilty pleas,but the ij concluded that had no settled expectation that he would be entitled to c relief when he entered those pleas.
on march,the bia affirmed.it first held that had not established that his misdemeanor convictions were based on guilty pleas because the conviction documents for those convictions were not in the record.it then held,even assuming misdemeanor convictions were based on guilty pleas,that he did not have a settled expectation of the availability of discretionary relief under c when he entered the pleas.timely petitioned for review.
ii.standard of review 
when the bia conducts an independent review of the ij findings we review the bia findings and not those of the ij.simeonov ashcroft,cir,cert.denied,simeonov ashcroft.to the extent that the bia incorporates the ij decision as its own,we review the ij decision.gonzales,cir.
we review factual findings of the bia for substantial evidence.tawadrus ashcroft,cir.we will uphold them unless the evidence compels a contrary result.id.
whether application of iirira is impermissibly retroactive presents a question of law that we review de novo,at.
iii.jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction under a d,which provides that n othing in subparagraph b or c,or in any other provision of this chapter other than this section which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.the questions presented in this petition are reviewable questions of law.see,at.
iv.discussion 
the government makes two arguments.first,it contends that challenges only the decision of the ij in his opening brief to us.it argues that has thereby waived any challenge to the bia decision.second,the government argues on the merits that is ineligible for a c waiver under cyr.
we can make short work of the government first argument.it is true that focuses virtually all of his argument in his opening brief on the decision of the ij rather than that of the bia.but his argument is not exclusively aimed at the decision of the ij.on page eight of his opening brief,he argues that the immigration court and the bia both erred in one respect.further,to the degree that opening brief mistakenly focuses on the ij decision,the government was not misled as to the substance of his arguments.we therefore conclude that has not waived his challenge to the decision of the bia.
availability of section c relief under cyr 
the bia based its decision on two grounds.first,it concluded that there was insufficient evidence that pled guilty to his misdemeanor convictions.second,it concluded tha
