petitioner oswaldo cabas,a native and citizen of venezuela,seeks review of a final order of the board of immigration appeals bia.the order upheld both an immigration judge ij determination that cabas asylum application was and the ij denial of his application for withholding of removal on the merits.we lack jurisdiction over the asylum claim and,discerning no error in the bia ruling on the withholding of removal claim,we deny the remainder of the petition.
cabas first entered the united states in april.the record does not disclose whether he entered lawfully.roughly six months later,he returned to venezuela and stayed there for a month.in november of the same year,cabas reentered the united states as a visitor permitted to remain in the country for one month.he has remained here ever since.federal authorities initiated removal proceedings against him in december for overstaying his visa.cabas conceded removability but applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.
cabas,the only witness at the removal hearing,testified to the following facts.he was born in maracaibo,venezuela,and lived there until he came to the united states in.after graduating from high school in,he became a political activist.as a member of an opposition group known as acción democrática,he organized meetings,distributed fliers,and spoke to people about vices of the government.he also had a small segment on a political opinion show that aired on a local radio station.after hugo chavez came to power in,cabas joined a rival political party and began speaking out against the chavez administration.his troubles began shortly thereafter.
in december,cabas was at a party with some friends when he heard gunshots and his name being called.he fled the scene and hid in a nearby house until it was safe for him to go home.the next incident occurred in march,when he was kidnapped at gunpoint in the daytime while buying auto parts.based on their apparel and the fact that they called themselves the defenders of the government,cabas believed his kidnappers were members of the bolivarian circle,a group associated with chavez.the kidnappers beat cabas and demanded that he cease his political activities.at one point he was struck on the head with a gun and lost consciousness.he awoke in a remote location,covered in blood.cabas went to the nearest police station to report the attack,but he did not seek medical attention for his injuries.the police did not investigate the incident.
cabas resumed his political activities several months after the attack.after his father was kidnapped and beaten in a similar fashion,cabas decided to come to the united states.he arrived here in april.six months later,he returned to venezuela because he thought that the situation there had calmed.shortly after his arrival,two men came to his parents house looking for him.they beat his brothers to coerce them to reveal cabas whereabouts.his mother and sister,who witnessed the incident,received threats as well.around the same time,several men forcibly broke into his parents house and issued threats 
with his family encouragement,cabas returned to the united states in november.after his departure,his family received threats that he would be harmed or killed if he returned to the country.his family remained living in venezuela unharmed.
cabas testified that he did not seek asylum until because he was and had planned to return home after chavez left office.in february,cabas became convinced that chavez would remain in power indefinitely because the country eliminated presidential term limits.
at the close of the hearing,the ij issued an oral decision finding cabas removable as charged.the ij ruled that cabas asylum application was untimely because he had filed it more than six years after his november arrival,and he did not prove changed country conditions to qualify for an exception to the filing deadline.the ij also denied cabas application for withholding of removal,in which cabas claimed a likelihood of persecution on the basis of the statutorily protected ground of political opinion.the ij concluded that cabas failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a likelihood of future persecution.the ij found cabas testimony to be generally credible,but discounted his testimony that men forcibly broke into his parents house because cabas never mentioned the incident in his affidavit filed in support of his application.the ij then determined that the kidnapping and beating that cabas suffered and the threats to his safety were not so severe as to constitute persecution,reasoning that cabas was physically harmed on only a single occasion and did not seek medical attention following the incident.further,the ij concluded that cabas return to venezuela after the attack and the fact that his family continued to live there unharmed undermined his claim of future persecution.lastly,the ij denied cabas cat claim.
cabas appealed the ij decision,save for its ruling on the cat claim,and the bia affirmed.the bia agreed with the ij that cabas failed to prove changed country conditions or exceptional circumstances to excuse the late filing of his asylum application.with respect to withholding of removal,the bia echoed the ij reasoning that cabas was physically harmed only on one occasion he did not seek medical attention for his injuries and he returned to venezuela following the incident.accordingly,the bia concluded that he did not establish past persecution,and it agreed with the ij determination that the evidence did not otherwise support a finding of a likelihood of future persecution.this petition followed.
cabas challenges both the bia decision that his asylum application was and its denial on the merits of his request for withholding of removal.we address the challenges in turn.
timeliness of the asylum application 
to qualify for asylum,an applicant ordinarily must make his request within one year of his arrival in the united states.a b.late applications may be accepted,however,if the applicant shows changed circumstances which materially affect his eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.id.a d.the applicant bears the burden of establishing that the application was timely or that an exception to the filing deadline applies.oroh holder,cir.
cabas concedes that he filed his asylum application more than six years after his last arrival in the united states.in his petition for review,he argues that the bia and the ij abused their discretion in finding that he did not establish changed circumstances that could support an exception to the filing deadline.this challenge is a quintessentially attack,and it is thus doomed to fail.we are without jurisdiction to review agency findings regarding timeliness of an asylum application or applicability of exceptions to the rule,unless the petitioner challenges the decision on constitutional or legal grounds.rashad mukasey,cir.cabas is plainly challenging the bia factfinding about changed circumstances vel non.we lack jurisdiction to review that decision.
withholding of removal 
because the bia adopted in part the ij decision denying cabas request for withholding of removal but also provided additional analysis,we review both decisions.uruci holder,cir.we review the decisions under the deferential substantial evidence standard,reversing only if a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.khan mukasey,cir internal quotation marks omitted.under this standard,we uphold the agency action so long as it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins elias zacarias,d internal quotation marks omitted.
to qualify for withholding of removal,an alien must show that,if repatriated,he faces a clear probability of future persecution on account of one of five protected grounds,namely,race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.palma mazariegos gonzales,cir see a.to satisfy this burden,the alien must show that it is more likely that not that he will face future pers
