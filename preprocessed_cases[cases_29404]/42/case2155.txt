in january,morhay tapucu,a citizen of turkey and a lawful permanent resident of the united states,went on a road trip to toronto with three of his friends from chicago.the group of four rented a van for the trip and shared driving responsibilities on the way there and on the way back.upon returning to the american border at the end of the weekend,immigration officers stopped the car and asked the four men to go into the office to answer questions about their admissibility.the officers determined that one of the friends,kirkor deveci,a canadian citizen,did not have authority to the country.they then concluded that tapucu was a smuggler of aliens because he had knowingly encouraged,induced,assisted,abetted,or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the united states in violation of law.a e i.the two other friends were allowed to the country.tapucu violated the provision,the officers claimed,because he happened to be the driver at the time the car reached the border and because tapucu did not correct deveci when deveci told the officers that he lived in canada.
in a opinion bereft of any citation to relevant case law,the immigration judge ij concluded that tapucu was a smuggler of aliens and ordered him excluded from the united states.one member of the board of immigration appeals summarily affirmed the order without opinion.while we generally give broad deference to the agency over these decisions,we can not defer to this one.tapucu did not knowingly assist an alien to enter the united states in violation of law first,because he testified that he thought deveci could lawfully the country and no one questioned that testimony or its credibility and,second,because the statute requires something more than openly presenting an alien to border officials with accurate identification and citizenship papers.we accordingly vacate the decision of the immigration judge and remand the case for additional proceedings consistent with this opinion.
tapucu was born in elazig,turkey,in and has been a lawful permanent resident of the united states since.his wife is an american citizen and so is his son.for some time,he has owned a jewelry business in chicago.
on january,tapucu and three friends left chicago,illinois,in a rented van to attend a party in toronto,canada.the four friends shared driving responsibilities during the trip.upon returning to the american border on january,immigration officers stopped the van at the inspection point in windsor,canada.tapucu was driving at the time.the officers asked tapucu and his friends to exit the van and to proceed inside to allow the officers to inspect their documents.
once inside,the officers interviewed the passengers and eventually obtained sworn written statements from tapucu and deveci.the officers denied entry to deveci because he was a canadian citizen who did not reside in canada but was living illegally in chicago.during the interviews with the officers,tapucu said that he knew deveci had been living illegally in the united states for two years,that he had employed him in the past and that deveci family had applied for permanent residence status for him.in answering why he thought deveci could the country,he explained that deveci had done so before.after taking these statements,the immigration officers paroled tapucu into the united states pending a hearing on his admissibility.the officers allowed the two other friends to enter the country without restriction.
while the ij did not hear any live testimony at the hearing on tapucu petition,it did receive the sworn statements given by tapucu and deveci at the border,affidavits from tapucu and deveci,a copy of deveci birth certificate,and copies of tapucu marriage certificate and the birth certificate of his son.on january,the ij issued a decision concluding that tapucu had violated the provision.see a e i.in the ij view,clear and convincing evidence established that tapucu had smuggled deveci into the country because he was driving the van at the time it reached the border,because tapucu knew that deveci was living illegally in the united states and because tapucu failed to correct deveci misstatement to the officers that he had a residence in toronto,canada.deploying the procedure of the board of immigration appeals,a single member of the board affirmed the ij decision without opinion on april.
when the board summarily affirms an ij order,it is the decision of the ij that we review.denko ins,cir.we review the ij legal conclusions de novo and the ij factual findings for substantial evidence.see ins,d.
under a,i llegal entrants to the united states and immigration violators may not be admitted into the united states.the provision lists two types of i llegal entrants a liens present without admission or parole,id.at a,and s towaways,id.at d a ny alien who is a stowaway is inadmissible.and it lists three types of immigration violators those who f ail to attend removal proceeding s regarding their potential inadmissibility or deportability,id.at b those who make m isrepresentation s of material fact s in seeking admission to the united states,id.at c and s mugglers of illegal aliens into the country,id.at e.
in claiming that tapucu could not be readmitted to the united states,the government invoked the smuggler provision.that subsection reads in pertinent part 
e smugglers.
i in general.any alien who at any time knowingly has encouraged,induced,assisted,abetted,or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the united states in violation of law is inadmissible.
a e.because tapucu was a lawful permanent resident of the united states,the government had to establish that tapucu was a smuggler of an illegal,of kirkor clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence.woodby ins,d.the government did not meet this burden.
first,the words of the statute do not support the ij decision.some of the statutory language,it is true,perhaps supports the ij the sense that one might say that tapucu assist ed an alien to enter or to try to enter the united states by being the driver of the car at the time it reached the customs office at the border in windsor,canada.though as for that,one has to wonder why a road trip in a rented van,in which the driving and expenses are shared equally by four individuals,means that tapucu provided any more assist ance to the than deveci himself or for that matter than either of the other two individuals on the trip.but that is a mere quibble when compared to our broader objection to the government reading of the statute.
the government makes no suggestion that tapucu encouraged or induced deveci to enter the country illegally,so it must show that tapucu knowingly assisted an alien to enter or to try to enter the united states in violation of law.emphasis added.far from showing that tapucu knowingly assisted an illegal entry,the unvarnished facts show just the tapucu did not commit a single affirmative act designed to assist an illegal effort by deveci to cross the border and that indeed tapucu thought deveci legally could the country.
consider what happened before the men entered the immigration facility.when the four individuals reached the border,there were no hidden compartments in the car,no hidden passengers,no doctored documents,no effort to cross the border at a place where there were no border guards and no other affirmative act by tapucu to cross the border surreptitiously.to the contrary,the four individuals did what legal travelers between the united states and canada customarily do they approached the border crossing they handed the guard their papers and they waited for the guard response.when the guard asked them to go inside to answer additional questions,they did just that.
while the answers to those questions revealed that three of the passengers had authority to enter but the fourth deveci did not,it is difficult to see how tapucu had done anything to interfere with the proper enforcement of the immigration laws regarding who may enter the country.up to this point,tapucu no more assisted the illegal of an the happenstance of being the current driver of the he assisted the government in preventing the.the immigration laws generally do not discourage aliens or their traveling partners from directly presenting themselves to immigration officials with authentic papers upon reaching the border.
not quite true,the government responds.tapucu was not an innocent because he acknowledged that he knew that deveci was living illegally in the united states and had hired him in the past to work as a diamond setter in his jewelry business.but his candor on this point should have led the government and the ij to credit his other deveci family had filed an application for status,that he thought deveci as a canadian citizen could enter the united states freely and that he knew deveci had gone back and forth between canada and the united states many times before.a waiving passport and visa requirements for canadian nationals seeking entry as nonimmigrants.the fact that tapucu knew deveci could not stay permanently in the country at least until his application was granted fails to prove that tapucu knew he could not enter the in view of the fact that tapucu testified to just the opposite conclusion and in view of the fact that the ij never questioned the credibility of or for that matter even explored his statement on this point.and tapucu knowledge of deveci status in this country assuredly does not prove that tapucu knowingly assisted deveci illegal merely by being the hapless driver at the time they reached the conclusion with which the united states department of state appears to agree.see department of state foreign affairs manual interpreting knowingly in a e i n order to be found ineligible the smuggler must act with intention of encouraging or assisting the alien to achieve the illegal entry.therefore,belief that the alien was entitled to enter legally,although mistaken,would be a defense to ineligibility for a suspected smuggler.emphasis added.what,one wonders,is illegal about driving a known illegal alien with admittedly authentic papers to the american border for examination by the border guards the department of homeland security,we suspect,does not devote a considerable amount of resources to correcting this problem.
second,these facts stray still further from the word,smuggler,which congress used in captioning this provision,which the board of immigration appeals uses in describing it and which is what the relevant words of the prohibition knowingly assist ing an alien to enter in violation of law describe.see in re,bia referring to the provision as dealing with the inadmissibility of alien smugglers.smugglers import or export secretly contrary to law or bring in or take out merchandise,forbidden articles,or persons contrary to law and with a fraudulent intent,webster third new international dictionary emphasis added,which is a far cry from what tapucu did.whether as a matter of sheer common sense or the utmost sophistication,there was nothing illicit or secret about tapucu actions at the,in short,that calls to mind smuggling.
attempting to counter this conclusion,the government protests what did not happen once the four travelers were inside the immigration,that tapucu did not speak up when deveci told immigration officials that he lived in canada.but tapucu inaction occurred in response to a question by immigration officials to deveci,not to tapucu.one does not smuggle by declining to correct what appears to be an inaccurate statement by another individual in response to a question not addressed to the alleged smuggler.in fact,one of the other two passengers in the van,hagop dirilien,stated in his affidavit that he also was present when deveci lied about his residence,yet officials admitted dirilien into the united states without reservation.like dirilien,tapucu never affirmatively said or did anything to bolster deveci efforts to.indeed,when the immigration officials turned their questions to tapucu,he answered them truthfully and acknowledged that deveci was an illegal alien.if this counts as smuggling,the net is wide and the water is far from deep.
third,the history of this legislation bolsters this interpretation.prior to,the smuggling provision applied to those who knowingly assisted the illegal entry of aliens for gain.congress removed the for gain language through the passage of the immigration act of,stat,and according to the state department did so for the understandable reason that the for gain requirement had created difficult proof problems for the,for example,the government intercepted the smugglers before any payment had been made or when the fact of compensation otherwise became hard to prove.see department of state foreign affairs manual elimination of the for gain element obviates the necessity to establish the expectation or receipt of profit as an element of a finding of ineligibility.no doubt,this amendment to the statute makes it easier to prove smuggling and in this respect broadens the statute reach.but even after the amendment the provision still requires an affirmative and illicit act of assistance in shepherding someone across the border.put another way,the statute still requires the smuggler to commit a compensable do something for which remuneration reasonably could be made even if it need not be proved.no such act occurred here.at the end of a road trip in which all expenses and driving are shared,there are no more debtors or creditors than there were at the beginning of the trip.
fourth,the government has not identified a single case from the board of immigration appeals or the federal courts of appeals that has endorsed its interpretation of the,that one may be tagged as a smuggler of aliens without committing a single affirmative illicit act.nor did the ij opinion cite a single case in support of its this after taking tapucu lawyer to task for not submitt ing any cases which directly support his client position.ij decision at.while the case reporters are not filled with decisions directly construing the provision,that makes it all the more puzzling why the ij engaged in so little analysis of this issue and even more puzzling why the board invoked its procedure.more on that later.the salient point is that the reported cases,whether directly construing the provision or not,all are one step removed from the fact pattern we have here,as indeed the government acknowledged at oral argument.there are no cases.
consistent with the language of the statute,the cases all involve some form of affirmative assistance in the alien illegal entry,something more than merely driving to a border station and presenting valid documents to customs officials.see landon plasencia,d smuggler agreed to transport the aliens to los angeles and furnished some of the aliens with alien registration receipt cards that belonged to her children ashcroft,cir smuggler tried to evade inspection while transporting six undocumented mexican women into this country in his van sidhu ashcroft,cir smuggler agreed in advance to help a young man illegally enter the united states,guided him through immigration at the airport and was suspected of providing false documents olowo ashcroft,cir smuggler presented a plane ticket and birth certificate to officials on behalf of the illegal alien,both of which were in the name of a legal resident,then lied to immigration official that she was the illegal alien mother selimi ashcroft,cir smuggler purchased falsified passports lopez de jesus ins,cir smuggler knowingly handed false documents to the immigration official united states tsai,cir smuggler bought airline tickets for illegal aliens and did so using false names for the aliens zhang ins,cir smuggler helped steer a boatload of illegal aliens across the ocean and admitted that he planned to enter the united states surreptitiously witter ins,cir smuggler falsely stated she was married to the illegal alien and presented visas that were procured on the basis of the marriage,which had already been annulled ashcroft.cir unpublished smuggler drove illegal alien to border where alien presented a false birth certificate supplied by the daughter of the smuggler girlfriend in re,bia smuggler drove illegal alien in a hidden compartment of a van in re,at smuggler drove the illegal alien
