background 
experiences with the farc 
as an initial matter,we note that the facts of this case are undisputed.was the only witness to testify at the hearing and the ij found her completely credible.
is a colombian citizen from bogota who has dedicated her life to helping others.she is a optometrist and holds a master degree in health administration.attended university in the,where she became involved in a clinical practicum providing free health services to impoverished communities in colombia.her practicum experience set her down a career path of providing health services to communities in need.in,began organizing health brigades,groups of volunteer health care providers and other individuals who travel to remote areas of colombia to provide health services.the health brigades organized by generally operated in areas around barranquilla,where lived and worked,and bogota,where family lived.in addition to her work organizing health brigades,also taught courses at the metropolitan university in barranquilla and worked as an optometrist.is unmarried.her mother and five siblings all still live in bogota.
beginning in,members of the farc began contacting by telephone and leaving notes at her office,on her car,and at her home demanding that she start publicly attributing her health brigade work to farc.the farc members threatened to harm if she did not comply.at first ignored the threats because she thought they were pranks by her students.however,in november it became clear that these threats were not a prank.that month,organized a health brigade trip to the municipality of icononzo.sister and were participating in this trip.while traveling to icononzo,a group of farc members intercepted the health brigade.the farc members read the names of the health brigade members from a list to the group,and physically attacked several members of the health brigade,including.during the commotion,a government helicopter flew by and began shooting at the farc members.once the shooting began,the farc members quickly grabbed several members of the health brigade,including sister,mercedes.heard one of the farc members say,i have doris already,which she believes meant that the farc intended to capture her instead of her sister.the farc also the health brigade cars with statements such as dogs from the government.and her managed to get to the next town and get a new vehicle to get to bogata.once they returned home they called the police.the department of security administration installed a recording device on mercedes phone to intercept any calls from the farc.
over the next few months received several phone calls from the farc on her home phone and on mercedes phone.during one of those phone calls,the farc member told that they had her sister and that they would kill her unless agreed to work for the farc cause.testified that she always hung up and never spoke to the person on the phone.when the ij questioned about why she did not go along with the farc to save her sister,said that she was unable to work for the farc because it is a rebel group to the democracy of colombia,because they have harmed a lot of colombia and my beginnings would not let me or allow me to do this.in february,was in bogota visiting her mother.while at her mother house,mercedes showed up in the middle of the night visibly beaten,wearing men clothing,and very thin from having been infected with a parasite.testified that mercedes told the family that she escaped in the night.also testified,and provided documentation,that mercedes suffered,and continues to suffer,severe psychological damage from her experience in captivity.in march,mercedes husband was captured by the farc and died in their custody because he did not have access to proper medicine.
because of mercedes kidnaping,did not organize any health brigades during.however,at some point in,did go to a community meeting in puerto colombia.after dropping off school supplies at a school in puerto colombia,got into a taxi.an armed member of the farc followed her into the taxi,pointed a gun at her,and threatened to kill her unless she began doing work for the farc.the individual gave thirty days to appear before the farc.after this incident,fled to the united states and applied for asylum.
procedural history 
filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture on october.the department of homeland security initiated removal proceedings against her on december.after a series of continuances,had a hearing before an ij on march.she had an attorney present.the ij found testimony consistent and credible.the ij also found that had suffered harm that rose to the level of past persecution.however,the ij denied relief because he found that did not suffer past persecution on account of her political opinion or her membership in a particular social group.appealed the ij decision to the board.the board held that the farc actions were motivated by the farc own political agenda and not by a desire to punish for her political opinion.the board also held that had not established that she belonged to a cognizable social group because the health brigades did not have a common quality binding its members that is either unchangeable or fundamental to their identities.in the alternative,the board held that failed to show that the farc persecuted her to punish or overcome her membership in the health brigades.because did not demonstrate that her past persecution was on account of her political opinion or social group membership,she could not establish a fear of persecution on account of those factors.
ii.discussion 
this is an appeal from the board denial of relief.the board issued its own opinion,independent from the ij oral order.therefore,we review only the board opinion.moab gonzales,cir.we review the board determination of facts,including that failed to establish statutory eligibility for asylum,for substantial evidence.mabasa gonzales,cir b b stating that factfindings by the agency are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.under this standard,we only reverse if the evidence presented was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.ins.
to qualify for asylum,an applicant must show a reasonable possibility of persecution on account of her race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b a,a.because filed her claim in,the real id act of governs.the act requires to show that one of five protected grounds was or would be a central reason for her persecution.see a,b b.a showing of past persecution creates a fear of future persecution.a a.the ij and the board both found that faced persecution in the past.therefore,the only findings challenged in this appeal are the board findings that the persecution faced was not because of her political opinion and that the persecution was not because of her membership in a particular social group.
in proving that she was persecuted on account of her political opinion,an imputed political opinion,or her membership in a social group,must put forth either direct or circumstantial evidence that the farc prior persecution of was motivated by one of those factors,at.however,in certain cases,the factual circumstances alone may constitute sufficient circumstantial evidence of a persecutor motives.attorney general,cir quoting gonzales,cir.
persecution on account of political opinion 
the board found that did not reasonably show that the farc targeted her on account of her actual or perceived political opinion.in coming to this conclusion,the board mainly relied on three cases gonzales,cir matter of,et,bia and matter of,bia.before this court,the government relies on the same three cases as the board and additionally points our attention to ins,and attorney general,cir.
ins is the predecessor to the other pertinent cases,so we begin there.in the supreme court addressed the question of whether a guerrilla organization attempt to coerce a person into performing military service necessarily constitutes persecution on account of political opinion.at.the court determined that the question was and therefore such coercion was not necessarily persecution on account of political opinion.id.under the specific facts of,the court found that the guerrilla organization attempt to coerce the petitioner into performing military service did not constitute persecution on account of political opinion.id.at.two uniformed guerrillas went to the home of when he was eighteen and attempted to recruit him to fight with them.id.at.he refused to join the guerrilla army and fled to the united states out of fear of future persecution.id.after he fled,the guerrillas returned twice more to attempt to recruit him.id.testified that he refused to join the guerrillas because he was afraid the government would retaliate against him for joining.id.in assessing these facts,the court rejected the ninth circuit contention that a guerrilla organization attempt to conscript a person into its military forces necessarily constitutes persecution on account of political opinion because the person resisting forced recruitment is expressing a political opinion hostile to the persecutor.id.at.in rejecting the ninth circuit position,the court reasoned that 
even a person who supports a guerrilla movement might resist recruitment for a variety of of combat,a desire to remain with one family and friends,a desire to earn a better living in civilian life,to mention a few.the record in the present case not only failed to show a political motive on part it showed just the opposite.
id.at.the court went on to state that had to show that the record compelled the conclusion that the guerrillas will persecute him because of his political opinion,rather than because of his refusal to fight with them.based on the limited evidence that the guerrilla group attempted to recruit and he refused,the court found that there was not sufficient evidence to compel the finding that he was persecuted on account of his political opinion.
contrary to the government position in this appeal,does not stand for the proposition that attempted recruitment by a guerrilla group will never constitute persecution on account of the asylum seeker political beliefs.rather,instructs courts to carefully consider the factual record of each case when determining whether the petitioner fear of future persecution due to his refusing recruitment attempts constitutes persecution on account of political beliefs.does not draw a rule one way or the other.therefore,we turn our attention to the record.
the record in this case demonstrates that was persecuted in the past,and therefore has a legitimate fear of future persecution,on account of her political beliefs.unlike the record in,the specific facts of this case make it clear that politically opposed the farc and that her political beliefs were the reason for her refusal to cooperate with the farc.while the reason behind refusal to fight with the guerillas was not clear,the record in this case is explicit and uncontradicted refused to align with the farc because of her political views.unlike the attempt to recruit to fight,the farc did not ask to do anything she would not otherwise do,nor did they ask her to refrain from doing something she otherwise would do.the farc demanded that continue doing what she was doing,but simply allow them to take credit for the political goodwill she engendered with the populations she served.refused because,the farc is a rebel group to the democracy of colombia,because they have harmed a lot of colombia and my beginnings would not allow me to do this.ij hearing testimony.it is exactly this type of that the refusal to cooperate was based on a political was missing.
also,unlike the record in,the record in this case makes it clear that the farc imputed an political opinion to which led to the increasingly violent nature of their persecution of her.there is uncontested evidence in the record that the farc views members of health brigades as political opponents.a report by the immigration and naturalization service indicates that individuals who do humanitarian work,such as working with health brigades,are at a great risk of attack by the farc or other armed groups in colombia.the report quotes an amnesty international colombia country specialist,you can not do humanitarian work without being perceived as a political threat by one or all of the armed groups.the report finds that this is largely because the various political groups in colombia use health brigades to garner political support.id.this report leads us to the conclusion that the farc viewed as a political opponent and sought to sway her politically so that they could take credit for the humanitarian work that she performed.
persistent refusal to politically align with the farc despite the increasingly violent nature of the persecution would have only strengthened the farc belief that she was a political opponent.the farc initially attempted to recruit through phone calls and threatening notes.if had fled to the united states after only these recruiting attempts and sought asylum,the government contention that this case is on all fours with still would not be appropriate,but it would be much attempts were made the individual ignored or rejected the attempts the individual fled to the united states and sought asylum.however,story does not end there.after these early refusals,that the farc escalated the violent nature of their recruitment attempts.the farc increasingly violent actions,which the board found amounted to persecution,came in response to refusal to politically align her humanitarian work with the farc.while it may be unclear whether the farc initially targeted her to overcome her political stance,the later persecution came as a result of her refusal to cooperate with the farc to advance their political agenda.this persecution is a key difference between situation and that of,and leads us to the inference that the farc targeted to overcome the political opinion they attributed to her.see delgado mukasey,cir it did not necessarily follow that,because petitioner original kidnaping had not been politically motivated,her refusal to provide further technological assistance did not support a fear of future persecution on account of an imputed political opinion,distinguishing situation from situation in part because the family was approached by the farc on multi
