we consider on this appeal whether a conviction under new york penal law and for attempted arson in the third degree constitutes an aggravated felony under the immigration and nationality act ina.see a e i.answering this question requires us to decide this state crime,which lacks a federal jurisdictional element,is an offense described in i,the federal statute governing explosive materials offenses,which does contain such an element.because we defer to the bia reasonable determination that a state offense described in i need not contain a federal jurisdictional element,we deny the petition.
background 
jorge luna torres,a native and citizen of the dominican republic and a lawful permanent resident of the united states,was convicted in of attempted arson in the third degree in violation of new york penal law and.was sentenced to one day of imprisonment and five years of probation.
in,luna sought admission to the united states as a lawful permanent resident after a trip abroad.on march,the immigration and naturalization service issued a notice to appear charging luna with inadmissibility as an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.
luna applied for cancellation of removal.after a merits hearing,a united states immigration judge ij found luna removable as charged,a conclusion which luna does not challenge before this court.relying on matter of bautista,bia,overruled by bautista attorney,cir,the ij also found luna ineligible for cancellation of removal as a permanent resident convicted of an aggravated felony,see a.in matter of bautista,the board of immigration appeals bia had concluded that a conviction under the same provision of the new york penal law constitutes an aggravated felony under section a e i of the ina as an offense described in i.matter of bautista,at see a e i codifying ina a e i.
luna appealed the denial of cancellation to the bia.he argued that the agency should reconsider matter of bautista and that,if it did not,the decision should not be applied retroactively to his case.the bia dismissed luna appeal,declining to reconsider matter of bautista and concluding that its effect was not impermissibly retroactive.luna timely petitioned this court for review,repeating both of these arguments.
after briefing but before oral argument in luna appeal,the third circuit vacated the bia ruling in matter of bautista,concluding that the new york arson statute did not qualify as an aggravated felony because it lacked the federal jurisdictional element.bautista attorney,cir.the third circuit decision conflicts with interpretations by the fifth,seventh,eighth,and ninth circuits of a offense described in language.see spacek holder,cir interpreting a j,relating to racketeering offenses nieto hernandez holder,cir interpreting a e ii,relating to firearms offenses negrete rodriguez mukasey,cir same united states castillo rivera,cir same.we therefore requested supplemental briefing,which the parties submitted prior to oral argument.
discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
this court lacks jurisdiction to review the bia denial of discretionary relief from removal.see a b ii,a.but luna claim that his conviction is not an aggravated felony rendering him statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal raises a question of law which we retain jurisdiction to review,id.a d,and which we evaluate under the principles of deference set forth in chevron,u,natural resources defense council.
ii.whether a violation of new york penal law constitutes an aggravated felony under the ina 
on appeal,luna argues that matter of bautista was incorrectly decided because congress intended to define as aggravated felonies only those state law crimes encompassing all elements of the federal statute,including jurisdictional elements.because we defer to the bia reasonable conclusion to the contrary,we reject this argument.
the statutory framework 
under the ina,an alien is ineligible for cancellation of removal if he has been convicted of an aggravated felony.a.the statute defines the term aggravated felony by enumerating an extensive catalogue of crimes identified with varying degrees of specificity.see id.a.the definition penultimate sentence also provides that t he term applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of federal or state law and applies to such an offense in violation of the law of a foreign country for which the term of imprisonment was completed within the previous years.id.
among the offenses included under ina a definition is an offense described in i.see a e i.that section in turn provides 
whoever maliciously damages or destroys,or attempts to damage or destroy,by means of fire or an explosive,any building,vehicle,or other real or personal property used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce shall be imprisoned for not less than years and not more than years,fined under this title,or both 
i.new york penal law,under which luna was convicted,provides that a person is guilty of arson in the third degree when he intentionally damages a building or motor vehicle by starting a fire or causing an explosion.penal law.the two statutes are substantially similar except that i contains one element that the property destroyed be used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting interstate or foreign commerce which new york penal law lacks.the question this appeal poses is whether the new york provision must include this jurisdictional element in order to qualify as an offense described in the federal statute.
the bia decision in matter of bautista 
the bia confronted precisely this question in matter of bautista.after determining that new york penal law and i are substantially similar except for the jurisdictional element,the bia concluded that its analysis in matter of vasquez muniz,bia en banc,controlled.matter of bautista,at.
in matter of vasquez muniz,the bia decided that a conviction under the california penal code for possession of a firearm by a felon constituted an aggravated felony under a e ii as an offense described in g.matter of vasquez muniz,at.the bia,sitting en banc,reasoned that a state crime described in a federal crime need not reproduce the federal jurisdictional element.id.the bia concluded that the penultimate sentence of section a,which clarifies that the term aggravated felony applies to an offense described in this paragraph whether in violation of federal or state law or the law of a foreign country,expressed a congressional concern over substantive offenses rather than any concern about the jurisdiction in which they are prosecuted.id.at emphasis added.the bia also reasoned that,since states rarely include federal jurisdictional language in their criminal statutes,requiring state crimes to reproduce federal jurisdictional elements in order to constitute aggravated felonies would virtually excise state criminal convictions from the ambit of section a e,despite clear language to the contrary.id.at citing a b ii,which refers to aliens in the custody of a state pursuant to a final conviction for an offense described in a e.the same would be true,the bia concluded,of foreign offenses.id.at.
applying this reasoning in matter of bautista,the bia found no distinction between the federal jurisdictional element of i and that of g.matter of bautista,at.the bia also distinguished the holding of jones united states,which emphasized the importance of section i federal jurisdictional element,as related to the scope of the federal criminal statute,not the collateral consequences in an immigration case.matter of bautista,at.the bia therefore concluded that a conviction under new york penal law and constituted an aggravated felony rendering an alien ineligible for cancellation of removal.id.at.
our analysis under chevron 
chevron requires us to defer to an agency reasonable interpretation of the statute it administers.chevron,at kar onn lee holder,cir.we must first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of
