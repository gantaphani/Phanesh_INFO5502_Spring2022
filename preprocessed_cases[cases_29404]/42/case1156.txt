in this appeal,we must determine whether a conviction for the new york equivalent of statutory rape under new york penal law constitutes an aggravated felony within the meaning of a a iii and a.deferring as we must to the board of immigration appeals reasonable interpretation of the immigration laws,we conclude that it does.we also must determine whether a certificate of relief from disabilities issued pursuant to of the new york corrections law by the new york court in which mugalli was convicted immunizes the petitioner from any immigration consequences of his conviction.we conclude that it does not.
background 
petitioner abdulkhaleq mugalli is a native and citizen of yemen who lawfully immigrated to the united states in march.on april,mugalli was indicted by a grand jury in oneida county,new york,on two counts rape in the third degree for engaging in sexual intercourse with a female under the age of seventeen in violation of new york penal law and endangering the welfare of a child in violation of new york penal law.mugalli pled guilty to the first in full satisfaction of the indictment.at the time of the offense,the victim was sixteen years and seven months old mugalli was.mugalli was sentenced on july,to five years probation.at sentencing,he received from the court a certificate of relief from disabilities certificate of relief pursuant to new york corrections law.the certificate of relief purported to relieve mugalli of all forfeitures,and of all disabilities and bars to employment,excluding the right to retain or to be eligible for public office.
less than a month later,on august,the immigration and naturalization service ins served mugalli with a notice to appear in removal proceedings brought under of the immigration and naturalization act ina.the notice asserted that mugalli was deportable under a a iii as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in a a.
mugalli appeared before an immigration judge ij arguing that his new york conviction for rape in the third degree did not constitute an aggravated felony as defined by a a and that his certificate of relief immunized him from any immigration consequences of the conviction.the ij rejected mugalli arguments and ordered his removal.
mugalli appealed the ij decision to the board of immigration appeals bia.the bia concluded that statutory rape constituted sexual abuse of a minor,which is designated by a a as an aggravated felony.see in re mugalli,no.bia.the bia further held that the certificate of relief had no bearing on his deportation.the bia therefore dismissed mugalli appeal and ordered that he be removed to yemen.
mugalli petitions for review of that decision.because his new york conviction does qualify as an aggravated felony and has not been expunged by his certificate of relief,we lack jurisdiction over mugalli petition for review and therefore dismiss it.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
the ina provides that a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.a a iii.for purposes of this section,an aggravated felony includes murder,rape,or sexual abuse of a minor.a a.
under the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,div,title,stat,iirira,we can not review any final removal order against an alien who is deportable because he was convicted of an aggravated felony.see a c.this jurisdictional bar arises if the petitioner is an alien and he is deportable under one of the offenses enumerated in a.see bell reno,cir,cert.denied,d.however,w e have jurisdiction to determine whether this jurisdictional bar applies,and we may thus review whether mugalli satisfies these jurisdictional facts.id.
mugalli concedes that he is an alien.the jurisdictional inquiry thus merges with the question on the merits if mugalli is in fact removable because he was convicted of an aggravated felony,we must dismiss his petition for lack of jurisdiction.sui ins,cir.we are therefore required to consider mugalli substantive arguments that his new york conviction is not an aggravated felony under the ina and that his conviction has been expunged for purposes of the immigration laws by the certificate of relief.
ii.standard of review 
the determination of our jurisdiction is exclusively for the court to decide.reno,cir,cert.denied,d.in this appeal,our jurisdiction depends on the definition of the phrase aggravated felony as used in the ina,a statute that is administered by,among others,the bia.as is,chevron natural resources defense council,d,requires reviewing courts to defer to an agency interpretation of the statute it administers when the intent of congress is unclear and the agency interpretation is reasonable.sui,at citing bell,at.
under chevron,when we examine an agency interpretation of a statute it administers,we first ask whether the intent of congress is clear as to the precise question at issue.bell,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
if,by employing traditional tools of statutory construction,we determine that congress intent is clear,that is the end of the matter.however,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,we then ask whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.we must affirm the agency construction as long as that interpretation is reasonable.
id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in making this assessment,
it is not necessary that we conclude that the agency interpretation of the statute is the only permissible interpretation,nor that we believe it to be the best interpretation of the statute.rather,in order to affirm the bia determination,we need only conclude that its interpretation is reasonable and that it considered the matter in a detailed and reasoned fashion.
michel ins,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
the supreme court has held that the bia should be accorded chevron deference as it gives ambiguous statutory terms concrete meaning through a process of adjudication.ins,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we have observed,however,that where the bia is interpreting state or federal criminal laws,we must review its decision de novo,michel,at,because the bia is not charged with administration of these laws,sui,at citing michel,at and sutherland reno,cir.
our recent decision in sui is instructive.there,the petitioner had been convicted of possessing in counterfeit traveler checks with intent to deceive another in violation of a.the question presented to us was whether that conviction constituted an attempt,under a u,to commit an offense invol ving fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victims exceeds under a m i,and therefore an aggravated felony under a a iii.we held that the bia was entitled to deference with respect to its interpretation of a m i,a u and a a iii,which provide for deportation of aliens for committing specified aggravated felonies,because those statutory sections are part of the immigration laws that the ins administers.thus,we deferred to the bia construction of a u under which an attempt to commit a crime requires both the requisite intent to commit the crime and a substantial step toward completing it.but the bia conclusion that a conviction under a necessarily constituted an attempt as the bia had defined it depended on an analysis of a federal criminal statute and was thus beyond the bia administrative responsibility and expertise.that conclusion was therefore entitled to no deference from us.see sui,at.
similarly in the case at hand,we defer to the bia interpretation of a a in determining the meaning of sexual abuse of a minor.we give no deference,however,to the bia decision that mugalli conviction under new york law for statutory rape meets the bia interpretation of sexual abuse of a minor.
iii.merits 
whether mugalli was convicted of an aggravated felony 
the meaning of sexual abuse of a minor.the ina defines aggravated felony to include murder,rape,or sexual abuse of a minor.a a the only guidance provided by the statute regarding the meaning of the phrase sexual abuse of a minor is that it applies to an offense whether in violation of federal or state law.a.the term is not defined by explicit reference to other provisions of the united states code,as are terms in several other parts of a,a b referring to section of title and section c of title a c referring to sections and c of title a d referring to sections and of title a e referring to several sections of title,a h referring to several sections of title.thus,the language of the statute yields no clear evidence of congressional intent as to the scope of the phrase.
in interpreting the phrase sexual abuse of a minor,the bia reasoned that because a a does not refer to other specific statutory provisions,the agency was not required to adopt a definition of the term from a specific federal or state statute.see in re mugalli,slip op.at.but in accordance with its decision in matter of,interim bia,bia lexis,wl bia,the bia decided that to determine the meaning of the phrase,it could refer to other federal statutes for guidance.see in re mugalli,slip op.at.
mugalli urged the bia to look to the definition of sexual abuse of a minor in a,which makes it a crime,denominated sexual abuse of a minor or ward,for a person 
in the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the united states or in a federal prison,knowingly to engage in a sexual act with another person who has attained the age of years but has not attained the age of years and is at least four years younger than the person so engaging.
under that definition,mugalli would not have been guilty of felonious sexual abuse of a minor because the victim of his crime had in fact attained the age of sixteen.
the bia,employing the interpretive approach taken by,supra,rejected that contention.in,the bia had been called upon to decide whether conviction of an alien for violation of a texas statute making it a felony for an adult to sexually expose himself to a child was,for purposes of a a,the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor.petitioner asked the bia to find the definition of the phrase in elements of the federal crimes set forth in sexual abuse,and in the statute urged upon us in this case,sexual abuse of a minor or ward.see,bia lexis,at an element of the crimes established by and is a sexual act.see.section defines sexual act to include touching or contact.see.neither touching nor contact were elements of the texas crime for which had been convicted.
the bia declined to base its definition on those statutes.it looked instead to a as a useful identification of the forms of sexual abuse,bia lexis,at.section a provides 
t he term sexual abuse includes the employment,use,persuasion,inducement,enticement,or coercion of a child to engage in,or assist another person to engage in,sexually explicit conduct or the rape,molestation,prostitution,or other form of sexual exploitation of children,or incest with children.
a.the bia also referred to black law dictionary for a common defin ition of sexual abuse illegal sex acts performed against a minor by a parent,guardian,relative,or acquaintance,bia lexis,at quoting black law dictionary,ed.the bia decided that,and were too restrictive to encompass the numerous state crimes that can be viewed as sexual abuse and the diverse types of conduct that would fit within the term as it commonly is used.id.at.it also found the,and definitions to be in consistent with congress intent to remove aliens who are sexually abusive toward children and to bar them from any relief.id.adopting the broad general definition extracted from a and black,the bia concluded that sexual exposure by an adult to a child,the crime for which had been convicted,constituted the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor even though neither contact nor touching is an element of the crime 
the bia took a similar approach in mugalli case.the bia was seeking a definition of sexual abuse of a minor that captured a broad spectrum of sexually abusive behavior,mugalli,slip op.at internal quotation mark and citation omitted because,in the judgment of the bia expressed in,congress intended to provide in iirira a comprehensive scheme to cover crimes against children,bia lexis,at.the bia therefore declined to adopt the definition limiting sexual abuse of a minor to abuse of a person twelve through fifteen years of age as too restrictive to encompass the numerous state crimes that can be viewed as sexual abuse and the diverse types of conduct that would fit within the term as it is commonly used.mugalli,slip op.at quoting,bia lexis,at.
instead,the bia adopted the definition of sexual abuse of a child contained in a,the same statute to which the board had referred.see,slip op.at.as noted,a provides,inter alia,that s exual abuse of a child includes the employment,use,persuasion,inducement,enticement,or coercion of a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct.a.sexually explicit conduct is,in turn,defined to include sexual intercourse.a a see in re mugalli,slip op.at.and a child is a person under the age of eighteen.see id.at citing a.thus,according to the bia,a felony is equivalent to sexual abuse of a minor if the elements of the crime include the employment,use,persuasion,inducement,enticement,or coercion of a person under eighteen to engage in sexual intercourse.
it would be troubling if the bia had done no more than pluck the definition of sexual abuse of a minor from a.that statute sets forth procedures for protecting child victims and child witnesses in the course of federal litigation.it is directed neither to substantive criminal law nor to immigration law.it addresses neither the elements of criminal conduct nor the characteristics of aggravated felonies.but the board observed,we are not adopting this statute as a definitive standard or definition but invoke it as a guide in identifying the types of crimes we would consider to be sexual abuse of a minor,bia lexis,at.we agree that the a definition is appropriate not simply because it appears somewhere in the united states code,but because it is consonant with the generally understood broad meaning of the term sexual abuse as reflected in black an illegal sex act,esp.one performed against a minor.see black law dictionary,ed.it is also supported by the bia reading of congressional intent to provide a comprehensive scheme to cover crimes against children,bia lexis,at.
mugalli,relying on taylor united states,d,argues that the bia was required to adopt a single federal definition of sexual abuse of a minor so that aliens throughout the united states are subject to a uniform standard of behavior.we have indeed observed that we are to avoid decisions that result in disparate treatment of similarly situated aliens under the immigration laws.aguirre ins,cir.we summarized the principle in sui 
t he supreme court addressed an analogous issue in taylor when it considered whether the term burglary,as used in a federal sentence enhancement statute,meant burglary however a jurisdiction chose to define it,or was instead premised upon a uniform definition of the crime,which might not include some offenses formally labeled burglary.see id.at.the court concluded that it was implausible that congress intended the meaning of burglary to depend on the definition adopted by the state of conviction,since such a conclusion would mean that exactly the same conduct could have different results for sentencing if state labeling schemes varied.id.at.indeed,the general rule is that unless congress gives plain indication to the contrary,federal laws are not to be construed so that their meaning hinges on state law,because the application of federal legislation is nationwide and at times the federal program would be impaired if state law were to control.dickerson new banner institute,d.
sui,at second ellipsis in the original.
the bia decision in mugalli is consistent with both taylor and sui.the definition that the bia has adopted applies nationwide.what varies from state to state is statutory rape laws.we are confident that congress intended that behavior criminalized in one state and not another can constitute an aggravated felony if committed in the first state and not the second,even though the result would be that identical behavior may result in an alien being sub
