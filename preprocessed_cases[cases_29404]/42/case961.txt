background 
blake,a citizen of jamaica,entered the united states in and was granted temporary resident status in under the special agricultural workers program.see.on november,the united states department of justice notified blake that it intended to terminate his temporary resident status based on his september,convictions in massachusetts state court for one count of cocaine possession and two counts of assault and battery on a police officer.on february,the department of justice informed blake that he had not responded to the notice of intent to terminate and therefore he had not overcome the grounds for termination of his temporary resident status.it therefore terminated his temporary resident status.
on october,blake pleaded guilty in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts to making false statements in an application for a passport and to the deceitful use of a social security number in violation,respectively,of and a b.two weeks later,on october,the ins commenced removal proceedings against him by filing a notice to appear in the hartford immigration court.blake appeared before ij on september,for a hearing at which the government amended the notice to appear by submitting an,resulting in,inter alia,the following charges relevant to this appeal 
on september,you were admitted as a temporary resident based upon an application for adjustment of status under the special agricultural workers program,approved on september,and you were authorized to remain in the united states for the duration of temporary residence.
on february,your lawful temporary saw status was terminated,based upon your controlled substance conviction on september,and you have remained in the united states since that time without the authorization of the ins.
on september,you were convicted of assault and battery upon a police officer in violation of massachusetts general laws chapter sec,for which a sentence of two years suspended was imposed.
after several continuances,the ij held a removal hearing on october.blake admitted that he was a citizen of jamaica,and not a citizen of the united states,but denied all other charges and allegations.based on documentary evidence in the record,which included the ins notice of intent to terminate blake temporary resident status as well as records of blake state and federal court convictions,the ij determined that the government had sustained all charges and allegations against blake by clear,convincing and unequivocal evidence.the ij held blake removable on two independent grounds on the basis of his conviction for assault and battery upon a police officer,which the ij determined was a crime of violence and,therefore,an aggravated felony and because blake remained in the country without authorization from the ins after his temporary resident status was terminated in.with respect to the first finding,the ij determined that assault and battery upon a police officer in massachusetts under chapter,section does,in fact,have as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,and thus came within the ambit of a crime of violence as defined by a.in the alternative,the ij held that the offense is a felony that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense,and thus came within the ambit of b.accordingly,the ij held,blake was an aggravated felon and was removable under section a a iii of the immigration and nationality act ina,a a iii.in addition,based on uncontested documentary evidence,the ij held blake removable because he remained in the united states after his temporary resident status had been terminated.see ina a b,a b.
the ij also denied blake request for a continuance in order to permit adjudication of an petition for an alien relative filed on his behalf by his son.ij deemed blake ineligible for adjustment of status,cancellation of removal or a waiver of conviction under ina h,h,because he was an aggravated felon and had been convicted of a crime involving cocaine,and further concluded that blake was precluded from seeking a waiver of his convictions under ina c,c,and ins cyr,d,because he was not a lawful permanent resident.
blake timely appealed to the bia,which affirmed the ij decision on april.the bia agreed with the ij and held that,whether analyzed under subsection a or b of,the respondent assault and battery conviction constitutes a crime of violence such that he is removable under section a a iii of the act and,accordingly,is not eligible for cancellation of removal.the bia noted that the first circuit adjudged assault and battery upon a police officer under massachusetts law to be a crime of violence in the context of a sentencing enhancement case,united states santos,cir,and deemed this a persuasive interpretation of the massachusetts law.noting,however,that blake case fell within the jurisdiction of the second circuit,the bia found that case law from this court did not require a different result while the second circuit has found that assault in the third degree does not necessarily contain the element of use of force and,therefore,does not qualify as a crime of violence under a,it is clear that battery,at least the common law definition,does require some physical contact and force and,furthermore,that since the respondent conviction qualifies as a felony,it only need involve the substantial risk that force will be used under b.the bia also affirmed the ij denial of blake motion for a continuance,holding that the ij had not abused his discretion because blake was not eligible for the relief requested.
blake timely filed a petition for review in this court.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
federal courts generally lack jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense,ina a c,a c,including,inter alia,offenses constituting aggravated felonies,see ina a a iii,a a iii,the provision addressing aggravated felonies.however,under the ina as amended by the real id act of,we are permitted to review questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals,a a iii,stat,codified at a d.because the question of whether blake offense is a crime of violence,and therefore constitutes an aggravated felony,is such a question of law,we have jurisdiction to review it.see dos santos gonzales,cir.if we determine that blake conviction involves a crime of violence,and therefore is an aggravated felony,we must dismiss his petition for review for lack of jurisdiction.see dep t of justice,cir.
ii.standard of review 
when this court is called upon to construe a provision of the ina,we must give substantial deference to the bia interpretation of the statutes it is charged with administering.abimbola ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,i n contrast to situations where a federal agency is interpreting a statute it is charged with administering,courts owe no deference to an agency interpretations of state or federal criminal laws,because the agency is not charged with the administration of such laws.sutherland reno,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because our consideration of blake petition for review requires interpretation of federal and state criminal and massachusetts general laws chapter,section review of the petition is de novo.see,at.
iii.relevant statutes 
under the ina,a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.ina a a iii,a a iii.of the many aggravated felonies identified by congress in the ina,the one relevant here is a crime of violence as defined in section of title for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.ina a f,a f.a crime of violence,in turn,is defined in as 
a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,or 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
under the plain language of a,one of the elements of a crime of violence must be the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.a.see chrzanoski ashcroft,cir.
as the supreme court noted in leocal ashcroft,d,section b sweeps more broadly than a.it requires only two elements a felony that by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used.sutherland,at quoting b.to determine whether an offense is a crime of violence within the meaning of b,this court employs the categorical approach.see dalton ashcroft,cir.under this approach,the singular circumstances of an individual petitioner crimes should not be considered,and only the minimum criminal conduct necessary to sustain a conviction under a given statute is relevant.id.quoting michel ins,cir calabresi,dissenting alteration in dalton see also leocal,at.noting that,to determine whether an offense is a crime of violence under b,a court must look to the elements and the nature of the offense of conviction,rather than to the particular facts relating to petitioner crime.
assault and battery on a police officer is an offense under chapter,section section of the massachusetts general laws,the section under which blake was convicted in its entirety,it provides 
whoever commits an assault and battery upon a police officer,firefighter,correction officer,sheriff,deputy sheriff,court officer,parole supervisor,constable,an employee of the department of social services,an employee of the registry of motor vehicles having police powers,an employee in the department of youth services with the care and custody of a juvenile offender,a public school teacher,a public school administrator or any person in the public school system having duties similar to a teacher or administrator when such person is engaged in the performance of his duty at the time of such assault and battery,or a bus,trackless trolley,rail or rapid transit motorman,operator,gateman,guard,or collector when such person is engaged in the performance of his duties at the time of such assault and battery,shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than ninety days nor more than two and years in a house of correction or by a fine of not less than five hundred nor more than five thousand dollars.
massachusetts law does not define the elements of criminal assault and battery,but rather looks to the common law for definition.see commonwealth burke,stating that a ssault and battery is a common law crime now set forth in massachusetts general laws chapter,and analyzing the elements of the offense by reference to the common law.under the common law of massachusetts,there are two theories of assault and battery.under the first theory,an assault and battery is the intentional and unjustified use of force upon the person of another,however slight.commonwealth ford,internal quotation marks omitted hereinafter,the intentional theory.under the second theory,assault and battery can be defined as the intentional commission of a wanton or reckless act something more than gross negligence causing physical or bodily injury to another.id.internal quotation marks omitted hereinafter,the wanton or reckless theory.to sustain a conviction for assault and battery under this second theory,the commonwealth must prove that the defendant conduct involve d a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will result to another,or that it constitute d a disregard of probable harmful consequences to another,and that,as a result of that conduct,the victim suffered some physical injury.commonwealth correia,internal quotation marks and citations omitted 
the statute under which blake was convicted lists a broad array of public officials against whom an assault and battery constitutes a specially recognized crime.although blake judgment of conviction makes clear that he was convicted of assault and battery on a police officer,as opposed to some other specially recognized public official,section does not recognize assault and battery on a police officer as an offense separate from the other offenses covered by the statute.section defines the crime,and merely lists which public officials are covered by the provision.we must be specific in our analysis,however,given that criminal statutes may encompass diverse classes of criminal of which would categorically be grounds for removal and others of which would not.dickson ashcroft,cir.in such cases,a court may treat the statute as divisible,for purposes of determining whether the precise offense of conviction is one for which the ina permits removal.leocal,at.see also,at a criminal statute is divisible if it encompasses multiple categories of offense conduct,some,but not all,of which would categorically constitute aggravated felonies under the ina.if a statute is divisible,while a court may not look to the particular facts of an alien conduct to determine if the alien actually used force a court may refer to the record of conviction to determine whether the alien offense conduct falls within a category that would justify removal.canada gonzales,cir.the record of conviction includes the charging document,plea agreement,a verdict or judgment of conviction,and a record of the sentence or plea transcript.abimbola,at.
if we determine that a statute is not divisible,we can not construe the offense it describes as an aggravated felony because the statute can not be cleanly divided between conduct that is categorically a crime of violence and conduct that is not categorically a crime of violence.see canada,at.here,blake argues that section is not divisible.he notes that it applies to a range of public employees,and observes that,at the time he was convicted,the statute actually named those categories of persons.because assault and battery on many of these public employees does not entail the same risk of violence as it does on a police officer,blake argues,the statute allows for conviction of nonviolent offenses and therefore does not satisfy the requirements of b.
we dispose of this argument easily,as this court considered and rejected a virtually identical proposition in canada.see id.at.the connecticut assault statute under consideration in canada,like the massachusetts statute at issue here,listed serially categories of public safety personnel covered by the statute.canada asserted that assault against certain enumerated categories of public personnel did not inherently involve a risk that force would be used against them,and argued that because the statute did not delineate the various categories of public employees in specific subsections,it could not be treated as divisible.we rejected this argument and declared the statute divisible,in part because the various categories of public safety officers protected by the statute are listed sequentially,each separated by a comma,and are phrased in the disjunctive.id.at.because the same is true of the massachusetts statute at issue here,and because blake has offered no persuasive reason for us to depart from the court reasoning in canada,we treat the statute as divisible and consider only whether assault and battery on a police officer is a crime of violence.see abimbola,at when
