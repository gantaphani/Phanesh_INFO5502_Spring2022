sihin hadera francois,a native and citizen of eritrea,petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia dismissing her appeal from an immigration judge denial of her request for asylum and withholding of deportation.for the reasons stated below,we deny the petition.
procedural background 
francois entered the united states on october,as a nonimmigrant student to attend brown institute in minneapolis,minnesota.she was authorized to remain in this country until march.on december,however,francois was placed in deportation proceedings by the filing of an order to show cause with the immigration court.the order charged that francois was an alien who failed to comply with the conditions of the nonimmigrant status under which she had been admitted to the united states,namely,that she had never attended the brown institute.
at a july,hearing francois admitted the factual allegations contained in the order and conceded deportability,but requested an opportunity to apply for asylum and a withholding of deportation.at the conclusion of an immigration hearing held on december,an immigration judge denied francois applications for asylum and withholding of deportation,but granted her voluntary departure.francois appealed the immigration judge decision to the bia,and on december,the bia dismissed her appeal.
factual background 
francois contends she was subject to past persecution in eritrea because of her religious beliefs and political opinion,and that she has a fear of future persecution if she returns because she is a christian,a political opponent of the mengistu regime,and a member of the elf eritrean liberation front,an opponent of the eplf eritrean people liberation front,which now rules eritrea.francois submitted evidence based on her individual and family experiences in eritrea.
francois individual experiences 
francois belonged to the catholic youth organization cyo and was involved in studying the bible and teaching the catechism.while attending asmara university in eritrea,she distributed pamphlets for the eritrean liberation front elf the last time she distributed pamphlets was in.the elf was a group that opposed the marxist mengistu regime.francois was prepared to perform two years of government service in exchange for her free education at the university,but the government sent her to study ideology in the soviet union for three years along with other ethiopian students.she refused to cooperate in the study of that ideology because it denied the existence of god and was against her religion.
after her return from the soviet union,francois underwent an interrogation by the kedele,the local communist party.she told them she refused to cooperate in the study of ideology because of her catholic beliefs.she was then referred to another level of interrogation,the keftegne,or workers party,under the mengistu regime,where she was interrogated every day for two months about her political beliefs in an effort to convince her to embrace their ideology.from there she was referred to ethiopian military officials who asked her the same questions for a week and showed her pictures of people being tortured and killed.francois was told that if she did not change her ideology,they were going to kill her father.she was never detained overnight or sent to jail during these interrogations and was allowed to return home every day.when asked if she was involved with the elf,francois always responded in the negative.
after these interrogations,francois was accepted to hull university in london,but was unable to attend because the ethiopian government refused to issue her an exit visa.when the ethiopian government began to imprison members of the cyo,francois believed her life was in danger so she decided to leave ethiopia,contacted her brother in the united states,and made plans to come to this country as a student.she admitted she never actually attended brown institute in minneapolis because she wanted to study biology not electronics.
a week before the immigration hearing,francois received a letter from her father in which he related incidents of terrorism and killing of former elf supporters by former mengistu sympathizers.in that letter,her father also indicated that one of her sisters was promoted by her employer and her other sister graduated from high school and was awaiting her college entrance exam results.
the transitional government of ethiopia took power and overthrew the mengistu regime in.eritrea became independent in and the new government of eritrea is neither nor,but is dedicated both to democratic reform and freedom of religion.francois has acknowledged these political changes.she also testified she is not opposed to the new government.she agreed the new government is engaged in reform and that her religious beliefs would not be persecuted.francois stated she nevertheless fears persecution because the new government is incapable of protecting its own people from ethiopian terrorists or controlling political violence.
francois family experiences 
francois father had been a judge on the supreme high court in ethiopia for years,but his duties ended when the ethiopian government forced him to resign and replaced the court with military tribunals in.he had also attempted to establish a catholic university and write a newsletter on human rights issues.francois father still resides in eritrea.
francois uncle had been a bishop in the catholic church for years until,when his tenure ended under pressure from the government due to his involvement with the eritrean independence movement.her uncle was arrested in for giving a sermon during the feast of anthony in which he discussed the oppression of the people,and was jailed for a week.he also wrote six or seven books on catholic theology that were banned by the ethiopian government.
francois oldest brother left ethiopia in and presently lives in germany under refugee status.he left ethiopia because he was involved with the elf and the mengistu government was aware of this affiliation.government soldiers descended upon his home and questioned his mother at gun point as to his whereabouts.after this incident,he left eritrea.a second brother left eritrea in because he had been forced by ethiopian soldiers to fight against the eritrean people.this brother was granted refugee status in the united states.francois third brother left eritrea in because he was involved in distributing pamphlets for the elf and several of his friends had been killed.this brother came to the united states in and was also granted refugee status.a fourth brother was imprisoned by ethiopian soldiers in for three years because of his involvement with the elf.he was released in and left ethiopia because his friends started to disappear.this brother died in the sudan of unknown causes.francois also has two sisters who still reside in eritrea.
the immigration and nationality act authorizes the attorney general,in his discretion,to confer asylum on any refugee.a.a refugee is defined as an alien who is unwilling to return to his or her home country because of past persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.id.a a.the fear of persecution standard contains subjective and objective elements.an alien may establish the subjective element with credible testimony that he or she genuinely fears persecution.ghasemimehr ins,cir internal citations omitted.the objective element requires a showing of credible,direct,and specific evidence that a reasonable person in the alien position would fear persecution if returned to the alien native country.id.
an alien will be presumed to possess a fear of future persecution if past persecution is established,and the burden then shifts to the immigration and naturalization service ins to show by a preponderance of the evidence that conditions in the applicant country have changed to such an extent that the applicant no longer has a fear of being persecuted if he or she were to return.b i.even if the ins carries this burden,humanitarian asylum may be granted based on past persecution alone if that
