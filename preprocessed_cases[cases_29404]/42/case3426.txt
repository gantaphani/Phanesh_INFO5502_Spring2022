petitioner lakhwinder latter singh singh,a native and citizen of india,petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia order dismissing his appeal.singh claims that the bia wrongly determined that a violation of california penal code constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude or cimt,thus rendering him removable.although we previously determined that a violation of is an aggravated felony,see rosales rosales ashcroft,cir,we have not yet decided whether is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude.we do so now and answer the question in the affirmative.we also address and reject singh other claimed errors.
singh entered the united states illegally in january and received a grant of asylum in september of that year.singh never obtained legal permanent residency in the united states.
singh came to the attention of asylum officers after he was convicted for making threats with intent to terrorize in violation of california penal code.in march,the department of homeland security dhs commenced removal proceedings against singh by serving him with a notice to appear nta.the nta alleged,among other things,that singh was subject to removal from the united states pursuant to a a i i as an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.
singh sought relief from removal by submitting a new application for asylum applying for withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture cat and seeking to adjust his status under b of the ina in conjunction with a waiver of inadmissibility under c,b c.in,after fourteen days of hearings and testimony,the immigration judge ij denied singh application for adjustment of status and a c waiver,as well as singh application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under cat,and ordered singh removed to india.
the bia affirmed the ij order and determined that singh conviction under rendered him removable,because categorically constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude.to reach this conclusion,the bia relied on rosales rosales,at,where we determined that the full range of conduct embraced by constitutes an aggravated felony because the statute necessarily requires a showing of willful violence.the bia also noted that specifically requires willfulness of conduct to implicate criminal liability.the bia therefore denied singh his requested relief.
a petition for this court review followed.
although a c generally precludes judicial review of orders against aliens removable on criminal grounds,we have jurisdiction to review both constitutional claims and questions of law arising from removal orders.a d.whether a crime involves moral turpitude is such a question of law.mendoza holder,cir.we therefore have jurisdiction to resolve the moral turpitude question,and we conduct our review de novo.see galeana mendoza gonzales,cir.
to determine whether a crime is categorically one of moral turpitude,we examine whether the full range of conduct encompassed by the criminal statute constitutes a crime of moral turpitude.see mendoza,at.if the full range of conduct under the statute fits the definition of a crime involving moral turpitude,then any conviction under the statute can subject an alien to removability.as we explained in marmolejo campos holder,cir en banc,a inquiry applies to a determination of the proper weight to give the bia conclusion that a particular crime is or is not a crime involving moral turpitude.first,after the bia determines the offense the petitioner has been convicted of,the bia must interpret the applicable state statute to ascertain the elements of the offense.id.because the bia has no special expertise in the interpretation of state criminal statutes,we review this determination de novo.see id.
second,once the bia has identified the relevant offense elements,it must determine whether the offense constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude as defined by the ina.id.at.to do so,the bia should assess the character,gravity,and moral significance of the conduct.id.at.we have recognized the bia special role in interpreting the ina,and as a result,we will afford deference to the bia conclusion regarding whether the statute under which singh was convicted categorically criminalizes turpitudinous conduct.id.at.
the level of deference in turn depends on the character of the bia opinion.if the bia issues or relies on a precedential determination to conclude that a particular crime is a crime involving moral turpitude,we accord it chevron deference,see chevron natural res.defense council,d otherwise,we defer to the bia determination only to the extent that it has the power to persuade skidmore deference,see skidmore swift.see marmolejo campos,at see also saavedra figueroa holder,cir.the decision here falls into the latter category,so we apply skidmore deference to the second part of the moral turpitude analysis.our deference will depend on the thoroughness evident in the bia consideration,the validity of its reasoning,and its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements.skidmore,at.
we begin by identifying the elements of singh crime of conviction.singh was convicted under california penal code,which provides,in relevant part 
any person who willfully threatens to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another person,with the specific intent that the statement is to be taken as a threat,even if there is no intent of actually carrying it out,which,on its face and under the circumstances in which it is made,is so unequivocal,unconditional,immediate,and specific as to convey to the person threatened,a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat,and thereby causes that person reasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her immediate family safety,shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail not to exceed one year,or by imprisonment in the state prison.
as california courts have explained,the elements of the completed crime under are willfully threatening to commit a crime that will result in death or great bodily injury to another person specific intent that the statement be taken as a threat the threat was on its face and under the circumstances so unequivocal,unconditional,immediate,and specific as to convey to the person threatened,a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat the threat caused the victim to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her immediate family safety and the victim fear was reasonable under the circumstances.people jackson,th,d.
although the bia analysis is terse and exhibits less than ideal clarity,we can uphold its decision if the agency path may be reasonably discerned.bowman,arkansas best freight,d.here,the bia properly identified and interpreted and its analysis is accorded some deference.the bia correctly observed that requires willful conduct,and,based on that determination,and on this court holding that a violation of categorically constitutes a crime of violence,the bia held that requires sufficient mens rea.there was no error in the bia identification of the elements of the california crime.
having identified the elements of singh conviction,we next compare these elements with the definition of a crime involving moral turpitude to determine whether they satisfy that definition.see uppal holder,cir.although the immigration statutes do not specifically define offenses constituting crimes involving moral turpitude,a crime involving moral turpitude is generally a crime that is vile,base,or depraved and violates accepted moral standards.saavedra figueroa,at.the bia has emphasized that evil or malicious intent is the essence of moral turpitude,in re flores,bia,and,therefore,one test to determine if a crime involves moral turpitude is whether the act is accompanied by a vicious motive or a corrupt mind.in re ajami,bia.we have upheld this emphasis on evil intent.see mendoza,at.
although we have held that criminal threats alone,without any attendant serious physical harm,do not necessarily implicate moral turpitude,see fernandez ruiz gonzales,cir,we conclude that,unlike in fernandez ruiz,the par
