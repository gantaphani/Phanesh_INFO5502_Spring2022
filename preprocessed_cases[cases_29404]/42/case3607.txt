in,ivad mohammed hammad,a palestinian immigrant to the united states,was granted permanent resident status on a conditional basis,based on a petition filed by his citizen wife.his permanent resident status lapsed when his wife admitted to immigration and naturalization service ins officials that she had entered into the marriage for a fee,and withdrew her support of his petition to remove the condition on his residency.now remarried,hammad appeals a determination by the board of immigration appeals bia that he is not entitled to permanent resident status.because the bia determination was supported by substantial evidence,we deny his petition.
before discussing the facts of this case,we provide a brief overview of the statutory and regulatory framework that allows an alien to obtain legal permanent residency status based on a petition from the alien citizen spouse.see a.
under a,a citizen may file a petition with the to adjust the status of an alien spouse.an alien with a qualifying marriage to a citizen is generally granted the status of lawful permanent resident,but maintains this status on a conditional basis for a period.a at any time before the end of the conditional residency period,the ins may terminate the alien permanent resident status if it determines that the alien qualifying marriage is fraudulent,was judicially annulled or terminated,or that a fee or other consideration was paid to the citizen claiming to be a spouse.b see in re stowers,bia.if the alien appeals this termination to the bia,the burden of proof is on the agency to establish,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the facts and information presented by the alien are not true with respect to the qualifying marriage.c d 
if the ins does not terminate the alien conditional resident status under b,then ninety days before the end of the period of conditional status,the alien may attempt to remove the conditional aspect of the permanent resident status by following the procedure outlined in c.first,the alien and spouse must jointly file a petition requesting removal of the condition.c a.next,the alien and spouse must appear for a personal interview before the ins.c b.following the interview,if the ins determines that the alien marriage to the citizen was entered into in good faith,the ins will remove the condition on the alien resident status.c a b.if the ins makes an unfavorable determination,it will terminate the alien resident status as of the date of the determination.c c.the alien may appeal this determination to the bia,in which case the burden of proof is on the ins to establish,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the facts and information contained in the petition are not true with respect to the qualifying marriage.c d.
there are exceptions to this general procedure.relevant here,if the alien fails to meet the requirements for timely filing a joint petition,or for jointly appearing for a personal interview,the alien may seek a waiver of these requirements.upon request,at the attorney general discretion,the ins can waive this requirement,and remove the conditional basis of the permanent resident status,if the alien demonstrates that the marriage to the citizen was entered into in good faith by the alien spouse,but has been terminated other than through the death of the spouse and the alien was not at fault in failing to meet the requirements of submitting a joint petition and appearing for a personal interview.c b the ins also can remove the conditional basis of the alien permanent resident status if extreme hardship would result if such alien is removed.c a.hardship is judged by considering circumstances occurring only during the period that the alien was admitted for permanent residence on a conditional basis.c.generally,in considering these waiver requests,t he determination of what evidence is credible and the weight to be given that evidence shall be within the sole discretion of the attorney general.c.
if the alien does not file the joint petition within the period set forth in the statute,then the alien conditional permanent resident status automatically terminates on the second anniversary of the date the alien received that status.c a a.in a subsequent removal proceeding,the burden of proof shall be on the alien to establish compliance with the joint petition and interview requirements.c b.
hammad attempted to obtain his permanent resident status by means of the procedures described above.in,hammad was admitted to the united states as a nonimmigrant student.he married veronica fierro,a united states citizen,in.fierro submitted a petition to allow hammad to adjust his status and,on july,hammad was granted permanent resident status on a conditional basis for two years.
on may,a little over a month before hammad status was due to lapse,the couple filed a joint petition to remove the condition on hammad resident status.the couple appeared for a personal interview on august,and initially maintained that their marriage was bona fide.ins officials then interviewed hammad and fierro separately and discovered inconsistencies between their descriptions of daily life together.after an ins official confronted fierro with the serious consequences of immigration fraud,fierro admitted that the marriage had been entered into solely for immigration purposes and withdrew her support of the petition.she also signed an affidavit,dated august,stating that hammad paid her for helping him become a permanent resident and that she had never lived with him or had sexual relations with him.in light of this information,the ins served hammad with a notice to appear nta and a removal hearing was scheduled.
on june,before his removal hearing commenced,hammad filed a petition under c c,asking the ins to waive the joint petition requirement based on having been battered or the subject of extreme cruelty perpetrated by his spouse during the good faith marriage.to support his petition,hammad submitted an undated written statement,purportedly signed by fierro,which was not notarized in that undated statement,fierro retracted her prior sworn statement that her marriage to hammad was fraudulent and explained that she had lived with hammad as his wife,and had withdrawn support of the joint petition because she had felt under duress by the ins.the undated statement further explained that fierro had withdrawn support of the petition because she was angry with hammad over rumors that hammad was planning to remarry.she believed that hammad was upset with her for having another man child on october.when hammad promised to take care of her and her baby,and expressed a desire for the family to be one unit,fierro decided to come forward with the truth and reassert her wish that the ins permit hammad to become a permanent resident.
in addition to submitting the undated statement,hammad was interviewed again by the ins.at the interview,hammad explained that contrary to the statement made in his petition,he had not been subject to any mental or physical cruelty during marriage,and that he instead sought a waiver based on having entered into a good faith marriage that ended in divorce.see c b.hammad marriage had not actually ended in divorce at the time of the interview although hammad had filed for divorce,the divorce was not yet final.
on october,the ins denied hammad petition for a waiver and terminated hammad conditional resident status.in its termination letter,the ins noted that the undated statement from fierro was internally inconsistent,inconsistent with hammad testimony,and lacked specificity.among other things,the ins pointed out that the undated statement supposedly prepared by fierro asserted that hammad and fierro had a bona fide marriage and lived together as husband and wife,but also stated that fierro had a child by another man less than one year into the marital relationship.in addition,the ins noted that fierro undated statement said that hammad had promised to take care of fierro and her baby,while hammad testified in his interview with the ins that he had decided not to get back together with fierro.the ins concluded that there was evidence that hammad had engaged in marriage fraud,in violation of c because there was reason to doubt that hammad had entered into his marriage with fierro in good faith,and because hammad had failed to present objective evidence to overcome inconsistencies in the record indicating that the marriage was fraudulent,the ins denied hammad petition.
at his removal hearing in hammad requested relief from removal on the ground that the ins had erred in denying his june petition for a waiver from the joint petition requirement.the government submitted a new declaration from fierro,dated,which said that the undated statement submitted by hammad was neither written nor signed by her and,in fact,contained lies.the affidavit supported fierro story that she married for immigration purposes and never had romantic relations with hammad.in addition to proffering this new evidence,the government moved to allow fierro to testify by telephone.hammad objected because the government had not notified him about fierro proposed testimony until two days before the hearing.despite this objection,the ij granted the government request,noting that under local court rules,no notice was necessary for testimony being introduced for impeachment or rebuttal purposes.hammad then requested that the ij allow his friend,yassar dahbour,to testify as a rebuttal witness.when the ij asked if dahbour was waiting outside,hammad responded that dahbour was available to testify only by telephone,but if the ij wanted dahbour to appear in person,hammad would request a continuance.the ij allowed dahbour to appear by telephone and,therefore,denied the continuance motion.
at the hearing,fierro swore that her affidavit was truthful,and confirmed that she had never been romantically involved with hammad.she explained that she had not seen the undated statement purportedly signed by her until the government sent it to her a few months before the hearing.she noted that the undated statement contained several mistakes,such as the date and place of her daughter birth,as well as the allegation that she was angry with hammad.
hammad and his friend dahbour attempted to counter this testimony by explaining how fierro came to sign the undated statement.hammad testified first,and stated that after his attorney prepared the undated statement for fierro,he drove from his house in daly city to fierro place of work in san mateo with his friend dahbour,who was visiting from sacramento.according to hammad,after he and dahbour arrived,fierro came out of the building,read the statement,and signed it outside of the car,in view of dahbour.hammad could not remember the date these events transpired,but testified that it was during the day,a few months after his july interview.in addition,hammad was unsure whether he drove his white nissan or green toyota,and could not recall whether it was rainy or whether the undated statement was two or three pages long.
next,dahbour testified that he had accompanied hammad to san mateo to get a document signed near the end of.he guessed that hammad drove them in his car to fierro place of work in the afternoon,but could not readily recall who drove.according to dahbour,hammad called fierro on his cell phone from the car to come out from her office,which she did.to the best of dahbour recollection,fierro proceeded to open the car door and read a document while standing beside the car,but dahbour also thought that fierro may have sat down in the back seat of the car.dahbour stated that he did not read the undated statement or see fierro actually sign the document because he was looking away.instead,he just assumed that fierro signed it because he saw hammad hand fierro a pen and heard hammad say thank you when she left.
after considering all the evidence,the ij concluded that hammad had not carried his burden of proving that his marriage was entered into in good faith.according to the ij,the evidence of record does not establish that the marriage was a good faith marriage,or that it was entered into with any purpose other than for respondent to gain an immigration benefit.the ij noted the inconsistencies between hammad and fierro testimony,and also noted inconsistencies between hammad and dahbour testimony about how fierro came to sign the undated statement.the ij held that hammad had given false testimony to support his claim,and therefore was not eligible for voluntary departure.accordingly,the ij denied hammad petition to remove the condition on his resident status,denied his application for voluntary departure,and ordered hammad removed to jordan.
hammad appealed the ij july,decision to the bia,which affirmed the ij determination.the bia held that the ij did not err in concluding that hammad marriage was not bona fide under c,and also rejected hammad claim that several due process violations occurred at his hearing below because he had failed to show prejudice.finally,the bia determined that hammad failed to demonstrate that his removal would result in extreme hardship where circumstances occurring only during the period that he was admitted for permanent residence on a conditional basis can be considered.see c.
hammad raises several arguments on appeal.he first argues that the bia erred in its allocation of the burden of proof on the question whether he had entered into his marriage to fierro in good faith.because the government bears this burden of proof,according to hammad,it was the government obligation to present sufficient evidence to prove that his marriage was in bad faith.claiming that the decisions by the bia and ij were infected by this erroneous allocation of proof,he also argues that the bia erred by upholding the ij erroneous adverse credibility determination,affirming the ins denial of hammad waiver request,failing to consider whether hammad was entitled to a waiver based on extreme hardship,and ignoring due process violations at his hearing.we consider each of these arguments in turn.
hammad overarching argument is that the ij and bia erred in holding that he bore the burden of proving that his marriage was bona fide.according to hammad,b puts the burden of proof on the government to prove that his marriage was fraudulent.this is incorrect.as noted above,b applies to the situation where the ins determines that the alien qualifying marriage was improper during the period before the conditional status terminates.by its terms,is inapplicable to hammad,because the ins did not terminate hammad conditional permanent resident status until august,when hammad period had already lapsed.
the provision applicable to hammad is c,which provides that an alien conditional resident status terminates automatically when the alien and the alien citizen spouse fail to file a joint petition.we have held that when one party makes a written withdrawal of support from a joint petition,the petition is considered not to have been filed.singh holder,cir.as noted above,when the citizen fails to file the petition to remove the alien conditional status,that status terminates automatically at the end of the period,c a,and at the subsequent removal hearing,the burden of proof shall be on the alien to establish compliance with the requirements for obtaining a removal of conditional status,c b.although hammad and fierro timely filed a joint petition and appeared for an interview with the ins,fierro withdrew her support of the petition before it was adjudicated.because fierro withdrawal of her petition is equivalent to the failure to file,singh,at,hammad had the burden of establishing eligibility for a removal of the conditional status.
hammad attempted to establish this eligibility by obtaining a waiver from the joint petition requirement.see c.but again,under c,it was hammad burden to demonstrate,to the satisfaction of the attorney general,that the qualifying marriage was entered into in good faith.c see matter of mendes,bia holding that withdrawal of support for a joint petition by a petitioning spouse raises the question whether the marriage was entered into in bad faith,and therefore,the act then shifts the burden onto the alien to demonstrate that the marriage was nevertheless entered into in good faith.accordingly,the ij allo
