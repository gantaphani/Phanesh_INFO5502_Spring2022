appellant,fausto miguel,appeals his conviction and sentence under for being found in the united states without the permission of the attorney general after having previously been deported for an aggravated felony.appellant reentered the united states under an alias and was later arrested and convicted by north carolina authorities for drug trafficking.upon his release from state prison after a sentence,appellant was interviewed by federal immigration authorities.during that interview,appellant revealed his real identity and unauthorized presence in the united states.eight days later,appellant was indicted under section.appellant moved to dismiss the indictment on statute of limitations,venue,and delay grounds.after the district court denied the motion,appellant pleaded guilty and was sentenced.on appeal,appellant raises the same arguments and also challenges his sentence on fifth and sixth amendment grounds.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
appellant fausto miguel,a citizen of mexico,has been deported from the united states on at least five separate occasions in ten years,at least once after having been convicted of an aggravated felony.he unlawfully reentered the united states in and was subsequently arrested by north carolina law enforcement officials for drug trafficking in august.
the record shows that appellant used over thirty aliases during his time in the united states,including,but not limited to,francisco rios medina,francisco,efrain,jose antonio bautista cobos,victor,adolfo rios medina,ruben hureverios,and paco gomez.following his arrest in,he was prosecuted under the name francisco rios medina in wake county,which is located in the eastern district of north carolina.on january,following a trial in north carolina state court,he was sentenced to six years in state prison.
although appellant was initially incarcerated in a facility located in the eastern district of north carolina,in december he was transferred to a different facility located in the western district of north carolina where he served the remainder of his state prison term.before the transfer occurred,federal immigration authorities placed a detainer on appellant under the name francisco.the detainer,dated may,advised north carolina officials that an i nvestigation ha d been initiated to determine whether this person is subject to removal from the united states.
upon his release from state prison in the western district of north carolina on september,appellant was immediately taken into custody by the united states bureau of immigration and customs enforcement ice.in an interview with ice agents conducted that same day,appellant stated that his real name was fausto miguel,he had previously used the alias francisco rios medina,he had previously been deported,and he had not applied to the attorney general for permission to reenter the united states.appellant reiterated these statements in a sworn affidavit.ice agents processed appellant fingerprints at that time,discovering deportation orders and warrants under appellant true name,fausto miguel,as well as under the aliases francisco and efrain.it is undisputed that the federal government did not have actual knowledge of appellant presence in this country under his correct name until this time.
appellant was indicted in the western district of north carolina on september,under for being found in the united states without the permission of the attorney general after having previously been deported for an aggravated felony section provides in pertinent part 
a in general any alien who 
has been removed or has departed the united states and thereafter 
enters,attempts to enter,or is at any time found in,the united states,unless the attorney general has expressly consented 
shall be fined under title,or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
b criminal penalties for reentry of certain removed subsection a 
any alien whose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony,such alien shall be fined under such title,imprisoned not more than years,or both.
in the district court,appellant moved to dismiss the indictment,arguing that the applicable statute of limitations had run,that venue was improper,and that he was prejudiced by delay.the district court rejected appellant arguments and denied the motions to dismiss the indictment.united states,wl,at,appellant pleaded guilty without entering a plea agreement and was sentenced to months imprisonment with three years of supervised release.
appellant timely appealed his conviction,raising the same statute of limitations,venue,and delay claims raised in the district court below.he also raised a new claim that his sentencing violated his rights under the fifth and sixth amendments because he was sentenced based on past convictions that were neither admitted by him nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
we have jurisdiction under.appellant arguments turn on questions of law,which we review de novo.united states woolfolk,cir.we address appellant arguments in turn.
the parties do not dispute that the applicable statute of limitations is five years appellant argues that the statute of limitations began running on january,when he entered the custody of the state of north carolina.appellant br.at.he contends that a t that point,he had been found by authorities as required to establish a violation of.id.he notes that at or by this date,he had given his name as miguel in state court and had testified in that forum as to his illegal status in the united states.he further emphasizes that he was in the exclusive control of government authorities and had been fingerprinted.id.at.
to support his statute of limitations argument,appellant relies heavily on united states gomez,cir,which concerned an illegal alien who had been deported under the alias rodrigo rojas gomez,but whose real name was javier dario gomez.when gomez was deported as rodrigo rojas gomez,the ins file under that name contained a social security number and fingerprints.gomez reentered the united states surreptitiously and presented himself at an ins legalization office to apply for temporary resident status.in the application,he provided his real name,his fingerprints,and the false social security number connected with the alias rodrigo rojas gomez.the ins granted him temporary resident alien status,which was later adjusted to permanent resident alien status.when gomez was arrested several years later in connection with a jewelry theft,an fbi and ins fingerprint analysis revealed that javier dario gomez and rodrigo rojas gomez were the same person.five years and four days after gomez had initially presented himself to the ins legalization office,the ins filed an indictment charging gomez with violating.under these circumstances,the gomez court found that the limitations period had expired by the time the indictment was filed,noting that federal immigration authorities had possesse d all the necessary information to determine gomez identity and illegal status,but negligently fail ed to act upon it for over five years.id.at.the gomez court held that the statute of limitations for a found in violation should begin running when immigration authorities could have,through the exercise of diligence typical of law enforcement authorities,discovered the violation.id.at.
in addition to gomez,appellant cites cases from the second,fifth,and tenth circuits for the proposition that for an alien to be found,the government must have knowledge of the illegality of his presence,through the exercise of diligence typical of law enforcement authorities.united states,cir quoting united states,cir citing,at.appellant argues that in his case,had governmental authorities used reasonable diligence,they would have found him at the time he was incarcerated in state prison.appellant br.at.he points out that north carolina correctional authorities had a system in place for notifying ice officials of inmates believed to be in the country illegally.id.he also emphasizes that the north carolina department of corrections maintained a website that provided the name of francisco rios medina,a state identification number,and an fbi identification number.these state and fbi identification numbers appear on the fbi criminal history report for fausto,which also includes a north carolina conviction under the name francisco rios medina.appellant argues that i mmigration authorities had access to his fbi and state identification numbers and they could have run them through the fbi database at any time,which would have revealed appellant name,his alias of francisco rios medina,and his illegal immigration status.appellant br.at.appellant contends that ice failure to do so does not demonstrate the level of diligence typical of law enforcement authorities and that the limitations period began running on january,the date of his state incarceration.id.
appellant argument that the limitations period began running on january,is unpersuasive for several reasons.at the outset,we note that appellant cites no evidence in the record showing that on january,federal immigration authorities were aware of his identity and illegal presence in the united states.as appellant correctly points out,courts interpreting section have held that a previously deported alien is found in the united states when his physical presence is discovered and noted by the immigration authorities.united states,cir quotations and citations omitted see also united states almendarez,cir unpublished o ther courts have held that an alien is found when immigration authorities discover his presence in the united states,determine that his presence is illegal,and ascertain that he has reentered after a previous deportation.citations omitted.appellant provides no evidence showing that on january,federal immigration authorities were aware of his actual identity,his presence in the united states,or his illegal immigration status.he can only show that state authorities were aware of his an he points to no cases in which courts have held that an alien is found in the united states in violation of section when state,rather than federal officials,take the alien into custody.in fact,courts have uniformly declined to find that state officials knowledge of an alien illegal presence in the united states may be imputed to federal immigration authorities to trigger the limitations period.see,united states clarke,cir collecting cases and holding that t o the extent that the alien contends that the knowledge of florida police can be imputed to the ins and therefore is sufficient to start the running of the statute of limitations,we reject this argument.
contrary to appellant argument that when he was incarcerated by state officials he was in the custody of governmental authorities and therefore found under section,courts have routinely held that an alien is found in the united states only when federal,not state,immigration officials become aware of the alien presence and illegal status.in united states,cir,an alien reentered the united states illegally and was eventually arrested and convicted in texas state court for the offense of injury to a child.while serving his state sentence,an ins agent interviewed him.the fifth circuit held that the alien was found in the united states on the date the ins agent interviewed him,and not when the alien was arrested and convicted by state law enforcement authorities.i n instances where the deported alien surreptitiously enters the country,and is later discovered by the ins,the statute of limitations does not begin to run until his presence as well as the illegal status of that presence is discovered by the ins.at citations omitted emphasis added.similarly,in united states mercedes,cir,an alien illegally reentered the united states in and was arrested by the new york city police department on a state homicide charge in.while he was awaiting his sentencing,the ins first learned of his presence in the united states in when they interviewed him at a state correctional facility.the second circuit rejected the alien contention that the ins could have discovered his illegal presence in the country after his arrest,when state authorities took his fingerprints and generated a rap sheet on him.the mercedes court noted that if any authority was on notice of the alien illegal presence in the united states in,it was the new york state department of corrections,not the ins.id.at.the court refused to adopt a rule that would make the ins responsible for any information discovered in state investigations of the hundreds of thousands of prisoners in state custody at any given time.id.because appellant points to no evidence showing that federal immigration authorities were aware of his identity and illegal presence in the united states when he was incarcerated in state prison on january,we reject his argument that on that date he had been found by authorities as required to establish a violation of.appellant br.at.
appellant also relies on gomez and a theory of constructive knowledge to support his statute of limitations argument.his arguments are unavailing in this case for several reasons.
first,we note that the plain text of section does not support a theory of constructive knowledge.an alien violates when the alien is at any time found in the united states not when the alien is found or should have been found in the country,as appellant argues.the seventh circuit has already rejected a theory of constructive knowledge under section,finding that when the government should have discovered a deportee illegal presence in the united states is irrelevant to when the statute of limitations begins to run.united states gordon,cir citations omitted.the gordon court reasoned that to be found in the united states means to be present in the united states without permission after deportation the immigration agency discovery of the alien whether actual or constructive is not an element of the offense.id.at.because the alien remains illegally present in the united states,the gordon court interpreted the found in violation of section to be a continuing offense,such that t he limitations clock does not run during this period.id.at citation and quotation marks omitted.because the found in version of a is a continuing offense,the date on which the immigration agency should have discovered the alien is simply irrelevant.id.citation and quotation marks omitted.like the gordon court,we are reluctant to read a gloss onto section that the text of the statute does not itself support.
second,even if section does countenance a theory of constructive knowledge,we conclude,consistently with other circuit courts,that such a theory does not benefit appellant.notably,appellant cites no case in which a court has found that federal immigration authorities had constructive knowledge of an alien illegal presence in the united states when the alien concealed his identity through the use of an alias.although the theory of constructive knowledge imposes upon federal immigration officials a duty to exercise diligence typical of law enforcement authorities in ascertaining an alien immigration status,see united states,cir,courts have declined to apply such a theory to find that federal immigration officials failed to act with the requisite diligence when the alien has affirmatively concealed his true identity with an alias.
in,for example,the tenth circuit acknowledged the availability of a constructive knowledge theory under section,but nevertheless affirmed the district court determination that federal immigration authorities had found an alien only when an ins agent identified him as a previously deported alien,and not at an earlier point when state police arrested him,took his fingerprints,and submitted them to the fbi.at.the court noted that federal immigration officials can not discover information about an alien giving a false name unless they check multiple computer indexes,and that if the alien uses a new alias,the indexes will not yield any information about him.id.at.under these circumstances,the court refused to find that federal immigration officials had constructive knowledge of the alien illegal presence in the united states when state officials submitted his fingerprints to the fbi.see id.at declining to impose on immig
