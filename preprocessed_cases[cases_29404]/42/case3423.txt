the pertinent facts are as follows mendoza pablo is a member of the mam mayan group,an indigenous ethnic group whose members live predominantly in guatemala.his family originally hailed from the village of todos santos.in,when mendoza pablo was born,the guatemalan government was engaged in a fierce and largely civil war with insurgent groups predominantly of mayan ethnicity.in jorge tzoc gonzales,cir,the second circuit,citing the report of the commission for historical clarification which was established by the june,oslo accord as part of the united peace process,described this conflict as follows 
of the identified victims of the violence were mayan and state forces and related paramilitary groups were responsible for of documented human rights violations t hroughout the armed confrontation the guatemalan government designed and implemented a strategy to provoke terror in the population mayans as a group were identified by the army as guerrilla allies leading to massacres,scorched earth operations,forced disappearances and executions 
during this conflict,the guatemalan government,regarding the entire civilian population of many villages as members of guerrilla groups,sought to physically eliminat e all the people residing in those villages,including children.see guatemala never again the official report of the human rights office,archdiocese of guatemala,at greta tovar siebentritt,trans.at some point in,when mendoza pablo mother was eight months pregnant with him,guatemalan government soldiers,having accused the residents of todos santos of aiding the guerrillas,burned the village to the ground,massacring many of the village inhabitants in the process.though mendoza pablo immediate family,along with some other villagers,escaped the attack by hiding in the mountains,his paternal grandparents and two aunts were killed when government soldiers locked them in their homes and burned them alive.outside observers have estimated that i n todos santos the town sixty to eighty people were killed in and t he army also burned an estimated or more houses.
very shortly thereafter,mendoza pablo was born,several weeks premature.food was scarce in the mountains and mendoza pablo mother,unable to breast feed,sought to nourish him with tea made from wild herbs.when he was roughly three months old,mendoza pablo family decided that,in light of the foregoing events,remaining in guatemala posed a danger to their lives.accordingly,the family traveled to mexico,where,however,they did not have lawful status,as a result of which mendoza pablo was unable to attend school and had difficulty obtaining employment.in addition,mendoza pablo was often sick and frequently had nightmares eventually,in september,mendoza pablo entered the united states illegally.
in due course,the government sought mendoza pablo removal,and on may,mendoza pablo appeared before an ij without counsel,and was granted a continuance of removal proceedings to obtain legal representation.on october,he filed with the department of homeland security dhs an application for asylum,of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.after the ij granted two additional continuances to allow for attorney preparation,for the resolution of a pending freedom of information act request,and for mendoza pablo to retain new counsel on july,mendoza pablo appeared before the ij and renewed his applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection.on march,four days before the scheduled merits hearing on those applications,counsel for mendoza pablo filed a motion to continue the proceedings so as to allow time for a psychological evaluation of mendoza pablo,which had not yet been completed because of scheduling and monetary restraints.the ij denied the request,ruling that no good cause ha d been established for a continuance.
on march,after a merits hearing,the ij denied mendoza pablo applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection.the ij found mendoza pablo credible in all respects,but held that the substance of his testimony was insufficient to meet his burden of establishing past persecution.specifically,the ij held that mendoza pablo had not been persecuted because he had never personally witnessed any atrocities and he was never personally challenged or confronted by the guatemalan military forces that attacked todos santos.the ij further emphasized that mendoza pablo had not adduced any evidence from a professional standpoint that he had suffered psychologically as a result of his childhood experiences.finally,the ij stated that the attack on todos santos and the resultant deaths of mendoza pablo extended family members could not constitute persecution when the event s happened during the civil war in guatemala.
mendoza pablo appealed the ij decision to the bia,which,by order dated august,affirmed the ij decision.specifically,the bia held that mendoza pablo second hand exposure to the civil war in guatemala was insufficient to establish past persecution because he did not personally endure or witness the atrocities perpetrated by the guatemalan government against his family and ancestral village.further,the bia agreed that mendoza pablo testimony as to any emotional harm he suffered as a result of his childhood experiences was insufficient to constitute past persecution without expert or objective evidence that he presently suffers from a psychological disorder stemming from those experiences the instant petition for review followed.
