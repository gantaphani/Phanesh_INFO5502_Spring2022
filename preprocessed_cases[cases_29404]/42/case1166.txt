opinion of the court 
patricia flores,a native and citizen of guatemala,seeks review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia that found her ineligible for withholding of removal because she had been convicted of a particularly serious crime namely,she was convicted of accessory after the fact in south carolina for witnessing,but failing to report,a murder.flores now petitions for review,contending that her south carolina conviction does not constitute a particularly serious crime under our decision in denis attorney general,and that she should therefore be eligible for withholding of removal.we agree.because flores south carolina conviction is not an offense relating to obstruction of justice,it can not be considered either an aggravated felony or a particularly serious crime under the immigration and nationality act ina.accordingly,flores is eligible for withholding of removal.
flores,a guatemalan native,originally entered the united states with her husband to escape her abusive father.although her husband traveled with a visa,she entered the country illegally.the two had a daughter together,but subsequently divorced,and flores entered various relationships with other men and women.
according to the record on appeal,flores traveled to south carolina to visit family in late.while there,she struck up a relationship with a young man,fredy sibrian.unfortunately,this relationship soon deteriorated as sibrian became increasingly violent,jealous and possessive,causing flores to leave sibrian she then traveled to north carolina,where she met,and started dating,another man,antonio perez.when flores subsequently returned to south carolina with perez in april,sibrian confronted them at a gas station,causing a heated exchange that ended when sibrian shot and killed perez.according to flores,she did not immediately report the murder because sibrian threatened to kill her and her daughter if she disclosed sibrian actions to the police.fearing sibrian retribution,flores returned to north carolina,but she was later arrested and sent back to south carolina,where she was charged with perez murder.
flores eventually pleaded guilty to accessory after the fact under south carolina law and was sentenced to five years imprisonment.according to flores testimony,which the immigration judge ij found credible,she pleaded guilty to accessory after the fact because she failed to report the murder to police.the record does not reflect that flores covered up the homicide,lied to police or prosecutors,or assisted the shooter in any way.
after serving about two years of her prison term,flores was removed to guatemala.a few months later,however,she the united states illegally.in,following her arrest for prostitution,flores was detained by immigration and customs enforcement.during an asylum interview,she stated that she feared returning to guatemala because her father,who had physically and sexually abused her as a child,wanted to kill her she had been raped by members of a local gang immediately following her previous removal to guatemala and she feared that she would be persecuted because she is a lesbian.the asylum officer determined that flores had a reasonable fear of persecution.
the case was referred to the immigration court where flores filed an application for withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture cat.the ij made two primary findings with respect to flores.first,the ij found that flores conviction for accessory after the fact was a particularly serious crime under the ina,rendering her ineligible for withholding of removal.second,the ij found that flores failed to adequately establish that she would,more likely than not,be subjected to torture in guatemala,as required to obtain relief under cat.flores then appealed to the bia.
the bia dismissed the appeal and affirmed the ij decision on both grounds.first,relying on its own decisions and our holding in denis the bia concluded that flores conviction relat es to obstruction of justice,and therefore constitutes a particularly serious crime.the bia also concluded that flores had not meaningfully challenged the denial of her cat claim because she failed to produce any purported new evidence in support of her position.
flores now petitions for review of two bia determinations that her conviction is a particularly serious crime rendering her ineligible for withholding of removal and that she did not meaningfully challenge the denial of her cat claim we address each in turn.
the ina provides that the attorney general may not remove an alien to a country if the attorney general decides that the alien life or freedom would be threatened in that country.however,such withholding of removal is unavailable if the alien committed a particularly serious crime because,in such a case,the alien is considered a danger to the community of the united states.a particularly serious crime,under the ina,includes crimes that are considered aggravated felon ies for which the alien received a prison sentence of at least five years the ina list of aggravated felonies,in turn,includes descriptions of various offenses,including,as relevant here,offense s relating to obstruction of justice,perjury or subornation of perjury,or bribery of a witness the obstruction provision because flores was sentenced to five years for her conviction,the question before us is straightforward is accessory after the fact relat ed to obstruction of justice we now answer that question in the negative.
our inquiry starts,as it must,with our decision in denis.there,we examined whether an alien prior new york conviction for tampering with evidence was an offense relating to obstruction of justice.in doing so,we first explained that we apply the categorical approach of statutory interpretation in determining whether a state conviction constitutes an aggravated felony and thus a particularly serious crime under the ina this approach involves a comparison between the statute of the alien prior conviction and the relevant federal crime listed as an aggravated felony,without regard to the underlying facts of the petitioner offense if the elements of the alien statute of conviction are broader than the elements of the aggravated felony crime,then the crime of conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony.if,however,the elements of the statute of conviction are the same or narrower than the elements of the aggravated felony crime,then the crime of conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony 
importantly,unlike other contexts,denis makes clear that,when applying the categorical approach,we do not strictly compare the elements of the statute of conviction to the elements of the obstruction provision referenced offenses instead,we apply a looser categorical approach in light of the obstruction provision statutory text,which states that aggravated felonies include any offense relating to obstruction of justice.thus,rather than ascertaining whether the elements of a prior crime of conviction match the elements of a generic federal offense with precision,we must only decide that the prior conviction relates to the offense criminalized by the obstruction provision,namely,obstruction of justice.in other words,we survey the interrelationship between the crime committed and the relevant obstruction statute,and apply the phrase relating to broadly,seeking a logical or causal connection.as the prime example of this causal connection,we remarked that section b,which criminalizes the knowing exchange of stolen or forged treasury instruments,is related to forgery,even though it lacks the essential element of an intent to defraud or deceive similarly,we noted that a conviction for trafficking in counterfeit items constitutes an aggravated felony relating to counterfeiting in light of the connection between these two offenses 
with those principles in mind,we then turned to denis prior new york conviction for tampering with evidence.in reviewing the obstruction provision,we explained that title of the code contains a listing of crimes entitled obstruction of justice,permitting us to easily determine the types of conduct congress intended the phrase to encompass.looking at that section of the code chapter,to be precise we noted that and c were most relevant to denis conduct section prohibits a person from corruptly or by threats or force influenc ing,obstruct ing,or imped ing,or endeavor ing to influence,obstruct or impede,the due administration of justice.we explained that denis conviction for tampering bears a close resemblance to the federal obstruction of justice offense defined in section because b oth denis crime of conviction and the obstruction provision,by their terms,proscribe any behavior that entails the use of force in an effort to impede or obstruct an official proceeding,such as through evidence tampering.likewise,c prohibits the alteration,destruction,mutilation,or concealment of any object that would impair the object integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding.section c focus on destroying or mutilating evidentiary items in anticipation of their potential production in a prospective proceeding,we observed,is directly analogous,and thus,logically connected to denis state crime of conviction.accordingly,we held that new york offense relat es to obstruction of justice as defined in and c,and therefore constituted an aggravated felony within the meaning of the ina 
the government construes denis expansively,seeking to extend that decision beyond its central holding in an effort to reach flores conviction specifically,the government argues that we may use the federal statute,as a suitable basis with which to compare flores conviction,rather than the statutes in chapter and even setting aside the federal statute,flores conviction is connected to a broad notion of obstruction of justice and therefore falls within the obstruction provision purview.we reject both contentions.
the government first claims that we may look beyond chapter and compare flores conviction to the federal statute,in order to determine whether her offense relat es to obstruction of justice.given the similarities between and south carolina accessory after the fact,the government argues,flores prior conviction constitutes obstruction of justice within the meaning of the ina this argument is unavailing for three reasons.
first,denis straightforwardly tells us that we review chapter to determine whether an alien prior offense relat es to obstruction of justice.in that case,we scrutinized the obstruction provision and explicitly stated that we were e xamining the alien crime of conviction in relation to the federal obstruction of justice offenses codified in section et,chapter.nothing in denis remotely suggested searching the code to discover other offenses that might qualify as crimes.
second,the text of the obstruction provision indicates congress intention to reference chapter and not,as the government contends.the obstruction provision facially encompasses all offense s relating to obstruction of justice,perjury or subornation of perjury,or bribery of a witness.importantly,both perjury and subornation of perjury and bribery of a witness reference specific chapters of title and,indeed,specific offenses codified therein the first phrase in the list,obstruction of justice,seems to follow this same pattern while it is not tied to any specific statute,it is identical to the title of chapter,labeled obstruction of justice.as the supreme court has recognized,t itles can be useful devices to resolve doubt about the meaning of a statute,especially where,as here,other aspects of the statute indicate the same result given congress linking of the textually adjacent terms perjury and subornation of perjury and bribery of a witness with their respective chapters,it seems odd that congress would not similarly link the first term in the list,obstruction of justice,with its identically named chapter.we therefore do not believe congress engaged in such tortuous drafting.
third and relatedly,congress codified its own statute at,but it placed that statute outside the provisions related to obstruction of justice if congress considered an offense,it presumably would have placed that statute in chapter,entitled obstruction of justice,or referenced in the obstruction provision.it did neither.
thus,we decline the government invitation to look at the federal offense,in determining whether flores offense relat es to obstruction of justice.
the government also argues that,even setting aside,flores conviction is connected to a broad notion of obstruction of justice and therefore falls within the obstruction provision purview this argument raises a broader question how close a connection is required between an alien prior offense and obstruction of justice such that the former may be considered relating to obstruction of justice we answered that question in denis and we reiterate that holding today an analysis of specific statutes must be employed to determine whether a logical or causal connection exists between an alien prior offense and a chapter offense.
our case law identifies a spectrum of possible connections that may be made between an alien prior offense and some federal offense.on one end of the spectrum,we could require a precise match between the elements of alien prior offense and the elements of one specific federal offense.we rejected this approach in park,where we faced the question of whether an alien prior offense for trafficking counterfeited goods under was an aggravated felony relating to counterfeiting.the alien sought to compare his conviction with one particular statute,which criminalizes falsely making,forging,counterfeiting,or altering any obligation or other security of the united states with intent to defraud.but we precluded such an analysis,noting that the ina description of offenses relating to counterfeiting required us to look beyond one statute and instead examine a class of criminal statutes related to counterfeiting 
on the other end of the spectrum,we could,as the government urges,merely require some connection to broad notions derived from federal offenses.but this approach was rejected by denis and would otherwise engender uncertainty among those tasked with applying it.indeed,the ninth circuit rejected a similar interpretation of the obstruction provision in valenzuela gallardo lynch that case confronted a new bia explanation of the obstruction provision,which stated that,to qualify as an aggravated felony,convictions must only involve the affirmative and intentional attempt,motivated by a specific intent,to interfere with the process of justice,regardless of the existence of an ongoing investigation or proceeding the ninth circuit declined to follow this interpretation because it raises serious constitutional concerns about whether the statute is unconstitutionally vague.specifically,the court found that this construction leaves grave uncertainty about the plethora of steps before and after an ongoing criminal investigation or trial that comprise the process of justice,and,hence,uncertainty about which crimes constitute obstruction of justice.while the ninth circuit decision is not wholly applicable to our case its point is well taken adopting a construction of the obstruction provision that reaches unknowable offenses based on broad notion s of obstruction of justice causes confusion for courts,puzzlement for practitioners,and incomprehension for immigrants 
recognizing these concerns,denis adopted a categorical approach somewhere in the middle of the spectrum while w e need not determine the precise degree of similarity between the elements of an alien offense and a listed federal crime,we must survey the interrelationship between the two statutory provisions and apply the phrase relating to broadly,seeking a logical or causal connection.this requirement of a logical or causal connection is derived from bobb where we adopted the dictionary definition of relate,which means to show or establish a logical or causal connection between.in bobb,and again in denis,we stressed the causality prong of this definition,explaining by way of example that the knowing exchange of stolen or forged treasury instruments is relat ed to forgery because,but for the forged endorsement,there would be no criminal offense.for similar reasons,we found in park that a conviction for trafficking in counterfeit items constituted an aggravated felony relating to counterfeiting.therefore,a causal connection requires a link between the alien offense and a listed federal crime without the listed federal offense,the alien offense could not have occurred.
a logical connection is also defined by denis.there,we stated that the offense codified at c which prohibits corruptly alter ing,destroy ing,mutilate ing,or conceal ing a record,document,or other object with the intent to impair the object integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding was directly analogous,and thus,logically connected to new york tampering statute because both statues focus on destroying or mutilating evidentiary items in anticipation of their potential production in a prospective proceeding.so while the new york statute in denis and c are not a perfect match in terms of prohibited conduct,denis makes clear that the obstruction provision does not require a precise matching of elements given its reference to offenses relating to obstruction of justice.it is enough that the two crimes target the same,core criminal conduct such that they are directly analogous.
accordingly,we reject the government position and reaffirm denis central holding to determine whether a petitioner prior offense constitutes an aggravated felony relating to obstruction of justice,we apply a categorical approach,seeking a logical or causal connection between an alien offense and a relevant chapter offense.logical means that both an alien statute of conviction and a chapter statute are directly analogous causal means that,but for a chapter offense,the alien offense could not have occurred.
applying this framework reveals that flores conviction is not relat ed to obstruction of justice.in south carolina,accessory after the fact occurs where the defendant,knowing that a principal has committed a felony,harbor s or assist s the principal felon for the purpose of enabling the principal felon to escape detection or arrest.we must compare this south carolina offense to the federal obstruction offenses listed in chapter to determine whether flores conviction is relat ed to obstruction of justice.of those offenses,only and c contain language that could arguably encompass accessory after the fact.
section a includes a catchall provision prohibiting a person from corruptly or by threats or force influenc ing,obstruct ing,or imped ing,or endeavor ing to influence,obstruct or impede,the due administration of justice.in denis,we explained that a new york statute prohibiting intentionally tampering with physical evidence to prevent its use in an official proceeding was sufficiently connected to to constitute an aggravated felony because both statutes by their terms,proscribe any behavior that entails the use of force in an effort to impede or obstruct an official proceeding,such as through evidence tampering.
but flores conviction does not bear this same type of resemblance to and it is therefore not logically or causally connected to accessory after the fact.with respect to a logical connection,both the mens rea corruptly or by threats or force and actus reus influence,obstruct or impede the due administration of justice of focus on a defendant intent and actions with respect to the due administration of justice.the due administration of justice,we have held,refers to a judicial proceeding,and not some ancillary proceeding,distinct from a judicial proceeding such as an investigation independent of the court authority.in stark contrast,the mens rea intending the principal felon to escape detection or arrest and actus reus harbor ing or assist ing the principal felon of flores south carolina offense focus not on a defendant intent and actions regarding a particular judicial proceeding,but on the principal of a crime put another way,these two offenses target completely different criminal conduct.indeed,there are infinite actions a defendant may undertake with the intent to aid the principal after the commission of a crime,but before the commencement of judicial proceedings,none of which would constitute a violation of,and all of which could constitute accessory after the fact so while denis makes clear that the elements of an alien offense and a chapter offense need not match precisely to fall within the obstruction provision they must be directly analogous such that a logical connection exists.in light of the widely divergent elements between accessory after the fact and,however,we find no such connection here 
with respect to a causal connection,flores offense does not form the basis of a conviction,and a offense does not form the basis of an conviction.as discussed,these crimes are independent one may be convicted under without ever aiding a principal felon,and one may be convicted of south carolina accessory after the fact without ever interfering with a judicial proceeding.thus,no causal connection exists.
a similar analysis applies to c.that provision makes conduct criminal where one corruptly otherwise obstructs,influences,or impedes any official proceeding,or attempts to do so.we did not address c in denis,but we stated that c which prohibits corruptly alter ing,destroy ing,mutilat ing,or conceal ing a record,document,or other object with the intent to impair the object integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding is directly analogous,and thus,logically connected to new york tampering statute because both statues focus on destroying or mutilating evidentiary items in anticipation of their potential production in a prospective proceeding.
the same can not be said of flores fact conviction and c.as a threshold matter,c references any official proceeding,not a judicial proceeding or the the due administration of justice as in.however,this difference is immaterial under united states tyler,which held that in any prosecution brought under a provision charging obstruction of justice involving an official proceeding,the government is required to prove a nexus between the defendant conduct and a particular official proceeding before a judge or court of the united states that the defendant contemplated.section c which involves any official proceeding clearly falls under our holding in tyler and,therefore,we apply a nexus requirement to c 
with c nexus requirement in mind,our analysis of this statute closely mirrors our analysis of,as c is neither logically nor causally connected to accessory after the fact.with respect to a logical connection,both the mens rea corruptly and actus reus obstruct,influence,or impede any official proceeding of c focus on a defendant intent and actions concerning a judicial proceeding.as noted previously,accessory after the fact,in contrast,contains mens rea and actus reus elements directed toward a defendant intent and actions regarding the principal of a crime,not a judicial proceeding.accordingly,as with,the widely divergent elements between accessory after the fact and c demonstrate that no logical connection exists.
likewise,no causal connection exists between accessory after the fact and c flores offense does not form the basis of a c conviction,and a c offense does not form the basis of an conviction.thus,like,no causal connection exists.
our conclusion that the obstruction provision does not capture flores south carolina conviction is further bolstered by a straightforward review of the obstruction provision statutory text and legislative history.indeed,at bottom,the categorical approach conducted today is merely a tool of statutory interpretation used to avoid the practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach when analyzing prior convictions the categorical approach is not talismanic it does not eclipse or alter our other methods of statutory interpretation.as always,our primary purpose in statutory interpretation is to discern legislative intent.
the obstruction provision,on its face,includes all offense s relating to obstruction of justice,perjury or subornation of perjury,or bribery of a witness.the term obstruction of justice is not alone,but listed in conjunction with perjury or subornation of perjury and bribery of a witness.t his informs our understanding of congress intended interpretation of obstruction of justice.so while obstruction of justice may,at its most expansive,be taken to include offenses wholly divorced from any judicial proceeding the other offenses listed therewith perjury or subornation of perjury and bribery of a witness relate only to conduct that impedes a judicial proceeding under such circumstances,the noscitur a sociis canon counsels toward a narrower definition of obstruction of justice that does not reach conduct unmoored from judicial proceedings.
moreover,in adding certain categories of offenses,like the obstruction provision,to the list of aggravated felonies in,congress made an effort to ensure that the overall reach of the definition would be consistent with the sentencing guidelines.specifically,w ith only certain limited exceptions,congress attempted to ensure that all of the crimes defined as aggravated felonies carry a base offense level of at least,in order to ensure that only the most serious crimes render the alien deportable.but in the united states sentencing guidelines of the time,obstruction of justice had a base offense level of while accessory after the fact had a base offense level as low as this lends further support to the proposition that congress did not intend offenses to be considered aggravated felonies 
consistent with denis categorical approach,and our review of the relevant statutory text and legislative history,we conclude that flores south carolina conviction is not an offense relating to obstruction of justice and therefore constitutes neither an aggravated felony nor a particularly serious crime under the ina.she is therefore eligible for withholding of removal.
flores also seeks review of the bia denial of her cat application.an applicant for cat relief must show that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if she were removed to her home country and that such torture would be inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official before both the ij and the bia,flores asserted that it was more likely than not that she would face torture if removed.before the bia,flores also stated that she obtained new evidence that her father sought to murder her.but the bia observed that she never provided this new evidence and concluded that she failed to meaningfully challenge the ij denial of her application for cat relief 
in this appeal,flores does not meaningfully dispute the bia conclusion that she failed to appeal the ij ruling on her cat claim as a result,she did not exhaust her cat claim,and we therefore lack jurisdiction to review it 
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that flores accessory after the fact conviction is not a particularly serious crime within the meaning of the ina and she is therefore eligible for withholding of removal.we also conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review flores cat claim.accordingly,flores petition is granted in part and dismissed in part,the bia decision is vacated in part,and the case will be remanded to the bia for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
i agree with my colleagues that we lack jurisdiction to review patricia flores petition for relief under the convention against torture cat because she did not dispute the board of immigration appeals bia finding that she failed to meaningfully challenge the immigration judge ij ruling.however,i part company with my colleagues conclusion that a conviction under south carolina accessory after the fact statute does not constitute an aggravated felony.applying the framework set forth in denis attorney general,cir,i believe we are required to conclude that south carolina accessory after the fact offense is related to obstruction of justice,and it therefore qualifies as an aggravated felony under a s.as a result,flores is not entitled to withholding of removal.
the immigration and nationality act ina provides a list of offenses that are considered aggravated felonies.a.to determine whether a state conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under the ina,we presumptively apply the formal categorical approach.ng att y,cir.under this approach,we look at the elements of the crime to determine whether it falls within a category enumerated in the ina id.at.in general,i f the elements of the aggravated felony generic crimes enumerated in the federal statute are the same as or broader than the elements of the specific criminal statute of conviction,then the specific crime of conviction categorically qualifies as an aggravated felony.denis,at.
one category of aggravated felony under the ina is an offense relating to obstruction of justice for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.a s.in denis,we observed that the phrase relating to must be read expansively and encompass es crimes other than those specifically listed in the federal statutes.denis,at citations omitted see also yong wong park att y,cir.noting that the supreme court has defined relating to as to stand in some relation to have bearing or concern to pertain refer to bring into association with or connection with quoting morales trans world airlines,internal quotation marks omitted.mindful of congress word choice,the denis court held that in deciding whether a conviction is related to another offense crimes of conviction can be related to a listed offense without containing what might be viewed as an essential element.denis,at.thus,under denis,the elements of the federal statute and the crime of conviction need not match for the latter to relate to obstruction of justice.see id.at stating that t o give effect to congress choice of language,a categorical matching of the elements of the offense of conviction with the elements of a federal law can not be the sole test for determining whether a crime of conviction relates to a generic federal offense.rather,a logical or causal connection may suffice to make the separate crimes related.id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also id.at w e will survey the interrelationship between the two statutory provisions and apply the phrase relating to broadly,seeking a logical or causal connection.second alteration in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted.therefore,our task is to determine whether the state offense is logically or causally connected with the generic federal obstruction of justice offense 
chapter of title of the united states code is entitled obstruction of justice and contains more than twenty different offenses most applicable here is,which provides that w hoever corruptly,or by threats or force,endeavors to influence,obstruct,or impede,the due administration of justice shall be imprisoned if the obstruction does not involve a killing or attempted killing not more than ten years.
we have held that obstruction of the due administration of justice under requires an ongoing judicial proceeding.united states davis,cir.denis makes clear,however,that the elements of the crime of conviction and the federal offense need not precisely match for the conduct to be logically or causally connected to obstruction of justice.see denis,at stating that a s inclusion of the words relating to obstruction of justice makes the provision more descriptive in nature and,thus,slightly more expansive.r ather than ascertaining whether the elements of a state crime of conviction match the elements of the generic federal offense with precision,we must only decide that the state conviction relates to the offense criminalized by a s,namely,obstruction of justice.thus,my colleagues focus on the individual elements of and,in particular,the element that requires proof of an ongoing judicial proceeding is inconsistent with denis.indeed,in denis we explicitly rejected the argument that a crime of conviction must require an ongoing judicial proceeding in order to relate to obstruction of justice.there,we reviewed the elements of the new york state evidence tampering statute and concluded that it related to the offense set forth in because both statutes proscribe any behavior that entails the use of force in an effort to impede or obstruct an official proceeding,such as through evidence tampering.id.at footnote omitted.we explained that,although the new york statute applied regardless of whether the conduct interfered with a judicial proceeding or a police investigation,and only pertains to obstruction of judicial proceedings,this distinction does not defeat our relating to analysis because our approach does not depend upon matching the elements of the state crime of conviction with the elements of.id.at citations omitted instead,we only consider ed the provision to identify the nature of offenses classified as obstruction of justice under federal law for purposes of conducting the relating to examination.id.
with this in mind,i conclude that the absence of a pending judicial proceeding requirement does not mean south carolina accessory after the fact crime is unrelated to obstruction of justice.under south carolina law,the crime of accessory after the fact may be committed where the defendant,knowing the principal committed a felony,harbor s or assist s the principal felon for the purpose of enabling the principal felon to escape detection or arrest.state legette,citations omitted such an offense impedes law enforcement efforts to apprehend wrongdoers and prevents courts and juries from considering criminal charges against them.given that the purpose of the accessory after the fact offense is to help the principal avoid facing justice before a court,this conduct is related to obstructing the due administration of justice indeed,our court and others have recognized that accessory after the fact is,by definition,an obstruction of justice.see gov t of aquino,cir.an accessory after the fact is one who,knowing that a crime has been committed,obstructs justice by giving comfort or assistance to the offender in order to hinder or prevent his apprehension or punishment.see also united states brenson,cir.the gist of being an accessory after the fact lies essentially in obstructing justice by rendering assistance to hinder or prevent the arrest of the offender after he has committed the crime.citation and internal quotation marks omitted united states brown,cir.same united states willis,cir.same united states barlow,cir.same 
for these reasons,denis requires us to conclude that flores conviction for accessory after the fact under south carolina law is related to the obstruction of justice,and that the bia appropriately designated flores as an aggravated felon.because flores committed an aggravated felony for which she was sentenced to five years imprisonment,she has committed a particularly serious crime and is ineligible for withholding of removal.b b.
for the foregoing reasons,i join my colleagues in dismissing flores cat claim for lack of jurisdiction,but under denis i would be compelled to deny her petition for review of her application for withholding of removal.
