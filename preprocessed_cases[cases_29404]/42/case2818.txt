the question before the en banc court is whether this court has jurisdiction over a petition for review filed by marekegn asfaw tamenut challenging the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia not to reopen sua sponte proceedings relating to tamenut removal from the united states.we conclude that the decision whether to reopen removal proceedings sua sponte is committed to the bia discretion by law,a,and that we lack jurisdiction to review the agency discretionary decision.we therefore dismiss the petition for review.

this court has jurisdiction to review all final orders of removal.a,b.although the statute does not mention orders denying motions to reopen or reconsider,we have held that the grant of jurisdiction extends to review of these decisions.see esenwah ashcroft,cir de jimenez ashcroft,cir.we adopted the view of the seventh circuit that congress has not clearly expressed an intent to depart from the long line of supreme court and appellate court decisions interpreting order of deportation to include orders denying motions to reconsider and reopen.see id.at quoting chow ins,cir.in considering the scope of a,we do not perceive a material difference between the bia decision to deny a party motion to reopen and the bia decision to refuse a party request that the agency reopen proceedings on its own motion.thus,to the extent the bia refusal to reopen proceedings sua sponte is not committed to agency discretion,we would have jurisdiction to review the decision pursuant to.
there is a basic presumption of judicial review of final agency action,lincoln vigil,d,but this presumption may be overridden in certain circumstances.the administrative procedure act declares that its provisions for judicial review do not apply when a statute precludes judicial review,or agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.a.the ina does include a statutory provision that precludes judicial review of decisions by the attorney general other than the granting of relief under a,which are specified under subchapter ii of the ina to be in the discretion of the attorney general.a b ii.because the ina does not specifically address the attorney general authority to reopen proceedings on his own motion,a b ii does not preclude judicial review of the bia refusal to reopen sua sponte.even where a statute does not preclude review of a particular agency action,however,we must still consider whether that agency action is committed to agency discretion by law under a of the apa.heckler chaney,d see,ngure ashcroft,cir kambolli gonzales,cir.
