b.the ukrainian auxiliary police and world war ii 
in august,following nazi germany june invasion of territory,german authorities formed the uap to aid in policing the district galicia.throughout its existence,the uap was financed,directed,and controlled by german authorities.ukrainian auxiliary policemen in the city of were uniformed,armed,salaried,and received various benefits,including leave and preferential access to scarce commodities.
the nazi policy toward jews in district galicia had several components.first,the nazis issued new identification papers to jews that identified their religion,and oversaw their confinement in ghettos.later,many of these jews were forcibly removed and killed.the nazis temporarily spared a limited number of jews,whom the germans considered work capable,transferring them to forced labor camps where many died from starvation,disease,and other inhumane conditions.these measures were implemented and enforced from to in galicia.during this time,the uap checked personal identification documents and arrested jews who lacked special work passes.they also arrested any jew who failed to wear an armband bearing the star of david.
at the time that firishchak was admitted into the united states,the uap was not on the inimical list of organizations hostile to the united list maintained by the displaced persons commission to assist with processing visa applications.
stipulations and evidence presented at trial 
the parties stipulated to numerous facts and legal conclusions in the order that greatly reduced firishchak available defenses at trial.they stipulated,among other things,that the uap enforced nazi persecutory measures against jews in the city,by checking personal identification documents and arresting jews for various violations and that the uap assisted the nazis with the largest ghetto reduction action in,commonly known as the great operation.order at.
as for legal conclusions,they stipulated if firishchak performed the routine duties of a ukrainian auxiliary policeman,he assisted in the persecution of civil populations.id.at.moreover,the parties stipulated that if firishchak served in the uap during wwii,he was a member of,or participated in,a hostile movement.id.at.in addition,the parties agreed that firishchak wartime activities,and uap membership in particular,were material facts and that if he actually served in the uap during wwii,he made a willful and material misrepresentation of his wartime activities for the purpose of gaining admission to the united states.id.at.finally,the parties stipulated that if firishchak served in the uap,which was subordinate to the nazi security authorities and routinely assisted in implementing a range of nazi policies,he advocated or acquiesced in activities or conduct contrary to civilization and human decency.id.at.the end result of these stipulations was that firishchak could only be absolved if the government failed to prove his membership in the uap altogether.
at trial,the government introduced wartime documents related to firishchak uap service,including seven that bear his signature two of those documents identify firishchak by name and birth date and state that he had been employed by the commissariat of the ukrainian police since october.one of the documents lists the headquarters of the commissariat as firishchak residence and lists his father name as hryts.the signatures on the documents are spelled the same,and all of the documents identify firishchak as a police private in the uap.a few of the documents lacked specific dates.
during firishchak trial,dieter pohl,a scholar who has done extensive archival research on the nazi occupation of district galicia and the uap,testified generally about the german occupation of galicia and the role of the uap in implementing nazi policy.in addition,pohl testified that there was no suspicion regarding the authenticity of the wartime documents and that they were all housed in a location where one would expected to find state regional archive.he further testified that all of the documents dated from to.
robert groner,a former department of justice trial attorney,testified regarding firishchak sworn interview,in which firishchak identified seven signature samples extracted from relevant uap documents as his own.groner stated that firishchak declined the services of an interpreter at the interview and was composed,lucid,and responsive until he was shown the documents regarding his uap service,at which point he became nervous and agitated.
the government also offered testimony from william weiss,a survivor of the jewish ghetto.he did not specifically testify about firishchak or identify him as a member of the uap.instead,weiss testified about ghetto conditions as well as the abuse that occurred at the hands of both the nazis and the uap.finally,the government entered the de bene esse taken for use in the event of a witness absence at mario decapua and everett coe,who testified generally about visa applications and procedures under the dpa,including security investigations into applicants backgrounds.no one with personal knowledge testified that firishchak was a member of the uap or performed the duties of a ukrainian auxiliary policeman in the streets of during world war ii.
firishchak testified in his own defense at trial,denying any service in the uap.he admitted that the individual identified in the incriminating documents had the same name,the same birth date,the same father name,and came from the same village.firishchak admitted that he resided in the same town during the war as the individual identified in the wartime documents.as to his wartime activities,firishchak testified that he was homeless throughout the war and drifted from place to place,hiding out in coffee shops along the way.he testified that after leaving his factory job in germany,he went with little money and without proper travel documents from town to town,en route to a town whose name he did not know,to go to school.he picked up occasional odd jobs along the way.the government highlighted various inconsistencies in firishchak story.for example,he stated that he never slept in the same place and was always on the move,but later acknowledged that he had an address in for an extended period of time.
the district court found the government witnesses credible,but questioned both the substance of firishchak testimony and his mannerisms on the stand.taking the stipulations,the admitted documents,the admitted depositions,and the live testimony altogether,the district court ruled against firishchak on all four counts of the complaint.
ii.discussion 
firishchak raises a number of issues on appeal.first,he contends that the wartime documents evidencing his uap service were inadmissible.second,he argues that the district court abused its discretion by permitting pohl to testify on a subject that was not disclosed in his expert report.third,firishchak claims that the district court should have granted him a continuance because the government took two de bene esse depositions after the close of discovery.fourth,firishchak challenges the sufficiency of the evidence against him.finally,he argues that he was denied a fair trial.
admissibility of the wartime documents 
as a threshold matter,firishchak disputes the admissibility of the wartime documents,arguing that they were improperly authenticated as ancient documents or business records and that they constitute inadmissible hearsay.this court reviews a district court determination regarding the admissibility of documents for an abuse of discretion.chemetall gmbh zr energy,cir.
documents are authenticated by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.a chemetall,at.federal rule of evidence b identifies the means by which ancient documents are authenticated.an ancient document should be a in such condition as to create no suspicion concerning its authenticity b in a place where it,if authentic,would likely be and c in existence twenty years or more at the time it is offered.b united states kairys,cir.whether the documents correctly identify the defendant goes to their weight and is a matter for the trier of fact it is not relevant to the threshold determination of admissibility.see kairys,at affirming the admission of wartime document.
in this case,pohl,an expert who has done extensive archival research on the district galicia,testified that there was no suspicion regarding the documents authenticity and that they were housed in a state regional archive where one would expect to find such documents.he also testified regarding the age of the documents,stating that each document dated from between and.
firishchak correctly notes that mere recitation of the contents of documents does not authenticate them or provide for their admissibility,united states wittje,d,but pohl testimony was more than a mere recitation.rather,he spoke of how historians relied on the documents and where they could be found in addition to their contents.furthermore,firishchak identification of his own signature on seven of the documents suggests that they are authentic 
firishchak particularly questions the authentication of those documents that lacked specific dates.while it is true that several of the documents bear no specific date,their age can be proven by other means.for example,the appearance of the proffered evidence or even the contents of the material itself together with the surrounding circumstances can be used to determine a document age.see.b.in addition,all but one of the documents contain month and year or season and permits their age to be determined.finally,firishchak did not cite any particular characteristics of the documents that raise doubts regarding their authenticity.considering pohl testimony in addition to the contents,location,and appearance of the documents themselves,the district court could reasonably determine the threshold question of the documents authenticity.therefore,the district court decision to admit the wartime documents was not an abuse of discretion.
firishchak also argues that the wartime documents were not admissible business records.this argument misses the point because the ancient documents rule and the business records exception are independent grounds for determining admissibility.compare.with.b see also,george celotex,cir.because the documents in question were admissible under the ancient documents rule,whether they were kept in the ordinary course of uap business is irrelevant.finally,firishchak assertion that the documents constitute inadmissible hearsay is without merit.under federal rule of evidence,statements contained in authenticated ancient documents are not hearsay.
discovery issues 
firishchak has two complaints regarding the discovery phase.first,he asserts that the government failed to disclose certain expert testimony in its required report.second,he believes that the taking of two de bene esse depositions after the close of discovery entitled him to a continuance.we review a district court discovery rulings for an abuse of discretion.sims gc servs,cir.
firishchak contends that the government did not disclose in its expert report that pohl would testify regarding the authenticity of the wartime documents.as a result,firishchak argues,any such testimony should have been excluded as a sanction for violating federal rule of civil procedure a b,which requires expert reports to contain a complete statement of all opinions to be expressed and the basis and the reasons therefore.firishchak asserts that pohl report did not disclose any opinions regarding the authenticity of the wartime documents.the government,on the other hand,argues that firishchak waived this claim because he did not object to pohl qualification as an expert on the uap and documents relating thereto,thereby acknowledging pohl ability to authenticate uap documents.br.at emphasis in original.even if the claim was not waived,firishchak can not prevail.pohl expert report discussed each historical exhibit that was subsequently introduced at trial,including its archival source and locator information.the report also contained passages about where the historical documents are kept and how historians rely on them.therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion by permitting pohl to testify regarding the authenticity of the documents.
firishchak also takes issue with the fact that the government took two de bene esse depositions in the week leading up to trial.pursuant to a court order,all discovery in the case closed on march,and trial was scheduled to begin on august.according to firishchak,on may,the government sent notice to the defendant of its intention to take the de bene esse depositions of mario decapua and everett coe in than days prior to the trial date.firishchak then filed a motion for a continuance,but his motion was denied.the government took mario decapua deposition on july and everett coe deposition on july.
the record reflects that more than ten weeks before trial,the government notified firishchak that it would be taking videotaped de bene esse depositions of two elderly witnesses pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a c,which permits the use of depositions for any purpose if the court finds a witness is unable to attend or testify because of age.because the rule permits broad use of depositions in these circumstances,the court decision not to grant firishchak a continuance due to a permitted use was not an abuse o
