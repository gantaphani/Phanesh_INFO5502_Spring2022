discussion 
confrontation clause 
the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment guarantees that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi.in crawford washington,the supreme court held that the confrontation clause guarantees a defendant right to confront those who bear testimony against him.id.at citation omitted.the court ruled that t estimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial are admissible only where the declarant is unavailable,and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to.id.at.the court described various formulations of the core class of testimonial statements without expressly endorsing any formulation.id.at.among the examples so discussed were statements contained in formalized testimonial materials,such as affidavits,depositions,prior testimony,or confessions as well as statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.id.at ellipsis,internal quotations and citations omitted.on the issue before it,the court held that statements taken by investigating police officers during interrogations were testimonial under even a narrow standard.id.at.
recently,in massachusetts,the supreme court shed additional light on the contours of the term testimonial.the court held that certificates of analysis by laboratory technicians confirming that substances possessed by the defendant were cocaine were testimonial statements under crawford.id.at.the court emphasized that the certificates were quite plainly affidavits and were functionally identical to live,testimony.id.at.moreover,not only were the certificates made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial,id.quoting crawford,at,but under state law the sole purpose of the affidavits was to provide evidence at trial.id.
relying upon,challenges the district court introduction into evidence of the cnr and the warrant of removal.he argues that both the cnr and the warrant of removal are testimonial and that,because he never had the opportunity to their declarants,the introduction of these documents violated his right to confront witnesses against him.the government concedes that introduction of the cnr was error under,but argues that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.the government also maintains that introduction of the warrant of removal into evidence did not violate the confrontation clause.
certificate of of record cnr 
to convict of violating,the government was required to prove that,after being removed,the united states without permission to reapply for admission.see a a united states,cir.as part of its proof on this element,the government introduced the cnr,in which a district director of the citizenship and immigration services of the department of homeland security certified that after a diligent search of two agency databases,no record was found to exist indicating that obtained consent for in the united states.
because the government concedes that the introduction of the cnr violated confrontation right,we must remand for a new trial unless the government demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that admission of the evidence was harmless.united states norwood,wl,at cir.in evaluating whether a confrontation clause violation is harmless,we consider a variety of factors,including 
the importance of the witness testimony in the prosecution case,whether the testimony was cumulative,the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points,the extent of otherwise permitted,and,of course,the overall strength of the prosecution case.
delaware van arsdall.we conclude that the government has met its burden of proving harmlessness in this case.
first,the cnr was cumulative of other evidence.agent holmes testified that if had filed the form required to reapply for admission,this fact would have been documented both in and in the agency database,but no such documentation appeared in either place.any doubt arising from the possibility that agent holmes record search was less comprehensive than the search conducted for the cnr was allayed by the introduction of own sworn statement that he had not applied for permission to,as well as the arresting agent testimony that admitted that he lacked documents allowing him to be in the united states legally.the jury also could infer that lacked permission to the united states from the circumstances of his apprehension rather than entering through a designated port of entry,as would be expected if had received permission to the united states,was apprehended in a desolate,inhospitable,and uninhabited border area.thus,the government case on the element was overwhelming,even without the cnr.
had an adequate opportunity to the witnesses who testified against him.these witnesses included agent holmes,who reviewed,agent bourne,who prepared sworn statement,and agent thompson,who apprehended near the border.we reject contention that his ability to agent holmes was unduly limited by the district court refusal to order the production of notes agent holmes made while reviewing nothing prevented counsel for from pressing agent holmes on the manner in which he conducted the search,but counsel did not do so.in fact,the question of whether had applied for permission to the united states was never seriously challenged at trial.thus,we are convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that the jury would have convicted on the elements of regardless of the introduction of the cnr.norwood,wl,at.
warrant of removal 
to convict,the government also was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that,prior to being apprehended,had in fact been physically removed from the united states.see,united states,cir.as part of its proof,the government introduced the warrant of removal,which both ordered
