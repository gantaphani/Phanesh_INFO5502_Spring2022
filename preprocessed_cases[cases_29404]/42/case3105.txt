immigration

the panel held that under the temporary protected status statute,f,a tps recipient is deemed to be in lawful status and thereby has satisfied the requirements to become a nonimmigrant,including inspection and admission,for the purposes of adjustment of status.the panel held that as a tps beneficiary,ramirez was therefore eligible to obtain lawful permanent residence.
mckeown,circuit judge 
this appeal presents a question of statutory interpretation about the interplay between two subsections of the immigration code one involving designation of temporary protected status tps and the other involving adjustment of status.the attorney general may grant tps to an alien who can not safely return home to a or country.during the pendency of the tps designation,the government may not send the alien back to the unsafe country.
jesus ramirez,who came to the united states from el salvador in,was granted tps in and has remained in that status to the present day.in,he married barbara lopez,a citizen,and the couple sought lawful permanent resident status for ramirez.although they were unsuccessful before citizenship and immigration services uscis,they prevailed in a lawsuit filed in district court.
the parties dispute whether being a tps designee provides a pathway for ramirez to obtain lawful permanent resident status under the adjustment statute.we hold that it does under f,an alien afforded tps is deemed to be in lawful status as a nonimmigrant and has thereby satisfied the requirements for becoming a nonimmigrant,including inspection and admission for purposes of adjustment of status under.
background 
statutory regime 
two statutory provisions are at the heart of this appeal.the first relates to tps,a status that the attorney general may grant to aliens that prevents their removal from the united states while dangerous conditions persist in their home country.see a a,b.the second provision governs an alien ability to adjust to lawful permanent resident status.see id.a.we offer a general description of the mechanics of the tps statute and then address where the rubber meets the road in this appeal the intersection of the tps and adjustment statutes.
tps first requires a designation.when the attorney general determines that a foreign state or any part of a foreign state faces an ongoing armed conflict,environmental disaster,or other extraordinary and temporary conditions that prevent aliens from returning safely,the attorney general may designate that state or part of the state for tps and grant tps to an alien who is a national of that state.id.a a,b.the attorney general sets the initial duration of the designation,which may be extended following periodic review.see id.b.an alien desiring tps requests such status by submitting an application including detailed information about identity,residence,and admissibility to uscis,which considers the application.see,b.to maintain tps,aliens must periodically.see c c a.
an alien granted tps receives two primary benefits during the period in which tps is in effect he is not subject to removal and he is authorized to work in the united states and supplied with the relevant accompanying documentation.a.the grant of tps has other consequences.for example,the tps beneficiary is not considered to be permanently residing in the united states under color of law and may be deemed ineligible for public assistance by a state or any political subdivision thereof which furnishes such assistance.id.f.if the beneficiary wishes to travel abroad,he must seek and obtain the prior consent of the attorney general.id.f.the consequence pertinent to this appeal is that for purposes of adjustment of status under section of this title and change of status under section of this title,the alien shall be considered as being in,and maintaining,lawful status as a nonimmigrant.id.f emphasis added.
the interpretive challenge is figuring out the extent to which the language affects a tps beneficiary ability to adjust to lawful permanent resident status.section a the first subsection of the adjustment statute permits the attorney general to adjust t he status of an alien who was inspected and admitted or paroled into the united states.id.a.in addition,some aliens are statutorily ineligible to adjust their status.section c lists multiple categories of aliens to whom subsection a shall not be applicable.id.c.one such bar under c applies to an alien,other than an immediate relative or special immigrant defined under the statute,who is in unlawful immigration status on the date of filing the application for adjustment of status or who has failed to maintain continuously a lawful status since entry into the united states.id.c.reading the tps and adjustment statutes together,the question we confront is whether the grant of tps allows an alien not only to avoid the bar under c but also to meet the inspected and admitted or paroled requirement in a.we conclude that it does and affirm the district court.
ii.factual and procedural history 
the parties agree on the essential background facts.ramirez is a native and citizen of el salvador who entered the united states on may,without being inspected and admitted or paroled by an immigration officer.in,the attorney general designated el salvador under the tps program after the country suffered a series of earthquakes.see designation of el salvador under temporary protected status program,fed.reg.with his home country designated,ramirez applied for and received tps.since then,the attorney general has continually redesignated el salvador,see extension of the designation of el salvador for temporary protected status,fed.reg.july,and ramirez has kept his tps registration up to date.
on july,ramirez married barbara lopez,a citizen.she filed a form petition for alien resident on behalf of ramirez,and ramirez filed a form application to adjust his status to that of a lawful permanent resident.uscis approved lopez petition on april.
however,eight days later,on april,uscis denied ramirez separate application.the agency explained that ramirez was ineligible as a matter of law to adjust status in the united states because he had not shown that he was inspected and admitted or paroled at the time of his may entry into the united states nor that he was exempt from that requirement.although uscis recognized that,by virtue of the grant of tps,ramirez is considered as if he was in a lawful status,it concluded that that treatment does not override the adjustment statute general requirement to be inspected and admitted or paroled.
ramirez and lopez then filed suit in the western district of washington,bringing an action under the administrative procedure act apa,et.the district court determined that uscis interpretation is incorrect as a matter of law because the tps statute clearly provides that recipients count as being inspected and admitted for purposes of adjusting their status.
the court also noted that,though it need not defer to the agency interpretation where the statute unambiguously answers the question at issue,the agency decisions do not deserve deference because they reach the wrong conclusion and do not thoroughly examine the question at issue.finally,the court closed with the policy consideration that ramirez has established a life in the united states and should not have to leave the country to seek admission.for these reasons,the district court ruled that ramirez is entitled to summary judgment because he meets the requirements of a to adjust his status.we review this judgment de novo,protect our cmtys.found.jewell,cir,through the lens of the apa arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law standard,a.
ramirez desires to adjust his status to that of a lawful permanent resident,a process governed by.all parties agree that ramirez must comply with the requirements of the first subsection,which provides that 
t he status of an alien who was inspected and admitted or paroled into the united states may be adjusted by the attorney general,in his discretion and under such regulations as he may prescribe,to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if the alien makes an application for such adjustment,the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the united states for permanent residence,and an immigrant visa is immediately available to him at the time his application is filed.
id.a.ramirez easily satisfies subsections a and a because he made an application for adjustment of status and an immigrant visa is immediately available through his american citizen wife.the prefatory language and subsection a remain.
the prefatory language asks whether ramirez was inspected and admitted or paroled into the united states,but for our case the question can be slightly narrowed from there.no party contends that ramirez was paroled into the united states.the government also downplays or fails to make separate arguments about inspection,and ramirez soundly argues that he has been inspected because tps applicants undergo a rigorous inspection process by an immigration officer.therefore,the action in this appeal centers on whether ramirez has been admitted as that term is used in a.although the government separately contends that ramirez flunks subsection a because his may illegal entry renders him inadmissible,see id.a a i,the question whether ramirez is admissible is bound up with whether the grant of tps to ramirez means that he has been admitted.
this takes us to the tps statute.the operative provision,f,states that tps recipients shall be considered as being in,and maintaining,lawful status as a nonimmigrant for purposes of adjustment of status.under the familiar framework for evaluating an agency statutory interpretation,we first consider whether the statute is unambiguous.see chevron,nat.res.def.council.
employing the traditional canons of statutory construction at step one,we conclude that f unambiguously treats aliens with tps as being admitted for purposes of adjusting status.because the statutory language is clear,that ends the inquiry the agency has no interpretive role to play but must instead follow the congressional mandate.chevron,at see.
it bears noting,however,that even if we were to proceed to step two because the statute is unclear on the admitted issue,the government has not identified any controlling agency interpretation to which we owe deference.see chevron,at.the cited published decisions do not address the statutory interpretation question at issue here.see in re alyazji,in re sosa ventura.the remaining decisions variously issued by the immigration and naturalization service general counsel,board of immigration appeals bia,and uscis are,see d,g,so the deference owed depends on their persuasive value,see garcia holder,cir.while the decisions stretch back to,that consistency is strongly outweighed by a pervasive lack of thorough and valid reasoning,as the decisions often state a conclusory answer without taking into account the various statutory and other considerations at play.see skidmore swift.because the agency interpretation does not warrant deference,we must decide the proper construction based on the text,structure,and purpose of the relevant provisions.
i.the plain statutory language 
the language of the tps statute itself strongly points to the conclusion that ramirez qualifies as admitted for adjusting his status.see pom wonderful llc,noting the primacy of the text in statutory interpretation.in particular,f broadly states that d uring a period in which an alien is granted temporary protected status under this section,for purposes of adjustment of status under section of this title,the alien shall be considered as being in,and maintaining,lawful status as a nonimmigrant.emphasis added.the language explicitly refers to the adjustment statute,and confers the status of lawful nonimmigrant on tps recipients when looking at adjusting their status.
the sixth circuit,squarely addressing the same interpretive issue,concluded that that text is clear.flores citizenship immigration,cir.the court explained that exactly what f provides is that a tps recipient is considered as being in lawful nonimmigrant status and thus meets the admitted requirement in.id.at.like the sixth circuit,w e interpret the statute exactly as written as allowing a tps recipient to be considered as being in lawful status as a nonimmigrant for purposes of adjustment of status under.id.at.
the eleventh circuit has taken a contrary position,holding that the statutes unambiguously point the other way t he plain language of a limits eligibility for status adjustment to an alien who has been inspected and admitted or paroled and t hat an alien with temporary protected status has lawful status as a nonimmigrant for purposes of adjusting his status does not change a threshold eligibility requirement.serrano attorney,cir.per curiam.while the sixth circuit in flores and the district court here attempt to distinguish serrano on the ground that the petitioner there did not disclose his illegal entry into the country in his tps application,see serrano,at,that factual difference has no bearing on the eleventh circuit conclusion that f does not override a threshold inspected and admitted requirement.nevertheless,for the reasons discussed below,we disagree with the eleventh circuit and decline to follow serrano 
under the immigration laws,an alien who has obtained lawful status as a nonimmigrant has necessarily been admitted.the statutory provisions refer to t he admission to the united states of any alien as a nonimmigrant,though the duration and purpose of the alien stay may be tightly circumscribed.a emphases added see id.d alien admission as a nonimmigrant,g the period of authorized admission as such a nonimmigrant,a the conditions of any previous admission as such a nonimmigrant.indeed,every alien shall be presumed to be an immigrant until he establishes to the satisfaction of the consular officer,at the time of application for a visa,and the immigration officers,at the time of application for admission,that he is entitled to a nonimmigrant status.id.b.in other words,by the very nature of obtaining lawful nonimmigrant status,the alien goes through inspection and is deemed admitted.see also id.k the admission,and continued stay in lawful status,of such a nonimmigrant.
as the governing statutes and implementing regulations demonstrate,in practice,too,the application and approval process for securing tps shares many of the main attributes of the usual admission process for nonimmigrants.like an alien seeking nonimmigrant status,see id.b,f,an alien seeking tps must establish that he meets the identity and citizenship requirements for that status,usually by submitting supporting documentation like a passport,see a,c a a.similarly,an alien on either track must adequately demonstrate that he is eligible to be admitted to the united states,with the possibility that some grounds of inadmissibility may be waived in individual cases at the attorney general discretion.compare a,d,g i,a i,with c a iii,c a d.
once the request for nonimmigrant status or tps has been submitted,the application is scrutinized for compliance sometimes supplemented with an interview of the applicant then approved or denied by uscis.compare a,b d,with a a,b.that the tps application is subject to a rigorous process comparable to any other admission process further confirms that an alien approved for tps has been admitted.
the government pushes back,urging that the statutory definition of admitted at a a which requires something akin to passage into the united states at a designated port of entry controls,but the awkwardness of the fit is telling and makes that definition inapplicable.the government itself concedes that the definition is not always appropriate by acknowledging and accepting the bia decisions which hold that aliens can be admitted even
