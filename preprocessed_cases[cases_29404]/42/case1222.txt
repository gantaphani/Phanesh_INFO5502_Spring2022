petitioner zaman sattaur hanif hanif or petitioner seeks review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia finding him statutorily ineligible for relief from removal under h applying the precedent of matter of koljenovic,bia,the bia found that hanif was a lawful permanent resident lpr,and that his date of admission was may,the date he was granted lpr status.thus,he had not satisfied the seven years of continuous residence required by the statute.hanif argues that the language of the statute is clear,and that he has never been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.rather,he acquired his lpr status while in the united states,never having been admitted for that purpose.
for the reasons set forth below,we find that the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous on its face.therefore,we will accord no deference to the bia interpretation,which we find to be at odds with the wording and clear meaning of the statute.we will grant the petition,vacate the bia decision,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
hanif is a citizen of guyana currently detained by immigration authorities pending the outcome of his removal proceedings.although the exact details are not clear,hanif entered the united states on a fraudulent visa at some point during the after his marriage to shakirah hattim,a naturalized citizen,hanif applied for a waiver of his ground of inadmissibility.on may,a new york immigration judge ij granted hanif application and adjusted hanif to lpr status.prior to his detention,hanif resided in the bronx,new york with his wife and two children.also living in the bronx area are hanif parents and five siblings,all either naturalized citizens or lawful permanent residents.

in early december,the secret service was notified that hanif would fly to the united states from guyana to surrender.hanif arrived at john kennedy international airport on december.he was arrested and paroled into the united states for purposes of prosecution for counterfeiting.on may,hanif pled guilty to dealing in counterfeit united states currency,usc,and,on september,was sentenced to four months in prison.

on january,an ij denied hanif application,finding him ineligible for a waiver under h,pursuant to the bia decision in matter of koljenovic.specifically,the ij noted that the board of immigration appeals held in matter of koljenovic that an alien who entered the united states without inspection and later obtained lawful permanent residence sic status through adjustment of status has previously been admitted as a lawful permanent resident,and therefore,must satisfy the seven year continuous residence requirement at section h.admin.on may,the bia adopted and affirmed the ij order.on june,hanif petitioned this court for review of the bia decision.

iv.analysis 
when considering the propriety of an agency interpretation of a statute,we must turn to the analytical structure set forth by the supreme court in chevron,at.under the familiar chevron inquiry,first,if the statute is clear we must give effect to congress s unambiguous intent,and,second,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to a specific issue,we defer to an implementing agency reasonable interpretation of that statute.de leon ochoa att y,cir.
regarding the first step,the supreme court noted that t he judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction and must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent.if a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.chevron,at.citations omitted.
we have adopted limitations on the first step of the chevron test.
as this court has observed,a blind adherence to the literal meaning of a statute could lead to a patently absurd result that no rational legislature could have intended.following the letter,rather than the spirit,of the law in such cases would go against the court role of construing statutes to effectuate the legislature intent.
barrios att y,cir quoting fogleman mercy,cir in turn citing united states schneider,cir it is the obligation of the court to construe a statute to avoid absurd results,if alternative interpretations are available and consistent with the legislative purpose.
as to the second step,the supreme court stated that a court need not conclude that the agency construction was the only one it permissibly could have adopted to uphold the construction,or even the reading the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding.chevron,at.
petitioner and amicus argue that the language of the statute is clear,and this court therefore need only read the statute in order to conclude that it does not apply to him.that is,according to petitioner,he was never admitted to this country as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.although his status is that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,as defined by a,he has never been admitted to the united states,since he originally entered the country illegally.
although asserting that we need not go beyond the plain meaning of the statute,petitioner also argues that the statute legislative history supports his position.noting that congress amended h,a and the definition of admission in a a at the same time,petitioner concludes that the differences among these sections indicate congress clear intent to differentiate among them.specifically,petitioner notes that congress used lawf
