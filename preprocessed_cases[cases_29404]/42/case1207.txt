opinion of the court 
after a jury convicted zavkibeg ashurov of presenting a materially false statement in an immigration form,the district court entered a judgment of acquittal,concluding that the statute of conviction required,but that the government had not proved,that the statement was made under oath.the relevant statute punishes 
w hoever knowingly makes under oath,or under penalty of perjury knowingly subscribes as true,any false statement with respect to a material fact in any document required by the immigration laws or knowingly presents any such document which contains any such false statement or which fails to contain any reasonable basis in law or fact.
a emphasis added.the united states asks that we reinstate ashurov conviction,arguing that the knowingly presents clause of the statute,which ashurov was charged with violating,does not require that the materially false statement be made under oath.after carefully considering the opposing arguments regarding the proper construction of this complex law,we conclude that it is grievously ambiguous as to whether the knowingly presents clause requires an affirmation made under oath.accordingly,we apply the rule of lenity and affirm the judgment of acquittal.
factual and procedural background 
ashurov,a citizen of tajikistan,entered the united states under a visitor visa in and subsequently sought to obtain an f student visa that would permit him to enroll in an english language program and temporarily remain in the united states.
the application to adjust ashurov status and obtain the f visa requires the submission of an immigration and naturalization service form i,which has been described as a school petition to the government to sponsor a student for enrollment.app.the form requires that a school designated official provide information regarding the candidate and the educational program he or she intends to complete,and certify under penalty of perjury that the information provided therein is true and that the student will be required to pursue a full course of study at the school.in the context of a language program,full course of study means at least eighteen hours of classroom instruction per week.f i d.form i also requires a student certification whereby students agree to comply with the terms and conditions of their admission as students and certify that they seek admission for the purpose of pursuing a full course of study.that certification is not made under penalty of perjury.
ashurov first sought adjustment of his status in april pursuant to citizenship and immigration services uscis form i,which,generally,is used to apply to extend or change an individual status.included with that form was a form i wherein ashurov stated that he planned to study english as a second language at the cmg school in trevose,pennsylvania.the form was certified under penalty of perjury by the cmg school designated official,and was signed by ashurov without an oath,as the form provides.the application was granted later that year and ashurov obtained a student visa.in april and again in april,ashurov presented identical forms i to the cmg school officials all signed by ashurov,but not sworn under oath,who in turn completed them,executed them under penalty of perjury,and submitted them to uscis.in,federal authorities began an investigation of the cmg school,seizing business records that revealed that the school was not providing students the required eighteen hours of weekly instruction.the school was eventually closed and its designated school official was indicted.records also revealed that ashurov attendance at the cmg school began to decline in and eventually became insufficient to meet the weekly hour requirement.
ashurov was originally charged with violating a by knowingly making under oath a materially false statement in the forms i,but,given that he did not therein certify anything under oath,a superseding indictment was returned charging him only with knowingly presenting a false statement.a.a jury convicted him of one count,based on the april form,but the district court granted him a judgment of acquittal,concluding that the oath requirement applied to both the knowingly makes and knowingly presents clauses and that,alternatively,it would apply the rule of lenity.the government now appeals.
ii.analysis 
at issue is the fourth paragraph of a,which punishes 
whoever knowingly makes under oath,or as permitted under penalty of perjury under section of title,united states code,knowingly subscribes as true,any false statement with respect to a material fact in any application,affidavit,or other document required by the immigration laws or regulations prescribed thereunder,or knowingly presents any such application,affidavit,or other document which contains any such false statement or which fails to contain any reasonable basis in law or fact.
emphasis added.specifically,ashurov was indicted for violating the knowingly presents portion of the statute.the question in this case is what exactly that clause proscribes 
textual canons of construction 
we begin,as always,with the text of the law.in framing the discussion of what the knowingly presents clause prohibits,the parties agree that the provision as a whole lists two crimes one,which is referred to as the making clause,punishes knowingly mak ing under oath a materially false statement in an document the other,which ashurov was charged with violating and which is referred to as the presenting clause,punishes knowingly present ing an document with a materially false statement.u.a.the sole point of contention is whether the knowingly presents crime,by virtue of the use of the word such,also requires that the statement that ashurov presented be made under oath by incorporating that element from the making clause.the government contends that it does not,thereby dismissing the need to prove that ashurov form i statements were made under oath.
we begin with two textual modes of construction first,the plain meaning of the word such and the rule of the last antecedent and,second,the rule against surplusage.as we shall see,these two textual approaches pull us in directions.
ashurov contends that the words any such false statement in the presenting clause refer to a false statement with respect to a material fact that is made under oath.the only way this interpretation can be correct,however,is if we read such to refer both to the adjective clause with respect to a material fact as well as to the verb and adverb knowingly makes under oath of the making clause.but,grammatically,the words under oath in the making clause do not describe the false statement.instead,they characterize and qualify the action itself that the statute punishes,knowingly makes.as the district court recognized,such means of the character,quality,or extent previously indicated or implied.united states ashurov,crim,wl.may,quoting webster ninth new collegiate dictionary see also black law dictionary ed defining such as t hat or those having just been mentioned.in other words,the use of such is meant to invoke a characteristic,a quality,or an extent,and ashurov construction requires us to transform the verbs and adverbs in the first clause into adjectives in the second.
by contrast,reading the second such to reach only with respect to a material fact and not makes under oath comports with a commonly recognized rule in american jurisprudence that t he word such naturally,by grammatical usage,refers to the last precedent.bahre hogbloom,state ex rel.king bd.of trs.of firemen pension fund of kansas city,identifying such as a term of comparison meaning of the same kind as that which has been enumerated.our court has also recognized the basic canon that referential and qualifying words and phrases,where no contrary intention appears,refer solely to the last antecedent.tippins usx,cir citing norman singer,sutherland statutory construction ed.here,the oath requirement is not the last thing mentioned in connection with false statements.the last mentioned qualifier is that they must be made with respect to a material fact.a.
on the other hand,we would be remiss if we did not recall that this
