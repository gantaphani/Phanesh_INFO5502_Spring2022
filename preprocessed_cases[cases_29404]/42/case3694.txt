factual and procedural background 
on january,petitioner obtained a fapa restraining order to prevent abuse from the circuit court for the state of oregon,washington county.that restraining order contained a number of separate provisions,including terms enjoining petitioner from intimidating,molesting,interfering with or menacing his or any minor children in her custody or attempting to do any of those things,enjoining petitioner from entering or attempting to enter various locations,including his residence and areas within yards of his or her residence,and enjoining petitioner from contacting or attempting to contact his in person or through party contact by phone,mail and except regarding parenting time with his children.however,the restraining order was soon thereafter modified to permit petitioner to pick up the children from or deliver them to his residence so long as he remained curbside and except to put a child in a car seat inside his vehicle.
on february,petitioner returned his son to his exwife residence and walked halfway up the driveway a judgment on contempt hearing reflects that,on april,the washington county circuit court found petitioner,beyond a reasonable doubt,in wilful contempt for violation of the restraining order in connection with the february incident in particular,the court found that petitioner had violated the order by being within yards of petitioner ex wife not allowed by rest.order.the court sentenced petitioner to serve days in jail with credit for time served and a suspension of the remainder,placed him on formal probation for a period of two years,ordered him to undergo treatment and counseling for anger,mental health and domestic violence,and required that any further exchange of children would take place at the police station in beaverton,oregon.
over a year later,department of homeland security authorities arrested petitioner and served him with a notice to appear.the government charged petitioner with violating the portion of a domestic restraining order that involved protection against credible threats of violence,repeated harassment,or bodily injury to his,making him subject to removal under a e ii.
the ij assigned to the case terminated removal proceedings with prejudice upon determining that petitioner violation of the yard stay away portion of the restraining order did not bring petitioner within the meaning of section a e ii.on appeal,the bia disagreed,vacating the ij decision and remanding the matter.petitioner asserts that,in reaching its decision,the bia improperly relied upon a police report that the ij had entered into evidence below.petitioner refers to the following language from the bia ruling 
in the instant case,the record includes a copy of the police report respecting petitioner arrest.it shows that during a drop off of his child,petitioner did not remain in his car,did not remain at curbside,but got out of his car and walked up halfway up sic his driveway 
the bia then concluded that petitioner conduct fell within the terms of section a e ii.
upon remand,petitioner applied for cancellation of removal pursuant to a,and the,withholding of removal,relief under the convention against torture.the ij denied all of petitioner requested forms of relief and ordered him removed to hungary.petitioner appealed the ij order and the bia dismissed the appeal

categorical analysis of the oregon fapa restraining order 
petitioner is charged with removability under a e ii which provides,in pertinent part 
a classes of deportable aliens 
any alien in and admitted to the united states shall,upon the order of the attorney general,be removed if the alien is within one or more of the following classes of deportable aliens 
criminal offenses 
e crimes of domestic violence,stalking,or violation of protection order,crimes against children and 
ii violators of protection orders 
any alien who at any time after admission is enjoined under a protection order issued by a court and whom the court determines has engaged in conduct that violates the portion of a protection order that involves protection against credible threats of violence,repeated harassment,or bodily injury to the person or persons for whom the protection order was issued is deportable.for purposes of this clause,the term protection order means any injunction issued for the purpose of preventing violent or threatening acts of domestic violence,including temporary or final orders issued by civil or criminal courts other than support or child custody orders or provisions whether obtained by filing an independent action or as a pendente lite order in another proceeding.
a e ii supp emphasis added.the question here is whether petitioner violation of the restraining order by being within yards of his exwife residence without falling within the conditions set in connection with the provision for delivery or of children brings him categorically within the scope of section a e ii.
petitioner admits that all provisions of the fapa restraining order at issue in this case generally involve protection of persons who obtain the order,but insists that not all provisions of a fapa restraining order involve protection against credible threats of violence,repeated harassment,or bodily injury.petitioner argues that to read section a e ii as the bia has in his case would be to render superfluous the words the portion of.in essence,he contends that the bia interpretation means the violation of any provision in a protective or restraining order would render someone in his position removable.that,however,is not the argument which the government espouses or the position that the bia took.
the government concedes that there are certain provisions which might be encompassed within a fapa restraining order which,at least arguably,would not fall within the terms of section a e ii for example,provisions requiring attendance at and payment for a counseling program or requiring the payment of costs for supervision during parenting time.see or.stat.c,e.in addition,although the case dealt with california law,in we specifically cited oregon law as allowing for a provision requiring support for the spouse or children as part of a protective order.see at citing or.stat.h,which permits a restraining order to include an award of monetary assistance.we then noted that a conviction for violating a protection order issued under such a statute would require additional proof as to what portion of the protection order was violated.id.had such a provision been involved here and had the government charged petitioner with being removable for having violated it,his argument might have some weight.but as the record clearly indicates,petitioner was not charged with having violated any support provision or with removability in connection with any such provision.
citing gerlack roberts,petitioner also argues that,under oregon law,a court considering a charge that an individual violated a restraining order must make a special finding as to each provision or condition of the order violated.here,the oregon court only found that petitioner violated the provision requiring him to stay more than yards away from his,not the other portions of the restraining order which are,on their face,more directly tied to credible threats of violence,repeated harassment,or bodily injury.see,at s ome acts,such as telephoning one domestic partner or coming within a specified distance of him or her,do not typically constitute violence,threats,or harassment.
however,even if petitioner reading of gerlack is accurate and it is not clear that it is,that the oregon court only found petitioner in violation of the yard stay away prohibition is not to say that such a provision does not involve protection against credible threats of violence,repeated harassment,or bodily injury.indeed,in,we discussed the distinction a statute such as section a e ii inherently draws between assessing what an accused individual has actually done in violating a protective order versus the purpose that a protective order serves 
if the ina provision required the state court to find that petitioner actually had engaged in violent,threatening,or harassing behavior,we would conclude that petitioner convictions do not qualify categorically.but the ina provision requires something different that the state court conclude that petitioner violated the portion of a protection order that involves protection against violence,threats,or harassment.a e ii emphasis added.as discussed above,an injunction against making a telephone call and all the other enumerated acts in section involves protection against violence,threats,or harassment,even if it is possible that petitioner violative conduct did not independently constitute violence,threats,or harassment.
ultimately,petitioner arguments are foreclosed by the reasoning in.at issue in that case was section of the california family code which provided 
the court may issue an ex parte order enjoining a party from molesting,attacking,striking,stalking,threatening,sexually assaulting,battering,harassing,telephoning,including,but not limited to,annoying telephone calls as described in section of the penal code,destroying personal property,contacting,either directly or indirectly,by mail or otherwise,coming within a specified distance of,or disturbing the peace of the other party,and,in the discretion of the court,on a showing of good cause,of other named family or household members.emphasis added 
we were unable to determine from the record in that case which,under the modified categorical approach that we adopted,consisted of the petitioner two guilty pleas which portion of a section protective order the petitioner had violated see at.nevertheless,we concluded there that every portion of a protective order issued under that statute involves protection against credible threats of violence,repeated harassment,or bodily injury.id.at emphasis in original.because section of the california family code permitted protective orders which merely prevent a party from coming within a specified distance of another party and because we concluded that any protective order issued under section met the definition of section a e ii,petitioner arguments here are untenable.id.
at oral argument petitioner emphasized that in we concluded only that all portions of a section protective order served the purpose of section a e ii because the issuance of an order under section required a showing of reasonable proof of a past act or acts of abuse.id.at,quoting cal.however,a fapa restraining order imposes a similar threshold requirement and more.see in re marriage of ringler,under ors,in order to obtain a fapa restraining order,a petitioner must prove,by a preponderance of evidence,that he or she has been the victim of abuse,as that term is defined in ors.or.stat.indicating that the court may issue a fapa restraining order upon a showing that the individual has been the victim of abuse committed by the respondent within days preceding the filing of the petition,and that there is an imminent danger of further abuse to the individual and that the respondent represents a credible threat to the physical safety of the individual or the individual child.moreover,in issuing the fapa order here,the oregon court in fact found that petitioner had abused his within the meaning of or.stat,and that he represents a credible threat to the physical safety of his or her child and there is an imminent danger of further abuse petitioner attempt to distinguish is therefore unavailing.
we are bound by.however,as in that case,based on the government concession that the full range of conduct proscribable under a fapa restraining order is broader than section a e ii,we conclude that petitioner conviction does not suffice under the categorical approach.see at emphasis in original.we therefore proceed to an examination under the modified categorical approach.
the modified categorical approach 
the parties dispute whether the bia relied upon improper material in reaching its decision and even whether we have jurisdiction to resolve that issue.in light of,however,we need not reach those disputes.even assuming that the bia erred by considering the police report petitioner does not deny that he violated the restraining order yard stay away provision which we concluded in involves protection against credible threats of violence,repeated harassment,or bodily injury.given the import of,all information necessary to the section a e ii analysis here was contained in the fapa restraining order and the judgment on contempt hearing,documents which petitioner admits may be considered under the modified categorical approach.see kawashima mukasey,cir,abrogated in part,nijhawan holder,d.thus any error in the bia consideration of the police report was harmless.
the petition for review is denied.
i concur in the result reached in the majority opinion and in most of its analysis based upon the decision in holder,cir,except as noted herein.
holds,inter alia that the issue of whether a petitioner has violated a protection order under a e ii is to be determined under the categorical approach and the modified categorical approach first announced in taylor united states,d,and that the petitioner pleas to violating court orders issued pursuant to california family code fell within section a e ii because section is part of a statute that,in its entirety,aims to prevent domestic violence,authorizes a court to enjoin abusive acts,upon a showing of a past act of abuse and every portion of a protective order issued under section involves protection against credible threats of violence or bodily injury.a e ii.at,emphasis in original.i believe that the latter holding in is binding on this case and consequently petitioner szalai petition for review must be denied.however,i also conclude that initial holding as to the applicability of taylor categorical and modified categorical approaches to section a e ii was simply assumed without analysis and is incorrect.
admittedly,it has been noted that the lower courts uniformly have applied the approach in taylor united states to determine whether a conviction for violating a state criminal law falls within one of the removable offenses listed in a.gonzales,d.however,the precise problem raised in the taylor scenario and addressed by the court categorical and modified categorical approaches while present where the application of a federal statute is predicated on the conviction of a crime which is undefined in the federal statute and where the conviction occurs in a state court is not present in the context of section a e ii,which is premised on a violation of a protection order which is defined in the federal statute itself.
in taylor,the issue concerned the meaning of the word burglary as it was used in e,which provided for a sentence enhancement for persons with three prior convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.see at.a violent felony was defined to include burglary which was not itself defined in the version of the statute.id.at.after reviewing the relevant legislative history of section e,the court concluded that congress intended burglary to have its generic meaning,having the basic elements of an unlawful or unprivileged entry into,
