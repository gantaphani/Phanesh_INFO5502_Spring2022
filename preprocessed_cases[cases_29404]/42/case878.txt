petitioner artur piranej piranej or petitioner alleges that but for the ineffective assistance of his counsel,he would have been able to adjust his status to that of a lawful permanent resident and thus avoid deportation.based on that claim,he filed a motion before the board of immigration appeals bia to reopen his removal proceedings.the bia denied the motion,finding that piranej had failed to meet certain of the pleading requirements set out in in re lozada,specifically that of alleging in detail the agreement he had with counsel and how that agreement was violated.
piranej affidavits and submitted materials before the bia,however,can be read to assert that he and his counsel were in a relationship similar to that of a general retainer agreement,and that,due to the nature of this relationship,the lawyer should have provided piranej with timely advice about new opportunities for adjustment of status.because the prospect of a general retainer agreement is not one which the language of lozada contemplates,we find that the bia abused its discretion in rejecting petitioner ineffective assistance of counsel claim without a more thorough factual examination and,if such an examination warranted it,a consideration of the meaning and applicability of the lozada requirements in the context of general retainer agreements.
we therefore remand this case to the bia with instructions to remand it to an immigration judge ij for on the exact parameters of the relationship between piranej and his lawyer.the ij and bia should then determine,in the first instance,whether the understanding between piranej and his lawyer serves the functions embodied in lozada agreement requirement,and whether,in light of that determination,piranej allegations have substantially complied with this requirement.
background 
underlying events 
artur piranej,a citizen of albania,entered the united states on or about july.in august of that year,piranej,with the assistance of james hakanjan,a member of an immigration service,who was familiar with how these applications are filled out,attempted to file an asylum claim.the application was apparently improperly filled out and,on this basis,was denied.on september,piranej was served with a notice to appear.as an alien inadmissible due to invalid entry documentation,he was charged with removability.a a i i.
at that point,piranej hired james lombardi as his lawyer.at a hearing before an ij in december of that year,piranej,with counsel present conceded his removability and sought political asylum and withholding of removal.on march,his petitions for relief were denied by the ij,and he was ordered removed.lombardi,on behalf of piranej,filed a timely appeal to the bia,which affirmed the ij decision without opinion on february.in re piranej,no,aff g no.immig.city.the bia decision was not appealed to this court.
ii.motion to reopen before the bia 
in may,piranej,represented by new counsel,filed a motion to reopen his deportation hearings on the ground that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.he argued that but for lombardi negligence,piranej would have been able to adjust his status to that of a permanent resident and thus avoid deportation.in submitting his motion to the board,piranej provided an affidavit alleging prejudice due to lombardi ineffective assistance and outlining aspects of their relationship.piranej also submitted the complaint that he had filed with the departmental disciplinary committee,as well as evidence that lombardi had been informed of the allegations against him and been given an opportunity to respond.
a.the alleged ineffective assistance of counsel 
shortly after arriving in the united states,in the autumn of,piranej met bukurije neza.at piranej asylum hearing on march,neza,a citizen,was identified as artur piranej fianc√©e.after the hearing,piranej told his lawyer,lombardi,that he and neza wanted to get married.lombardi allegedly advised them not to do so,saying it would hurt their case.
in early,the availability of adjustment of status based on a marriage to an american citizen was limited by g,which states that a petition may not be approved to grant an alien immediate relative status or preference status by reason of a marriage which was entered into during the period in which administrative or judicial proceedings are pending regarding the alien right to be admitted or remain in the united states,until the alien has resided outside the united states for a period beginning after the date of the marriage.a waiver,provided in immigration and nationality act ina section i,i,allowing certain aliens to remain in the united states while adjusting their status,had expired in january 
piranej and neza still wanted to get married,regardless of the outcome of the case.and to this end,in february,neza called lombardi t o be on the safe side.she left a message with someone,identified by neza as a secretary,that neza needed to talk with lombardi,as she and piranej were planning on getting married soon.lombardi did not return the phone call,and neza and piranej assumed from this silence that it would be all right for them to get married.on march,piranej and neza were married.following the wedding,neza again called lombardi office and spoke to an unidentified woman who answered the phone.neza told this woman that she and piranej were now married and that she would like to talk to lombardi and ask him what they should do next.again,lombardi did not return neza call.
in july,after having called lombardi office many more times and receiv ing no response from him,artur piranej went to the office,without an appointment,and asked to see lombardi.he met with lombardi and announced his intention to find another attorney to take action on his case,stating that on march,he had married a citizen.lombardi allegedly replied,oh my god if you were here before april,you would be talking now with me with your green card in your pocket.were the beneficiaries of visa petitions filed by april,lombardi advised piranej to have neza file,as soon as possible,an petition for permanent residence of an alien spouse.lombardi assisted with this filing,which was submitted on august,almost sixteen months after the statutory deadline.in january,the piranejs had a son,brian,and on april,roughly two months after piranej removability had been upheld by the bia,the ins approved neza petition.
b.the bia decision 
the bia,with one board member dissenting,denied piranej motion to reopen on december.in re piranej,no.it first noted that the petition,filed by neza on piranej behalf,was not filed until august,and that neither the statute,ina section i,i,nor its implementing regulation,provided for an exception to the april,filing deadline.on that basis,the bia denied piranej petition to reopen since piranej was not the beneficiary of a timely filed petition for an immigrant visa,he was statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status under section i,hence reopening was not warranted.
the bia did not address,however,whether the statute allowed for any equitable measures to toll the deadline.instead,it stated that e ven if section i of the act was interpreted to include ineffective assistance of counsel as an exception to the april,filing deadline,piranej had not met the requirements under lozada.the board reasoned that piranej required affidavit fail ed to set forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representation counsel did or did not make to the respondent.the affidavit merely recount ed what his counsel failed to do,but did not mention what actions his counsel promised to undertake.
the dissenting board member,lauri steven filppu,disagreed with this analysis.she instead determined a that piranej had,in fact,complied with the lozada requirements,and b that,in light of this court decision in rabiu ins,cir,attorney error should permit piranej to obtain the benefits of section i,even though the necessary filings are untimely under that statute.the dissent would have remanded the case to the ij to resolve factual disputes regarding whether attorney negligence had actually occurred and,if piranej prevailed on the facts,would have ordered the ij to reopen proceedings.
piranej timely filed a petition for review before this court.he contends that,in the circumstances of his case,the bia abused its discretion in its application of the lozada requirements.
discussion 
we review the bia denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.kaur bia,cir per curiam.an abuse of discretion may be found in those circumstances where the board decision provides no rational explanation,inexplicably departs from established policies,is devoid of any reasoning,or contains only summary or conclusory statements that is to say,where the board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.zhao dep t of justice,cir internal citations omitted.
i.the lozada requirements 
the bia,in its decision in in re lozada,outlined certain requirements for making an ineffective assistance of counsel claim 
a motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be supported by an affidavit of the allegedly aggrieved respondent attesting to the relevant facts.in the case before us,that affidavit should include a statement that sets forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel with respect to the actions to be taken on appeal and what counsel did or did not represent to the respondent in this regard.furthermore,before allegations of ineffective assistance of former counsel are presented to the board,former counsel must be informed of the allegations and allowed the opportunity to respond.any subsequent response from counsel,or report of counsel failure or refusal to respond,should be submitted with the motion.finally,if it is asserted that prior counsel handling of the case involved a violation of ethical or legal responsibilities,the motion should reflect whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities regarding such representation,and if not,why not.
lozada,at emphasis added.
as the bia has itself noted,the primary rationale for the imposition of these requirements is to provide a basis for determining whether the assistance provided by counsel was,in fact,ineffective.lozada,at this high standard is necessary to have a basis for assessing the substantial number of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that come before the board.where essential information is lacking,it is impossible to evaluate the substance of such claim.a secondary purpose,as we have acknowledged,is to deter meritless claims.twum ins,cir.for both reasons,this court has firmly upheld the relevance of the lozada requirements.see zheng dep t of justice,cir.accordingly,w e have upheld the application of these requirements where appropriate.twum,at.in its role as gatekeeper,however,this court has not required a slavish adherence to the lozada requirements.yi long yang gonzales,cir.rather than,our aim has been balance.we have recognized that requiring strict compliance increases the danger of foreclosing those claims that are colorable and may be meritorious.see id.
in the case before us,it is undisputed that piranej satisfied all but one of the lozada requirements he informed his former counsel,lombardi,of the allegations against him.lombardi was given an opportunity,which he took,to respond to the allegations.and piranej filed a complaint with the departmental disciplinary committee it is the first lozada petitioner present an affidavit set ting forth in detail the agreement with former counsel,lozada,at is at issue in this appeal.
ii.the alleged relationship and the scope of an agreement under lozada 
a.the alleged relationship 
piranej affidavit outlines his ongoing relationship with his counsel.in,piranej met lombardi at his law office in astoria,new york.lombardi had been recommended to piranej by james hakanjan,the man who had assisted piranej with his original,flawed,asylum application lombardi described hakanjan as a prominent member of the albanian community,who would,from time to time,ask lombardi to see people and try to help them.at their october meeting,lombardi allegedly informed piranej that he would charge to represent him in his removal proceedings,and that piranej should bring on the hearing date and the balance of the would be payable on demand from time to time throughout the proceedings.no written agreement was entered into.
after a master hearing in late october,piranej paid lombardi in cash.piranej did not receive a receipt.at the october hearing,the case was adjourned until december,at which time piranej conceded his removability and sought political asylum and withholding of removal as relief.piranej next hearing was scheduled for march.piranej alleges that he made numerous calls to lombardi office in an attempt to prepare for that hearing,but that his messages were not returned.on the evening of march,piranej met with lombardi at a restaurant to discuss the case,and lombardi assured him not to worry and that he would take care of it.at the hearing on march,the ij denied piranej petitions for relief.according to piranej,a s soon as he and his fianc√©e left the courtroom,lombardi informed them that for him to do the appeal he wanted as soon as possible so that he could enter his appearance as piranej legal counsel before the deadline.a few days later,piranej went to lombardi new office,now in manhattan,to pay the money.it was at this meeting that lombardi allegedly advised the couple not to get married,due to the fact that piranej would have to leave the country prior to adjusting his status.
as of april,piranej had an appeal pending before the bia and,apparently,a balance outstanding to lombardi.after his wedding,piranej went to lombardi office,allegedly to take his files to another attorney,and told lombardi about his marriage piranej states that subsequently,in august,lombardi helped neza,piranej citizen wife,fill out and file an application,without any further fee.
in arguing that,given lombardi alleged earlier advice on the subject of marriage and its immigration consequences,lombardi should have advised him of the change in section i filing deadlines,piranej alleges facts indicating that the nature of his relationship with lombardi was that of a retainer agreement,under which lombardi was to provide general legal assistance to piranej in piranej efforts to avoid removal.and,in this respect,lombardi assistance to piranej wife in filing the application,without further fee,supports such a view of their relationship.
yet the exact parameters of this relationship are unclear.lombardi admits that in,he explained to piranej and his neza that the law required an alien to leave the united states in order to adjust his status following a marriage to a citizen.but he states that his agreement with piranej was only to represent piranej in his immigration proceedings.and notwithstanding his comments that he provided other clients with this information lombardi denies that he had any affirmative obligation to inform piranej of the change in the filing deadlines for section i.he describes his subsequent work on the filing as a favor to his client,artur piranej.
like the dissenting bia member,we believe that the exact nature of the relationship can only be determined after additional.hence,if that relationship could,on a plausible reading of the facts,satisfy lozada,a remand for factfinding would be necessary.it is this lozada question to which we therefore turn.
b.the scope of lozada agreement 
to examine this question properly,we must begin by looking at lozada itself,and at the possible type of agreement involved in that case.in doing so,we note that the bia in lozada prescribed the content of the aggrieved alien affidavit in light of the case before us,at a motion based upon a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be supported by an affidavit in the case before us,that affidavit should include a statement that sets forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with former counsel emphasis added,and therefore may have tailored the requirement to comport with the particular facts of lozada.what were these facts 
in lozada,the allegation made by petitioner was that,after filing a no
