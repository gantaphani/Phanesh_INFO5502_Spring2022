alejandro pled guilty to illegal reentry into the united states after deportation in violation of.on appeal,challenges his sentence.he contends that the district court erred by applying a enhancement to his offense level under based on his prior conviction for attempted kidnapping.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm sentence.
a indictment charged alejandro with illegally reentering the united states after deportation in violation of.the indictment noted that had previously been removed and deported from the united states subsequent to a conviction for felony attempted kidnapping in michigan state court in.pled guilty to the illegal reentry charge without the benefit of a plea agreement.at his rearraignment,the united states expressed its belief that would be subject to a enhancement to his base offense level under the guidelines at sentencing because his prior attempted kidnapping conviction qualified as a crime of violence under b a.indicated his intent to object to such an enhancement.the district court ordered the parties to brief the issue prior to sentencing.
the united states probation office prepared a presentence investigation report psr which calculated base offense level at as expected,the psr recommended a enhancement to offense level based on his prior michigan state court conviction.the psr also recommended a reduction due to acceptance of responsibility.with a total offense level of and a criminal history category iii,sentencing guideline range was to months.
at sentencing,the court heard oral arguments from the parties regarding the disputed guideline enhancement.after reviewing the michigan kidnapping statute at issue,the district court found that had been convicted of a crime of violence within the meaning of b a.the court further found that it could not consider the police report related to attempted kidnapping conviction in determining whether the offense qualified as a crime of violence.having determined that the psr correctly calculated his guideline range,the district court sentenced to months in prison.this appeal followed.
sentences imposed are reviewed for for procedural error in the calculation of the guideline range such as defendant asserts in this case.united states bartee,cir citing gall united states,d.this court reviews legal conclusions regarding the application of the united states sentencing guidelines de novo.united states hover,cir.accordingly,this court reviews de novo the question of whether attempted kidnapping conviction constitutes a crime of violence for the purposes of.see united states,fed.appx,wl cir,citing united states humphrey,f d,cir.
united states sentencing guideline a prescribes a base offense level of for those convicted of unlawfully entering the united states.section b a ii then directs that this offense level be increased sixteen levels if the defendant previously was deported after conviction for a felony that is a crime of violence.b a ii.the commentary defines the term crime of violence for purposes of this section to mean any of the following offenses under federal,state,or local law murder,manslaughter,kidnapping,aggravated assault or any other offense under federal,state,or local law that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.id.at,cmt.b iii emphasis added.the commentary further explains that p rior convictions of offenses counted under subsection b include the offenses of aiding and abetting,conspiring,and attempting,to commit such offenses.id.at,cmt.emphasis added.
on appeal,does not dispute that he was previously deported after a michigan conviction for attempted kidnapping.instead,he argues that the michigan statute under which he was convicted is broader than the generic kidnapping offense contemplated by the guidelines.accordingly,contends that the court must look further into the details of his conviction to determine whether he was necessarily convicted of generic kidnapping.specifically urges the court to examine the police report describing the incident that gave rise to the kidnapping charge and find that he did not commit a crime of violence.
in taylor united states,the supreme court considered whether burglary under missouri law constituted a violent felony for purposes of the armed career criminal act acca,and specifically e.if so,a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years in prison would apply to the defendant.see taylor,at e.the statute at issue defined violent felony to include any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that is burglary taylor,at quoting e b ii.the court,however,found that burglary in e must have some uniform definition independent of the labels employed by the various states criminal codes.id.at.specifically,the court found that congress meant by burglary the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most states.id.at.the court held that a person has been convicted of burglary for purposes of a e enhancement if he is convicted of any crime,regardless of its exact definition or label,having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into,or remaining in,a building or structure,with intent to commit a crime.id.at.
the taylor court then adopted a categorical approach for ascertaining whether a defendant is subject to an enhanced penalty under the acca.id.at.under this approach,the sentencing court is generally required to consider only the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense in determining whether the defendant has committed a violent felony.id.at.the court may not consider the particular facts underlying the conviction.id.at.
in circumstances in which the state statute defines the crime more broadly than the generic offense,however,a modified categorical approach applies.see united states de jesus ventura.then,according to taylor,the court may look beyond the statute and the fact of conviction to the indictment or information and jury instructions.taylor,at.the court must determine whether these documents show that the jury was required to find all elements of the generic offense in order to convict the defendant.id.in other words,the court still may not consider the details of the defendant crime.see id.at.the court may use these additional materials only to determine which crime within a statute the defendant committed,not how he committed that crime.see united states woods,cir emphasis in original.
the taylor court adopted the categorical approach in part to avoid the practical difficulties and potential unfairness of a broader factual inquiry.taylor,at.of a approach,the court asked,would the government be permitted to introduce the trial transcript before the sentencing court,or if no transcript is available,present the testimony of witnesses id.the court continued,if the sentencing court were to conclude,from its own review of the record,that the defendant actually committed a generic offense,could the defendant challenge this conclusion as abridging his right to a jury trial id.later,in shepard united states,the supreme court expanded on this reasoning,noting that allowing a sentencing judge to consider evidence of the facts of a prior offense raises the concerns underlying jones united states,and apprendi new jersey,u.specifically,it allows the sentencing judge to make a disputed finding of act about what the defendant and state judge must have understood as the factual basis of the prior plea shepard,at.the sixth and fourteenth amendments,however,guarantee a jury finding of any disputed fact essential to increase the ceiling of a potential sentence.id.
since taylor,this court has employed the categorical approach in determining whether an offense constitutes a crime of violence under,for purposes of the career offender provision,see united states arnold,cir,and in determining whether an offense constitutes a crime of violence for purposes of,see,fed.appx.at further,in shepard,the supreme court expressly extended taylor categorical approach to convictions following guilty pleas.at.accordingly,this court will employ the categorical approach in determining whether convi
