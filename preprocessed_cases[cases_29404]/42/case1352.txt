carlos petitions for review of an en banc decision of the board of immigration appeals denying his motion to reopen.the government did not initially oppose that motion.however,after the board granted permission to reopen,the government petitioned for en banc review by the entire board.the bia en banc decision reversed the decision to allow to reopen his motion.the en banc board held that had not established a prima facie case for relief under the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment the convention or the cat because he had not shown governmental acquiescence in the torturous conduct.for the reasons that follow,we will reverse the bia en banc decision and remand to the bia for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural history 
a husband and father of three,entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident in when he was only years old,and he has lived here continuously for the past years.in,he was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in state court in new jersey,for which he was sentenced to a period of incarceration of three and years.
as a result of that conviction,removal proceedings began against him in june.in,after a full hearing,an immigration judge found him removable and denied his application for section c hardship relief the ij considered the equities that presented,but concluded that the equities and the evidence of family hardship that would be caused by removal did not justify relief under section c.appealed the ij decision to the bia.the bia rejected his appeal in december.although the bia held that was removable in,the ins took no steps to remove him for several years.seven years later,on november,the ins issued a form,or letter requiring aliens with final removal orders to report for deportation by a specified date implementing the bia decision.
on july,was arrested on a warrant that issued after he failed to appear in response to the bag and baggage letter almost immediately thereafter,on july,he filed a motion with the bia asking it to reopen or reconsider the decision so that he could produce evidence that would establish his eligibility for relief under the cat.he argued that,due to changed country conditions since the ij decision,he would face an unacceptable risk of death or serious injury if removed to colombia.the record before the board included documentary evidence of the changed country conditions,including evidence of human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings carried out by the government,kidnapings by paramilitary and guerilla forces,and cooperation or collusion between such groups and the government 
the bia granted the motion to reopen in part,and denied it in part.the board relied on cyr,d to deny reopening section c application to present additional evidence of his rehabilitation during the seven years since the initial bia decision.however,the board granted the request for consideration of relief under the cat.the board explained 
he also wishes the hearing to be reopened so that he can apply for asylum and withholding of deportation to colombia he is barred from filing an asylum or cat application unless he can show changed circumstances in his country of nationality or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay.
the respondent has demonstrated changed circumstances in his country of nationality.the background information demonstrates a significant deterioration in society since his hearing.his claim that he belongs to a persecuted social group of foreign nationals or those perceived to be foreign nationals is supported by the reports submitted with this motion.therefore,we find he has made a prima facie case of a fear of persecution to qualify for asylum.however,there is little evidence that the government acquiesces in torture this issue should be developed at the hearing regarding whether he has not demonstrated a sic eligibility for relief under the convention against torture.see matter of,interim decision bia.
app.at.the board thereafter entered an order granting motion to reopen,and remanded the appeal to the ij for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.
the government responded to the bia partial grant of relief by petitioning for en banc reconsideration of the bia order.as summarized in the bia en banc decision,the department of homeland security dhs argued that application for relief was untimely,and that he had not set forth a prima facie case for eligibility under the cat since he did not show that he was more likely than not to face torture by those acting with the consent or acquiescence of public officials.citing a.
the en banc board rejected dhs claim that motion to reopen was untimely,stating we stand by our previous finding that the respondent can demonstrate changed country conditions as a basis for justifying the late filing of his application for relief.app.at.bia en banc decision.however,the en banc board nevertheless held that allowing to reopen was error because he had not established that the colombian government acquiesces to torture.the board explained 
the respondent,however,did not provide evidence of his prima facie eligibility for relief under the convention against torture because he failed to show that any harm that might befall him in colombia would be meted out by the government or by those acting with the consent or actual acquiescence of the government.a.protection under the convention against torture does not extend to those who are harmed by groups that the government is unable to control.see matter of,i n bia.
app.at bia en banc decision emphasis added.the board concluded that because the record contain ed little evidence that the colombian government acquiesces in torture of those perceived to be foreign,the respondent has failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief under the convention against torture,and,therefore,the motion to reopen should have been denied.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
then filed the instant petition for review of the en banc decision.he also filed for habeas corpus relief in the united states district court for the district of new jersey.he raised the following five claims for relief in his petition for review the government had waived any challenge to his prima facie case by failing to initially oppose his motion to reopen the bia erred in concluding that he had not established a prima facie case he was wrongly precluded from introducing additional evidence of his rehabilitation and seeking reconsideration of the bia decision the ins was precluded from enforcing the initial order of removal because of laches equitable estoppel and his underlying conviction should not be considered an aggravated felony for immigration purposes.
pursuant to a motion by the government,habeas petition was transferred from the district court to this court under the real id act of,div.b,stat.the real id act.his original petition for review is consolidated with the habeas petition which we must treat as a petition for review,and both are now before us.kamara att y,cir.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
jurisdiction 
under the real id act,a petition for review is now the exclusive means of judicial review of all orders of removal except those issued pursuant to b.see a.moreover,all habeas corpus petitions filed by aliens seeking relief from removal that were pending in the district courts on the date the real id act became effective may,were converted to petitions for review and transferred to the appropriate court of appeals.see a see also hernandez gonzales,cir 
accordingly,we now have before us two petitions for review.the first is the petition for review that filed in this court seeking review of the bia en banc denial of his motion to reopen.as noted,there,the en banc board denied the motion based upon its conclusion that he had not demonstrated prima facie eligibility for relief under the cat.the second is the converted habeas petition that originally filed in the district court,challenging the constitutionality of the removal proceedings.
standard of review 
although habeas corpus petition has now been converted to a petition for review,our standard of review remains the same.a review for constitutional claims or questions of law,as described in a a iii of the real id act,a d,mirrors our previously enunciated standard of review over an alien habeas petition.kamara,at.thus,we review constitutional and legal questions de novo,but defer to the bia reasonable interpretations of statutes it is charged with administering.ins,d chevron,natural res.def.council,d.
the same standard applies to petition for review under the real id act.prior to enactment of the real id act,we would not have had jurisdiction to review claim because an alien who was removable because of a conviction for an aggravated felony was statutorily barred from petitioning a court of appeals for review of the bia finding that he was ineligible for cat relief.see a c.however,the real id act eliminated that barrier as to constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals.see a d see also kamara,at noting that real id act jurisdictional grant regarding appeals by aggravated felons extends not just to legal determinations but also to application of law to facts.accordingly,we also afford de novo review to the bia en banc decision.
iii.discussion 
as noted above,the en banc bia reversed the order allowing to reopen his case because he failed to show that any harm that might befall him in colombia would be meted out by the government or by those acting with the consent or actual acquiescence of the government.app.at.citing a,and its earlier decision in matter of,i n bia.although raises four other issues in his petitions for review,inasmuch as we will vacate the en banc decision based upon its erroneous interpretation of the requirement for governmental acquiescence under the cat,we need not rule on his remaining claims.rather,we will dismiss them without prejudice to ability to raise those arguments on remand to the board 
a.the convention against torture 
the united states signed the convention against torture on april,and the senate ratified it on october.cong.rec,daily ed.it became binding on the united states in november of,after president clinton delivered the ratifying documents to the united nations.doc.iv convention.the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of farra initiated the implementation of the convention,div,tit.xxii,stat.codified at note.that provision provides in part that n o state shall expel,return refouler or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.id.accordingly,it became the policy of the united states not to expel or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture see also li ashcroft,cir.
an applicant for relief on the merits under article of the convention against torture bears the burden of establishing that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.sevoian ashcroft,cir quoting c.the united states senate specified this standard,as well as many of the other standards that govern relief under the convention,in the several understandings that it imposed on the united states ratification of the convention against torture.id.at citations omitted.unlike with asylum or withholding of removal,an alien seeking relief under the cat need not establish that is a refugee and therefore need not establish that torture is inflicted on account of any protected status.see amanfi ashcroft,cir a petition for protection under the convention against torture differs significantly from petitions for asylum or withholding of removal because the alien need not demonstrate that he will be tortured on account of a particular belief or immutable characteristic.rather,must establish a likelihood of being subjected to torturous acts inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.a emphasis added.
acquiescence of a public official requires that the public official,prior to the activity constituting torture,have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.a.if an alien produces sufficient evidence to satisfy that burden,withholding of removal or deferring of removal is mandatory.however,as shall become clear from our discussion,the alien need not establish actual knowledge by government officials of torturous conduct particular to the petitioner.
as noted at the outset,in denying motion to reopen,the en banc bia reversed the board decision.the en banc board relied upon the language of section a of the convention implementing regulations together with the board decision in matter of,i n bia.the board reasoned that had not established that any torture he might be subjected to would be meted out by the government or those acting with the consent or actual acquiescence of the government,and that the convention does not extend to those who are harmed by groups the government is unable to control.app.at emphasis added.
we can not accept the board conclusion that the acquiescence that must be established under the cat requires actual knowledge of torturous activity as required in matter of.similarly,although a government ability to control a particular group may be relevant to an inquiry into governmental acquiescence under the cat,that inquiry does not turn on a government ability to control persons or groups engaging in torturous activity.see,tunis gonzales,cir finding the issue of the sierra leone government ability to control torture by private individuals irrelevant where the torturous legal and to the government,thus concluding the applicant for relief under the cat had satisfied her burden.the cat does not require an alien to prove that the government in question approves of torture,or that it consents to it.rather,as the court concluded in zheng ashcroft,cir,an alien can satisfy the burden established for cat relief by producing sufficient evidence that the government in question is willfully blind to such activities.see id.holding that congress has made clear that the correct inquiry under the convention is whether an applicant can show that public officials demonstrate willful blindness to the torture of their citizens by third parties a closer look at the decision in zheng illustrates this point.
zheng,a native of china,petitioned for review of an immigration judge decision denying his claim for relief under the cat.zheng had introduced evidence that he had been smuggled out of china by snakeheads,professional smugglers who were part of an enormous organization that was very powerful and pervasive.at.an expert testified that people who failed to pay their debts to those smugglers faced death or torture including dismemberment.id.at.evidence showed that the people republic of china would not protect its citizens from the wrath of snakeheads because the existence of the snakeheads as a criminal syndicate was not acknowledged by the government.id.interceding on behalf of the syndicate victims would be tantamount to an admission that the syndicate existed and cause the government to lose face,which the chinese government simply was not going to do.id.ellipsis in original.
zheng testified that he was beaten and tortured by the snakeheads on board the boat bound for the united states and that he had been a material witness against some of these snakeheads in a criminal proceeding following his arrival in the continental united states from guam.id.at.he reported both the torture and the names of the seamen involved in transporting him from china to guam to united states officials.id.at.after doing so,he was approached by a snakehead while waiting to use the restroom and told to be careful as he might be dead for sure.id.although zheng had not feared reprisal while remaining under the protection of the united states government,he testified that if returned to china he would be killed or tortured by snakeheads or their associates and he therefore requested withholding of removal under the cat.the ij found that zheng had testified credibly.id.at.
to establish that the chinese government acquiesced in the actions of the snakeheads,zheng offered evidence of collusion between snakeheads and government officials.this included testimony about an instance where zheng saw snakeheads give three cartons of cigarettes to police at the harbor before his group was allowed to board the boat they were smuggled out on,and evidence of several instances of socializing between government officials and snakeheads.id.at.zheng argued that this established official participation in the smuggling.
the government opposed relief from removal,arguing that zheng testimony established nothing more than some collusion between local government or provincial officials,and that this did not establish acquiescence on the part of the chinese government.the government position was strengthened by a state department country report on china stating that it appeared to be taking active measures to target people smugglers and that several scores of people smugglers and government officials reportedly had been convicted,fired from jobs,or expelled from the communist party.id.at.
the ij rejected the government argument based upon his conclusion that zheng testimony established that the government acquiesced to torture within the meaning of the cat.the ij granted withholding of removal under the cat,explaining that zheng evidence established that the government condones or at least is not willing to interfere and,in a way,acquiesces to the smugglers conduct.id.the ins appealed to the bia.the issue presented to the bia was whether zheng failed to demonstrate acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity as required by.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the ins argued that the chinese government turning a blind eye to its citizens being smuggled out of the country was not tantamount to acquiescence to torture.id.at.the ins attempted to rigidly compartmentalize the illegal actions of the snakeheads by claiming that,
e ven if some chinese police take bribes to let refugees pass through checkpoints,this is a purely and relatively benign offense.it does not raise any inference whatsoever that such would be amenable to violence,that with prior knowledge they would allow the commission of acts of torture 
id.internal quotation marks and original brackets omitted,emphasis in original.the bia sustained the ins appeal,relying upon its decision in matter of.the bia concluded that even if factions within the chinese government colluded in the snakehead smuggling and took no action to stop it,that did not establish that the government acquiesced in torture.zheng petitioned for review to the court of appeals for the ninth circuit.
the resolution of zheng petition for review hinge d on the interpretation of the term acquiescence as used in.zheng,at emphasis in original.the court of appeals rejected the rationale of matter of,and held that the board interpretation of acquiescence impermissibly narrows congress clear intent in implementing relief under the convention against torture.id.the court concluded that zheng did not have to establish the government actual knowledge of torturous conduct as matter of required.rather,the court held that zheng could establish the requisite governmental acquiescence by showing that government officials were willfully blind to the activities of the snakeheads.we agree.we therefore reject the board reliance on matter of here.
in matter of,the bia reviewed the removal order of a colombian national who was residing in the united states as a lawful permanent resident when he was convicted of a crime of violence.the board concluded he was removable,and the alien sought relief arguing that,if returned to colombia,he would be in danger from nongovernmental guerrilla,narcotrafficking,and paramilitary groups in colombia he claimed that the guerillas finance their operations through kidnaping and that he would be a target for kidnapers because he had family in the united states and was unable to speak spanish correctly.i n at.he submitted country reports and newspaper articles detailing the violence,including kidnaping and a department of state travel warning stating that united states citizens have been the victims of threats,kidnaping,hijacking,and murder as well as other reports and documentation.id.
the bia ruled that not met his burden of demonstrating that he was eligible for relief under the cat because he had not shown that the colombian government failure to protect its citizens was the result of deliberate acceptance of the guerillas activities.id.at.the board noted that torturous conduct must be inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.id.at quoting a.
zheng rejection of matter of clarified the correct standard for acquiescence as set forth in the legislative history of the enactment of the cat.a brief review of the convention implementing legislation confirms that congress intended that relief under the convention not be limited to situations where public officials have actual knowledge of torturous activity.
the cat was submitted to the senate by president ronald reagan for advice and consent on may.see exec,at.along with the convention,the president proposed conditions,including an understanding that acquiescence meant that the public official,prior to the activity constituting torture,must have knowledge of such activity and thereafter breach his legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.khouzam ashcroft,cir emphasis added quoting exec,at.however,upon review of the proposed conditions,the senate foreign relations committee was concerned that knowledge was too limiting and created the impression that the united states was not serious in its commitment to end torture worldwide.see also exec,at.these concerns were addressed two years later when the first president bush administration submitted a revised and reduced list of proposed conditions.id.the revised list contained an understanding of the definition of acquiescence that required that an official have only awareness of the torturous activity,rather than knowledge.id.
the senate foreign relations committee reported that this change was intended to make it clear that both actual knowledge and willful blindness fall within the definition of the term acquiescence.the senate adopted a resolution of advice and consent to ratification of the convention on october,subject to the revised reservations,understandings,and declarations.
khouzam,at quotations and citations omitted emphasis added.the regulations reflect this intention.see a requiring awareness,not knowledge of torturous activity.notably,when president clinton ultimately deposited the instrument of ratification with the united nations on october,he included the senate understandings in the instrument of ratification.see.
as noted above,farra implements obligations under the cat,div,tit.xxii,stat.codified at note.the first section of farra,a,contains a general statement of congressional policy not to return persons to countries where there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture the following section,b,which substantively implements the convention,directs the heads of the appropriate agencies to prescribe regulations to implement the obligations of the united states under article of the convention,subject to any reservations,understandings,declarations,and provisos contained in the united states senate resolution of ratification of the convention.note.hence,the convention and its accompanying regulations must be read in conjunction with the understandings prescribed by the senate,which make clear that the definition of acquiescence includes both actual knowledge and willful blindness.
as in zheng,the court in khouzam also recognized the import of the implementing legislat
