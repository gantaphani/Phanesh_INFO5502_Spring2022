rigoberto vladimir del cid marroquin petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his application for protection under the convention against torture cat.we have jurisdiction,see a garcia lynch,cir,and deny the petition.we write principally to elucidate our conclusion that del cid marroquin removal from the united states did not moot his petition.
del cid marroquin,a native of el salvador,illegally entered the united states with his family in,when he was eight years old.ten years later,he was convicted of two counts of attempted murder under california law.he served eighteen and a half years of two consecutive life sentences.
the department of homeland security dhs initiated expedited removal proceedings when del cid marroquin was released from prison in.because of his convictions,del cid marroquin was ineligible for all forms of relief except deferral of removal under cat.although an immigration officer concluded that del cid marroquin did not have a reasonable fear of being tortured in el salvador,an immigration judge ij reversed that determination and placed him in proceedings to adjudicate his cat claim.
del cid marroquin claim was based on his status as a former gang member.during his time in the united states,he had joined a predominantly mexican gang operating in his neighborhood and acquired at least one tattoo.although he had renounced his gang affiliation while in prison,he testified that if he returned to el salvador,he feared being tortured by the national police pnc or vigilante groups as part of a nationwide crackdown on gang activity.he further testified that he feared harm from powerful gangs in el salvador,who might view him as a traitor because of his former membership in a rival gang,his presumed status as a prison informant,or his efforts to convince other gang members to change their ways.he described three interactions with salvadoran gang members during his incarceration that he perceived as threats on his life should he return to el salvador.
in support of del cid marroquin claim,thomas ward testified as an expert on social and political conditions in el salvador,particularly with respect to gang activity.he explained that the salvadoran government has enacted legislation known generally as the mano dura firm hand initiative granting pnc officers broad powers to search for,arrest,and detain possible gang members.ward testified that he had heard accounts of officers beating detainees,although he did not know the details of any specific incidents.he further conceded that not all officers engage in such conduct a s in any organization,there are some who follow the rules and some who do.
ward testified that in the and,many pnc officers who did follow the rules joined death squads that abducted,tortured and killed gang members.he claimed to have seen reports that these vigilante groups were resurfacing,but could not speak to how they determine who a potential victim is.ward opined that there was a distinct possibility that del cid marroquin could be tortured by either pnc officers or a death squad,but was unable to say that it was more likely than not.
ward further opined that del cid marroquin had an over percent chance of being beaten,physically assaulted,tortured or killed by enemy gang members because of his past affiliation with what they consider to be an enemy gang.he stated that pnc would be unable to protect him from gang violence because it is understaffed,inefficient and corrupt,and because the general attitude of law enforcement to people who have gang tattoos is that they are members of a gang and,therefore,they get what they deserve.
the ij denied del cid marroquin application for cat relief.although he considered ward testimony,he found it too anecdotal to support the conclusion that del cid marroquin would more likely than not be tortured in el salvador.he further found that the salvadoran government did not acquiesce in violence by either vigilante groups or gangs because it was taking steps to correct the situation.
the bia affirmed in a reasoned decision.it concluded that del cid marroquin had not presented sufficient evidence establishing that it is more likely than not that he would be subject to torture upon return to el salvador,at the instigation of,or with the consent or acquiescence of,the government.it cited a state department issue paper introduced before the ij for the propositions that it is not the policy of the salvadoran police to arrest or abuse someone for having a tattoo,there have been no reports of police carrying out extrajudicial killings of gang members,and any police involvement in such killings would violate salvadoran policy.see bureau of democracy,human rights labor,department of state,issue paper youth gang organizations in el salvador.it agreed with the ij that a government does not acquiesce to torture where the government actively,albeit not entirely successfully,combats the illegal activities.
del cid marroquin petitioned for review on may.after another panel of this court denied his request for a stay,he was removed to el salvador on november.
del cid marroquin removal requires us to ask whether his petition is moot.as the supreme court recently reiterated,i f an intervening circumstance deprives the plaintiff of a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit,at any point during litigation,the action can no longer proceed and must be dismissed as moot.campbell ewald gomez,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.a case becomes moot,however,only when it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
in the immigration context,we have held that a petition for review is mooted by the petitioner removal from the united states unless there is some remaining collateral consequence that may be redressed by success on the petition.abdala ins,cir.in kaur holder,cir,we rejected an argument that a ban on reentry into the united states constituted a collateral consequence because the petition for review did not challenge the basis for the ban.see id.at.by contrast,in blandino medina holder,cir,we held that the petitioner removal did not moot his petition because a favorable ruling would have made it possible at least hypothetically for him to obtain a waiver of the ban on reentry.see id.at.
del cid marroquin removal subjects him to the ban on reentry for removed aliens.see a ii.however,he is also inadmissible by virtue of his convictions,which resulted in two life sentences.see id.a b.he is not eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility.see id.h.thus,success on his petition would have no effect on his future admissibility to the united states.
we directed the parties to submit supplemental briefs identifying any other possible collateral consequences.in response,the government asserted that dhs might parole del cid marroquin into the united states if he prevailed on his cat claim.although the regulation it cited,does not specifically deal with removed aliens,dhs does have a policy facilitating the return,in certain circumstances,of removed aliens whose petitions for review are granted.see ice policy directive,pursuant to the policy,the government will,a bsent extraordinary circumstances,facilitate the return of a removed alien whose petition for review is granted if either the circuit court decision restores the alien to lawful permanent resident lpr status,or the alien presence is necessary for continued administrative removal proceedings.id.in addition,it will facilitate the return of a removed alien whose pfr was granted and who is granted relief by the executive office for immigration review or dhs allowing him or her to reside in the united states lawfully.id.
we solicited a second round of supplemental briefing to ascertain how ice policy directive would apply to del cid marroquin.in a letter brief dated april,the government stated that ice ordinarily would facilitate the return of an alien who prevailed on a petition for review challenging the denial of cat protection if the court of appeals directed an outright grant of cat protection.in
