wang is a chinese immigrant who has been ordered removed from the united states to china as a result of his unlawful entry into the united states and his subsequent robbery conviction.wang sought relief from removal during his deportation proceedings on the ground that his removal would violate the united states obligations under article of the united nations convention against torture cat the immigration judge denied wang cat claim on september,and the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the denial on april.wang subsequently filed a petition for habeas corpus pursuant to,arguing that he is entitled to relief from deportation under cat and the government has violated his due process rights by continuing to detain him during the course of the deportation proceedings without providing him with a bond hearing.the united states district court for the district of connecticut gerard goettel,judge,of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,sitting by designation held that it had jurisdiction to entertain wang cat claim,wang was not entitled to relief under cat because he failed to establish that he is more likely than not to be tortured if returned to china,and wang continued detention without a bond hearing does not violate his procedural due process rights.
background 
relevant law 
the united nations convention against torture has been in effect in the united states since november,article of the convention provides in relevant part that n o state party shall expel,return or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.in order to implement this provision,congress passed the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of farra,div.g,title xxii,stat,codified as note to,which states that 
i t shall be the policy of the united states not to expel,extradite,or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture,regardless of whether the person is physically present in the united states.
farra b provides that the heads of the appropriate agencies shall prescribe regulations to implement the obligations of the united states under article of the united nations convention against torture.in accordance with b,the justice department,after the requisite proceedings,promulgated a series of regulations implementing farra.see.these regulations require the immigration and naturalization service ins to grant protection under cat whenever it determines that an alien is more likely than not to be tortured in the country of removal,c,but the burden of proof is on the applicant to prove that he or she is more likely than not to be tortured if removed,c.torture is defined as 
any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession,punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed,or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person,or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind,when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.
a.the regulations further provide that t orture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment,a,and i n order to constitute torture,an act must be specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering,a.
additionally,the regulations expressly state that t orture does not include pain or suffering arising only from,inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.a.lawful sanctions include judicially imposed sanctions and other enforcement actions authorized by law,including the death penalty,but they do not include sanctions that defeat the object and purpose of the convention against torture to prohibit torture.id.
accordingly,an alien is not entitled to cat relief unless he can prove that,upon being returned to his country of origin,he is more likely than not to suffer cruel and inhuman treatment that either is not lawfully sanctioned by that country or is lawfully sanctioned by that country,but defeats the object and purpose of cat.
procedural history 
wang,a old native and citizen of china,entered the united states in june without being lawfully admitted or paroled.on july,he was convicted in the superior court in new haven,connecticut of two felonies robbery in the first degree and unlawful restraint in the first degree,in violation of connecticut general statute a and,respectively.he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten years five years to be served,five years to be suspended on the robbery conviction and one year on the unlawful restraint conviction.
wang was serving his criminal sentence when,on april,the ins instituted removal proceedings against him pursuant to a a i,a a i i and a a iii of the immigration and nationality act ina,a a i,a a i i,a a i i,iii,based on his status as an alien present in the united states without having been admitted or paroled and upon his status as an alien ineligible for parole by the ins as a result of his conviction for a crime of moral turpitude and an aggravated felony.following a hearing before an immigration judge on january,at which wang appeared pro se,wang was ordered removed to china pursuant to a a iii because he had been convicted of an aggrated felony,pursuant to a a i i,because he had been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude and pursuant to a a i,because he was present in the united states without being admitted or paroled.
wang appealed this decision to the bia,asking for political asylum and withholding of deportation under cat on the ground that,if returned to china,he would be executed as a traitor for deserting the chinese army and his family would be severely persecuted for aiding in his desertion.the bia remanded the case on september,because the immigration judge had failed to inform the parties of the legal basis for his decision on the cat and asylum claims in his january,order.
on remand,the immigration judge held another hearing,and,on october,he issued a decision concluding that,because robbery in the first degree is an aggravated felony under a g of the ina,a g wang is ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to ina c,c.the immigration judge held further that wang was not eligible for any other form of relief from deportation presumably including cat relief and ordered him deported to china.
wang again appealed his removal order to the bia.on april,the bia issued a decision upholding the immigration judge determination that wang was ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under ina c on the ground that,prior to the initiation of removal proceedings against wang,c had been repealed by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act,iirira,b,stat.at codified at note to.the bia also held that wang was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal under ina,and ina,formerly because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony for which he was sentenced to more than five years of imprisonment.additionally,the bia found that,at the time of his decision on october,the immigration judge correctly determined that he did not have authority to entertain wang claim for cat relief because there was no legislation implementing article of cat.but,because congress had subsequently enacted farra,which instructs the attorney general to adopt regulations implementing the united states obligations under article of cat,and because the attorney general had published interim rules pursuant to farra,the bia remanded the case to the immigration judge for consideration of wang cat claim.
on august,the immigration judge held a hearing to address wang claim for cat relief during this hearing,wang now represented by counsel testified that,while still living in china,he had been drafted into the chinese military.he asserted that he lived on a military base where he was forced to sleep on wooden boards on the ground,there were no showers,and the food supply and medical care were insufficient.wang testified that,in,he tried to escape,but was captured and returned to the base,where he was beaten in the head with a rifle butt,kicked,and punched until he became unconscious.he claims that,as a result of this beating,he has scars on his eyes and problems with his vision.wang testified that,following this incident,he was told by his lieutenant that he would be beaten to death if he ever tried to escape again 
during the hearing,the government asked wang why he had not mentioned this beating in his earlier applications for asylum,see note,ante,and why his sister and,whom he claimed were lawful residents of the united states,had not come forward to support his claims.wang maintained that other people prepared his earlier asylum applications for him because he could not speak or write english,and that he was advised not to tell the ins about his desertion from the chinese army.he gave an assortment of explanations for the failure of his relatives to testify on his behalf,including that it was too far for them to travel without missing work,that they could not drive,that they could not speak english,and that they do not like to deal with other people.
on september,the immigration judge denied wang application for relief under cat,finding that wang had not testified credibly and,therefore,had not met his burden of proof in establishing the statutory and regulatory requirements for cat relief.accordingly,he once again ordered wang removed.
again,wang appealed his removal to the bia,and,on april,the bia affirmed the immigration judge decision and dismissed wang appeal.bia decision dated april,bia decision.in the beginning of its decision,the bia declared that we agree with the immigration judge that the respondent has not met his burden of proof,but we do not affirm the immigration judge decision on the basis of an adverse credibility finding.bia decision at.instead,the bia held that 
i n light of the regulations implementing the convention against torture,it is incumbent upon the respondent to show that the threats of death were more than the threat of a lawfully imposed sanction under chinese law that would not defeat the purposes of the convention,and the respondent has not established the contours of chinese law,let alone how the imposition of such a law would defeat the purposes of the convention against torture.
id.at.it went on to hold that,i n this case,there is no evidence in the record that china tortures deserters from its military.id.the bia added that it was hesitant to ascribe the respondent characterization of torture to military discipline without more specific evidence,and concluded that,upon the evidence presented,wang has not established that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if he is removed to china.id.
on may,wang filed a petition in this court for review of the final order of removal,but on august,we approved a stipulation and order by the parties to withdraw the petition for review from active consideration.the stipulation provided that the petition would be deemed withdrawn with prejudice if it was not reinstated within thirty days after we issued the mandate in ins,cir.argued,the mandate in issued on june,and wang never reinstated his petition.accordingly,pursuant to our order of august,approving of the parties stipulation,wang may,petition for review was dismissed with prejudice as of july.
wang has been detained by the ins since he was paroled in from his state criminal sentence.on october,the ins conducted a custody status review hearing,see,and determined that wang should not be released from custody.in a written decision,the ins officer justified his decision to detain wang on the following grounds his conviction was for a crime of violence in which a weapon was utilized,he failed to submit documentation of his employment history,educational background,vocational training,or close family ties in the united states,the letter from his sponsor with whom he would reside if released gave the same address at which he resided when he was arrested,and his sworn statement that he would rather stay here in jail than be killed or beaten and starved in china indicated that he would not surrender to the ins if released.the written decision stated that wang custody status would be reviewed again in six months.
on july,wang filed the instant petition for habeas corpus pursuant to in the district of connecticut,claiming that the bia erred in denying him relief pursuant to article of cat because it erroneously determined that military discipline can never constitute torture under cat and his continued detention without an opportunity for a bond hearing before an article iii court has deprived him of his fifth amendment right to due process of law.in response,the ins asserted that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider wang cat claim pursuant to because farra expressly stripped federal courts of such jurisdiction and,in the alternative,wang claim is without merit because both the immigration judge and the bia determined that he lacks credibility.the government also argued that,pursuant to the supreme court decision in zadvydas davis,d,wang continued detention without a bond hearing has not violated his constitutional right to due process of law.
on december,the district court entered judgment in favor of the ins and denied wang petition for habeas relief.as an initial matter,the court held that it had jurisdiction to consider wang cat claims because nothing in the language of farra or its legislative history indicates that congress clearly intended to forbid habeas review under.wang ashcroft,civ.glg,dist.lexis,at.the court reasoned that a bsent a statement of such clear congressional intent and guided by the supreme court holding s in ins cyr,d and,this court has jurisdiction under to hear petitioner legal challenges to his removal.id.
with respect to the merits of wang cat claim,the district court found no error in the bia unwilling ness to ascribe the petitioner characterization of torture to military discipline without more specific evidence.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court explained that 
the bia did not hold that military sanctions can never violate cat,as petitioner suggests.instead,it recognized that punishment inflicted upon military personnel for desertion was a lawful sanction.it further found that petitioner had failed to carry his burden of proving that he would face punishment above and beyond that lawfully imposed,or that the punishment he would receive would defeat the underlying purposes of cat.
id.at.it found no error in either the standard applied by the bia or the bia determination that wang had failed to carry his burden of proof.
finally,the district court evaluated wang due process claim under the balancing test set forth by the supreme court in mathews eldridge,d,for procedural due process challenges id.at.it determined that wang interest in freedom from incarceration wa s minimal because wang appeal to this court was his only remaining opportunity for relief from removal.id.at.it also found that wang does not face the prospect of an extended period of detention without the opportunity for a bail hearing because the government stated that it would be prepared to remove wang within thirty days of a final ruling on his habeas petition.id.at.the court further concluded that there is little probability of error,that the government has a substantial interest in safeguarding the public from criminal aliens and in ensuring that criminal aliens,who have an obvious motivation to flee,will be present when it is time for them to be removed,and that wang has already received at least one or more custody status review hearings at which it was determined that he posed a threat or danger to the community and a flight risk.id.at.for all of these reasons,the district court held that wang continued detention without an opportunity for bail had not deprived him of his fifth amendment right to due process of law.
on december,wang timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.standard of review 
in reviewing a district court denial of a habeas petition brought pursuant to,we examine both the merits of the petition and questions pertaining to subject matter jurisdiction de novo.kuhali reno,cir.
iii.convention against torture claim 
jurisdiction 
c authorizes a district court to grant a writ of habeas corpus whenever a petitioner is in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states.unless a treaty is,however,it does not,in and of itself,create individual rights that can give rise to habeas relief.see,columbia marine services,reffet,cir an action arises under a treaty only when the treaty expressly or by implication provides for a private right of action.the treaty must be,it must prescribe rules by which private rights may be determined.internal quotation marks,alteration,and citation omitted dreyfus von finck,cir it is only when a treaty is,when it proscribes rules by which private rights may be determined,that it may be relied upon for the enforcement of such rights.
wang concedes,as he must,that cat is not a treaty.see cong.rec.daily ed,statement of terry sanford,wl,rendering the advice and consent of the senate in ratifying cat subject to the declaration that the provisions of articles through of the convention are not see also treaty doc,at letter of transmittal from the president of the united states,recommending that the senate adopt the accompanying cat along with a declaration that the convention is not.instead,he argues that,by authorizing the attorney general to promulgate regulations implementing the united states obligations under cat,farra creates individual rights based on cat that may be enforced by a writ of habeas corpus.
but,as the government notes,farra expressly states that 
n otwithstanding any other provision of law,nothing in this section shall be construed as providing any court jurisdiction to consider or review claims under the convention or this section except as part of the review of a final order of removal pursuant to section of the immigration and nationality act.
farra d,stat.emphasis added.
wang argues that this restrictive language is insufficient to repeal habeas jurisdiction with respect to the rights created by farra.the district court agreed,citing,inter alia,the supreme court decision in ins cyr,d.
in cyr,the supreme court held that the provisions of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa and iirira,see aedpa d,stat.iirira b,stat,which prevent certain classes of aliens from obtaining judicial review of their removal orders,do not deprive federal courts of jurisdiction to consider challenges by such aliens to their removal orders raised in habeas petitions.the court held that i mplications from statutory text or legislative history are not sufficient to repeal habeas jurisdiction instead,congress must articulate a specific and unambiguous statutory directive to effect a repeal.cyr,at.because aedpa and iirira only expressly repeal judicial review or jurisdiction to review generally,and do not explicitly mention habeas corpus jurisdiction,the supreme court held that they did not repeal jurisdiction.in particular,even though e of aedpa is entitled elimination of custody review by habeas corpus,the court found that this provision was insufficient to repeal jurisdiction because n either the title nor the text makes any mention of.id.at.similarly,the court held that,because n either relevant provision of iirira explicitly mentions habeas,or neither provision speaks with sufficient clarity to bar jurisdiction pursuant to the general habeas statute.at.footnotes omitted.
accordingly,the supreme court decision in cyr makes clear that a statute must,at a minimum,explicitly mention either habeas corpus or in order to limit or restrict jurisdiction.because farra does not expressly mention either habeas corpus or,it does not meet the requirements set forth in cyr,at,for the elimination of jurisdiction.see seifert,cir holding that t he farr act of did not limit habeas corpus review because a ny limitation of federal habeas corpus must be by express command and farra makes no mention of habeas corpus review internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the district court was therefore correct to hold that it had jurisdiction to consider wang cat claims 
in reaching this conclusion,we are able to avoid serious constitutional concerns that would be raised if farra prohibited petitioners from bringing cat claims in petitions.farra d only permits review of claims for cat relief as part of the review of a final order of removal pursuant to section of the immigration and nationality act.ina permits aliens who have been ordered removed by the immigration court to petition federal courts of appeals for review of their removal orders.see generally.but such review is prohibited for certain classes of criminal aliens,including those who have been convicted of an aggravated felony.see a c.accordingly,absent habeas review,aggravated felons like wang have no opportunity to seek review in federal court of ins decisions denying them cat relief.
in ins,cir,aff,d,we addressed whether,following the implementation of iirira,federal courts maintained habeas jurisdiction over challenges brought by aggravated felons to executive removal orders.we held that 
w ithout habeas jurisdiction to review final orders,there is currently no judicial review at all of a removal order issued against a who is ordered removable because he or she committed a certain crime.because habeas jurisdiction is constitutionally required where the immigration laws have been interpreted to bar other forms of judicial review under a c,our decision that habeas review remains for a criminal alien legal challenge to his or her deportation order obviates the profound constitutional questions that would arise if we concluded that all judicial review had been eradicated by iirira.
id.the supreme court affirmed this decision,finding that leaving aliens without a forum would raise serious constitutional questions.at.similarly,in cyr,the supreme court noted that a construction of aedpa and iirira that would entirely preclude review of a pure question of law by any court would give rise to substantial constitutional questions.at.
because,under the test set forth by the supreme court in cyr,farra does not speak with sufficient clarity to exclude cat claims from jurisdiction,we are able to avoid the serious constitutional concerns that would have arisen if farra had explicitly excluded cat claims from 
in sum,federal courts have jurisdiction under to consider claims arising under cat,as implemented by farra and the regulations promulgated thereunder 
scope of habeas review 
even if we have habeas jurisdiction over cat claims generally,the government argues that wang claims do not fall within the scope of our review.in particular,it asserts that aedpa and iirira have limited the scope of habeas review of removal orders to purely legal questions of statutory interpretation.accordingly,it maintains that we may not consider wang cat claim because it essentially challenge s the factual determinations made by the bia and immigration judge.gov t br.at.we disagree.
wang does not merely contest the immigration court factual challenges its application of the facts to farra and the regulations adopted pursuant to farra.in cyr,the supreme court recognized that the suspension clause requires habeas review of claims based upon the erroneous application of statutes the court explained that at the absolute minimum,the suspension clause protects the writ as it existed in,at.internal citation and quotation marks omitted,and at that time the use of the writ encompassed detentions based on errors of law,including the erroneous application or interpretation of statutes,id.at emphasis added.
in henderson ins,cir,we concluded that iirira and aedpa were intended to make administrative decisions regarding removal nonreviewable to the fullest extent possible under the constitution.id.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.but,because the constitution requires habeas review to extend to claims of erroneous application or interpretation of statutes,cyr,at,neither aedpa nor iirira could have excluded such claims from the scope of habeas review.accordingly,wang argument on appeal challenging the bia application of the particular facts in this case to the relevant law falls within the permissible scope of habeas review.
merits of wang cat claim 
the bia expressly stated that it did not affirm the immigration judge decision on the basis of an adverse credibility finding.bia decision at.instead,it denied wang cat claim because there is no evidence in the record that china tortures deserters from its military.id.at.this determination is not simply a factual is based upon an application of the facts to the legal standard set forth in.see section i a,ante.
since the enactment of aedpa and iirira,we have not had occasion to articulate a standard for reviewing,in a habeas setting,an application of facts to law by the bia.the district court applied a deferential,substantial evidence standard of review.wang,dist.lexis,at.however,in addressing a direct petition for review of a decision of the bia w hen the situation presented is the bia application of legal principles to undisputed facts,rather than its underlying determination of those facts or its interpretation of its governing statutes,our review of the bia asylum and withholding of deportation determinations is de novo.diallo ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
although the standard of review of a bia decision in a habeas case is generally more limited than on direct review,heikkila barber,in this case we need not decide the precise standard to adopt for reviewing a bia application of law to fact pursuant to a petition even if our standard of review pursuant to affords no more deference to the bia than on direct other words,even if our review here is de find no error in the bia analysis.
under c,wang bore the burden of proving that,as a result of his military desertion,he is more likely than not to be tortured if removed to china.the bia held that wang failed to meet this burden because,i n this case,there is no evidence in the record that china tortures deserters from its military.bia decision at.we agree.wang submitted no evidence that military deserters generally are tortured in china.instead,wang relies upon his own anecdotal testimony regarding the following allegations that he was beaten for his first desertion attempt,that he was told he would be beaten to death if he deserted again,that he was likely to be imprisoned if returned to china,and that persons he knew had not fared well in chinese prisons.
but this testimony is not sufficient to establish that wang is more likely than not to be tortured if returned to china imprisonment of military deserters does not inherently constitute torture.and,while wang testimony as well as some of his country conditions documents see note,ante indicate that some prisoners in china have been tortured,wang has in no way established that someone in his particular alleged circumstances is more likely than not to be tortured if imprisoned in china moreover,although the bia was bound to consider any past torture inflicted upon wang by chinese officials,c,wang failed to establish that his alleged previous beating was anything more than a deviant practice carried out by one rogue military official.and there is no evidence in the record that wang would be placed under the supervision of that same lieutenant if returned to china.for this same reason,wang has failed to establish that his lieutenant alleged threat that he would be beaten to death if he deserted again is more likely than not to be carried out upon his return.in sum,none of the evidence relied upon by wang establishes that he is more likely than not to be tortured if returned to china,and,like the bia and the district court,w ithout more specific evidence,we are not persuaded by wang arguments.bia decision at see also wang,dist.lexis,at.
wang argued before the district court that the bia erred by holding that military discipline can never constitute torture under cat.as the district court properly determined,this argument radically misconstrued the holding of the bia.id.at.because wang does not advance this particular argument on appeal,however,we need not address it in depth.
on appeal,wang asserts that the bia erred because it imposed a heavier burden of proof on cat applicants who claim to have been tortured in the context of military discipline.but in making this argument,wang misconstrues the bia opinion.the bia stated 
we do not question the respondent evidence that there has been torture in china,nor do we question his characterizations of that torture.however,there is no evidence in the record that china tortures deserters from its military and we are hesitant to ascribe general conditions to the specific condition of a military deserter.furthermore,we are hesitant to ascribe the respondent characterization of torture to military discipline without more specific evidence.
id.this language makes clear that the bia did not impose a heavier burden in the context of military discipline.instead,the bia declined to extend wang evidence of torture by the government of china in other contexts to the specific context of military discipline,and it denied wang cat relief because he presented no evidence that the chinese government tortures military deserters in particular.accordingly,the bia properly held that wang failed to show that,if returned to china,he is more likely than not to be tortured as a result of his military desertion.
iv.due process claim 
wang argues that the government has violated the due process clause of the fifth amendment by holding him in detention since his release from state custody in without affording him a bond hearing before an article iii court.to remedy this asserted violation of the due process clause,wang requests that we enter an order directing the district court to grant him a bond hearing as soon as possible.
the district court treated wang claim as one of procedural due process and,therefore,analyzed it under the test for procedural due process challenges set forth by the supreme court in mathews eldridge,d.on appeal,wang does not challenge the district court application of the balancing test set forth in mathews.instead,wang argues that the district court erred because it did not address the supreme court decisions concerning the fifth amendment substantive due process component as it affects aliens.br.for appellant at emphasis added.accordingly,we will analyze wang claim as one of substantive,rather than procedural,due process.
ina,governs the detention of aliens subject to final orders of removal.it provides that,in general,the attorney general shall remove the alien from the united states within a period of days of the final removal order,ina a a,a a,and that d uring the removal period,the attorney general shall detain the alien,ina a,a.it further provides that certain classes of aliens,including inadmissible aliens and criminal aliens,shall continue to be subject to supervision even after the day period expires if they have not yet been removed.ina a,a.the ins has interpreted the term supervision to include detention,and has maintained in the past that ina sets no limit on the length of time beyond the removal period that an alien who falls within one of the section a categories may be detained.zadvydas davis,d quoting brief for petitioners in zadvydas.
in zadvydas,the supreme court was faced with the challenge of reconciling ina apparent authorization of indefinite executive detention with the due process clause of the fifth amendment id.in order to save from unconstitutionality,the supreme court held that once removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable,continued detention is no longer authorized by statute.id.at.the court stated that detention is presumptively reasonable for six months following a final removal order,and that,after the first six months,detention violates if an alien demonstrates that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future and the government is unable to rebut this showing.id.at.
because the
