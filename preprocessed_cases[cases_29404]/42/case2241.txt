the supreme court decision in kimbrough united states,d,taken together with other recent cases,has rekindled debate about whether sentencing disparities created by programs can be considered by district court judges in districts when crafting individual sentences.we address that issue today.because both cases present the same issue on appeal,we consolidate them for the purpose of our review.
in the first case,jaime pled guilty for illegally the united states after he had been removed twice following a conviction for the aggravated felony of robbery.the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment,the most lenient sentence available under the applicable guideline range for his offense level and criminal history category.in the second case,pedro pled guilty to illegally the united states after being removed following a conviction for the aggravated felony of domestic battery.the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment,which was at the lowest end of the guidelines range for his offense level and criminal history category.
in both cases,the district court refused to even consider imposing sentences,thereby refuting defendants claims that they should receive lesser sentences based on comparisons to sentences imposed on similarly situated individuals prosecuted in districts.both defendants ask us on appeal to abandon our precedent and provide district courts with the latitude to consider sentences as part of their u.a analyses.for reasons stated below,we grant their requests.we therefore vacate both sentences and remand to the district court for resentencing.
background 
case,jaime 
jamie is a native and citizen of mexico.in,he was convicted of robbery in the united states,an aggravated felony,and sentenced to four years in prison.one year following his conviction,he was released from prison and removed to mexico.he returned to the united states shortly thereafter,but he was again removed to mexico in.in july of,authorities found once again in the united states without permission from the attorney general.
following his arrest,was indicted for and pled guilty to illegally the united states after being removed in violation of a and b.the report psr calculated advisory guideline range at to months imprisonment based on a total offense level of and a criminal history category of ii.
prior to the sentencing hearing,submitted a sentencing memorandum objecting to the psr and requesting a range sentence of equivalent of a reduction from the psr total offense level of.argued that the district lack of a program created an unwarranted sentencing disparity,and that the court had authority to consider and grant a departure under kimbrough.argued that geography was the only difference between him and other defendants who received lower sentences.
at the sentencing hearing,judge delivered a comprehensive oral statement addressing his consideration of the sentencing factors in,as well as the parties oral and written submissions.the judge then addressed sentencing disparity argument.citing united states,cir,the judge said that the seventh circuit has addressed and rejected this very argument,concluding that such discrepancies or disparities are not unreasonable.app.at.the judge then sentenced to months imprisonment,the lowest end of the advisory guidelines range.
case,pedro 
pedro case is factually similar to and presents the same issue on appeal.is a mexican citizen who was arrested in for theft and illegal following removal pursuant to a conviction of domestic battery,an aggravated felony,in violation of a.he waived the indictment and pled guilty pursuant to a plea declaration.
the imprisonment guideline range for was to months,based on a total offense level of and a criminal history category of vi.requested a sentence of months,arguing that under a,a sentence would create an unwarranted disparity with similar defendants in districts.he also argued that the district court had authority under a parsimony clause to consider the existence of disparities created by programs when determining an appropriate sentence.
judge kennelly entered a memorandum opinion discussing request for a sentence.although judge kennelly found that he was bound by our decisions in and united states,cir and was not therefore permitted to take into account the opined that as a matter of policy it is unjust to permit sentencing disparities based on the fortuity of the judicial district in which a defendant in an illegal reentry case is charged.app.at.was sentenced to months imprisonment,the bottom of the guidelines range.

on appeal,we review a district court sentence for reasonableness,united states booker,d united states vaughn,cir,under an abuse of discretion standard,gall united states,d united states scott,cir.we presume that a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range is reasonable,but there is no corresponding presumption of unreasonableness for a sentence.united states jackson,cir citing united states omole,cir.moreover,we review de novo a district court interpretation of the guidelines.united states diekemper,cir see also united states dote,cir we review a district court determination that it had no discretion to depart downward de novo.
we follow a inquiry.see united states,cir.first,we determine whether the district court committed any procedural error,such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.gall,at see also jackson,at.second,if we determine there was no procedural error,we then examine the substantive reasonableness of the sentence itself.gall,at see also united states abbas,cir.
history of programs 
although much ink has already been used by this and other courts in describing the genesis of programs,we feel it necessary to provide an abridged history of these programs because the disposition of our cases today turns on the gloss that recent case law has placed on this background.
or early disposition programs,were used in federal district courts as early as.see,at citing alan bersin,reinventing immigration law enforcement in the southern district of california,fed.sentencing.the programs emerged in states bordering mexico in an effort to curtail overwhelming immigration case loads.see,at citing united states,cir.at the time,united states attorneys used as a mechanism to speed the disposition of these cases.in essence,they offered to recommend more lenient sentences in exchange for guilty pleas and waivers of appellate rights.see also united states,cir citing sentencing comm n,report to congress downward departures from the federal sentencing guidelines,at,available at hereinafter sentencing commission report.
almost ten years later,congress formalized the practice by enacting the prosecutorial remedies and tools against the exploitation of children today act of protect act,stat.the protect act was designed as part of an overarching initiative to respond to a purported increase in departures from the guidelines and provide meaningful appellate review of such cases,at noting that the act was passed.in an amendment to a companion bill,the child abduction prevention was passed before the protect house of representatives attached a report expressing its intent for legislating in this area.according to the commentary,congress sanctioned limited departures under structured early disposition programs,although such programs were to be reserved only for offenses whose high incidence within the district has imposed an extraordinary strain on the resources of that district as compared to other districts,at emphasis added see also,at.congress also commented that the bill does not confer authority to depart downward on an ad hoc basis in individual cases,at.
although the protect act did not specifically address the practice of,at,it nonetheless authorized the attorney general to establish official programs on a basis,united states rodriguez,cir.it further directed the sentencing commission to develop a guideline authorizing a downward departure of not more than levels if the government files a motion for such a departure pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the attorney general and the united states attorney,at quoting the protect act,m b,stat.at.
as a result,the sentencing commission created,which provides upon motion of the government,the court may depart downward not more than levels pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the attorney general of the united states and the united states attorney for the district in which the court resides.the sentencing commission also filed a report with congress,which addressed the sentencing disparity paradigm created by.although this report is not binding here,it provides insight into the sentencing commission perspective in enacting the guideline.in pertinent part,the report stated 
the department of justice requested that the commission implement the directive regarding the early disposition programs in section m of the protect act in a similar unfettered manner by merely restating the legislative language and leav ing to the sentencing court the extent of the departure under these early disposition programs.the commission notes that implementation of the directive in this manner has the potential to create unwarranted sentencing disparity.
defendants sentenced in districts without authorized early disposition programs,however,can be expected to receive longer sentences than defendants in districts with such programs.this type of geographical disparity appears to be at odds with the overall sentencing reform act goal of reducing unwarranted sentencing disparity among offenders.
sentencing commission report,at emphasis added footnote omitted.the second circuit in united states mejia,cir,a case,and the fifth circuit in united states,cir,made particular note that the sentencing commission appeared to reject the idea of districts compensating for the disparity with downward departures 
furthermore,sentencing courts in districts without early disposition programs,particularly those in districts that adjoin districts with such programs,may feel pressured to employ other departures in reach similar sentencing outcomes for similarly situated defendants.this potential response by sentencing courts could undermine the goal of the protect act to reduce the incidence of downward departures.
sentencing commission report,at.but see rita united states,d listing the sentencing commission policy statements as one of the many factors to be taken into account by the district court when sentencing.the sentencing commission added that because little guidance was provided to sentencing courts,implementation of the guideline might lead to undesirable sentencing disparity.accordingly,the commission left the door open to a later examination of the impact of the programs the commission agrees with the department of justice comment that i t may be appropriate at some later date to review how these early disposition programs are actually being implemented and whether further guidance to the courts might be useful.sentencing commission report,at.
shortly after the sentencing commission released its report,general john ashcroft distributed a memorandum setting forth the department of justice policies and requirements for a district to obtain status

as noted by the district court in case,the development of programs has been prolific.see united states,cr,wl,at.february,referencing united states,d,which provided that early disposition programs were authorized in districts such as oregon,idaho,nebraska,north dakota,and the western district of washington see also thomas gorman,comment,sentencing disparity rereading congressional intent to resolve the circuit split,chi.as of february,the attorney general has authorized programs in districts,though only of those have illegal reentry programs,at.none of the districts in the seventh circuit are districts.
procedural error 
the appellants argue that both district courts committed reversible procedural error because the courts found that seventh circuit precedent precluded them from considering the sentences given in districts as part of their a analyses,despite recent supreme court decisions.
there is a principle that we may not overturn circuit precedent without compelling reasons.santos united states,cir mcclain retail food employers joint pension plan,cir united states walton,cir.tablewares,mogi trading,cir.
the doctrine of stare decisis imparts authority to a decision,depending on the court that rendered it,merely by virtue of the authority of the rendering court and independently of the quality of its reasoning.the essence of stare decisis is that the mere existence of certain decisions becomes a reason for adhering to their holdings in subsequent cases.

we give considerable weight to prior decisions of this court unless and until they have been overruled or undermined by the decisions of a higher court,or other supervening developments,such as a statutory overruling.however,we are cognizant of the fact that we are not absolutely bound by them,and must give fair consideration to any substantial argument that a litigant makes for overruling a previous decision.

our court has recently recognized that the supreme court has rekindled debate about whether the absence of a program can be a factor in the choice of sentence.united states,app x,cir declining to address the issue because the sentencing court in fact considered and rejected defendant disparity argument see also united states,app x,cir refusing to consider the effect of kimbrough on circuit precedent because the district court neither addressed defendant argument nor stated that it was precluded from considering it.and district courts in our circuit have repeatedly implored us to address this issue.see,united states,d,declining to wait for us to issue our opinion in because doing so might cause the defendant to serve more time than what would otherwise be the district court prescribed custodial sentence,d at imposing a sentence below the advisory guideline range based on the disparity created by districts,wl,at finding the court was precluded from considering the argument,but that it was unjust as a matter of policy.
there are considerable differences of opinion on this issue among the circuit courts.the fifth circuit held that kimbrough did not overturn several other circuits decisions that a sentencing court was precluded from considering disparities created by programs.united states,cir.because congress authorized programs without amending a,it implicitly intended sentencing disparity among similarly situated defendants to occur,and therefore such disparity was not unwarranted.id.the court stated that rita or kimbrough addressed only a district court discretion to vary from the guidelines based on a disagreement with guideline,not congressional,policy.id.at.
the eleventh circuit fell in line with the fifth circuit,stating 
t he most that could possibly be argued is that kimbrough overruled prior precedents holding that a district court can not vary from the advisory guidelines based on a disagreement with a guideline,even where the sentencing commission policy judgment,not congressional direction,underlies the guideline at issue,and even where that policy judgment did not arise from the commission exercise of its characteristic institutional role.
united states,cir.significantly,though,even if the eleventh circuit found that kimbrough was at odds with its prior holdings,its prior precedent rule restricted the panel from overturning its prior cases.id.at stating that prior precedent must be followed unless the prior precedent has been overruled by this court en banc or by the united states supreme court.in a vigorous dissent,judge barkett observed that kimbrough flatly rejected the panel position,and argued that sentencing courts should not infer from the protect act that they can never deviate from the guidelines based on disparities,id.at,because kimbrough held that it is improper to read any implicit directive into congressional silence,id.quoting kimbrough,at.the dissent further disagreed that the court was limited by its prior precedent rule because the panel was authorized to give full effect to intervening supreme court decisions when necessary.id.at.
the ninth circuit also concluded that kimbrough had no effect on sentencing arguments.united states,cir.the court reiterated that sentencing disparities resulting from programs were not unwarranted,citing our holding in among others,id.at,and that district courts may not disregard congressional policy,id.at.
the first,third,and sixth circuits,however,have reached a different conclusion.the first circuit held that following kimbrough,consideration of disparity is not categorically barred as a datum within the overall ambit of a.united states rodriguez,cir.the court noted that the conclusion in could only be reached through heavy reliance on inference and implication about congressional intent,and that kimbrough made pellucid that when congress exercises its power to bar district courts from using a particular sentencing rationale,it does so by the use of unequivocal terminology.id.at.
the third circuit also found the analyses by the fifth,ninth,and eleventh circuits to be erroneous.the court said that f ocusing on congressional policy here is illusory.united states,cir stating that the protect act contains no express congressional directive that would constrain a sentencing judge discretion to vary from the guidelines,and if congress wanted to limit this discretion,it has the power to amend the pertinent statute but has not done so here.in fact,the government declined to even argue that congressional policy limited a sentencing court discretion to consider disparities.id.at.moreover,the court specifically rejected the eleventh circuit view of kimbrough,stating that it was premised on the superficial factual distinction between crack and powder cocaine sentencing disparities and sentencing disparities.id.the court held that sentencing courts are permitted to consider a argument under a.id.at.
finally,the sixth circuit recently joined with the first and third circuit.the sixth circuit based its decision on kimbrough and held that a disparity can be the basis of a sentence.see united states,cir.importantly,the court noted that the holding in kimbrough and in spears united states,d that sentencing judges may vary from the guidelines based on policy disagreements is not limited to the cocaine context.id.at.
this ongoing debate and current circuit split are compelling reasons to revisit our precedent.we now turn first to the recent case law in this area.
recent case law 
in the watershed case of united states booker,d,the supreme court held that the sentencing guidelines are advisory only.in gall united states,the court reaffirmed that the guidelines are advisory only,d,and further provided that in considering the a factors the sentencing judge may not presume that the guidelines range is reasonable.id.at.likewise,appellate courts are not permitted to apply a presumption of unreasonableness to sentences falling outside of the recommended guidelines range.id.at citing rita,at.the court explained that t he sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under a in the individual case,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,because t he sentencing judge has access to,and greater familiarity with,the individual case and the individual defendant before him than the commission or the appeals court,id.at quoting rita,at rodriguez,at noting that in gall,the court emphasized that district courts have wide latitude in making individualized sentencing determinations.
further elucidating this new understanding of the guidelines,the supreme court decided kimbrough on the very same day that it decided gall.there,the court made abundantly clear that the guidelines are advisory only and that district court judges are authorized to disagree with the sentencing commission,even in a case.kimbrough,at.significantly,the court rejected the government position that the guideline adopting the ratio for crack and powder cocaine was binding on district courts because it was effectively sanctioned by congress.see also,at.as such,the court decline d to read any implicit directive into congressional silence.kimbrough,at.
more recently the court expounded on the application of booker,gall,and kimbrough in spears united states,in which it held that a district court had authority to replace the guidelines ratio for crack and powder cocaine offenses with its own ratio.at.the court said that the correct interpretation of kimbrough is that the district court may vary from the guidelines based solely on its view that the ratio embodied in the sentencing guidelines for the treatment of crack cocaine versus powder cocaine creates an unwarranted disparity within the meaning of a,and is at odds with a.id.at quoting united states spears,cir en banc colloton,dissenting.therefore,the sentencing courts are entitled to reject and vary categorically from the guidelines based on a policy disagreement with those guidelines.id.at emphasis added.we subsequently considered the impact of these cases en banc,reaching the conclusion that kimbrough and spears mean that district judges are at liberty to reject any guideline on policy they must act reasonably when using that power.corner,at.
finally,in vazquez united states,d,the court vacated an eleventh circuit opinion that held that sentencing courts could not disagree with congressionally dictated policy expressed in the career offender guidelines.see united states vazquez,cir.rather,the court was receptive to the solicitor general position that 
kimbrough reference to section h as an example of congress directing the sentencing commission to adopt a guideline reflecting a particular policy,at,did not suggest that congress had bound sentencing courts through section.the court of appeals reliance on kimbrough reference to section h therefore depends on the additional,unstated,premise that congressional directives to the sentencing commission are equally binding on sentencing courts.that premise is incorrect.
see brief for the united states at,vazquez united states,d.
in combination,these cases have cast doubt on the notion that district courts are bound to follow directives issued to the sentencing commission by congress.in light of booker,gall,kimbrough,spears,and vazquez,we recently granted a petition for rehearing en banc in united states corner,cir,to reconsider our holding in united states welton,cir,the primary authority on which the government in the cases at hand appears to rely.basing our reasoning on the eleventh circuit decision in vazquez,in welton we held that a sentencing court lacks authority to vary from the career offender guidelines based on the career offender disparity because the disparity is the result of a legislative act.id.at.we reached this conclusion by interpreting kimbrough to mean that h reflects a congressional policy with which a sentencing court may not disagree and is one instance where congress has expressly incorporated a sentencing policy into the guidelines.at.
we overruled welton in corner.not only does corner overturn welton,but also to a large extent it eviscerates the government position in this case.according to corner,welton mistakenly interpreted the supreme court reference to h in kimbrough to imply that,which implements h,should be treated as a statute for the purpose of booker and kimbrough.at.importantly,corner explained that a congressional directive to the sentencing commission to implement a particular guideline does not satisfy kimbrough requirement that congress must direct sentencing practices in express terms in order to limit judicial discretion.id.quoting kimbrough,at.we did,however,qualify our holding in corner by noting that district court judges must implement all statutes,whether or not the judges agree with them but we added that booker,kimbrough,and spears hold that the floors and ceilings in guidelines are not legally binding.id.at.
because the parallels between the analyses and holdings of these cases are unquestionably similar to the issues presented in the context,we now revisit our prior precedent in that area.
the government argues that because our prior precedent holds that congress expressly approved sentencing,must be treated as a statute,thus preventing district court judges in districts from disagreeing with that guideline.we do not believe that our precedent so neatly resolves the question.in any event,the government reading of our precedent is an overdrawn extension of the protect act.
our discussion begins with.in,after summarizing the history of the protect act and guideline,we commented that g iven congress s explicit recognition that procedures would cause discrepancies,we can not say that a sentence is unreasonable simply because it was imposed in a district that does not employ an early disposition program.id.at.we therefore concluded that the sentencing disparity created by programs can be considered appropriately as a single,and not controlling,factor.id.at.without the benefit of the analytical framework currently used by courts of appeals,gall,at,our holding that sentence should be affirmed was based on the substantive reasonableness of the sentence provided it did not address procedural error.
the following day,we held in a brief per curiam opinion based completely on that a sentence imposed after a downward departure based solely on the disparity created by early disposition programs in other districts could not be deemed reasonable,at.we observed that because congress directed the sentencing commission to develop a policy statement implementing the protect act,congress explicitly recognized that fast track procedures would cause discrepancies.id.accordingly,we concluded the district courts must look to other factors to determine if defendants are deserving of sentences below the advisory guidelines range.id.
in another case,united states,cir,we relied upon holding that a sentence in a district without a program need not be reduced,and clarification that it must not be reduced.and we again confirmed our reasoning in united states,cir and united states,app x,cir unpublished.we pause to note,however,that while these cases recognized that prohibits consideration of the disparity,none of their outcomes appear tethered to extreme interpretation of.
here,the government argues that despite the wave of change in recent case law,we have stayed the course on the theory that the guideline was a primary act of congress,thereby shielding sentences from these type of challenges.the primary support for the government argument is our decision in united states,cir,where we followed,and.
the government assumes too much,however,because although did kimbrough,that decision rested entirely on our cases in fact,we did not address kimbrough or gall.instead,our limited treatment of the argument in simply noted that we had repeatedly rejected arguments that a sentence is unreasonable solely because it was imposed in a jurisdiction that does not make use of programs.id.at.
as in corner,we are compelled now to reconsider our prior interpretation of the guideline.we now hold,consistent with the first,third,and sixth circuits,that a district court may consider a argument when evaluating the applicable a factors.although we previously held that congress expressly approved sentencing disparities through the protect effectively constraining sentencing judges discretion to consider the absence of a program in their districts under supreme court disposition in vasquez reflects the understanding that congressional directives to the sentencing commission are unlike statutes in that they are not equally binding on sentencing courts.
this follows the new paradigm established by kimbrough and spears that permits district court judges to disagree categorically with those directives in providing an individual sentence.to the extent that our prior decisions might be read to treat as if it had the effect or force of a statute,we were proceeding without the benefit of kimbrough,gall,spears,vasquez,and corner.these new developments in the law now refocus our understanding of and cause us to view it through a different lens.
our reading of the previously discussed policy statements published by the sentencing commission compels us to conclude that the commission clearly acted outside its characteristic institutional role in creating.kimbrough instructs sentencing courts to give less deference to guidelines that are not the product of the commission acting in its characteristic institutional role,in which it typically implements guidelines only after taking into account empirical data and national experience.at rodriguez,at.
in fact,it is arguable whether there is even a congressional directive embedded in the guideline.we simply know that congress authorized the sentencing commission to develop a guideline providing a downward departure of not more than levels if the government files a motion for such a departure pursuant to an early disposition program.protect act,m b,stat.at.further,the congressional report issued in connection with the child abduction prevention act,which was passed prior to the protect act,speaks only in general terms of congress reasons for legislating in the area.without more,we hesitate to construe the meaning of such a report in terms of defining as a statute.
importantly,in the text of the protect act,congress did not specifically address a district court discretion with respect to sentencing in districts.while congress explicitly gave the attorney general the ability to establish early disposition programs district by district,and instructed the sentencing commission to promulgate a guideline to implement those programs,it certainly did not explicitly forbid districts from taking into account the effect of dispositions under the a factors.
if congress wanted to prohibit judges in districts from disagreeing with based on policy,congress could have issued such a directive in unequivocal terminology.see corner,at congress has shown that it knows how to direct sentencing practices in express terms.for example,congress has specifically required the sentencing commission to set guidelines sentences for serious recidivist offenders at or near the statutory maximum.h.quoting kimbrough,at see also,at if congress does not want district courts to exercise their judicial function t
