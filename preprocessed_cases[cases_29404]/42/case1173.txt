opinion of the court 
petitioner luis antonio petitions for review of a ruling by the board of immigration appeals bia or board dismissing his appeal of the decision by an immigration judge ij that he is ineligible for deferral of removal under the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.treaty doc,cat.contends that the board erred in affirming the ij conclusion that the government of panama would not be willfully blind to torturous acts against him and,in any event,stated incorrectly what constitutes acquiescence to torture by panamanian officials.he also asserts that the ij is biased against him and this,among other things,violated his due process rights.
we conclude that the bia did not apply the correct legal standard under the cat and should have reviewed the ij application of this standard de novo.we remand on these grounds.while we reserve judgment on due process claim,we express concern that the ij opinion suggests such frustration with this case which appears to have nine lives that the board should consider assigning it to a new ij if further is necessary.
facts and procedural history 
background 
is a native and citizen of panama who came to the united states on a visitor visa in and remained after his visa expired six months later.in the early he pled guilty to offenses and criminal attempt to commit escape.
in the former immigration and naturalization service charged as removable for overstaying his visa and as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony for trafficking in a controlled substance.an ij sustained the charges against him and ordered him removed to panama.government agents began the process of deporting,but he the plane undetected before it left the united states and continued to live in this country without legal status.
the government apprehended in and deported him to panama.a few days after he returned,the record indicates that a group of men came to his apartment and stabbed him in the neck.he fled the country and the united states through its southern border.
the government apprehended a second time in and charged him with illegal.he ultimately pled guilty to these charges and was sentenced to time served the government then transferred him to the custody of immigration and customs enforcement ice.
removal proceedings before the immigration judge 
the united states department of homeland security reinstated in the final order of removal against.however,an asylum officer found he expressed a reasonable fear of returning to panama and referred him to an ij.filed an application for deferral of removal under the cat based on his claim that members of the mara salvatrucha gang would likely torture him if he returned to panama.
represented himself at the hearing on his application.he testified that his uncle,reginaldo,and his brother,ricardo,started a gang called la banda del norte in the in his hometown of colón,panama.over time the gang spread beyond colón,entering into feuds with rival gangs,including the.claimed that members of the panamanian were responsible for beating reginaldo to death in brooklyn,new york,in,and for murdering ricardo in panama four years later.
according to,the targeted male family members living in panama because of their kinship ties to reginaldo and ricardo in,brother jose was drowned his brother nelson was beaten and stabbed in his brother arnaldo was shot in,was attacked again in,and died in after members of the shot him times and in his brother regelio was shot twice but survived.
further testified that gang members attacked him immediately after he arrived in panama in.a former girlfriend in panama submitted an affidavit attesting that she called the police to report the attack,but no officer came to investigate.then fled the country.he stated that he believed the police were either bribed by the or were unwilling to protect his family,and he supported this conclusion with record evidence of his brothers deaths and testimonial evidence that the investigations into the murders and violent attacks remained unresolved.also submitted a letter from the panamanian department of public safety confirming the deaths of his family members,stating that his surviving family members receive death threats,and referencing a complaint that his mother made reporting threats to her children lives.
the ij found to be credible,accepting as true his testimony that the gang had killed several of his family members and that police had not prosecuted anyone for these crimes.though expressing concerns for the safety of dutton myrie if he were removed to panama,the ij nonetheless determined that he failed to establish that panamanian officials would consent or acquiesce to the harm he feared and thus denied his cat claim.
c.the bia first ruling 
appealed the ij conclusion that he was not eligible for cat relief.the bia affirmed,holding that t he evidence d id not establish that the panamanian government acquiesces to torture by gangs,as the term has been interpreted by the third circuit,but rather shows that it has been actively trying to combat them.
d.the government requests remand 
petitioned our court for review.the attorney general filed a motion to remand to allow the board to reconsider clarify the bases for its decision in light of att y of the,cir.we granted this motion and remanded the case to the bia,whereupon it vacated its first decision and remanded to the ij.
e.the immigration judge second decision and the bia second ruling 
the ij issued a second ruling in.he again denied cat relief.though the ij found that credibility was not at issue,cat protection remained unavailable because he determined had not established that the panamanian government permit ted a certain level of gang violence in order to inflict severe pain or suffering on him.on appeal,argued the ij applied an erroneous legal standard for acquiescence by requiring him to show the panamanian government intended that he be tortured.
the board sustained the appeal.it agreed that the specific intent requirement applies only to those who commit acts of torture,whereas an applicant need only show willful blindness to establish acquiescence to the torture by others.it also noted that the ij failed to consider evidence relevant to the likelihood of future harm.the board therefore found it necessary to again remand for the ij to reassess whether established acquiescence despite the panamanian government opposition to the,as well as evidence of future torture.
f.the ij third decision and the board remand 
the ij denied relief a third time in.there he relied on independent research he put into evidence,including a panama crime and safety report and an article from panama digest,which he found suggested the gang was a recent phenomenon in panama.the ij further deviated from his prior two findings of credibility,stating instead that the evidence cast serious doubt on the veracity of claim that lay behind the devastation to his family.the ij discounted the letter from the department of public safety in panama as unverified.he then concluded without discussion that the evidence was insufficient to establish willful blindness.
appealed,and once again the board ordered a remand to the ij for further proceedings.it held that he erred in questioning credibility despite finding him credible in prior proceedings,failing to notify that further corroboration was required,and relying on an internet search that was not part of the record of proceedings.the board directed the ij on remand again to determine whether established acquiescence,as well as evidence of the likelihood of future torture.
g.the ij fourth decision and the board affirmance 
on remand,the ij requested that both parties respond to the country conditions evidence the ij introduced previously.the record contains notice of a hearing,yet the bia can not locate a transcript of the hearing and the government now contests claim that it occurred.in his fourth decision,the ij concluded that there was no rebuttal of the evidence suggesting that the had only recently begun to infiltrate panama and opined that he was wholly unconvinced that the group had attacked and his brothers.yet the ij specifically stepped back from any adverse credibility determination as the legal basis for his decision.instead,he relied on his conclusion that could not establish the panamanian government would acquiesce to the harm he alleged and cited the absence of corroborating evidence that the was responsible for the deaths of family members or that it was operating in panama when the attacks occurred.the ij also found that panama was actively combating gangs and that could not establish that it was unwilling or unable to protect him because he had not reported the attack to the police and presented no further evidence that a public official was willing to do him harm or to acquiesce in someone else doing him harm.
once again,appealed the ij decision,and here the bia dismissed the appeal.it discerned no clear error in the ij finding that the panamanian government fell short of acquiescing to torture.the board supported this conclusion by citing to the ij findings that panama actively engage s against criminal gangs and combats crime,and although the applicant was attacked in february,he never reported the incident to police.the bia also rejected due process claims,finding insufficient evidence that the ij harbored personal bias against or that the ij failed to consider relevant evidence.while the board recognized that the ij did not specifically reference a letter from the department of public safety in panama confirming his family members deaths,stating that his surviving family members continue to receive death threats,and referencing his mother complaint reporting threats to her children lives,the board concluded that this was insufficient to establish that the ij did not consider this evidence.another petition for review followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction under a to review a final order of the bia denying cat relief.however,because is subject to removal based on an conviction,the statute constrains our jurisdiction to constitutional claims or questions of law,as factual or discretionary determinations are outside of our scope of review.pierre att y,cir.en banc referring to the provisions of a c d.
constitutional claims or questions of law we review de novo.att y,cir.where the bia affirms and partially reiterates the ij discussions and determinations,we look to both decisions.sandie att y,cir.if the board relies only on some of the grounds given for denying relief,we review only these grounds.chukwu att y,cir.
iii.analysis 
a.the convention against torture 
article of the cat provides that n o state party shall expel,return or extradite a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.the burden of proof is on the applicant to establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c.for an act to constitute torture under the cat and the implementing regulations,it must be an act causing severe physical or mental pain or suffering intentionally inflicted for an illicit or proscribed purpose by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or physical control of the victim and not arising from lawful sanctions.auguste ridge,cir.citing matter of j e,bia.if an alien produces sufficient evidence to satisfy that burden,withholding of removal or deferring of removal under the cat is mandatory.silva rengifo,at citing.
to establish acquiescence,an applicant must demonstrate that,prior to the activity constituting torture,a public official was aware of it and thereafter breached the legal responsibility to intervene and prevent it.a.the applicant can meet this standard even where the government does not have actual knowledge of the torturous activity if he produc es sufficient evidence that the government is willfully blind to such activities.silva rengifo,at see also gomez zuluaga att y,cir.quoting silva rengifo,at.a ll evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture shall be considered.c see,at.circumstantial evidence may establish acquiescence to targeted acts of violence even when the government has an official policy or is engaged in a campaign of opposition against the entity the applicant fears.see id.at,at.
b.the bia applied the incorrect standard of review to the ij determination that could not establish government acquiescence to the torture he fears.
argues that the bia erred in reviewing for clear error the ij conclusion that the panamanian government would not acquiesce to torture.true enough,the code of federal regulations directs the board to review the ij findings of fact for clear error,d i,but its authority to review questions of law,discretion,and judgment is de novo,id.at d ii see also in re cabrera,bia interpreting the regulation as providing de novo review of questions of law or mixed questions of law and fact.we agree with that the question of whether likely government conduct equates to acquiescence is a mixed question of law and fact under our decision in kaplun att y.cir.what this means is that the board should review without deference the ultimate conclusion that the findings of fact do not meet the legal standard.
to determine whether an applicant has met the burden of establishing that it is more likely than not he would be tortured if removed,the ij must address two questions what is likely to happen to the petitioner if removed and does what is likely to happen amount to the legal definition of torture id.at.in the first part of the inquiry,the ij reviews the evidence and determines future events more likely than not to occur.these findings are made up of facts and are distin ct from their legal effect.id.at citing black law dictionary ed.accordingly,the board reviews these factual findings for clear error.id.at.the ij then determines whether the likely harm qualifies as torture under the governing regulations,and the board reviews this legal conclusion de novo.id.at.
in assessing whether an applicant has established that public officials will acquiesce to the feared tortuous acts of a actor,the ij also must conduct a analysis.first,the ij makes a factual finding or findings as to how public officials will likely act in response to the harm the petitioner fears.next,the ij assesses whether the likely response from public officials qualifies as acquiescence under the governing regulations.as above with respect to determinations of torture,this second part of the inquiry is a legal question.while the board reviews the first part for clear error,it must review the second de novo.
to the extent a dictum in kaplun suggested that whether the government would acquiesce was a factual question,id.at,it addressed only the first component of the inquiry into acquiescence how the government would likely act in response to the harm the applicant fears.we clarify that the ij must then apply the legal standard for acquiescence to determine whether this response establishes that a public official was aware of the torturous activity and subsequently breaches his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.a.in colloquial terms,the question might be is the official willfully blind 
the board stated that it found no clear error in the immigration judge finding that the government of panama would not be acquiescent to any torture.while the board was correct in reviewing for clear error the ij factual findings that the government actively engages against criminal gangs and that did not provide the police notice that the gang attacked him in the past,it should have determined de novo whether these findings were sufficient to establish acquiescence.
although it is possible that the bia considered the appropriate willful blindness standard before concluding that the ij factual findings on likely government conduct would not qualify as acquiescence to torture as a matter of law,we can not tell from the bia short decision whether this is indeed the case.in order for us to be able to give meaningful review to the bia decision
