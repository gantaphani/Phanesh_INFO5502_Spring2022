order and amended opinion 
the opinion filed may,is amended as follows 
at delete the last sentence of the footnote,which reads 
this amendment does not change the deadline for filing a petition for panel rehearing or suggestion for rehearing en banc.
angel wilfredo ramos barrios ramos,a native and citizen of guatemala,petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia affirmance of the immigration judge ij denial of his application for asylum,withholding of removal,relief under the convention against torture cat,and special rule cancellation of removal under section of the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act nacara or the act.following our recent precedent,we hold that ramos is ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal because his refusal to join a gang does not make him a member of a particular social group or constitute a political opinion.we also hold as a matter of first impression that ramos is not entitled to nacara relief because a minor who seeks relief as a derivative must personally satisfy the act requirement of seven years of continuous physical presence.ramos father physical presence in the united states can not be imputed to him to satisfy this requirement.we do not reach ramos cat claim because it was waived.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we deny the petition.
factual and procedural background 
ramos entered the united states on december,without being admitted or paroled.the next day,the former immigration and naturalization service ins issued ramos a notice to appear,charging him with inadmissibility in accordance with a a i,and placed him in removal proceedings.on november,ramos filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.he also submitted an application for special rule cancellation of removal pursuant to section of nacara.
ramos was the sole witness at the merits hearing before the ij.he admitted the factual allegations and conceded inadmissibility.as to his claims for relief,ramos testified that he had been threatened by a gang,or mara,while attending school in guatemala the gang members wanted ramos to join the gang,but he refused.as a result,the gang members continued to threaten him and started to steal things from him.on one occasion,they cut his neck with a switchblade when he would not give them his lunch money.the gang members told him it was a sign as to what could happen to him.ramos did not report the incidents to the police because the gangs had warned him that if he told anyone,they were going to do something to him or his family.he did tell his family and two of his teachers about the threats,but they took no action because,according to ramos,they were also afraid.
believing his life was in danger on account of the threats,ramos left guatemala in december.since arriving in the united states,he has spoken to family members who remained in guatemala they told him that the gang members had passed by the house in which ramos formerly lived,asking about and threatening him.ramos testified that he is scared to return to guatemala,fearing that it would go back to the same thing and that the gangs will no longer threaten,but something would actually happen.
the ij accepted ramos testimony as true but nevertheless denied all forms of relief.on appeal to the bia,a panel adopted and affirmed the ij decision,citing matter of burbano,bia.ramos timely petitions for review.

iii.discussion 
asylum and withholding of removal 
the attorney general may grant asylum to an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to his home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a id.b a see ins,d.the source of the persecution must be a government official or an individual or group that the government is unwilling or unable to control.ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to qualify for withholding of removal,an alien must demonstrate that there is a clear probability that he will be subject to such persecution.ins,cir.an alien who fails to satisfy the lower standard of proof required to establish eligibility for asylum necessarily fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.farah ashcroft,cir.
ramos argues that he was persecuted on account of two protected grounds membership in a particular social,young males in guatemala who are targeted for gang recruitment but refuse because they disagree with the gang criminal activities and an opinion that was political in nature,insofar as gang activity affects the administration of the government and the country.we recently have held,however,that resistance to gang membership is not a protected ground.holder,cir 
in,we held that young honduran men who have been recruited by gangs but refuse to join do not constitute a particular social group.id.at.applying chevron deference,we concluded that the bia precedential decision in matter of is not arbitrary and capricious.id.at.we noted that the bia decision analyzed the purported social group using the factors set forth in our prior case law.id.at.upon reviewing its analysis,we determined that the bia reasonably found that the group was not sufficiently particular and that the group lacked social visibility.id.at.
ramos argument that young men in guatemala who resist gang recruitment constitute a social group is indistinguishable from the argument made in accordingly,we must reject ramos argument for the reasons explained in that case.see id.at.
we also addressed in whether the petitioner had been persecuted on account of an political opinion.id.at.turning again to matter of,we deferred under chevron to the bia reasonable interpretation of political opinion for the same reason we defer red to the bia reasonable interpretation of particular social group.id.we also relied on our decision in id.
in,we found that the petitioner had provided no evidence that his opposition to the gang criminal activity was based on political opinion or that he was politically or ideologically opposed to the ideals espoused by the mara or to gangs in general.at.rather,the available evidence suggested that was victimized for economic and personal reasons.id.we held that t hese motivations do not constitute persecution on account of political opinion.id.we also rejected contention that he was persecuted on account of an imputed political opinion,reasoning that neither stated in his application for asylum,nor in his testimony at his hearing,that he refused to join the gang,and that no evidence suggested that the gang held any sort of belief system that they perceived to oppose.id.accordingly,we affirmed the bia determination that a general aversion to gangs does not constitute a political opinion for asylum purposes.id.
we concluded that case was indistinguishable.because allege d no facts in support of a political opinion,actual or imputed,beyond his refusal to join the gang,we found that he had failed to prove persecution on account of a protected ground.id.
here,ramos similarly failed to present evidence that he was politically or ideologically opposed to the ideals espoused by the gang that recruited him or to gangs in general,or that the gang imputed to him any particular political belief.the evidence instead supports the conclusion that the gang victimized him for economic and personal reasons.that gang members attacked ramos and cut his neck just after unsuccessfully trying to rob him reinforces this conclusion.although ramos did state in his asylum application that he refused to join the gang,this fact alone does not save his claim.failure to state in his application or during his hearing that he refused to join the gang was not the dispositive factor for rejecting his claim.see at.we therefore reject ramos argument that he was persecuted on account of a political opinion for the reasons explained in and.
because ramos failed to demonstrate that he was persecuted on account of a protected ground,we deny the petition as to his asylum and withholding of removal claims 
relief under nacara 
ramos argues that the bia erred in concluding that he is ineligible for nacara relief on the grounds that special rule cancellation of removal special rule cancellation requires seven years of continuous physical presence for the minor children of nacara beneficiaries and ramos father physical presence can not be imputed to him to satisfy this requirement.we agree with the bia.
section of nacara 
on november,president clinton signed into law nacara,stat,amended by,stat.nacara provides various forms of immigration benefits and relief from removal to certain guatemalans and nationals of other central american and former soviet bloc countries.section of nacara allows qualified individuals to apply for special rule cancellation under the more lenient standards that existed before the passage of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat.see leon gonzales,cir munoz ashcroft,cir.agency regulations interpreting special rule cancellation closely track the text of iirira and nacara.see.
whether ramos satisfies one of the threshold requirements 
to qualify for special rule cancellation,an applicant first must show that he falls into one of the five groups identified in a as an initial matter,we must briefly address whether we have jurisdiction to consider the bia ruling that ramos failed to satisfy one of these threshold requirements.we hold that we do.section c c ii of iirira,as amended by section b of nacara,appears to limit our jurisdiction to review an agency determination that an applicant failed to satisfy one of the threshold requirements set forth in section c c i.however,section of the real id act of restored our jurisdiction over constitutional claims or questions of law raised in a petition for review.dhital mukasey,cir per curiam.in ramadan gonzales,cir per curiam,we held that such questions of law include not only pure issues of statutory interpretation,but also application of law to undisputed facts,sometimes referred to as mixed questions of law and fact.id.at see also khunaverdiants mukasey,cir ghahremani gonzales,cir.because the ij accepted ramos testimony as true and none of the facts pertaining to ramos nacara application is in dispute,we have jurisdiction to consider whether the bia properly applied the law.
we conclude that the bia erred in adopting the ij conclusion that ramos failed to satisfy one of the threshold requirements.ramos stated in his nacara application and argued to the ij that he was eligible for relief under section a.the ij acknowledged this fact during an initial hearing.addressing ramos counsel,he stated you arguing that ramos falls under the fourth paragraph of section a,which is that he is the child of a person who is applying for nacara.subsection a provides that a n alien who is the spouse or child of an individual described in paragraph a,a,or a of this section at the time a decision is made to suspend the deportation,or cancel the removal,of the individual described in paragraph a,a,or a is eligible for special rule cancellation,subject to certain exceptions not relevant here.a.subsections a through classify the individual aliens who qualify for suspension of deportation or special rule cancellation.despite the ij acknowledgment that ramos claimed relief under subsection a,the ij mistakenly analyzed ramos claim under subsection a.subsection a applies only to an applicant who is years of age or older at the time a decision is made to grant nacara relief to the applicant parent,id.a i,and requires a showing that the applicant e ntered the united states on or before october,id.a ii.this subsection is plainly inapplicable because,as the ij found,ramos was only seventeen years old when he applied for nacara relief.therefore,subsection a applies,which ramos undoubtedly satisfies based on the facts found by the ij 
ramos father,roberto ramos chamale chamale,was granted nacara relief in the form of permanent resident status on may,moreover,ramos qualifies as chamale child as defined in b.ramos therefore was eligible for nacara relief subject to meeting the physical presence requirement.
whether ramos satisfies the physical presence requirement 
to establish eligibility for special rule cancellation under the amended version of section f of iirira,the applicant must be described in section c c i and must establish the requisite physical presence this physical presence requirement is set forth in b the alien has been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of years immediately preceding the date the application was filed.it is undisputed that ramos did not personally meet this requirement.
applicability of the physical presence requirement 
ramos first disputes that special rule cancellation requires seven years of physical presence for the minor children of nacara beneficiaries.he notes that the amended version of section c c i iii of iirira does not include a physical presence requirement,and contends that form,the nacara application,confirms this interpretation of the act.although ramos accurately describes subsection iii,he fails to consider section in its entirety.the amended section f expressly states that an applicant must be described in section c c i and ha ve been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than years immediately preceding the date of such application.stat.emphasis added.form exactly mirrors the wording of section,and thus is of little aid to ramos argument.
ramos also incorrectly suggests that the regulations themselves support his interpretation.section unequivocally states that to be eligible for nacara relief,an applicant must be described in and must satisfy the physical presence requirement.a,b.the relevant legislative history also undermines ramos argument that there is no physical presence requirement for derivative nacara applicants.see,cong.rec,daily ed,explanatory memorandum regarding title ii of the appropriations potion sic of the omnibus appropriations bill submitted by mack,graham,abraham,kennedy,and durbin analysis of nacara.we therefore hold that a minor who qualifies for nacara relief as a derivative under a must satisfy the physical presence requirement set forth in b.
imputation of a parent physical presence for purposes of nacara relief 
ramos would satisfy the physical presence requirement if his father physical presence in the united states were imputable to him for purposes of nacara relief.for the reasons explained below,we hold that it is not.
i deference to the bia 
we must first consider the level of deference,if any,owed to the ij determination and the bia adoption of the rule disallowing imputation.a bia panel affirmed the ij decision in an unpublished,nonprecedential decision such decisions are entitled to only skidmore rather than chevron,deference.see gonzales,cir.in skidmore,the supreme court held that a nonbinding administrative interpretation carries a weight depend ent upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.at.see united states mead,d holding that skidmore remained intact after chevron and that skidmore deference applies when chevron deference does not.if the reasons provided by the bia to support its conclusion are not persuasive,then we must review de novo the question before us,at.
the bia did not even address ramos imputation argument,nor did it provide any reasoning for its determination that ramos failed to meet the physical presence requirement.moreover,it did not cite any precedent of the bia or our circuit.that the bia adopted the ij decision does not strengthen the bia basis for rejecting ramos argument.the ij merely noted that he was unaware of any precedent that had directly allowed such imputation,but did not address the cases ramos cited to support his argument.therefore,we review de novo the remaining question presented by ramos petition should a minor who applies for nacara relief as a derivative of his parent be permitted to impute his parent physical presence for purposes of satisfying the requirement 
ii analogous precedent 
while we have not previously addressed whether a parent physical presence can be imputed to his minor child for purposes of nacara relief,we have interpreted analogous immigration statutes.
in ins,cir,we addressed the concept of imputation in the context of a discretionary waiver of deportation under the immigration and nationality act ina section c c,which required,inter alia,seven years of lawful unrelinquished domicile.we held that a parent lawful unrelinquished domicile can be imputed to his minor child,at.the petitioner,a minor,had legally entered the united states with his parents,was always legally within the country,was domiciled here,but acquired permanent resident status many years after his parents achieved it because of a processing error attributable to the ins.id.at.we first observed that section c was enacted to alleviate the harsh effects of deportation on those aliens who have lawfully established substantial ties to the united states.id.at.we then reasoned that,b ecause children naturally form the strongest of ties to the place where their parents are domiciled and they with them,section c core policy concerns would be directly frustrated by the government proposal to ignore the parent domicile in determining that of the child.id.at.
we found further support for our analysis in congress use of the term domicile.id.adopting the common law definition of domicile that aliens must not only be physically present in the united states,but must intend to remain we reached the unremarkable conclusion that a child domicile follows that of his or her parents.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we explained that because children are,legally speaking,incapable of forming the necessary intent to remain indefinitely in a particular place,they can not determine their own domicile.id.finally,we noted that other sections of the ina giving a high priority to the relation between permanent resident parents and their children strengthened our analysis.id.
two years after we decided,congress replaced section c with ina section a,a,which governs cancellation of removal for lawful permanent residents see cyr,at.because section a modified section c in several key respects,our holding in came into question.in gonzales,cir,we reaffirmed viability and extended its holding to a requirement of seven years of continuous residence in the united states.
had lived in the united states since he was one year old,but he did not attain lawful permanent residence until he was approximately thirteen.id.at.he sought cancellation of removal less than seven years later.id.both the ij and the bia concluded that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal because he failed to satisfy a requirement of seven years of continuous residence after admission.id.at see a.
applying the chevron inquiry and determining that deference to the bia was not warranted,at,we held that for purposes of satisfying the of continuous residence after having been admitted in any status required for cancellation of removal under a,a parent admission for permanent resident status is imputed to the parent unemancipated minor children residing with the parent,id.at.instructed by,we reasoned that the difference between lawful unrelinquished domicile and residence after having been admitted in any status was not so great as to be dispositive and did not justify a departure from the ina policy of putting a high priority on relations between permanent legal residents and their children.id.at.
we also cited specific examples to demonstrate that both the bia and this court repeatedly have held that a parent status,intent,or state of mind is imputed to the parent unemancipated minor child in many areas of immigration law,including asylum,grounds of inadmissibility,and legal residency status.id.at.we first discussed vang ins,cir,in which we applied the principles articulated in to the question of whether aminor has firmly resettled in another country.id.at.we noted in vang that,under ins regulations,the child of a refugee or asylee is generally entitled to the same legal status as her parent.id.because it would be unreasonable to hold an adolescent responsible for arranging or failing to arrange permanent resettlement,id.internal quotation marks omitted,we concluded that we must look to whether the minor parents have firmly resettled in a foreign country before coming to the united states,and then derivatively attribute the parents status to the minor,id.at.
next,we addressed senica ins,cir,in which we agreed with the bia that a parent knowledge of ineligibility for admission to the united states should be imputed to her children.id.at.we concluded in senica that t he bia decision here was not a departure from its previous practice of imputing a parent state of mind,or failure to reasonably investigate,to an unemancipated minor child.id.at.finally,we observed in that the bia has commonly imputed a parent abandonment of permanent legal resident status to the parent minor children.at citing,for example,matter of zamora,bia holding that the voluntary and intended abandonment of lawful permanent resident status by the parent of an unemancipated minor child is imputed to the child matter of winkens,bia holding that parents abandonment of lawful permanent resident status was imputed to their minor child who was subject to their custody and control.
we then turned to congress intent in enacting,at.relying on the relevant legislative history,we determined that congress had replaced section c with section a to resolve the conflicting interpretations of unrelinquished lawful domicile,not to narrow the continuous residency rule.id.at.
we left open the question of whether a parent permanent resident status may be imputed to his child for purposes of a residency requirement.id.at see a requiring a showing that an alien has been lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than years.we recently answered this question in escobar holder,wl cir.relying on our reasoning in and,we held that,for purposes of satisfying the five years of lawful permanent residence required under a,a parent status as a lawful permanent resident is imputed to the unemancipated minor children residing with that parent.id.at.
iii application to nacara 
we reject ramos argument that we should extend our reasoning in and to impute a parent physical presence in the united states to his minor child for purposes of satisfying nacara physical presence requirement.the meaning of physical presence is quite distinct from the requirements we have previously held to be imputable.indeed,the difference in meaning is so great as to be dispositive,at.moreover,neither nacara legislative history nor its underlying policy compels a different conclusion.
our precedent demonstrates that we impute a parent status,intent,or state of mind to satisfy immigration criteria that an unemancipated minor child must meet.the requirements at issue in lawful unrelinquished domicile,admitted in any status,escobar lawfully admitted for permanent residence,vang firmly resettled,senica knowledge of ineligibility,and matter of zamora abandonment of lawful permanent resident status are all terms of art that include an element of status,intent,or state of mind.we have allowed imputation precisely because the minor either was legally incapable of satisfying one of these criteria or could not reasonably be expected to satisfy it independent of his parents.in,for example,we used a definition of domicile consonant with its common law meaning that aliens must not only be physically present here,but must intend to remain.at internal quotation marks omitted.we explained that a child domicile follows that of his or her parents because children are,legally speaking,incapable of forming the necessary intent to remain indefinitely in a particular place.id.accordingly,we imputed to the petitioner his parents years of lawful unrelinquished domicile in the united states.
in,our decision to impute turned on the meaning of admitted,which is defined as the lawful entry of the alien into the united states after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.a a.although the petitioner had lived in the united states with his lawfully admitted mother since he was one,he was not admitted until he was thirteen,at.analogizing to our precedent and that of the bia,we suggested that it would be unreasonable to hold a minor,who was subject to his mother custody and control,responsible for failing to satisfy this administrative procedure.id.at.because policy considerations and the legislative history of added support to our statutory analysis,see id.at,we imputed to the petitioner his mother admitted status for purposes of satisfying the seven years of continuous residence after having been admitted in any status required for cancellation of removal,id.at.
escobar followed directly from and.addressing a requirement that an alien have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence defined as the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the united states as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws,such status not having changed for not less than five years,we reasoned that the difference between lawful unrelinquished domicile and lawfully admitted for permanent residence was no greater than the difference between lawful unrelinquished domicile and admitted in any status,escobar,wl.we thus concluded that the bia interpretation of a was unreasonable and that compels the conclusion that imputation is appropriate.see also vang,at discussing whether the petitioner had firmly resettled,as defined in.
by contrast,the definition of physical presence does not require a specific status,intent,or state of mind,at.because physically present is not defined in section,in,or in any of the relevant regulations,see,we give it its ordinary meaning.united states santos,d.the relevant dictionary definition of physically present is corporeally being in the place in question or under consideration.oxford english dictionary xi,xii ed.our case law generally relies on this meaning of physically present.for example,in kalaw ins,cir,where we examined the transitional rules of iirira,we explained that t he first eligibility requirement,continuous physical presence,must be determined from the facts,not through an exercise of discretion.either the petitioner has been continuously present in the united states for seven years or the petitioner has not.id.at.in other words,the definition of physical presence is a state of being,not a state of mind it is not conferred by an immigration officer or a governmental agency it depends on no legal construct therefore,it can be attained as readily by a minor as by his parent.
the distinction between physical presence,on the one hand,and status,intent,state of mind,and analogous concepts,on the other,is readily observed here.unlike the petitioners in,and escobar,ramos had not lived in the united states for almost his entire life when he applied for relief he had only just arrived.ramos necessarily would have satisfied the physical presence requirement had he been in the custody of his father who was physically present in the united states for more than a decade before ramos arrived.in other words,unlike the petitioners in our prior decisions,ramos had no additional legal or administrative hurdles to clear beyond mere presence ramos was either corporeally within the borders of the united states or he was not.because he was not,he can not meet the physical presence requirement,and there is no legal basis for imputing his father physical presence.
nor does nacara legislative history support ramos argument that congress intended to allow minors to impute their parents physical presence for purposes of relief under the act.the legislative history does not mention imputation,which ramos does not dispute.rather,he argues that,because t he law was passed to assist individuals to gain legal status in the united states,allowing imputation would be consistent with the spirit of nacara.while we agree that congress primary goal in enacting nacara was to decrease obstacles to asylum relief for qualified individuals we disagree that this goal justifies imputing a parent physical presence under section.an individual must first be deemed qualified before he can reap the benefits of nacara relief.
statements made by the ins around the time nacara went into effect also undercut ramos argument 
s ection of nacara allow s children and spouses to apply for relief under nacara,even if they had not been continuously physically present in the united states for years at the time nacara was enacted or implemented.to meet the physical presence requirement,the spouse or child must have years of continuous physical presence in the united states as of the date the application for relief was filed.
rules and regulations,at emphasis added.although the ins was not directly addressing the question before us,its statements necessarily assume that the spouse or child must independently satisfy the requirement.particularly in light of congress silence on imputation in the legislative history,these statements support the conclusion we reach through our statutory congress did not intend to allow imputation in this context.
ramos also makes three policy arguments for allowing imputation of his father physical presence that our immigration statutes and regulations are replete with provisions giving a high priority to the relation between permanent resident parents and their children,at quoting,at that he would suffer a peculiar or unusual hardship if we refuse to impute his father physical presence to him,at internal quotation marks omitted and that we adhere to the general canon of construction that resolves ambiguities in favor of the alien,at see also hernandez ashcroft,cir.
none of these general considerations persuades us that imputation is appropriate here.although we have allowed imputation for purposes of satisfying a number of requirements in immigration statutes,we have not done so when neither the statutory language nor the legislative history supported that result.moreover,as already discussed,the key fact supporting the policy rationales articulated in,and the minor resided with his or her family in the united absent here.not only has ramos lived in guatemala nearly all his life,but most of his family still lives there.thus,he has not formed strong ties to the united states,at.because disallowing imputation in this context does not sever the bonds between parents and their children who had resided legally in the united states for the better part of their lives,it does not frustrate the just and humane goal of providing relief to those for whom deportation would result in peculiar or unusual hardship,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.finally,while the text of nacara does not explicitly prohibit imputation,neither is it ambiguous,as our statutory analysis makes clear.therefore,we need not read it in the light most favorable to ramos.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that ramos is ineligible for asylum,withholding of removal,cat relief,or special rule cancellation of removal.accordingly,we deny his petition for review.
petition denied.
during his testimony before the ij,ramos did not give the name of a particular gang rather,he referred generally to the gang or the mara.he conceded in his brief before the bia that he could not specific
