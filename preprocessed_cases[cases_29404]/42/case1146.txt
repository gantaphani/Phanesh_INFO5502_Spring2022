background 
is a citizen of the dominican republic.he entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident in august.less than a year later,in june,he was arrested and indicted for attempted murder in the second degree,assault in the second degree,and criminal possession of a weapon in both the second and third degrees.the charging documents reflect that,while cleaning an apartment,had placed magazines in the hallway of the building.when a building employee asked him to remove them,hit the employee in the head with a firearm and fired four shots at him,striking him once in the groin.pleaded guilty to criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree,and in august he was sentenced to two to six years imprisonment.
in october,while was incarcerated,the immigration and naturalization service ins commenced deportation proceedings at the ulster correctional facility in naponoch,new york.his due process claims arise from the conduct of these proceedings.on february,the first hearing was held before immigration judge joe miller the ij,at which represented himself.the ij questioned,who conceded that he was not a citizen of the united states he entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident in august and he had been convicted of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree in.the ij found that was a deportable alien because of his aggravated felony conviction.see a c.his conviction set an extremely high barrier for receipt of a deportation waiver,as the immigration and nationality act ina prescribes that a n alien convicted of an aggravated felony shall be conclusively presumed to be deportable from the united states.c.
notwithstanding this conclusive presumption,the ij questioned to see if he qualified for any form of discretionary relief and determined that,in view of his prior criminal record,faced certain deportation unless he could obtain an adjustment of his immigration status to that of a lawful permanent resident in order to be eligible for an adjustment of status under section a of the ina i the applicant must make an application for the adjustment ii he must be eligible to receive an immigrant visa and be admissible for permanent residence and iii the visa must be immediately available to him at the time of the application.a.had submitted a proper application for adjustment of status,he would have satisfied the first two requirements.see matter of gabryelsky,wl bia,finding that alien conviction for criminal possession of a weapon did not render him inadmissible for purposes of section a.with regard to the third requirement,the ij stated that stepfather,who was a citizen,was the only one that can file papers for you that might even give you a chance to stay in the united states.the stepfather was required to file an petition,which,if approved,would have made an immigrant visa immediately available to.see a a i a.the ij inquiry was complicated by the fact that had given the ins and the ij contradictory information concerning his date of birth and the citizenship of his parents.nevertheless,the ij granted three adjournments so that he could solicit the petition from his stepfather.
at the february,hearing,the ij gave a blank form and adjourned the proceedings until march.the ij told that if he were unable to locate his stepfather and demonstrate that the stepfather would file the petition,would be ordered deported at the next hearing.at the march hearing,told the ij that he had been unable to contact his stepfather,in part because his telephone privileges at the correctional facility had been revoked.the ij informed that he had one final chance to locate his stepfather and prove that your father sic is willing and going to file the petition.he adjourned the hearing until march and stated that no further adjournments would be granted.
the case reconvened on may.at this hearing,it was discovered that mother,who was not a citizen,had improperly filed an petition on her son behalf.stated that his mother had filed the petition because his stepfather was out of the country.the ij informed that the petition would not be approved and that only a petition from his stepfather could assist him.the ij then adjourned the hearing one last time until july,stating that i f you do not have an approved on july,i going to order you deported.
the final hearing was conducted on july.claimed that his stepfather had sent,by express mail,a completed petition to the ulster facility.the ins attorney in attendance informed the ij that the ins had not received the petition.the ij then briefly adjourned the hearing so that the ins could check its mail room to determine if the petition had arrived.it had not.claimed he had a copy of the petition in his property and requested a fourth adjournment of the proceedings so that he could submit the copy as proof that the form had been mailed.the request was denied.the ij told that he would be given no more adjournments,but that he could raise the issue with the board of immigration appeals the bia on appeal.the ij then rendered an oral decision ordering deported.the ij refusal to grant this fourth adjournment was the crux of due process claim in the district court.the ij then gave an appeals package,which he stated must be presented to the bia within ten days,and adjourned the hearing.with respect to the petition,the ij told that a ll you have to do is,tell the bia what the judge did wrong and get it there by the of july.
at a certain point,the date of which is unknown,the ins office at the ulster facility received an undated petition from stepfather.on july,an ins attorney who had appeared for the ins in the case at the may hearing,sent a letter to stepfather,stating that we are returning form to you.the you forwarded must be processed at the eastern adjudication center in burlington,vermont.was not advised of the letter,and claims that he was not notified that the ins had received the petition until discovery proceedings during his illegal prosecution.the whereabouts of the petition after the ins letter was sent to stepfather are unclear from the record there is no indication that his stepfather ever mailed a completed petition to burlington.
in september,still pro se,filed an appeal with the bia.this appeal,however,failed to raise the ij denial of his request for an additional adjournment to allow submission of his stepfather petition and,in fact,did not mention the petition at all.his sole ground for appeal was 
appellant was deemed an illegal alien status.per title a appellant was eligible for a certificate of citizenship from the attorney general,appellant has proof,per sub.a.and will be submitted forthwith the submitted brief.
the cited statute,allows citizen parents to naturalize their children born outside the united states if they are under eighteen years old and residing outside of the united states in the legal and physical custody of the citizen parent a.this provision was inapplicable to because,at the time of the deportation proceedings,he was over eighteen years old and resided in the united states.further,although reference was made to a brief,did not file any additional documents with the bia.
in november,the bia found claims to be without merit and dismissed the appeal.in september,was deported to the dominican republic.he returned to the united states at some point prior to january,when he was arrested in new york city for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree.in november,he was arrested again in new york city for grand larceny in the third degree,criminal possession of stolen property in the third degree,and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree.
on april,was indicted and charged with illegal reentry following deportation in violation of a and b.he moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the underlying order of deportation was invalid because he had been deprived of due process during his deportation proceedings.specifically,he claimed that b oth the ins negligence in being unable to find the which had properly been sent to the proper address and the ij refusal to grant an adjournment to resolve the matter rendered the deportation hearing on july,fundamentally unfair.the district court granted the motion and dismissed the indictment.specifically,the court held that had sufficiently exhausted his administrative remedies despite his failure to raise the issue on appeal had been denied the opportunity for judicial review because the ina,as amended by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,barred him from seeking direct judicial review of his deportation order the ij and ins deprived him of due process at his deportation proceedings and but for the due process errors,there was a meaningful chance that he would have been granted relief from deportation,d at.the government now appeals.
discussion 
because it entails mixed questions of law and fact,we review de novo the district court dismissal of the indictment.see united states,cir united states alfonso,cir.
after the district court dismissed the indictment,was released into the custody of the ins,which deported him to the dominican republic in november,where he purportedly remains.the question arises whether this appeal is therefore moot.we find it is not.should reenter the united states,he would be subject to arrest and,if convicted,imprisonment.see united states,d finding no mootness where defendants were deported following dismissal of their indictments,because defendants could manage to the country on their own,thereby subjecting themselves to arrest and imprisonment for their convictions united states londono,cir the government might make some effort to retrieve the defendant alternatively,the defendant,who was in this country illegally,might return.
ii.collateral attacks on deportation orders 
although the supreme court has not specifically delineated the procedural safeguards to be accorded aliens in deportation or removal hearings,it is well settled that the procedures employed must satisfy due process,at citing shaughnessy united states ex rel.mezei.a liens who have once passed through our gates,even illegally,may be expelled only after proceedings conforming to traditional standards of fairness encompassed in due process of law.consequently a defendant may collaterally attack an order of deportation on due process grounds where,as here,the order becomes an element of a criminal offense.united states,d.to do so successfully,he must satisfy each of the three requirements of d,which provides that 
a n alien may not challenge the validity of a deportation order unless the alien demonstrates that the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.
d see also,at.holding that a collateral challenge to the use of a deportation proceeding as an element of a criminal offense must be permitted where the deportation proceeding effectively eliminates the right of the alien to obtain judicial review,but declining to enumerate which procedural errors are so fundamental that they may functionally deprive the alien of judicial review.
iii.denial of due process 
alleges that the ij failure to grant a fourth adjournment so he could obtain the petition and the ins failure to notify him of its receipt of the form deprived him of due process because his only chance to avoid deportation was to obtain an adjustment of status based on the petition def.br.at.the district court agreed,finding that due process was violated because the defects in the deportation proceedings made his lawful claim for relief merely illusory,d at.in support of its conclusion,the court pointed out that was pro se and that the deportation could not be accomplished for two years following his deportation hearings.id.at.
we differ with the district court.the ij granted three adjournments and he had five months to obtain the,but failed to do so prior to the july,hearing.it was well within the ij discretion to deny request for a fourth adjournment.see ins,cir stating that,in immigration cases,w e will only find an abuse of discretion where the decision was made without a rational explanation,inexplicably departed from established policies,or rested on an impermissible basis citation and internal quotation marks omitted.assuming it was clear during the deportation proceedings that could not be deported for two years,that fact did not require a fourth adjournment because an appeal to the bia,at which he could present the form,was available.moreover,no applicable statute,rule,or decision requires adjournments to be granted merely because time remains before deportation,and such a requirement would lead to delay and inefficiency in deportation proceedings.
also suggests that the ins had the petition in its possession during the deportation proceedings,but did not disclose that fact.he has not,however,proffered any evidence that would show this to be the case.moreover,the document at issue came from his own stepfather and could have been proffered to the bia even after the close of proceedings before the ij.consequently,we conclude that has not established that his deportation proceedings failed to afford him due process of law 
iv.administrative exhaustion 
even if could establish a due process violation,his collateral challenge would fail because he has failed to satisfy the first prong of d exhaustion of his administrative remedies.see d.the district court recognized,and concedes,that his appeal to the bia failed to raise any of the arguments he raised before the district court and which he presses here.his sole basis for appeal to the bia was the inapplicable,which concerns the naturalization of children under the age of eighteen residing outside of the united states.made no reference to a,which governs adjustments of status nor did he make any claim relating to an petition or to the ij failure to grant a fourth adjournment.
the district court,while acknowledging that there are authorities to the effect that the issue to be exhausted must be raised,nevertheless concluded that d administrative exhaustion requirement had been satisfied here,d at.the district court began with the proposition that a n appeal from an ij to the bia,without more,generally suffices to satisfy an exhaustion requirement.id.at quoting united states johnson,wl,at.may.the court then concluded that,in this case,the bia should have considered the adjustment of status issue because it was evident on the record below,because pro se litigants deserve special deference,and because simply sought to raise the issue as he may have understood it.id.at.the court also concluded that was exempted from the exhaustion requirement because he asserted a due process claim that the bia itself could not consider,and because he did not learn that the ins had received his stepfather form until well after the bia had dismissed his appeal.id.
we are not persuaded.the fact that a possible adjustment of status had been discussed in the hearings before the ij does not mean that the issue was also raised on appeal.although the bia has access to the entire record,it is not obligated to search it for possibly meritorious appellate issues.see lovell ins,cir stating that the bia may conduct de novo review of an ij decision emphasis added abdulai ashcroft,cir finding meritless the claim that bia is required to review record de novo.statutory exhaustion requirements such as that set forth in d are mandatory,and court
