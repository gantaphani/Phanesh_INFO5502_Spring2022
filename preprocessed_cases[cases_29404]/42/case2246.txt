guillermo,also known as williams oswaldo,is fighting removal from the united states.he came to this country in the late,and was removed to mexico in.he returned shortly thereafter and has remained here ever since.life is hard for.he was diagnosed with and,later,with a debilitating viral disease that causes the brain white matter to deteriorate.thankfully,has found the support of various organizations and persons in the chicago area that have provided him with the medical,economic,and psychological support he needs.after a arrest,however,the department of homeland security sought to have him removed based on,among other grounds,a previous conviction for drug possession.
did not challenge the charges before the immigration judge ij,but he argued that he qualified for withholding of removal and protection under the convention against torture cat.focused on the threat of persecution against perceived homosexuals and persons suffering from aids.an ij in chicago found removable and denied his application for withholding of removal because he failed to establish a pattern or practice of persecution against those groups in the designated countries.the ij also denied the cat claim.appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia,but the bia affirmed the ij.now he has filed a petition for review with this court.faces a troubling predicament,but our review is tightly constrained.because we conclude that we lack jurisdiction over aguilarmejia factual and legal claims,we dismiss the petition for review.
was born in colombia and raised in guatemala.he was abused by his mother and stepfather.in or,left guatemala and traveled through mexico to the united states,eventually settling in chicago.in,was convicted of possession of a controlled substance and removed to mexico.sometime thereafter he reentered the united states.he was arrested again in,but stayed in the country.
in the years that followed,began to experience various symptoms that he was not able to understand for a time.in,the unfortunate truth emerged he was infected with hiv and had developed aids.later,he was diagnosed with progressive leukoencephalopathy pml,a rare and often fatal viral disease characterized by progressive damage of the brain white matter.this is a disease,as the description from the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke makes clear 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy pml is caused by the reactivation of a common virus in the central nervous system of individuals pml is most common among individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome aids.studies estimate that prior to effective antiretroviral therapy,as many as percent of people with aids eventually developed pml.for them,the disease was most often rapidly fatal.
with current hiv therapy,which effectively restores immune system function,as many as half of all patients survive,although they sometimes have an inflammatory reaction in the regions affected by pml.the symptoms of pml are the result of an infection that causes the loss of white matter which is made up of myelin,a substance th at surrounds and protects nerve fibers in multiple areas of the brain.without the protection of myelin,nerve signals ca travel successfully from the brain to the rest of the body.typical symptoms associated with pml are diverse,since they are related to the location and amount of damage in the brain,and evolve over the course of several days to several weeks.the most prominent symptoms are clumsiness progressive weakness and visual,speech,and sometimes,personality changes.the progression of deficits leads to disability and death over weeks to months.

has many of the symptoms that the institute described.he has had problems with his memory,has been diagnosed with clinical depression,has experienced various other health problems including a severe stroke followed by a coma,and has attempted suicide at least once.the record in this case is uneven because memory problems make it difficult to determine all of the relevant facts.
in,was arrested for possession of false identification and drinking alcohol in public.aguilar mejia tried to excuse his conduct by saying that he needed the id in order to obtain an apartment.following that arrest,the government sought to remove him to guatemala,colombia,or mexico.it offered four bases for the proposed action seeking admission within years of previous removal,a a ii entering the united states without inspection,id.a a i commission of a crime involving moral turpitude,id.a a i i and commission of a offense,id.a a i ii.
did not challenge these charges in fact,he conceded removability based on the crime of moral turpitude and the offense.instead,requested withholding of removal and protection under the cat.his arguments focused exclusively on his fear of future persecution based on his membership in two groups perceived homosexuals and persons with aids.presented a voluminous written record,called five witnesses,and testified himself.the evidence established diagnoses of and pml,his dire and deteriorating condition,the extensive medical treatment he required to stave off death,the severe difficulty of accessing that treatment in the countries to which the government was proposing to remove him,and the societal stigma and mistreatment of people belonging to the social groups he had identified.at all times,aguilarmejia through counsel argued that there was a pattern or practice of persecution directed at the social groups he had identified he did not assert that there was any reason that he would be singled out for persecution more than others in his groups.when the ij asked aguilarmejia counsel directly whether his claim was limited to the theory,counsel answered in the affirmative.
on february,the ij issued an oral decision denying relief.the ij first found that was removable on all four charges.does not challenge any of these grounds for removal in his petition.
the ij next turned to request for withholding of removal.because did not present evidence of past persecution,the ij looked only to future persecution based on the pattern or practice of persecution of persons perceived to be homosexuals and persons with aids in the countries designated for removal.the ij determined that qualified as a member of both groups,and that these groups constituted social groups for purposes of the regulations.the ij was sympathetic to aguilarmejia case,but in the end he decided that there was not enough evidence of a pattern or practice of persecution to warrant withholding of removal.although the ij acknowledged the difficulty may face in obtaining the necessary medications upon removal,he decided that these circumstances did not establish the threat of persecution required for withholding of removal.the ij also found that the cat was inapplicable because did not establish that the governments of the target countries would commit or acquiesce to the commission of torture against members of either social group.the ij noted that was not eligible for asylum,because he did not file his application within one year of entry into the united states.there was no evidence of changed country conditions in the proposed recipient countries.
appealed to the bia,again arguing the theory for withholding of removal.the bia agreed with the ij.has now filed a petition for review,with the help of the national immigrant justice center nijc as amicus curiae.he asks this court to reject the ij and bia decisions on withholding of removal,either based on the sufficiency of the evidence or a claim of legal error.did not raise any issues particular to the cat or asylum on appeal to the bia,nor does he raise those issues in this court.we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review the sufficiency of the evidence under the statute,and that failed to preserve the claim of legal error he raises in this court.
an applicant for withholding of removal must establish that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b.past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption of
