facing expedited removal from the united states as an alien convicted of committing an aggravated felony,prince henry eke filed this petition for review from the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia or board rejecting his request for withholding of removal.initially,the board argued before this court that we lacked jurisdiction to consider eke arguments.after oral argument,however,the attorney general withdrew that argument and,with the court permission,filed a supplemental brief defending the board decision on the merits.eke filed a response to that brief on november,and so the case is now ready for decision.
eke claims that if he is returned to his native nigeria,it is more likely than not that he will be harmed seriously or even killed,because he is homosexual.the board rejected this assertion,relying primarily on adverse credibility determinations it found that eke was subject to summary removal based on his guilty pleas to three crimes of theft of financial identity.before this court,eke now presents four reasons in support of his petition his convictions were not for crimes that fall within the definition of aggravated felony under a m i he should not have been required to provide corroborating evidence of his homosexuality the board should have considered the pattern of persecution against homosexuals in nigeria and eke due process rights were violated when the immigration judge ij insisted on conducting the hearing on the merits by video conference.we conclude that the government correctly conceded that we have jurisdiction over the petition,but that eke claims fail on their merits.we therefore deny his petition for review.
eke is a native of nigeria and member of the ibo tribe.he claims to be a homosexual.eke reported that he had a sexual relationship with a male companion,gozie,in nigeria.even though he tried to keep his sexual orientation a secret,eke claimed that others in his community saw through his efforts,and he was,as a result,frequently harassed.according to eke,his community traditional law forbids homosexuality and regards it as punishable by death.after eke father was named king of his village,eke allegedly became a prince and thus was responsible for certain ceremonial duties.bowing to pressure from his family,he at that time married a childhood friend,rose mary,and accepted her two children as his own.the record indicates that these children,in fact,were his own.the ij noted that eke testimony on this point shifted over time.on direct examination,he admitted that he had fathered the children but initially had disclaimed paternity because he did not want them and thought it was incredible that he had children.however,on cross examination,eke testified that he never consummated the marriage and that he did not have any physical relationship with rose mary.later during his cross examination,eke testified further that he did in fact have sexual relations with rose mary,on at least two occasions,and that he did have two children with her.eventually,the marriage failed,after rose mary discovered eke and his lover gozie in flagrante delicto.at that point,eke was forced to flee his village.he took refuge in an isolated village for three years,until he obtained the documentation needed to come to the united states,which he believed would be more accepting of his sexual orientation.once in the united states,he lived briefly with his sister,but,he testified,she asked him to leave because of his gay lifestyle.this rejection prompted him to divorce his nigerian wife and to marry an american woman.the latter wife also discovered that he was gay and ended the relationship.
in,eke made the mistake of trying to help a friend buy a used car with false documentation.he presented another person social security card,a permanent residence card,an illinois driver license,and a state id card,in an effort to purchase an automobile worth more than.caught in the act,eke pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the illinois identity theft statute,ilcs a,and to two substantive counts of identity theft.on april,the department of homeland security dhs served eke with a notice of intent to issue a final administrative removal order,based on those convictions.although at one point eke claimed that he never received this notice,the government has now furnished a copy of it,and the copy shows clearly that eke acknowledged service.more than that,the copy shows that eke,by checking some boxes on the form,admitted the allegations in the notice,admitted that he was deportable,waived his right to contest the charges,and designated nigeria as the country to which he would be removed.notwithstanding these representations,eke then expressed a fear of persecution upon removal to nigeria.dhs responded by putting eke in proceedings for withholding of removal.an asylum officer found that eke fear was reasonable,but the ij rejected his petition after a full hearing.the bia agreed with the ij,and eke now presents his petition for review.
although the government has now withdrawn its challenge to this court jurisdiction,we have a duty independent of its concession to assure ourselves that jurisdiction is secure.we therefore begin by explaining why we too have concluded that we have jurisdiction over this petition.
this case arose under the provisions of the immigration and nationality act ina that authorize expedited removal of certain aliens who have been convicted of committing aggravated felonies.see ina b,b.critically,section b allows a final removal order to issue without a hearing for the alien.expedited removal begins with formal notice served on the alien.see b the attorney general shall provide that the alien is given reasonable notice of the charges and of the opportunity to inspect the evidence and rebut the charges.removal proceedings shall commence upon personal service of the notice of intent upon the alien emphasis added.
as we noted,dhs served eke with a notice of intent to issue a final administrative removal order on april.the notice provided,consistently with b i,that eke had calendar days in which to respond to the charges.for an alien who does not file a response,the regulations provide that dhs may follow up with a final administrative removal order.d.eke notice informed him that he would be entitled to seek judicial review of any final administrative order by filing a petition for review within calendar days after the date such final administrative order is issued.dhs in fact issued its final order in eke case on may.although eke did not seek independent judicial review of that determination,what happened next was that dhs referred him for a interview,based on his statement that he believed that he would be killed or injured upon his return to nigeria because of his sexual orientation.an asylum officer from dhs citizenship and immigration services office interviewed him on june and,and determined that eke had demonstrated a reasonable fear of persecution.his case was then referred to the immigration court on july,for consideration of his petition for withholding of removal.
an ij held a hearing on july,at which he considered eke eligibility for both withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture.with respect to the former,the ij noted that eke had the burden of demonstrating a clear probability of persecution in nigeria on account of his race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.see ins stevic,d.in a written decision dated may,the ij found that eke failed to meet that burden.the record,the ij thought,was riddled with inconsistencies going to the heart of eke claims at one point eke fraudulently entered into a marriage in order to obtain a benefit under the immigration laws and eke never sought asylum until after he had committed the aggravated felony.eke testimony was not even clear on such a major point as how and why his son was killed at the hands of the village elders.the ij also found that eke commission of the crimes of identity theft independently barred him from withholding of removal,as those crimes were particularly serious,that eke had not shown a clear probability of future persecution based on his sexual orientation,and that he had failed to show that the threat of persecution he faced existed throughout the country.on the last point,the ij noted that eke claim that he could not relocate was not objectively reasonable,in light of the fact that he had remained in nigeria for three years in a different village without apparent difficulty.the bia affirmed the ij decision and denied eke motion to remand the matter to the ij in a decision dated august.
eke filed a timely petition for review from the bia order.we are satisfied that the attorney general is correct that the immigration authorities were not finished with eke case until the bia final decision,and thus we are authorized to consider the question whether dhs correctly determined that eke state court convictions were aggravated felonies for purposes of the immigration laws.the real id act,a d,put an end to any doubt on the matter.moreover,even before that,we had explained that we retain jurisdiction to determine whether we have is,to determine whether an alien criminal conviction is indeed an aggravated felony under the ina,thereby triggering the jurisdictional bar of a c.ins,cir.
even though we lack jurisdiction to review the attorney general exercise of discretion to grant or deny relief to an alien,we have the authority to decide constitutional claims and questions of law.see a d ali achim,cir.our review of the determination that eke committed an aggravated felony is de novo,at.our review of the legal standards that the ij and bia applied is also de novo.gattem gonzales,cir.
on the merits,the government argues first that eke conceded that he was deportable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony,and that should be the end of it.eke responds that the notice presented to him did not indicate that he could contest the characterization of his offenses,and thus that he should not be found to have waived an argument that he never knew he had.moreover,eke points out,the government did not make its own waiver argument in its initial brief in this case,and thus we should find that it has forfeited its waiver argument.given the shifts in position that have occurred in this case,we prefer not to resolve it on waiver grounds,either way.we are satisfied that eke has been trying to raise the argument that his convictions,for various reasons,should not automatically lead to his removal.both sides have now briefed the merits of this point,and so we see no reason not to reach them.
eke contends that he was not convicted of an aggravated felony,as defined by a,because there is an incomplete overlap between the illinois law identity theft statute under which he was convicted,which encompasses cases where a criminal has obtained or more in credit,money,goods,services,or other property,and the relevant ina section,which requires a loss to the victim or victims that exceeds.see ilcs a m i.
to determine whether any of eke convictions amounts to a conviction for an aggravated felony,we follow the categorical approach.hashish gonzales,cir.the ninth circuit did the same in a case very similar to the one now before us 
we first make a categorical comparison between the generic,an aggravated felony,defined as an offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds,a m i and the elements of each particular offense of which petitioner was convicted.if the statutory crime of conviction is broader than the generic crime that is,if petitioner could have been convicted under the statute for conduct that would not satisfy the generic crime then we must move to the modified categorical approach 
under the modified categorical approach,we conduct a limited examination of documents in the record of conviction to determine if there is sufficient evidence to conclude that a defendant was convicted of the elements of the generically defined crime even though his or her statute of conviction was facially overinclusive.
li ashcroft,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.other circuits employ the same analysis.for example,the first circuit observed in conteh gonzales,cir,that 
t he ina does not prescribe a detailed methodology for determining whether a predicate offense fits within these definitions and,thus,qualifies as an aggravated felony.where uncertainty exists,however,virtually every court of appeals faced with the question has sought some form of guidance from the categorical approach devised by the supreme court for use in the criminal sentencing context.the bia has followed suit,citing the leading supreme court precedent,taylor united states,d,in a number of aggravated felony decisions.
at citations omitted.
the ina includes many offenses within its definition of aggravated felony,but only one is relevant to eke case an offense that i involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds ina a m i a m i.we must therefore determine whether eke illinois convictions met these criteria,by looking at the terms of the charging document,the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant,or to some comparable judicial record of this information.shepard united states,d.two elements stand out first,did the offense involve fraud or deceit and second,was the loss to the victim or victims more than.although at one point,eke had argued that his conspiracy conviction did not involve an amount over,he has now withdrawn that argument.we thus analyze all three convictions together.
the relevant illinois statute bars using another person identity information to fraudulently obtain credit,money,goods,services,or other property.ilcs a.the record here includes an indictment from the grand jury in cook county,illinois,charging that eke violated this statute when he 
knowingly used any identification document,to wit social security card and naturization sic permanent residency card of another person,peace ralston,to fraudulently obtain credit,money,goods,services,or other property,to wit an automobile in the name of peace ralston and the value of the credit,money,goods,services,other property exceeded ten thousand dollars but did not exceed one hundred thousand dollars 
another count of the indictment alleged a violation of a with the use of illinios sic driver lecense sic and illinois state id of another person,peace ralston.finally,the third count of the indictment charged eke with conspiracy to commit a financial crime,in violation of ilcs,in that he had personal information of peace ralston mailed to his post office box on two occasions in furtherance of that agreement with sabina olapindo and presented said documents of peace ralston to purchase an automobile as part of a common scheme there is also a certified statement of,which lists the three charges as follows 
eke argues that these convictions punish frauds in which the value of the credit or item exceeded,but that the aggravated felony that dhs identified focuses on a loss to the victim that exceeds.here,eke continues,he never actually obtain ed credit,money,goods,services,or other property through his attempted use of ralston identity.at most,he attempted to obtain credit and goods through the use of ralston documents,but his efforts were unsuccessful.as we read his arguments,eke concedes that the illinois convictions involved fraud or deceit,and so we focus only on the monetary element.
the government agrees that a categorical approach is proper,citing taylor united states,d,as modified by shepard united states,d,and as applied to immigration cases in ashcroft,cir,superceded by statute on other grounds,as stated in hamid gonzales,cir.relying on ina a u,which includes in the definition of aggravated felonies covered by the act an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense described in this paragraph,the government argues that eke illinois convictions fall within the act definition.even though illinois was not prosecuting eke for attempted identity theft,it did prosecute him for conspiracy,and so a u is directly implicated.the documents we
