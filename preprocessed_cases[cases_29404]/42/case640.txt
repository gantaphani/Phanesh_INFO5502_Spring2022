the board of immigration appeals found that alwyn colin griffiths had been convicted of a firearms violation and ordered him deported under a c of the immigration and nationality act of,previously codified at a c.the bia also denied his request for discretionary relief from deportation.griffiths challenges whether the disposition of his firearms violation under massachusetts law was sufficiently final to constitute a conviction within the meaning of the ina.petitioner also challenges the bia failure to address his request for a h waiver and the denial of his request for voluntary departure under.we remand the case to the bia.
griffiths,a citizen of jamaica,has lived as a lawful resident in this country since.he is the son of a citizen mother and a lawful permanent resident father,and is the father of three minor citizen children.
in,at eighteen years of age,griffiths was charged in the dorchester district court with carrying a firearm without a license and unlawful possession of ammunition,in violation of section of chapter of the massachusetts general laws.on january,he was convicted and sentenced to probation,as well as a suspended term of imprisonment.
on september,the ins ordered griffiths to show cause why he should not be deported under former a c of the ina,a c,based on this firearms conviction at the deportation hearing on october,griffiths conceded the ins factual allegations and deportability,but sought an opportunity to apply for relief from deportation by way of an adjustment of status and a h waiver of inadmissibility based on purported hardship to his citizen family relations.over the ins objection,the immigration judge granted a continuance,and griffiths filed applications for adjustment of status and a h waiver.
on april,while his deportation case was continued,the dorchester district court granted griffiths motion for a new trial on the firearms offense,which had formed the basis for the deportation charge.this was two years after his initial conviction and after he had served his term of probation.the apparent basis for vacating the conviction was uncertainty over whether a deportation warning required by state law had been given.after the initial conviction was vacated,the court reduced the firearms charge from unlawful carrying a firearm to unlawful possession of a firearm,and griffiths admitted to sufficient facts to support both the revised firearms and the ammunition charges.the criminal court did not impose any additional punishment,but found him guilty and placed the criminal charge on file.
on april,griffiths moved to terminate the deportation proceedings against him,contending that he no longer stood convicted as alleged in the order to show cause.he argued to the immigration judge that the disposition of the renewed charges was not sufficiently final to support an order of deportation,citing pino landon.petitioner contended that that disposition of the criminal charge did not qualify as a conviction under the definition set forth in the bia decision,matter of ozkok,bia,which governed at the time.the ins countered that the portion of the definition in matter of ozkok relied on by petitioner in fact governed only cases where adjudication of guilt was deferred and thus there was no formal judgment of guilt entered,while in this case the criminal court entered a formal finding of guilty,a finding which was sufficient to support a charge of deportability.on may,the immigration judge found that the disposition was a conviction,mistakenly denied petitioner a c waiver which is a discretionary waiver based on equitable factors,and for which griffiths had not applied,denied petitioner request for voluntary departure,and ordered griffiths deported.the immigration judge failed to address petitioner application for a h waiver,the waiver for which he actually had applied.
griffiths timely appealed his deportation order to the bia,again contending that the disposition was not of sufficient finality to constitute a conviction for immigration purposes.while griffiths appeal was pending,congress enacted the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,stat,which amended the ina to include for the first time a statutory definition of conviction for federal immigration purposes.see ina a a,a a.on may,the bia dismissed griffiths appeal from the order of deportation,agreeing with the ins that the disposition was sufficient to support the deportation charges against him under this new statutory definition of conviction.the bia relied on its intervening determination in matter of punu,int,wl bia,that the statutory definition of conviction broadened the scope of conviction for immigration purposes to encompass some deferred adjudications,even where the right to further appellate review of the issue of guilt or innocence on such deferred adjudications remained available.the bia affirmed the immigration judge denial of a c waiver,and found that without such waiver he could not qualify for adjustment of status.like the immigration judge,the board failed to address the application for a h waiver,nor did it address his request for voluntary departure in lieu of deportation.griffiths now petitions this court for review of the board decision.
a.the scope of review 
we review de novo an agency construction of a statute that it administers,although subject to established principles of deference.see ins,d ins,cir.under those principles of deference,if the intent of congress is clear,it must govern,but where the statute is silent or ambiguous on an issue,the question for the court is whether the agency interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.see chevron,natural resources defense council,d,at.since agency officials acting in the immigration context exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations,deference to administrative expertise is particularly appropriate,at,quoting ins abudu,d.
b.the definition of conviction for immigration purposes 
at issue here is what it means to be convicted of an offense within the terms of former a c of the ina,a c,now codified at a c.what it means to be convicted of a crime for immigration purposes has been the source of much debate.while the ina compels consideration of various state criminal laws and procedures because it allows state convictions to form the basis for deportation,the question of what constitutes a conviction sufficient to afford such a basis is a question of federal,not state,law.see,white ins,cir.
before the enactment of iirira in,the ina did not provide any statutory definition of conviction for immigration purposes.the supreme court briefly addressed the meaning of the term in a per curiam opinion,pino landon.in that case,the supreme court addressed the decision of this court in pino nicolls,cir,which found that a criminal conviction placed on file in massachusetts qualified as a conviction for the purposes of the ina.the supreme court reversed,holding that o n the record here we are unable to say that the conviction has attained such finality as to support an order of deportation under the ina.at.
the bia attempted to create uniformity in the treatment of various state methods of disposing of criminal cases by creating a controlling definition of conviction for immigration purposes in matter of ozkok,bia,which included a test to apply where adjudication of guilt had been withheld under state procedures 
this court again addressed the massachusetts practice of placing criminal cases on file in white ins,cir,though not in the context of forming the basis of a deportation charge.there we applied the standard set out in matter of ozkok and held that,in weighing the equities while considering a c waiver,the bia erred in considering filed criminal charges to be convictions for immigration purposes.id.at.see also molina ins,cir rhode island nolo contendere plea plus probation,which was not considered a conviction under state law upon completion of probation,was conviction under federal immigration laws.
against this background,in congress enacted iirira,which,among other things,added a definition of the term conviction for federal immigration purposes to the ina.see iirira a,amending ina a a a a.that definition of conviction is as follows 
the term conviction means,with respect to an alien,a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court,or,if adjudication of guilt has been withheld,where 
i a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt,and 
ii the judge has ordered some form of punishment,penalty,or restraint on the alien liberty to be imposed.
ina a a.though enacted after the relevant conduct,this definition governs on griffiths appeal.see iirira c effective amendments made by subsection a shall apply to convictions and sentences entered before,on,or after the date of the enactment of this act.
the congressional conference committee report accompanying iirira commented on congressional intent in drafting iirira 
this section deliberately broadens the scope of the definition of conviction beyond that adopted by the board of immigration appeals in matter of ozkok,i n wl bia.as the board noted in ozkok there exist in the various states a myriad of provisions for ameliorating the effects of a conviction.as a result,aliens who have clearly been guilty of criminal behavior and whom congress intended to be considered convicted have escaped the immigration consequences normally attendant upon conviction.ozkok,while making it more difficult for alien criminals to escape such consequences,does not go far enough to address situations where a judgment of guilt or imposition of sentence is suspended,conditioned upon the alien future good behavior.for example,the third prong of ozkok requires that a judgment or adjudication of guilt may be entered if the alien violates a term or condition of probation,without the need for any further proceedings regarding guilt or innocence on the original charge.in some states,adjudication may be deferred upon a finding or confession of guilt,and a final judgment of guilt may not be imposed if the alien violates probation until there is an additional proceeding regarding the alien guilt or innocence.in such cases,the third prong of the ozkok definition prevents the original finding or confession of guilt to be considered a conviction for deportation purposes.this new provision,by removing the third prong of ozkok,clarifies congressional intent that even in cases where adjudication is deferred,the original finding or confession of guilt is sufficient to establish a conviction for purposes of the immigration laws.
conf,sess,wl at.
the bia has interpreted the definition of conviction in ina a a in matter of punu,int,wl bia.in that case,the board,sitting en banc,addressed a texas criminal procedure that deferred adjudication of the criminal charge and placed the defendant on probation,but allowed for the possibility of further appellate review on the question of the defendant guilt or innocence.the board found that the defendant was convicted for immigration purposes under the new definition,as there was a finding of guilt and the imposition of probation.see see also moosa ins,cir affirming the conclusion that a deferred adjudication under texas law was a conviction for federal immigration purposes,reversing ins,cir holding that deferred adjudication under texas law did not qualify as conviction for federal immigration purposes under the definition.implicit in this holding is a conclusion that the finality requirement no longer applied to deferred adjudications under the new definition,as the concurrence makes explicit.see matter of punu,int,at grant,board member,concurring see also moosa,at finality is no longer a requirement.matter of punu did not purport to deal with the issue of finality under the first prong of the new iirira definition of a conviction,where there is a formal judgment of guilt.it addressed only the second prong of the new definition,where adjudication of guilt has been withheld.
c.the procedure in massachusetts law 
massachusetts criminal procedure allows a court to place a case on file either before or after the plea where public justice does not require an immediate sentence.commonwealth dowdican bail.under massachusetts law,the procedure suspends the adjudicative process,including the defendant right to appeal,until such time as the court reactivates or makes some further disposition of the case.white,at.over years ago,the supreme judicial court of massachusetts described the process 
it has long been a common practice in this commonwealth,after verdict of guilty in a criminal case,when the court is satisfied that,by reason of extenuating circumstances or other sufficient cause,public justice does not require an immediate sentence,to order,with the consent of the defendant and of the attorney for the commonwealth,and upon such terms as the court in its discretion may impose,that the indictment be laid on file such an order is not equivalent to a final judgement,or to a nolle prosequi or discontinuance,by which the case is put out of court but is a mere suspending of active proceedings in the case and leaves it within the power of the court at any time,upon the motion of either party,to bring the case forward and pass any lawful order or judgment therein.
dowdican bail,at.despite the sjc reference to after verdict,a charge can be filed at any stage,white,at,even prior to trial or change of plea.a disposition involves an admission of sufficient facts for a possible finding of guilt,but not an explicit admission of guilt.united states tavares,cir.because filing of a charge is not a final judgment or equivalent to sentencing,commonwealth bianco,the process suspend s,for as long as the case remains on file,the defendant right to appeal alleged error in the proceeding,commonwealth delgado.it is for that reason that a defendant must consent to filing.see id.
application of the definition to the disposition 
griffiths contends that the disposition of the criminal charges against him does not qualify as a conviction for immigration purposes.recall that the definition has two alternate prongs for finding a conviction.the first prong involves cases where there has been a formal judgment of guilt.the second prong applies to deferred adjudications,and requires the presence of additional elements.griffiths argues that his disposition does not fall within either prong of the definition.first,he argues that there is a finding of guilt but no formal judgment of guilt,and therefore there is no conviction under the first prong of ina a a.on the other hand,he says,the elements for finding a conviction where the adjudication of guilt has been deferred are not met,as the massachusetts court did not impose any form of punishment,penalty,or restraint on griffiths liberty.in any case,he says,the finality requirement of pino landon presents a separate and remaining bar,as he retains his rights to direct appellate review.
the ins responds that the notation of the dorchester district court on the docket sheet that griffiths was guilty prior to placing the case on file reflects a formal judgment of guilt,and therefore the petitioner has been convicted of a crime for immigration purposes under the first prong of ina a a.in any case,the ins says,the court entered a finding of guilt and griffiths served a year of probation for the conduct,so he is convicted under the second prong of the statute as well.as to the second prong,the finality requirement,according to the ins,was an interpretation of the statutory meaning of the bare term convicted that was superceded by the congressional enactment of an express statutory definition.therefore griffiths theoretical right to appeal the case,should it ever be brought forward,is not relevant to the finding that he was convicted for immigration purposes under the second prong of the statute.
we read the board decision in this case to hold that the disposition of griffiths case was a conviction for federal immigration purposes under the second prong laid out in ina a a,which applies in cases where the adjudication of guilt has been withheld.while the board sp
