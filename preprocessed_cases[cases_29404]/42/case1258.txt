li hua yuan petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia denying her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.her husband,zhuo gui ni,joins her petition on a derivative basis.for the following reasons,we will deny the petition.
background 
yuan,a native and citizen of china,arrived in the united states in february and attempted to gain entry using a visa issued to her under a false name.shortly thereafter,in a secondary inspection,yuan told an immigration officer that she was single,from nantang wan li village,lian jiang district,fuzhou city,fujian province,china,and that she had fled china because her impoverished parents were forcing her to marry a man in exchange for money.the next month,in march,the department of homeland security dhs issued yuan a notice to appear nta,charging her with being inadmissible for lack of proper documentation in violation of the immigration and nationality act ina a a i i,a a i i,and for fraudulently or willfully misrepresenting a material fact namely her identity to gain entry to the united states in violation of ina a c i,a c i.
in july,yuan filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal she identified two bases for asylum the impending forced marriage in china and the punishment she would receive from the chinese government for being a practitioner of falun gong.in october,after hearing yuan testimony,an immigration judge ij sustained dhs charge of inadmissibility for lack of proper documentation and denied yuan application,finding that she was not credible and,in any case,had not shown that she satisfied the requirements for asylum,withholding of removal,or protection under the cat in april,the bia denied yuan appeal without opinion.
yuan timely moved to reopen her removal proceedings in july and attached a new asylum application.in her new application,yuan claimed that she and ni had given birth to a daughter in december,that they were planning to have additional children,and that she fear ed that if she is sent back to china,she would lose the chance to have as many children as she likes due to fujian province birth control policy,which,in yuan case,would permit no more than two children see app.at.in september,the bia denied the motion to reopen,concluding that,since yuan one child did not put her in contravention of the policy and yuan had presented no evidence that china sterilizes its citizens for having children,yuan had failed to show a fear of persecution in china.
yuan again moved to reopen in may.she also attached to her motion an amended version of her july asylum application,which included documentation indicating that she had given birth to a second daughter and documents regarding enforcement of china birth control policy.in september,the bia granted the motion to reopen.the bia explained that,since yuan was seeking to reapply for asylum and withholding of removal based on changed circumstances in china,the motion fell within the timeliness and numerical limits exception under c ii the bia further explained that,since the authenticity of yuan family planning policy documents had not been resolved,it was appropriate to remand yuan case to an ij to hold additional hearings to address the authenticity of the evidence presented with the motion,yuan credibility,and her eligibility for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.app.at.
in advance of yuan hearing,yuan and dhs submitted several documents to the ij,including information on china birth control policies and,from yuan,various affidavits,letters,statements,and certificates in support of her claims.the ij delayed the proceedings several times so that yuan or dhs could satisfy authentication concerns about yuan documents,but neither party was able to do so.dhs objected to much of yuan documentary evidence,noting that several items were copies instead of originals and lacked appropriate corroboration and authentication.the ij ultimately admitted yuan documents but noted that the legitimate issues raised with respect to their authenticity could affect their evidentiary weight.id.at.
after dealing with those preliminary questions,the ij conducted a hearing in may,at which yuan testified.yuan said that she was born in china fujian province,met and married ni after she came to the united states in february,and gave birth here to two daughters.she testified that,if returned to china,she would be sterilized or fined under her home village birth control policy because she had two children and was still a citizen of china.she claimed that she learned of her home village birth control policy from a letter sent by her father,who,at her request,had approached the village committee to inquire regarding the policy.yuan also submitted documents purportedly recounting the experiences of persons who had been subject to enforcement of birth control in china one was a letter from someone allegedly named yang yun duan,a neighbor in yuan village,in which duan claimed to have been subject to forced contraception after the birth of her first child and forced sterilization after the birth of her second child the others included statements from jin fu chen,whose wife had given birth to two children in japan and who was allegedly sterilized upon return to china,and yanyun wu,who was allegedly fined and sterilized for fathering a second child in china after having already fathered a son.
yuan further testified that she would be fined to renminbi rmb,which,under the exchange rate of rmb to dollar,equated to a fine ranging from to.she claimed that she would be unable to pay such a fine if returned to china,since she would stay at home with the children and ni would probably earn an estimated to rmb per month as a construction worker.yuan said that,though she was not then working in the united states,she had earned per year working in a restaurant and that ni also worked in a restaurant,giving them a combined annual income of.she also said that she had been able to repay the she owed to the smugglers who brought her to the united states only because her wages were higher in the united states than in china.
yuan claim for relief was undercut,however,by several evidentiary deficiencies and contradictions.for instance,she failed to produce her father letter explaining the village family planning policy,including the fine schedule.the letter from her neighbor duan gave as the neighbor name yunrui yang rather than yang yun duan,as yuan had claimed,and it was not authenticated.neither was there authentication for the documentation concerning others who submitted statements on yuan behalf.when asked why she made no mention of a fine in her asylum application after having testified at the hearing about it being of paramount importance,yuan testified that she forgot about it.yuan could not explain the discrepancy between her testimony of a to rmb fine and the duan letter,which mentioned only a rmb fine.yuan produced no tax returns to corroborate her testimony regarding her and ni household earnings.she testified that both of her children had traveled with their aunt to china,where they then lived for a number of years with ni mother and sister and were temporarily registered as part of ni mother household without any family member being fined or otherwise disadvantaged.she also testified that she and ni would reside in the town of guantao and be registered as part of ni household if they returned to china,but she failed to produce any evidence of a guantao birth control policy.and though yuan testified that she planned to have more children and had been trying to conceive for the past two years,she had not consulted with a physician to confirm whether she is able to have more children.
following yuan testimony,the ij issued an oral decision finding yuan removable and denying her asylum,withholding of removal,or relief under the cat.the ij analyzed yuan asylum claim under id act standards because yuan had filed her original claim prior to the real id act enactment in,though the ij noted that his conclusion about the case would be the sa
