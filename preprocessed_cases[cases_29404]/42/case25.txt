petitioner felipe appeals from a board of immigration appeals bia decision,which affirmed an immigration judge ij decision denying his applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.argues that he presented sufficient evidence to establish both past persecution and a fear of future persecution,and that he could not reasonably relocate within guatemala,the country of removal.
background 
factual background 
is a native of guatemala,from the village of chixocol,in the municipality of zacualpa.became involved in politics in june,after seeing the patriota spanish for patriot party mayoral candidate for zacualpa,gabriel ventura,deliver a speech.that month,he joined the patriota party,and by august he had become a member of the party executive committee.as a member of the committee,he traveled to campaign events to handle set up and logistics in his time with the party,he helped prepare three rallies.
the incumbent mayor,ernesto,belonged to the une y gana spanish for unite and win party.according to,in the days leading up to the elections,une y gana members began to carry weapons and threaten patriota supporters with their weapons.they had guns and they had sticks and machetes and they knew who patriota supporters were.une y gana members also threatened to kill anyone who voted for ventura.patriota supporters were ridiculed,sometimes even beaten by the une y gana party.nevertheless,and his family cast their votes for ventura on september.
that night,it was announced that,the une y gana candidate,had won the race.the next morning,patriota members gathered at the une y gana victory rally,where a huge fight broke out and the city hall was set on fire.was at home at the time,but other patriota supporters told him that the une y gana party was going to kill off all the members of the patriota party.in addition,the une y gana party made a list of people they accused of being responsible for the fire.was on the list,even though he had nothing to do with the fire,because of his involvement in the patriota party.
received five threatening phone calls in the aftermath of the september election.the first came just days after the election,when an anonymous caller who identified himself as an une y gana member blamed for the fire,pledged to hold him responsible for it,and threatened his life.a second anonymous caller made similar allegations and stated we are watching you,and when we find you we will kill you.became so concerned for his life that he stopped leaving his house.in the third call,the caller asked why he had stopped leaving the house,to which responded that he was frightened.
fearing for his life,moved to cobán,alta verapaz,guatemala.there,he found work running games at fairs and carnivals.on october,while in cobán,received the next phone call.the caller asked why he had left chixocol and told that they knew where he was.in the fifth and final phone call,in january,the caller told that if he did not return to chixocol,une y gana would kidnap his wife and children.never reported the threatening phone calls to authorities.he claimed that the local police were in the present mayor pocket,and he feared word would get back to those threatening him if he reported the calls to the national police.
in the days after the fifth phone call,relocated his family to the village of salamá,about ten hours from chixocol.also removed the chip from his cell phone so that he would not receive any more calls.after saving enough money,left guatemala for the united states in may.nothing suggests that he was either harmed or threatened further between january and may of.
the political conflict in zacualpa resulted in other patriota members being targeted.averred that other members of the patriota party were being kidnapped and beaten.two or three weeks after the election,an acquaintance of ventura was taken from his home and beaten very badly.another patriota member was abducted by une y gana and only returned as part of a prisoner exchange.also testified that he knew of at least one person who was killed by une y gana in the year that he left.does not know what happened to other members of the committee who were accused of burning the city hall,however.in june,after fled guatemala,ventura was arrested by the police for alleged crimes against his political rivals,triggering further protests.
at the time of hearing,the president of guatemala was a member of the patriota party,but the une y gana party remained in control of zacualpa.in addition,wife and children were still living in salamá,however,could not live with them because they lived with his wife employer,and he would not be able to find work in salamá.
procedural history 
conceded removability under a a i i and applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat on january.on may,the ij held a hearing on application.the ij found his testimony to be credible,but she ruled that did not establish past persecution.the ij explained that was never physically harmed and had worked in public view,and the phone calls alone were not so menacing as to have caused some actual harm and so did not rise to the level of persecution.moreover,given failure to report the calls to authorities,the ij could not conclude the requisite government action or inaction.
the ij also concluded that fear of future persecution was not given the time elapsed and limited involvement with the campaign,there was little support for his assertion that he would be targeted if he returned to guatemala.furthermore,the ij found that,although it would be economically difficult,could relocate within guatemala because guatemala president at the time of the hearing was a member of the patriota party and the patriota party ha d gained significant ground in guatemala.specifically,could reasonabl y and safely relocate to salamá,where he had relocated his wife and children.thus,the ij denied applications for both asylum and withholding of removal.the ij concluded by denying application for protection under the cat given his failure to demonstrate that he would be subjected to torture by or with the acquiescence of a public official.
on september,the bia upheld the ij decision on two grounds.first,it adopted the ij determination that the five anonymous threatening phone calls were not so menacing as to have caused some actual harm,and so they did not rise to the level of past persecution.second,it found no clear error of fact or mistake of law in the immigration judge assessment that would be able to relocate to another area in guatemala.it cited the fact that his wife and children lived in salamá as strong evidence that could do so as well.thus,the bia ruled that was not eligible for either asylum or withholding of removal.finally,the bia affirmed that failed to establish that he had ever been tortured or that government officials seek to torture him.the bia therefore dismissed his appeal,and petitioned this court for review.
we review the bia findings of fact under a substantial evidence standard,and we will uphold them if they are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.xin qiang liu lynch,cir.quoting hasan holder,cir.questions of law are reviewed de novo.id.thus,we will reverse the bia determination only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.
to be eligible for asylum,must establish that he is unwilling or unable to return to guatemala because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.proof of past persecution creates a presumption of a fear of future persecution.holder,cir.b.but the government can rebut this presumption by demonstrating either changed circumstances or that could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of guatemala and under all the circumstances,it would be reasonable to expect him to do so.b i a b.similarly,can not establish a fear of future persecution if he could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of guatemala and under all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect him to do so.b ii.
substantial evidence supported the bia determination that did not suffer past persecution 
sought to demonstrate that he suffered persecution in guatemala,in the form of death threats,on account of his political beliefs,thus creating a rebuttable presumption that he will more likely than not suffer persecution if returned to guatemala.see b.c redible,specific threats can amount to persecution if they are severe enough.javed holder,cir.threats of murder fit squarely within this rubric.id.at quoting lópez de hincapié gonzales,cir.t he addition of physical violence is not required for a finding of past persecution,but threats standing alone constitute past persecution in only a small category of cases,and only when the threats are so menacing as to cause significant actual suffering or harm.bonilla mukasey,cir.quoting tobon marin mukasey,cir.
in bonilla,the petitioner received frequent telephone calls from a militant group threatening his and his family lives because of his support for a presidential candidate.id.at.after he changed his telephone number,the same group left a letter outside his apartment declaring the petitioner a military target.id.at.the bia adopted the immigration judge ruling that this was not past persecution.id.at.we affirmed,stating that we could not say that the agency was compelled to find that the petitioner was persecuted.id.at.similarly,in un gonzales,the petitioner was twice confronted by government agents,who told him on the second occasion that he would be killed,and a friend subsequently told him to go into hiding because they were looking to kill the petitioner,cir.the bia had not considered the possibility of past persecution,and we remanded for a finding because we could not say the evidence compels a conclusion either way.id.at.
the intensity and credibility of the threats received by are similar to those in bonilla and un.bonilla in particular seems factually analogous,closer than cases like javed,cited by,in which we have held that threats constituted persecution as a matter of law.although the bia certainly could have found that suffered past persecution on this record,given our deferential standard of review,we can not say that it was compelled to do so.
b.the bia did not correctly analyze whether it would be reasonable to expect to relocate within guatemala 
the bia concluded that did not establish a fear of persecution.however,it did so on only one possible ground by adopting the ij finding that would be able to relocate to another area in guatemala.
an applicant does not have a fear of persecution if the applicant could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant country of nationality if under all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.b ii.when determining whether such internal relocation is reasonable 
adjudicators should consider,but are not limited to considering,whether the applicant would face other serious harm in the place of suggested relocation any ongoing civil strife within the country administrative,economic,or judicial infrastructure geographical limitations and social and cultural constraints,such as age,gender,health,and social and familial ties.
determining whether an applicant can reasonably relocate within the applicant country of nationality entails a analysis.matter of.first,the bia must decide whether there is a safe area of the country,one where the applicant would have no fear of persecution.id.second,if there is such an area,the bia must analyze whether it would be reasonable for the applicant to relocate,applying the considerations of b.id.at quoting b i b.
jurisdiction 
before we proceed,we must determine whether we can review all of arguments.we may only review claims if he has exhausted all administrative remedies available to him as of right.d.in his appeal to the bia,argued only that he would not be safe if he relocated within guatemala.he did not argue that the ij made any error in determining that it would be reasonable for him to relocate.before us,however,also argues that the ij and the bia did not properly apply the considerations listed in b.
the government has not raised this issue,and it appears that we have not previously addressed whether we would raise failure to exhaust sua sponte in the asylum context.but administrative exhaustion in this context is an inquiry into jurisdiction,holder,cir,and where a requirement is jurisdictional where it affect s a court constitutional or statutory power to adjudicate a case a party failure to fulfill that requirement is nonwaivable.bennett city of holyoke,cir.see also alphas william kopke,cir.we therefore hold that we may determine whether a petitioner has exhausted his or her administrative remedies as required by d,even if no party has addressed the issue.
a petitioner generally can not proffer a theory to the ij,forgo any presentation of that theory to the bia,and then resurrect the theory on a petition for judicial review.holder,cir.although a party presenting an issue to the bia is the most common way in which an issue is exhausted,however,it is not the only way,at.even if an issue was not raised by a party,the issue is exhausted if the bia addresses the issue on the merits.id.at where an agency has opted to address an issue,there is no logical reason why exhaustion should turn on which party if either brought the issue to the agency attention.see also xin qiang liu,at the exhaustion requirement is satisfied where the agency chooses to address the merits of a particular issue,regardless of whether the alien raised that issue.quoting meng hua wan holder,cir.
here,the ij squarely addressed the issue.it found that although it would be economically difficult for to relocate,it is reasonable to expect internal relocation rather than to come to the united states.the ij further explained that wife and children remain in guatemala in a town nine to ten hours from chixocol and so it would be reasonable for him to relocate there plus,the ij added,he could do so safely.
for its part,the bia repeated how the ij had found that would be able to relocate to another area in guatemala.the bia then stressed that i n this regard,the ij had noted that wife and child remain in guatemala in a town or hours away,strong evidence that he could do so as well.and the bia found no clear error of fact or mistake of law with the ij assessment.the bia therefore briefly addressed the reasonableness of internal relocation on its own finding that his wife and children remaining in guatemala was strong evidence that he could relocate and it adopted the ij more detailed reasoning on that point.thus,we can review both whether the bia properly found that it was safe for to relocate within guatemala which has raised at every level and whether the bia properly found that he could reasonably do so an issue which the bia addressed on the merits.
the merits 
substantial evidence supports the bia finding that could safely relocate within guatemala.as the ij described lived in cobán from january to may without any further threats after removing the chip from his phone his wife and children apparently lived unmolested after they moved to salamá at the time of the hearing,almost three years had passed since the mayoral election and the patriota party ha d gained significant ground in guatemala.although none of this evidence is conclusive,we are not compelled to overturn the ij finding.
but the ij and the bia described no similar evidence to support their conclusion that,although it would be economically difficult,it would be reasonable to expect to relocate internally.instead,both essentially asserted that because wife and children resided elsewhere in guatemala,so could he.
b,however,lists a number of factors that an adjudicator should consider.w hile the ij and bia do not necessarily have to address each of b reasonableness factors explicitly the agency must explain why the factors that cut against the asylum applicant outweigh the factors in his favor.khattak holder,cir.see also saldarriaga gonzales,app x,cir.remanding asylum petition for further review because the ij did not consider whether the petitioner relocation would be reasonable.in khattak,the bia determined that the petitioner could relocate to another part of pakistan where he owned a home and had briefly lived twenty years earlier.at.we remanded to the bia,however,because neither the ij nor the bia addressed evidence in the record indicating that the petitioner would not be safe in that area and neither the ij nor the bia made any mention of the reasonableness factors.id.at.
relevant factors here include 
ongoing civil strife within the country the ij found that electoral violence is common in every electoral cycle 
economic infrastructure the ij found that relocation would be economically difficult 
social and cultural constraints speaks quiché,a minority language that has no official status and is spoken mainly in guatemala central highlands and 
familial ties all of extended family live in chixocol.
yet the ij and the bia discussed only the fact that wife and children were in salamá.they did not address evidence in the record that appears to undercut the conclusion that could reasonably relocate within guatemala for example,testimony that he could not live with his wife in salamá and does not have a home or a job there.thus,neither the bia nor the ij presented a reasoned analysis of the evidence as a whole.id.at quoting jabri holder,cir.
asserts that every single factor supports a conclusion that he can not reasonably relocate,but he does little to develop this argument.he then asserts that the bia unfounded conclusion itself requires reversal.that is not accurate.to reverse the bia order,rather than simply remand it,the evidence must compel us to conclude that it would be unreasonable for to relocate within guatemala.id.at citing ins.there is significant evidence in the record supporting a conclusion that relocation would be unreasonable.but has understandably focused on the bia failure to properly analyze the reasonableness factors,rather than whether the evidence compels a finding that internal relocation would be unreasonable,and neither the ij nor the bia weighed the reasonableness factors.given the limited analysis on this issue,we think it best to remand to the bia to consider it fully.we therefore grant the petition for review,vacate the bia order,and remand for further proceedings 
conclusion 
petition for review granted,order vacated,and case remanded for further proceedings.
dissenting opinion follows 
i agree with my colleagues that the record supports the bia finding that the events occurring before left guatemala to enter the united states in may of did not constitute the type of persecution that creates a presumption of a fear of future persecution.i also agree that the record supports the bia finding that could have,in any event,safely moved elsewhere in guatemala.
i can not agree,however,that we have jurisdiction to adjudicate newly minted argument that the agency failed to consider adequately the relevant factors in finding that it would be reasonable to expect him to relocate within guatemala.congress has stated that we may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.d.this means that theories not advanced before the bia may not be surfaced for the first time in a petition for judicial review of the bia final order.makhoul ashcroft,cir.we have further concluded that t his exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional that is,it constitutes a limitation on our power of review.holder,cir.see also sousa ins,cir.whatever our own views,we are bound by precedent to apply the ina exhaustion requirement in a more draconian fashion.
as my colleagues concede,never raised before the bia his challenge to the thoroughness of the ij consideration of the factors set forth in b in finding that relocation within guatemala would be reasonable.in order to leap over this significant jurisdictional hurdle,my colleagues declare that the bia sua sponte raised and exhausted the issue of whether relocation would be reasonable.they then assert that we can find,essentially,that the bia sua sponte exhaustion of that issue was not exhaustive enough,because the bia did not also sua sponte evaluate factors that never faulted the ij for allegedly failing to consider.
to explain my disagreement,i first recount exactly what transpired before the agency.on the subject of relocation,the ij stated the following 
given that the patriota party has gained ground in guatemala and the president of the country is part of that party,the court finds that the respondent could internally relocate and that,although it would be economically difficult to do that,it is reasonable to expect internal relocation rather than come to the united states.
finally,the respondent wife and children remain in guatemala in a town nine to hours away from chixocol and the court finds that it is reasonable for the respondent to relocate there and that he could do so safely.
it is plain from the above that the ij made two relevant findings,consistent with the analysis described in matter of,could safely relocate within guatemala,and it would be reasonable for him to do so.
as my colleagues acknowledge,in his appeal to the bia,raised a question concerning only the first of those two findings.in own words,the question was w hether respondent can safely relocate within guatemala.with respect to that question,he advanced only a single,specific argument again in his words respondent can not safely relocate within guatemala.and in support of that argument,he stated only 
respondent has demonstrated that he was targeted by political enemies from une y gana,a national party.as a highly visible public supporter of this party,he runs the risk of being identified and targeted throughout the country.
the fact that respondent wife and children have not been harmed after fleeing their hometown should be given very little weight.respondent wife and children were not public supporters of the party and were not themselves politically active.accordingly,it is unlikely that respondent persecutors have been able to determine the identity and location of his family.in contrast,respondent persecutors can easily recognize him on sight.given these facts,the fact that respondent wife and children have so far escaped harm does not indicate that he can also safely relocate within guatemala.
citations omitted.the bia directly responded to argument with the following 
t he immigration judge found that the respondent would be able to relocate to another area in guatemala.in this regard,the immigration judge noted that the respondent wife and children remain in guatemala in a town or hours away,strong evidence that the respondent could do so as well.
we see no clear error of fact or mistake of law in the immigration judge assessment.
citations omitted.
to find from the foregoing that the bia raised or even acknowledged a challenge to the ij,reasonableness finding,one logically must point to language that one would not expect to find were the bia simply discussing and rejecting argument that it was not safe for him to relocate.my colleagues point to no such language.rather,and without explanation,they point to the fact that the bia said would be able to relocate.yet this is what one would well expect the bia to say in rejecting argument that he could not safely relocate.my colleagues otherwise point again without explanation to the bia observation that the fact that wife and children remained in guatemala provided strong evidence that could do so as well.but this statement,too,was directly responsive to argument that the experience of his wife and children did not mean that he could safely relocate as well.in short,there is no basis for reading into the bia opinion any indication that it was addressing or even aware of any challenge to the ij,reasonableness finding.indeed,the very fact that my colleagues fault the bia for not expressly weighing any of the,reasonableness factors listed in b underscores my point the bia did not weigh those factors because it did not need to do so in order to respond to
