anjam parvez khan petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the immigration judge ij denial of his application for asylum and withholding of removal.the bia adopted the ij finding that khan was ineligible for both forms of relief because he had engaged in terrorist activity.because we hold that the ij properly applied the terrorism bar in the immigration and nationality act ina,we deny the petition for review.
background 
according to his credible testimony,khan was born in kashmir and is a citizen of india.he has been involved in the kashmiri independence movement since about.beginning in the early,khan worked with the jammu kashmir liberation front jklf,a group dedicated to the establishment of an independent kashmir,though he was never officially a member of the jklf.
the jklf had both militant and political factions that,until approximately,were part of the same organization.according to khan,the two factions operated separately but were wings of the same organization.in about,the two factions split into different organizations when half of the jklf renounced violence.before the split,the political wing of the organization advocated nonviolently for an independent kashmir,while the militant wing operated an armed insurgency against the indian government in kashmir.the militant wing took part in killings of politicians,the kidnapping of the daughter of the indian home minister,and repeated attacks on the indian army,including attacks on military convoys.
khan testified that he was affiliated with only the political wing of the jklf,that his work with the jklf was entirely nonviolent in nature,and that he had no knowledge of the activities of the military wing.however,khan admitted to knowing that he was part of that movement,a part of which was an arms struggle and that the militant wing of the jklf was carrying out a war against the indian military.but he claimed to be unaware of any kidnappings,bombings,or activity targeting civilians by the militant wing of the group.khan work with the jklf consisted of planning political activities for the jklf,working to distribute aid through a central committee funded by the jklf,and raising funds for the political wing of the jklf.however,khan testified that he turned the money he raised over to the jklf,not merely to its political wing.he further testified that he was one of the primary organizers of the political wing of the jklf,and that he advised the political wing on how to spend its funds.
in october,khan fled india and entered the united states on a nonimmigrant visitor visa.in march,he applied for asylum and was referred to an ij.before the ij,he asserted requests for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.
in june,the ij issued a written decision denying khan request for asylum and withholding of removal but granting khan request for relief under cat.the ij found khan testimony to be credible,but held that khan was statutorily ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal under a b iv iv because he had engaged in terrorist activity.in july,the ij issued a supplemental decision to account for changes made to the ina by the real id act,which applied retroactively to cases pending at the time of its enactment.rafaelano wilson,cir.the ij held that the real id act increased the burden on khan to show that he had not engaged in terrorist activity.the ij held that because khan had failed to meet his burden under the old statute,he necessarily failed under the real id act.
both the government and khan appealed to the bia.the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision on january.khan timely petitioned for review.

iii.discussion 
the ina precludes aliens who have engaged in terrorist activity from seeking some forms of relief.in particular,a b i renders inadmissible certain aliens who have engaged in terrorist activity,have been members or representatives of terrorist organizations,or have encouraged others to engage in terrorist activity.this provision applies to aliens seeking both asylum or withholding of removal through other parts of the statute.section b a v provides that any alien described in a b i i,any alien who has engaged in a terrorist activity is ineligible for asylum additionally,b b iv provides that withholding of removal is unavailable when there are reasonable grounds to believe that the alien is a danger to the security of the united states.reasonable grounds exist to believe that an alien is a danger to security if the alien has engaged,is engaged,or at any time after admission engages in any terrorist activity as defined in section a b iv.bellout ashcroft,cir quoting b b iv and a former version of a b.thus,if an alien has engaged in a terrorist activity under a b iv at any time,he is ineligible for both asylum and withholding of removal.it does not matter that the alien ceased participation in terrorist activity at some point before seeking admission to or relief in the united states.
the statute defines engag ing in terrorist activity broadly.section a b iv iv cc defines engag ing in terrorist activity to include solicit ing funds or other things of value for a terrorist organization described in clause vi iii,unless the solicitor can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he did not know,and should not reasonably have known,that the organization was a terrorist organization.an alien intention in soliciting funds only for nonviolent activity is irrelevant to this definition,even when an organization has separate political and militant wings,because money donated to an organization political wing is considered to be support for the militant wing as well.humanitarian law project reno,cir m oney is fungible giving support intended to aid an organization peaceful activities frees up resources that can be used for terrorist acts.
the statute also defines terrorist organization broadly.the definition includes a group of two or more individuals,whether organized or not,which engages in,or has a subgroup which engages in,the activities described in subclauses i through vi of clause iv.a b vi iii.subclauses i through vi of clause iv list ways in which an individual or an organization can engage in terrorist activity.these include committing,planning,soliciting funds for,soliciting individuals for,or providing material support for a terrorist activity.id.a b iv.
the statute defines a terrorist activity as 
any activity which is unlawful under the laws of the place where it is committed or which,if it had been committed in the united states,would be unlawful under the laws of the united states or any state and which involves any of the following 
i the highjacking or sabotage of any conveyance including an aircraft,vessel,or vehicle.
ii the seizing or detaining,and threatening to kill,injure,or continue to detain,another individual in order to compel a third person including a governmental organization to do or abstain from doing any act as an explicit or implicit condition for the release of the individual seized or detained.
iii a violent attack upon an internationally protected person as defined in section b of title or upon the liberty of such a person.
iv an assassination.
v the use of any 
a biological agent,chemical agent,or nuclear weapon or device,or 
b explosive,firearm,or other weapon or dangerous device other than for mere personal monetary gain,with intent to endanger,directly or indirectly,the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.
vi a threat,attempt,or conspiracy to do any of the foregoing.
under these provisions,an alien is ineligible for asylum or withholding of removal if he solicited funds or things of value for an organization that committed,planned,solicited funds for,solicited individuals for,or provided material support for a terrorist activity,unless the alien can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he did not know,and should not reasonably have known,that the organization was a terrorist organization.the ij found khan ineligible for relief under these provisions because he solicited funds for the jklf.
the ij focused on subsections i,ii,and iii of a b iii in considering whether the jklf had engaged in terrorist activity.the ij found that the jklf had conducted attacks against the indian military,including killings,bombings,and attacks on convoys,as well as the kidnapping of the daughter of the indian home minister.the ij then found that khan had not met his burden in establishing that he had not known nor reasonably should have known about these terrorist activities.
khan makes several arguments challenging the ij findings.first,khan argues that his due process rights were violated when the ij did not conduct a new hearing to allow him to present evidence challenging his ineligibility under the modified standards in the real id act.
second,khan challenges the ij determination on the merits,arguing that the jklf was not a terrorist organization,that he did not know and reasonably should not have known about the jklf terrorist activities,and that he is not presently a threat to national security and thus may not be subjected to refoulement.the core of these arguments is that the activities of an organization such as the jklf that is engaged in armed resistance against an illegitimate government are permitted under international law,and that the definition of terrorist activity in the ina does not extend to violent activities in furtherance of such armed resistance so long as those activities comply with international law.
third,khan argues that the statute is unconstitutionally vague.
we consider each of these arguments below.
due process claim 
after the ij initial ruling,the ij issued a supplemental decision to account for changes made to the ina by the real id act.khan claims that his due process rights were violated because he was not afforded an opportunity to present evidence relevant to his admissibility under the new standards imposed by the real id act.
under the previously applicable standard,an alien was required to show,by a preponderance of the evidence,that he did not know,and should not reasonably have known,that the solicitation would further the organization terrorist activity.as we explained above,under the real id act,an alien must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he did not know,and should not reasonably have known,that the organization was a terrorist organization.a b iv iv cc.
khan due process claim fails because the real id act served only to increase khan burden.because khan failed to meet the preponderance of the evidence standard,he necessarily failed to meet the more stringent clear and convincing evidence standard.further,because khan failed to show that he should not reasonably have known that his fundraising would further the jklf terrorist activity,he necessarily failed to show that he should not reasonably have known the jklf was a terrorist organization.as explained above,the definition of terrorist organization encompasses any group engaged in terrorist activity.a b vi iii.if khan should have known that his fundraising for the jklf would further its terrorist activities,he also should have known that the jklf was engaged in terrorist activities and was thus a terrorist organization.
because khan had already presented evidence that failed to meet the lower standard id act,there was no due process violation in denying him the opportunity to present evidence to meet the higher standard id act.
asylum and withholding of removal claims 
khan challenges the ij holding that he is ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal because of his work for the jklf.the government argues that we lack jurisdiction to review the ij determination on the asylum claim.it is uncontested that we have jurisdiction to review whether khan is ineligible for withholding of removal because he engaged in terrorist activity.
jurisdiction over the asylum claim 
the government argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the bia determination that khan is statutorily ineligible for asylum because he engaged in terrorist activity.we have jurisdiction to determine whether jurisdiction exists.ins,cir.
section b d provides,there shall be no judicial review of a determination of the attorney general under subparagraph a v.section b a v,described above,bars aliens who engage in a terrorist activity from eligibility for asylum.in bellout ashcroft,cir,we held that this provision stripped the court of jurisdiction to review the ij or the bia determination that a petitioner was ineligible for asylum because he engaged in terrorist activity.id.at.
however,after we decided bellout,congress passed the real id act,which revised this jurisdictional bar.section a d provides that n othing in any other provision of this chapter other than this section which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.the chapter referred to in a d includes b d,the provision upon which we relied in.
in fernandez ruiz gonzales,cir,we held that the real id act restored appellate review over all constitutional claims or questions of law.id.at.in ramadan gonzales,cir,we held that this principle extended to mixed questions of law and fact.id.at.mixed questions of law and fact are those in which the historical facts are admitted or established,the rule of law is undisputed,and the issue is whether the facts satisfy the statutory standard.id.at quotation omitted.we held in ramadan that whether undisputed facts constituted changed circumstances in a country,as defined by the immigration laws,is a mixed question of law and fact over which we have jurisdiction.id.
where the facts are undisputed,we have extended ramadan to other provisions.see,ramos barrios holder,wl,at cir.june,holding that question of whether petitioner had satisfied threshold requirements to qualify for special rule cancellation was mixed question over which we have jurisdiction husyev mukasey,cir holding that question of whether extraordinary circumstances exist to justify a delay in the filing of an application for asylum is a mixed question over which we have jurisdiction ghahremani gonzales,cir holding that question of whether petitioner established due diligence in discovering deception,fraud,or error in motion to reopen context is a mixed question over which we have jurisdiction.additionally,we have held that even when facts are in dispute we have jurisdiction to review a mixed question so long as under any view of the factual record the petitioner has satisfied the relevant legal standard.khunaverdiants mukasey,cir.therefore,b d does not completely deprive this court of jurisdiction to review the ij holding that khan is ineligible for asylum on account of his engaging in terrorist activities.
we have jurisdiction to determine the scope and meaning of the statutory terrorism bar,including the definition of terrorist organization and terrorist activity,as these present purely legal questions.we also have jurisdiction to determine whether the jklf meets this standard.this is a mixed question,because the nature of jklf activities is undisputed by the parties,and the question is whether these undisputed facts as found by the ij meet the legal standard of terrorist organization.finally,because the ij found khan testimony credible,whether khan reasonably should have known of the jklf terrorist activity presents a mixed question of law and fact over which we have jurisdiction.see,kingman reef atoll,united states,cir stating that what a reasonable person should have known presents mixed question colleen united states,cir same.
merits of the asylum and withholding claims 
both the asylum and withholding of removal claim turn on whether the jklf is a terrorist organization,and on whether khan knew or should have known that it was a terrorist organization.we discuss these questions in turn.
jklf status as a terrorist organization 
as we noted above,the jklf is a terrorist organization under the ina if it committed,planned,solicited funds for,solicited individuals for,or provided material support for a terrorist activity.khan seeks to limit the definition of terrorist activity in a manner that might exclude the jklf from the definition of a terrorist organization.
khan argues that the definition of terrorist activity under a b iii incorporates international law,and thus excludes legitimate armed resistance against military targets from the definition of terrorist activity.under khan proposed definition,actions that are illegal under the laws of the regime in power in the alien country of origin are unlawful within the meaning of a b iii only if these actions violate the international law of armed conflict.we hold that this is not a permissible reading of the statute.
statutory text 
we begin with the text of the statute.as noted above,a b iii defines terrorist activity to include various violent acts that are unlawful under the laws of the place where they are committed or which,if they had been committed in the united states,would be unlawful under the laws of the united states or any state.the words under the laws of the place where it is committed directly modify the word unlawful,such that unlawful does not just mean generically unlawful,but rather unlawful in this specific sense.this text is unambiguous,specifying that unlawful actions include actions that are unlawful in the place where they were committed.
khan argues that the bia reading of the statute is so broad that it includes within the definition of terrorist activity many actions that we generally do not consider to be terrorist in nature.for example,khan argues that under the bia reading,it would include armed resistance by jews against the government of nazi germany.this may be true,but the text does not make an exception for actions that are lawful under international law.an action would be lawful within the meaning of a b iii if the law of the country in question incorporates international law such that the conduct in question is no longer unlawful under the country domestic law,but khan has made no argument that that is the case here.
we note that the statute includes a discretionary waiver of the terrorism bar for relief from removal that can be exercised by the secretary of state or the secretary of homeland security.section d b i provides 
the secretary of state,after consultation with the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security,or the secretary of homeland security,after consultation with the secretary of state and the attorney general,may determine in such secretary sole unreviewable discretion that subsection a b of this section shall not apply with respect to an alien within the scope of that subsection or that subsection a b vi iii of this section shall not apply to a group within the scope of that subsection,except that no such waiver may be extended to an alien who is within the scope of subsection a b i ii of this section,no such waiver may be extended to an alien who is a member or representative of,has voluntarily and knowingly engaged in or endorsed or espoused or persuaded others to endorse or espouse or support terrorist activity on behalf of,or has voluntarily and knowingly received training from a terrorist organization that is described in subclause i or ii of subsection a b vi of this section,and no such waiver may be extended to a group that has engaged terrorist activity against the united states or another democratic country or that has purposefully engaged in a pattern or practice of terrorist activity that is directed at civilians.
this waiver weakens khan argument that the bia reading of the statutory language is overly broad,because the broad statutory definition is combined with a discretionary waiver by executive branch officials.these officials are in a position to judge the characteristics of particular groups engaging in armed resistance in their home countries,as well as the implications for our foreign relations in determining whether the actions of these groups are terrorist activities.
refugee protocol and convention 
khan also argues that the international law obligations of the united states under the united nations protocol relating to the status of refugees the protocol compel a narrower definition of terrorist activity.the protocol binds parties to comply with the substantive provisions of articles through of the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees refugee convention with respect to refugees defined in article of the protocol.ins stevic,d.article of the protocol defines refugee as an individual who 
owing to a fear of being persecuted for reasons of race,religion,nationality,membership of a particular social group or political opinion,is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or,owing to such fear,is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country or who,not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence,is unable or,owing to such fear,is unwilling to return to it.
un protocol,article relying on refugee convention,article.the refugee convention excepts from coverage 
any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that 
a he has committed a crime against peace,a war crime,or a crime against humanity,as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes 
b he has committed a serious crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee 
c he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the united nations.
refugee convention,article,adopted in the protocol,article.the refugee convention includes the duty of in article,providing that 
no contracting state shall expel or return refouler a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race,religion,nationality,membership of a particular social group or political opinion.
refugee convention,article.article of the refugee convention provides an exception from this duty 
the benefit of the present provision may not,however,be claimed by a refugee whom there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he is,or who,having been convicted by a final judgement of a particularly serious crime,constitutes a danger to the community of that country.
refugee convention,article.
khan argues that article and article provide the only permissible grounds on which a country can refoul a refugee.therefore,he contends that the ina terrorism bar to relief from removal can only apply to individuals who have been implicated in a crime against peace,a war crime,or a crime against humanity have committed a serious crime have been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes or principles of the united nations may constitute a danger to the security of this country or having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime,constitute a danger to the community.he argues that the ij interpretation of terrorist activity covers actions that do not satisfy any of these five criteria,and that such a broad bar to relief from removal therefore violates the united states international obligations under the protocol.
the united states acceded to the protocol in,though it did not sign the convention itself.stevic,at.however,the protocol is not.barapind reno,cir citing stevic,at.a treaty has automatic domestic effect as federal law upon ratification.conversely,a treaty does not by itself give rise to domestically enforceable federal law.medellin texas,d.therefore,the protocol d
