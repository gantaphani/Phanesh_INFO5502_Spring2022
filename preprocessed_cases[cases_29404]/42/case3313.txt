procedural history 
in april,vitug appeared pro se in immigration court.vitug admitted the charges against him and applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief based on his sexual orientation and status.
at vitug june merits hearing,the ij found vitug to be credible.the ij made factual findings based on vitug testimony and documentary evidence that vitug had provided.the documentary evidence included articles about an organized raid by the philippine national police on a theater frequented by gay men.during this raid,police beat patrons,stole their money,and arrested them for public scandal or immoral or indecent activity.the ij findings included 
vitug was beaten and robbed five times in manila after being targeted as a homosexual.two of these beatings were severe.
while waiting for the bus in manila,vitug was harassed by police officers on account of his perceived sexual orientation.the officers threatened to arrest him for loitering if he did not give them money.
vitug was unable to find a job in the philippines on account of his sexual orientation.
the police will not do anything to help gay men who report abuse but will rather ridicule them and tell them they deserve it.
the government has failed or refused to protect gay men from persecution.
at the hearing,the government agreed that vitug was credible.the government did not present any evidence to contradict vitug testimony or documentary evidence.however,it did note that vitug documentary evidence included accounts of gay and lesbian activism in the philippines and a recently passed quezon city ordinance prohibiting sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace.
the ij held that vitug was persecuted on account of his membership in the social group of homosexual filipino men the ij noted that the government did not prove that country conditions had improved or that vitug could internally relocate within the philippines to avoid future persecution.the ij concluded that vitug would more likely than not suffer further persecution if he was removed to the philippines,and therefore granted vitug withholding of removal.the ij also concluded that it was more likely than not that vitug would be tortured in the philippines,and therefore granted cat relief.finally,the ij denied vitug request for asylum because of a procedural bar.
the government appealed.on november,the bia sustained dhs appeal,affirming the ij denial of asylum but vacating the ij grant of withholding of removal and cat relief.in reaching its decision,the bia did not expressly find any of the ij factual findings to be clearly erroneous.instead,the bia found that vitug failed to meet his burden of proof for four major reasons vitug failed to prove that the attacks against him r o se to the level of past persecution the rape was a crime of opportunity and was not based on account of a protected ground the record does not support the conclusion that the government would be unable or unwilling to protect vitug,because vitug returned to the philippines with only limited additional problems,the attacks against him were illegal,and he did not report the attacks and there was no evidence in the record that vitug would face torture were he to be returned to the philippines.
vitug moved for reconsideration,which the bia denied because vitug motion was one day late.the motion was late due to a snowstorm and the grounding of fedex planes.
on february,the bia issued an amended order to correct a misstatement in the original november,order.vitug timely moved for reconsideration of the amended order,arguing that the bia failed to give due deference to the ij factfinding.
on april,the bia denied vitug motion for reconsideration of the amended order.in its denial,the bia defended its original decision,arguing that it had properly applied the clear error standard of review w e did not determine that the immigration judge findings of facts were clearly erroneous,including the finding that he was credible.therefore,we accepted the respondent testimony,and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from it,as true.yet,later in the order,the bia contradicted itself by stating that one of the ij findings that the philippine government failed or refuse d to protect homosexuals from abuse was clearly erroneous.the bia concluded that vitug failed to establish that the government was unwilling or unable to protect him in light of the documentary evidence that showed no official discrimination,vitug testimony that he was never harmed by the police,and vitug failure t
