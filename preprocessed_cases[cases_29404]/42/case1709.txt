francisco challenges,as impermissibly retroactive,the immigration and naturalization service ins reinstatement of his prior deportation pursuant to a of the immigration and nationality act ina,a supp.v.we hold that a does not have a retroactive effect on and thus affirm reinstatement of the prior order deporting him.
a native and citizen of guatemala,entered the united states illegally in.an immigration judge ordered him deported on september,he was finally removed from the united states on october.upon his brief return to guatemala,in november,divorced his guatemalan wife of years.shortly thereafter,he illegally reentered the united states and,on february,married lorraine boyce,a united states citizen.
on september,congress enacted major immigration reform legislation,entitled the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat.title iii,subtitle a of iirira instituted a complete revision of procedures for removal of aliens.stat.congress included in that subtitle iirira a,creating new a of the ina,which provides 
if the attorney general finds that an alien has reentered the united states illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily,under an order of removal,the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed,the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under this chapter,and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.
ina a,a.the statute defines order of removal as follows 
for purposes of carrying out the immigration and nationality act,as amended by this subtitle 
any reference in law to an order of removal shall be deemed to include a reference to an order of exclusion and deportation or an order of deportation.
iirira d.congress also stated that subtitle a,which revised the procedures for removing aliens,shall take effect on april.iirira a.
in november,more than seven months after a took effect,wife,lorraine boyce,filed a form petition for alien relative on his behalf and he simultaneously filed a form application to adjust to register permanent residence or adjust status based on his marriage to a united states citizen.on march,the ins denied application for adjustment of status because he entered the united states without inspection,citing ina a a,a a,and reentered the united states illegally after previous removal,citing ina a a,a a,and implementing a.
on may,filed an application for permission to reapply for admission into the united states after deportation or removal.on the same day,however,the ins reinstated prior order of deportation in accordance with section a of the immigration and nationality act act and.the immigration judge denied subsequent application for asylum,finding did not have a reasonable fear of persecution or torture he does not seek review of this ruling.
rather,petitions this court to review and reverse the ins may,order reinstating the order deporting him for the reasons that follow,we deny his petition.
at the outset,we dispose of two preliminary matters.
first,we note that,as the ins concedes,we clearly have subject matter jurisdiction in this case.congress has expressly provided that aliens seeking to challenge an order of removal may file a petition for review with the court of appeals for the judicial circuit in which the immigration judge completed the proceedings.see ina b,b supp.v.
second,contrary to suggestion,his status as a deported rather than a removed alien does not render a of the ina a of the iirira inapplicable to him.although acknowledges that iirira d expands the definition of removal in a to include deportation,he suggests that d applies only to those removal proceedings ongoing at the time of iirira enactment.
that theory finds no support in the plain language of a,which states that subtitle a and the amendments made by this subtitle shall take effect on the first day of the first month beginning more than days after the date of the enactment of this act april.section c establishes transitional rules for ongoing proceedings,but there is no indication that d is also a transitional rule that applies solely to ongoing,not,proceedings.in fact,such a reading would eviscerate iirira streamlined removal procedures by resurrecting the distinctions between removal,deportation,and exclusion that d sought to abolish.see united states,cir holding that iirira eliminate d the previous legal distinction between deportation,removal and exclusion see also ins cyr,d noting that iirira substituted the term removal for deportation.contention also contradicts the relevant regulation,which applies a to an order of exclusion,deportation,or removal.a.accordingly,we reject it.
we now turn to principal argument.
contends that congress did not intend ina a to apply retroactively to deportation orders,and that,even if the statute temporal reach is ambiguous,to apply it to him would have an impermissible retroactive effect.to resolve this question,we must first ascertain whether congress expressly prescribed the statute reach.landgraf usi film,d.if there is no congressional directive on the temporal reach of a statute,we determine whether the application of the statute to the conduct at issue would result in a retroactive effect.if so,then in keeping with our traditional presumption against retroactivity,we presume that the statute does not apply to that conduct.tasios reno,cir quoting martin hadix,d.
we held this case in abeyance,awaiting the supreme court decision in ins cyr,which provides substantial guidance as to several of the retroactivity questions presented here.in cyr,the court rejected the ins contention that congress clearly intended to apply retroactively iirira repeal of former ina c,see iirira b,which provided for a discretionary waiver of deportation even for those aliens that had committed certain aggravated felonies.see cyr,at.at.the court further held that this repeal had a retroactive effect on aliens that pled guilty to one of those specified crimes in reliance on the availability and reasonable likelihood of obtaining a discretionary deportation waiver.see id.at.with these holdings in mind,we turn to the case at hand.
although a does not explicitly state whether it applies retroactively or prospectively,the ins and each contend that congress unambiguously defined the statute temporal application.
the ins asserts that congress clearly indicated,in iirira,that a is to apply to all aliens,including those,like,who illegally reentered the united states prior to the effective date of that statute.the ins maintains that the comprehensive nature of iirira revision,the statute general effective date,the presence of transitional rules,and the prospective nature of immigration deportation proceedings require this conclusion.
the supreme court recent analysis in cyr forecloses all of these arguments.see cyr,at.at the cyr court concluded that despite these very features,b of iirira was ambiguous and the longstanding principle of construing any lingering ambiguities in deportation statutes in favor of the alien forecloses the conclusion that,in enacting b,congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the counteracting benefits.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
contrary argument is equally untenable.
acknowledges that congress failed to insert any express statement as to whether a applies to those aliens that reentered the country prior to the statute effective date.he notes,however,that congress did expressly state that several other provisions of title iii of iirira apply retroactively.see,iirira c the amendments made by this section amending the definition of aggravated felony shall apply to actions taken on or after the date of the enactment of this act,regardless of when conviction occurred.emphasis added iirira c the amendments defining conviction and sentences shall apply to convictions and sentences entered before,on,or after the date of the enactment of this act.emphasis added iirira c the amendment regarding penalties for reen
