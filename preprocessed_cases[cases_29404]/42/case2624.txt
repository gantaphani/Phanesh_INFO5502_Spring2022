backgrounda.facts 
olowo was living with her family in chicago when a family friend,babatunde ali who also was living in chicago at the time,asked her to travel to the bahamas and to return with his daughter,grace ali.joyce mother and ali brought grace to the bahamas from nigeria and now wanted ali to send money and airline tickets for grace,herself and margaret ogunosun another nigerian so that they could travel to the united states.at direction,ali purchased the tickets in the names of batricia ann thompson,elease jennings and lillie harden.ali did not trust to deliver grace to him as they had agreed the two were not on the best of terms.he therefore asked olowo to deliver the tickets and to return with grace.ali bought olowo a plane ticket to nassau and gave her the three return tickets.
after she arrived in nassau,olowo found grace and gave her mother the tickets.the next day olowo and grace along with and ogunosun returned to the airport and entered inspection before boarding a flight to chicago.during inspection,olowo presented plane tickets,a green card for herself and a birth certificate for grace bearing the name batricia ann thompson.when asked by an ins inspector about her relationship to grace,olowo said that she was the child mother.after initially passing through inspection,olowo and grace were called back because ins inspectors had detained and ogunosun for having fraudulent documents,and the inspectors suspected that all four were traveling together.ins inspector george haas again questioned olowo about her relationship to grace this time olowo said that she was grace godmother and explained that she had earlier identified herself as grace mother because the two terms were in nigerian culture.inspector haas examined grace birth certificate and doubted its authenticity.nevertheless,because he was not certain that grace was not a united states citizen,he let both grace and olowo board the plane and deferred inspection until after their arrival in chicago.
a few months after her return to chicago,the ins called in olowo for questioning,and she gave a sworn statement about her arrangement with ali and the inspection that took place at the airport in nassau.in her statement,she admitted presenting the birth certificate to ins inspectors before attempting to board the plane with grace and said that the birth certificate was purchased by ali.by this time,the ins had determined that the birth certificate was fraudulent,and they issued olowo a notice to appear on charges that she was removable because she knowingly had aided grace,and ogunosun in their attempts to enter the united states,a violation of ina a e i.
administrative proceedings 
removal hearing 
at her removal hearing,olowo denied knowing anything about grace fraudulent birth certificate.she stated that she was not associated with or ogunosun and that she knew nothing about their attempt to enter the united states.she denied telling the ins in her sworn statement that she had presented a fake birth certificate before boarding the plane in nassau or that the birth certificate had been purchased by ali instead she said she actually had answered,i do know,to both questions.she also testified that she went to the bahamas at ali request because he was awaiting an adjustment of status and could not leave the country,that ali gave her a sealed envelope containing grace documents,that she presented the envelope at the airport without examining its contents and that she saw the birth certificate only after ins inspector haas questioned its authenticity.olowo further stated that she knew very little about grace before going to the bahamas to pick her up because husband close talked about her.
testifying by telephone,inspector haas stated that he had observed olowo enter the nassau airport inspection hall with grace and the other two women and that he had seen olowo give instructions to them before they separated and went into different inspection lines.inspector haas was not olowo primary inspector,but he did inspect,who presented conspicuously fraudulent documents bearing the name elease jennings.at another inspection station,a different ins inspector discovered that ogunosun was carrying false documents with the name lillie harden.because he had seen the group enter the hall together,inspector haas had olowo and grace called back to the inspection area for a secondary inspection.
at this secondary inspection,inspector haas questioned olowo about her relationship to and ogunosun.olowo first told him that they had been vacationing together in the bahamas.meanwhile,at a different ins inspection station,ogunosun broke down under questioning and admitted that she was a nigerian traveling with false documents and that olowo was carrying both her nigerian passport and in a bag.a bahamian constable then retrieved the passports from olowo luggage,and olowo changed her story and claimed that she did not really know the women that well and was traveling with them only because they had met in the bahamas by chance.she claimed that the passports were in her bag because the other women did not have any luggage,and they had asked her to carry the documents for them.
both and ogunosun were detained pending deportation to nigeria,but inspector haas said that he had allowed olowo and grace to board the plane out of compassion for the child because he was unsure about her citizenship.at.however,grace nigerian passport was found in the inspection hall lavatory about a month later,confirming inspector haas suspicion that the child was not olowo and also was not a united states citizen.
the ij found olowo removable and designated nigeria as the country for removal.the ij found that the ins had presented sufficient circumstantial evidence to show by clear and convincing evidence that olowo had knowingly aided grace to enter the united states and had also aided and ogunosun in their attempts to enter.in reaching his decision,the ij determined that olowo testimony was not credible because it was inconsistent,vague,and implausible,and that she had testified falsely in an attempt to mislead the court.at.specifically,the ij found that olowo had lied about her lack of familiarity with grace,her association with and ogunosun and her knowledge of grace fraudulent birth certificate and that she had falsely represented herself as grace mother to ins inspectors.the ij concluded that olowo was not a mere patsy,id.at,but instead an integral part of a scheme to get the three nigerian nationals into the united states with fraudulent documents 
even though olowo denied that she was involved it is clear from the record that she was involved in a scheme,whereby she knew that the child,the child mother joyce,and margaret were all nigerian citizens who were traveling with false birth certificates.as to the child,it is reasonable to conclude that olowo was fully aware that her friend child was an alien who needed proper documents to enter the.it is also evident that olowo not only carried the child travel documents and false birth certificate,but also provided false information and documents to the ins in order to assist the child to enter the illegally.as to the other two women,olowo knew that these women were aliens,because of their,and the fact that she had in her possession their nigerian passports while they were presenting false birth certificates to the ins.
asylum hearing 
after the ij announced his decision,olowo applied for asylum and withholding of removal on the ground that she and her twin daughters are members of a social group that is subjected to female genital mutilation fgm in nigeria,and that she fears that they will undergo this procedure if they return there with her.olowo testified that she is from the yoruba tribe in nigeria oyo state and that she lived in lagos before she won an immigration visa lottery and came to the united states on october.she stated that the yoruba tribe still practices fgm,and that she had been subjected to the procedure herself when she was twelve years old.olowo further stated that,if she returns with her daughters to nigeria,her husband family will force her daughters to undergo fgm and that she and her husband will be unable to protect the children because fgm is a tribal tradition and a cultural requirement.at.olowo also claimed that she could not relocate to another part of nigeria to protect her daughters because her husband family would eventually find them and subject her daughters to fgm.olowo said that,even though her daughters and her husband are legal permanent residents and could remain in the united states,the whole family will have to return to nigeria if she is removed because her husband would not be able to care for the children on his own.
the ij denied olowo application for asylum because she has already been subjected to fgm,and therefore no longer has a fear of persecution based on any social group comprised of women who feared fgm.the ij further determined that olowo could not bootstrap a claim for asylum based upon fear of harm to her children because they and their father are legal permanent residents in the united states and would not be required to return to nigeria with their mother.id.at.as an alternate ground for his decision,the ij concluded that,even if olowo family did return with her to nigeria,her husband would be able to prevent his daughters from undergoing fgm.the ij based this conclusion on a state department report that discusses the father traditional role in the practice of fgm in nigeria under nigerian tradition,the father has control over the children.if the father opposes fgm,therefore,the children would almost certainly be safe.bureau of democracy,human rights and labor,dep t of state,of asylum claims and country conditions at.the ij noted that,despite this information,olowo and her husband had decided that they would go along with such circumcision and they would not live in any other part of nigeria.at.the ij then determined that,although olowo testimony at the hearing was credible,she did not advance a credible claim for asylum.id.at.the ij also found that her petition for withholding of removal necessarily failed because such a claim requires an even higher standard of proof.the ij then ordered her removed to nigeria.
olowo appealed the ij decision that she was removable and not entitled to asylum or withholding of removal.the bia summarily affirmed the ij decision without a written opinion.
discussiona.the bia streamlining procedure 
olowo first argues that the bia abdicated its responsibility to review the ij decision when it employed its streamlined review procedure and affirmed the ij decision without an opinion.we have held,however,that it makes no practical difference whether the bia properly or improperly streamlined review when,as here,we can review directly the decision of the ij.georgis ashcroft,cir see also ciorba ashcroft,cir.we,therefore,need not consider the ins alternative argument that the bia decision to streamline is not reviewable because the streamlining procedure is an action committed to the bia discretion.see georgis.at.
removability 
olowo next submits that the ij erred in concluding that the ins met its burden to prove,by clear and convincing evidence,that she is removable for knowingly aiding grace and the two nigerian women to enter the united states.she contends that the ij impermissibly tipped the scales in the ins favor when he discredited her testimony,even though it was consistent and reliable,pet r br.at,and instead gave dispositive weight to unreliable ins evidence that included inaccurate reports by an ins officer and confusing hearsay testimony by inspector haas.
because olowo is an alien with lawful permanent resident status,the ins can remove her only if it establishes,by clear and convincing evidence,that she is removable.see sandoval ins,cir c a a.an ij decision that the ins has met its burden will be upheld as long as it is based on reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence.c a.when the ij bases evidentiary findings on credibility determinations,those determinations are reviewed deferentially and will be upheld if supported by specific,cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.oforji ashcroft,cir quoting ahmad ins,cir.
the ij reasoning is more than sufficient to support his adverse credibility finding.the ij found that olowo testimony was incredible because it was inconsistent,vague,and implausible.at.he noted that olowo changed her story several times,both when questioned by ins inspectors at the airport and also at the hearing when she disputed the answers that she had given in her sworn statement.the ij noted as well that her testimony was inconsistent with documentary evidence and other testimony presented by the ins.for instance,olowo testified that she did not know that she was carrying a fraudulent birth certificate for grace and that she did not know or ogunosun.yet,the ins found grace discarded passport in the airport inspection hall lavatory and and ogunosun passports in olowo baggage.numerous inconsistencies and contradictions in an alien testimony provide a substantial basis for an ij to discredit it.see oforji,khano ins,cir loulou ashcroft,cir.
olowo also submits that the ij improperly credited factually inaccurate reports by ins officer deborah eades that were not based entirely on personal knowledge,as well as confusing hearsay testimony by inspector haas concerning the sequence of the ins investigation of olowo at the airport.olowo contends that this evidence was unreliable.
conventional rules of evidence do not apply in immigration proceedings,which are governed only by the looser standard of due process of law.niam ashcroft,cir.as long as evidence is probative and its use is not fundamentally unfair,it is admissible.see ins,cir.
to the extent that portions of officer eades reports were not reliable,the ij addressed this problem by not relying on them in his analysis.olowo objected to officer eades reports at the hearing because they contained a minor factual inaccuracy about the dates when olowo testified at the ins chicago office,and also detailed the results of surveillance of olowo residence that officer eades did not conduct herself.the ij noted olowo objections and sufficiently addressed her concerns by limiting the weight accorded the reports.
inspector haas testimony about the sequence of events at the airport was not necessarily confused and inconsistent,pet r br.at,nor was it largely based on hearsay.on two occasions,the inspector referred to his inspection of olowo as primary rather than secondary,but his account of the relevant facts was otherwise completely consistent.the only facts about olowo airport inspection that inspector haas related were the answers that olowo had given when she first entered the inspection area and was questioned by an ins inspector.although hearsay,this testimony passes the due process test for admissibility it was probative,in that it tended to show that olowo tried to deceive ins inspectors both initially and when later questioned,and its use was not fundamentally unfair because olowo had the opportunity to inspector haas and offer rebuttal testimony.in a due process analysis,problems of fundamental fairness associated with hearsay testimony are dispelle
