the government appeals from the dismissal of an indictment charging juan carlos vidal mendoza with illegal reentry after removal.a.we conclude that vidal mendoza underlying removal proceeding was consistent with due process because he was correctly informed that he was ineligible for discretionary relief from removal under the applicable law at the time of his removal hearing.therefore,we reverse the dismissal of the indictment against vidal mendoza and remand for further proceedings.
vidal mendoza is a citizen of mexico who came to the united states in.in december,he pleaded guilty to third degree rape under oregon and received days in jail,a fine,and three years probation.the charge was for sexual contact between vidal mendoza,who was years old at the time,and his,who was under the age of.in,he pleaded guilty for failing to register as a sex offender and was sentenced to two years probation.he voluntarily left the country some time later.
in february,border patrol officers caught vidal mendoza as he reentered the united states.a few days later,he appeared before an immigration judge ij and conceded that he was removable for being present in the united states without having been admitted or paroled.the ij told vidal mendoza that,because the oregon conviction constituted an aggravated felony,he was not entitled to any relief from removal,including voluntary departure the ij entered a removal order and vidal mendoza waived his right to appeal.
vidal mendoza subsequently returned to the united states.in may,following a second conviction for failing to register as a sex offender,immigration officials reinstated vidal mendoza order of removal and again ordered him removed from the country.he returned once more in and this time he was indicted under.a for illegally reentering the country after having been previously removed in 
in february,vidal mendoza moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that his order of removal was invalid because the ij incorrectly determined that his oregon statutory rape conviction was an aggravated felony and,as a result,erroneously informed him that he was not eligible for voluntary departure.vidal mendoza argued that his prior rape conviction was not an aggravated felony under estrada espinoza mukasey,cir en banc,overruled on other grounds by united states aguilamontes de oca,cir en banc,a case decided four years after the challenged removal proceedings.he also asserted that he was prejudiced by the ij error.the district court agreed and dismissed the indictment.
the government timely appealed.it argues that under our recent en banc opinion in united states lopez velasquez,cir en banc,the sufficiency of an ij advice during removal proceedings must,with narrow exceptions not applicable here,be measured against the law at the time of the proceeding.the government asserts that the district court erred when it ignored this limitation and dismissed the indictment.
we have jurisdiction under and review the district court dismissal of the indictment de novo.united states cisneros resendiz,cir.
we begin by reviewing the legal framework for a collateral challenge to a removal order used as a predicate to proceedings.
an alien who has been denied admission,excluded,deported or removed commits a crime if the alien enters,attempts to enter,or is at any time found in the united states.a.one of the elements of a conviction under is a prior removal order.a.congress has strictly limited an alien ability to bring a collateral challenge to such an order.see d.specifically,an alien facing criminal charges under a may not attack the validity of a predicate removal order unless the alien demonstrates that the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.d.
we have interpreted these narrow criteria broadly.our flexible construction of d is predicated on our holding that an alien in removal proceedings has a due process right to be informed of his or her ability to apply for relief from removal.united states ubaldo figueroa,cir.we derived this obligation from a regulation relating to an alien application for lawful permanent resident status,which requires an ij to inform an alien of of his or her apparent eligibility to apply for specified discretionary relief and to afford the alien an opportunity to make application during the hearing for such relief.a see lopez velasquez,at because we have held this duty to inform the alien of apparent eligibility to apply for certain benefits is mandatory,we have concluded that the ij failure to discharge it is a denial of due process that invalidates the underlying deportation proceeding.united states muroinclan,cir.
our conclusion that the ij may violate an alien due process rights by failing to inform the alien of apparent eligibility to apply for specified relief often serves as the linchpin of our analysis of d requirements.first,if the ij has failed to provide information about apparent eligibility for relief,we excuse the alien from demonstrating that the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the removal order,d,because we deem the alien waiver of the right to an administrative appeal to have been insufficiently considered and intelligent due to the ij error.ubaldo figueroa,at internal quotation marks omitted.second,we have held that the same error also deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review,d,because an alien who is not made aware of his or her apparent eligibility for relief,a,has had no meaningful opportunity to appeal the removal and seek such relief.united states arrieta,cir see also united states pallares galan,cir.finally,we have concluded that an underlying removal order is fundamentally unfair for purposes of d if an alien due process rights were violated by defects in his underlying deportation proceeding,and he suffered prejudice as a result of the defects.ubaldo figueroa,at internal quotation marks omitted.we have held that the ij failure to inform the alien of potential relief in violation of a meets the first prong of this test,and an alien may meet the second prong by demonstrating that he had a plausible ground for that potential relief.id.at quoting arrieta,at.
in sum,the ij duty under a to inform the alien of his or her apparent eligibility to apply for certain discretionary relief may be the centerpiece of a collateral challenge under d.a violation of this duty excuses the alien from d exhaustion requirement satisfies d deprivation of judicial review requirement and also serves as a due process violation that goes halfway to demonstrating that the removal proceeding was fundamentally unfair,as demanded by d.
the ij duty under a is of critical importance in analyzing whether vidal mendoza may collaterally attack his removal order under d.we recently examined the scope of this duty as an en banc court in lopez velasquez,and are guided by its analysis here.
lopez velasquez involved an alien collateral challenge to his removal order on the ground that the ij failed to inform him of his apparent eligibility for discretionary relief under former c of the immigration and nationality act.lopez velasquez,at internal quotation marks omitted.at the time of his removal proceeding,lopez velasquez was unquestionably ineligible for c relief because longstanding ninth circuit and bia precedent provided that he had not accrued seven years of domicile in the from the date he became a lawful permanent resident,as required by c.id.at.a case decided a year after lopez velasquez removal proceedings,however,made a deviation from our precedent and suggested that an alien could begin accruing time to meet this domicile requirement starting at an earlier date.id.at,noting that,as of the removal hearing,there had been no suggestion from the bia or this court for such a change in law.relying on this precedent,lopez velasquez argued that the ij violated the regulatory duty to inform him of his apparent eligibility for c relief at the time of the removal hearing and,therefore,that removal could not be used to support an indictment for illegal reentry.id.at.
we rejected this argument,holding that an ij duty is limited to informing an alien of a reasonable possibility that the alien is eligible for relief at the time of the hearing.id.at emphasis added.because lopez velasquez was not eligible for relief under the applicable law at the time of his deportation hearing,and would become eligible only with a change in law,we determined that he was correctly informed at his removal hearing.id.at,
thus lopez velasquez reiterates two correlative principles regarding the ij duty under a.first,an ij must provide accurate information regarding an alien eligibility for relief under the applicable law at the time of his deportation hearing,id.at.we have applied this principle to uphold a defendant collateral challenge to a prior removal order where the ij erred in applying existing law and the error was prejudicial.see,pallares galan,at.in pallares galan,the defendant collaterally challenged a prior deportation order because the ij had informed him that his prior conviction under california penal code section a constituted sexual abuse of a minor and that,as a result,he was ineligible for relief.see id.at.applying the categorical and modified categorical approach set forth in taylor united states,d,we held that under the ordinary meaning of its statutory terms,as well as under the california supreme court understanding of its provisions,a is significantly broader than the federal definition of sexual abuse of a minor,pallares galan,at,and that the judicially cognizable documents in the record were insufficient to establish,under the modified categorical approach,that the defendant had committed such an offense,id.at.accordingly,the defendant prior offense did not constitute sexual abuse of a minor under either the categorical or modified categorical approach.id.because the ij misapplication of existing precedent resulted in his failure to inform the defendant of his apparent eligibility for relief,we held that the deportation proceeding deprived the defendant of a meaningful opportunity for judicial review.id.
second,by the same token,an ij need not anticipate future change s in law when determining an alien apparent eligibility for relief from removal.lopez velasquez,at.this rule likewise comports with our principle that ijs are not expected to be clairvoyant when discharging their duty to inform.id.at quoting moran enriquez ins,cir see also united states moriel luna,cir o ur precedent does not require that an ij act creatively to advise an immigrant of ways in which his legal prospects at forestalling deportation might improve with fundamental changes in his status.
finally,lopez velasquez also indicated a narrow exception to the general principle that the ij need not anticipate changes in the law.lopez velasquez,at.we provided only one example of such narrow circumstances where we have applied subsequent precedent in reviewing a deportation order under d our decision in united states leon paz,cir.
leon paz also involved an alien collateral challenge to his removal order on the ground that the ij failed to inform him of his apparent eligibility for discretionary relief under c.at.at the time of his removal hearing,congress had changed the law to limit the availability of c relief for aliens convicted of aggravated felonies,but we had not yet weighed in on whether these statutory changes were applicable retroactively to aliens like leon paz.see id.at.shortly after leon paz removal hearing,the supreme court held that these changes applied prospectively only.ins cyr,d see also magana pizano ins,cir.cyr made clear that the statutory changes regarding c did not apply to leon paz,and that he had been apparently eligible for such relief at the time of his removal hearing.see leon paz,at.accordingly,we determined that in these narrow circumstances,subsequent precedent required us to conclude that the ij committed an error of law by failing to inform leon paz of his apparent eligibility for relief lopez velasquez,at see also ubaldo figueroa,at applying cyr to hold that an ij failed to inform an alien of his apparent eligibility for c relief.
this narrow exception where subsequent precedent renders a deportation order invalid was not present in lopez velasquez.at.as described earlier,the precedent in lopez velasquez did not make clear that the alien was apparently eligible for relief at the time of his removal proceeding it was not analogous to the precedent in leon paz,for example,which held that a statutory change applied prospectively only.rather,the precedent in lopez velasquez created a new,previously unavailable,possibility of relief by making a deviation from longstanding ninth circuit and bia precedent.see id.at.because this precedent created such a change in the law,we saw no basis for lopez velasquez claim that he had apparent eligibility for relief at the time of the hearing and we denied his collateral challenge to his removal order.see id.at.
notwithstanding lopez velasquez,vidal mendoza argues that,even if case law at the time of the removal hearing foreclosed an alien eligibility for relief,judicial decisions explain what the statute has always meant and,thus,the ij should be deemed to have violated the duty to inform at any point the alien becomes eligible for relief under a interpretation of the law.he supports this argument with citations to cases involving direct review of removal orders.see,pelayo garcia holder,cir.
we disagree.first,such an interpretation would require the ij to inform an alien about relief for which the alien is apparently in eligible during the hearing.it would also require an ij to give an alien the opportunity to make application for relief that was not available during the hearing.see a.this interpretation is plainly illogical and inconsistent with the unambiguous language of a.see also united states garza sanchez,cir holding that a precursor of a did not require the ij to inform the alien of potential constitutional challenges to the immigration laws because such challenges were not mentioned in the regulatory text.because the ij does not violate a by failing to inform the alien of a future interpretation of the law,it is not relevant that such an interpretation may be deemed to establish what the meaning of the law always was in some theoretical way.
moreover,vidal mendoza interpretation would effectively transform a d collateral challenge into a direct appeal,because it would require courts to apply intervening changes in the law to the ij removal order in every case.but we do not review a collateral challenge to a removal order in the same manner as we review that order on a petition for review.see lopez velasquez,at.in alvarenga villalobos ashcroft,cir,for example,we rejected an alien collateral challenge to a removal order based on precedent because the order was perfectly lawful under the law at the time the alien was deported and the alien had a right to challenge the application of that law on a petition for review.id.at.thus,i n general,when intervening law renders an alien eligible for discretionary relief for which he was ineligible at the time of his deportation hearing,the proper remedy is for the alien to file a motion to reopen.lopez velasquez,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
because we can not depart from the plain language of a,nor conduct direct review of an alien removal hearing under d,we reject vidal mendoza argument,as well as his reliance on cases involving direct review of removal orders.
we now apply these principles to the facts of this case.vidal mendoza claims that the ij had an obligation to inform him of his apparent eligibility for voluntary departure because under estrada espinoza,decided over four years after his removal hearing,his rape conviction did not constitute sexual abuse of a minor,and,thus,was not an aggravated felony.estrada espinoza,at internal quotation marks omitted.
our analysis is largely controlled by lopez velasquez.we begin
