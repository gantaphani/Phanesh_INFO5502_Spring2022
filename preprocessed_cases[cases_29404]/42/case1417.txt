factual background and procedural history 
singh,a native and citizen of india,arrived in the united states on february,when he was fifteen years old.singh was born in the state of punjab,and he and his parents are religious sikhs he testified that he came to the united states because the indian police were after him and his father and were attempting to kill them because of his father activities in working for khalistan,a putative independent state for sikhs.singh and his father were members of shirdarval sahib,one of two groups under the akali dal,a political party in punjab.the leader of the akali dal told his followers that khalistan would be an independent state where sikhs would get their rights.
beginning when singh was ten years old,the police often came to his home and took his father away for questioning.in october,the police came to singh house while he was sleeping,began beating singh father,and then took singh and his father to a police station.while at the house,the police told singh father that he had arms and ammunition in the house,which singh father denied the police also searched the house.
the police kicked singh and his father while transporting them to the police station.when they arrived at the station,singh was pushed into a corner and watched while his father was stripped naked and beaten by the police.singh began to scream,at which point the police began to beat him also.singh believed that his father was beaten for half an hour or an hour and that he himself was beaten for ten to fifteen the point of losing consciousness.while the police were beating the father,they talked about his work for khalistan,which singh understood as the officers way of telling his father we have told you so many times not to work for khalistan.now,by beating this way,we are going to tell you that,how to ask for khalistan.
later,the police told singh and his father that a leader of their village and others had come to get them out,and the police let them go.before their release,the police inspector reiterated that singh father had been told many times not to work for khalistan sovereignty and had not listened even though the police had beat him.the inspector then threatened that,if singh father kept engaging in these political activities,the police would kill singh.singh and his father could not walk when they were released,and they were taken to a dispensary where they were given medication.
after singh returned from the hospital six or seven days later,his parents sent him to his uncle house,where he stayed for about a month.singh uncle told singh that his father had been taken away again by the police because a dead body was found near their family lands and that the police used this event as an excuse to take his father.he also told singh that the police made singh mother give them the names and addresses of all their relatives so that the officers could look for singh.
a different uncle then took singh in,but the police found him there.when singh uncle saw the police coming,he took singh to hide for a few hours at a neighbor house.singh uncle reported that the police said they would kill singh if they found him.singh uncle and grandfather then made arrangements for singh to come to the united states.singh testified that he is afraid that,if he is sent back,the police will get him at the airport because they will check his card or one way or the other they will find out,and the police will take him and they are going to kill him.
the immigration and naturalization service ins initiated removal proceedings against singh on february,by issuing a notice to appear,alleging that singh was removable under a a i i for arriving in the united states without a valid visa.singh conceded removability but applied for asylum and withholding of removal.on september,the ij granted both applications.the ij found singh to be very credible and further found that singh had suffered persecution on account of his perceived political opinion as being both his father son and a sikh himself.the ij also found that it is more likely than not that singh will be persecuted if returned to india.
the ins appealed,and the bia upheld the ij credibility finding but vacated the grant of asylum and withholding of removal,stating that even if singh had been persecuted,he had not met his burden of proving persecution on account of one of the five enumerated grounds in the ina.singh petition for review of the bia decision is now before us.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
under a,we have jurisdiction to hear a petition for review from a final order of the bia.we must uphold the bia factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence.ashcroft,cir.further,the bia denial of asylum can be reversed only if the evidence presented by petitioner was such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed.ins,d see also abdille ashcroft,cir.
iii.discussion 
the attorney general and his delegates may grant asylum to any alien who qualifies as a refugee under the ina.b.a refugee is an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country of origin because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.aliens have the burden of supporting their asylum claims.gao ashcroft,cir.testimony,by itself,is sufficient to meet this burden,if credible.id.citing a.
to establish eligibility for asylum,an applicant must demonstrate past persecution by substantial evidence or a fear of persecution that is both subjectively and objectively reasonable.lukwago ins,cir.an applicant who establishes that he or she has suffered past persecution on account of one of the five grounds enumerated in the ina triggers a rebuttable presumption of a fear of future persecution,as long as that fear is related to the past persecution.id.at citing b.whereas asylum is discretionary,withholding of removal under ina b a,b a,is mandatory if the applicant meets a more stringent it is more likely than not that he or she will be persecuted on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion if deported to his or her home country.id.at.
singh advances two principal arguments.the first is that the bia erred in determining that he did not establish imputed political opinion.the second is that the bia should have applied mixed motive case law in reaching its decision and upheld the ij grant of asylum because the harm singh suffered at the hands of the indian police was,in large part,on account of one of the grounds enumerated in the political opinion we agree with him on both counts.
imputed political opinion 
we have recognized that an alien may be eligible for asylum if the persecution he suffered,or has a fear of suffering,is on account of a political opinion the applicant actually holds or on account of one the foreign government has imputed to him.lukwago,at quoting balasubramanrim ins,cir see also in re,bia persecution for imputed grounds,where one is erroneously thought to hold particular political opinions can satisfy the refugee definition.in determining whether persecution existed on account of political opinion,we focus on whether the persecutor has attributed a political view to the victim and acted on that attribution.sangha ins,cir.
the bia did not engage in any substantial discussion regarding its conclusion that singh had not established imputed political opinion,but it did acknowledge that singh youth contributed to his lack of knowledge about his father political and other affiliations.there is nothing in the case law that suggests that an asylum applicant claiming imputed po
