on august,petitioner,silverio,was convicted of two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in violation of illinois criminal law stemming from his undisputed act of sexually touching a female child younger than years of age.on june,an immigration judge held that had been convicted of a crime of violence and sexual abuse of a minor and he was,therefore,deportable.on december,the board of immigration appeals bia agreed.now appeals.we find that raises no valid constitutional claims.therefore,we dismiss his appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
the petitioner,silverio,is a male and a native and citizen of mexico.on may,the immigration and natural service ins issued a notice to appear nta charging him with removability pursuant to the immigration and nationality act ina,a a iii,based on his conviction for aggravated criminal sexual abuse.the nta alleged that was not a citizen or national of the united states,that he was a native and citizen of mexico,and that he was admitted to the united states at eagle pass,texas on or about march,as a lawful permanent resident.the nta further alleged that on august,had been convicted of two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in violation of ch,section c i of the illinois revised statutes as amended,and sentenced to three years imprisonment.the nta charged that,therefore,was subject to removal under the ina because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined therein.
an immigration judge conducted a hearing on may.at the start of the hearing,was not accompanied by counsel and stated that his name was silverio.the immigration judge identified the participants in the hearing and their roles,the purpose of the proceeding,and the factual allegations supporting the charge of removability.the immigration judge gave a copy of the certified statement of conviction conviction record,at which point informed the immigration judge that he had retained a private attorney to represent him.thereupon,attorney arrived at the hearing and requested a continuance and a bond hearing.the immigration judge granted the continuance.
on june,the immigration judge denied request for bond and set the removal hearing for june.the immigration judge began the removal hearing by addressing motion to recuse on the grounds that the same judge can not hear both the bond and the removal hearing.the motion was denied as was subsequent motion for a continuance to take an interlocutory appeal from that ruling.the immigration judge next asked to plead to the factual allegations and charge of the nta.counsel responded that would neither admit nor deny any of the allegations or charges and asked that the service be put to its burden of proof.
the ins began its by calling as a witness.after again identifying himself as silverio,he testified that he was born in mexico.thereafter,responded,i do wish to respond,because it against the rights of the constitution of the united states to the following questions from the ins are you a permanent resident of the united states were you convicted on august,of aggravated criminal assault were you sentenced to a term of imprisonment counsel explained to the immigration judge that his client refusal to answer was not based on the fifth amendment right against,but instead on the first amendment guarantee of freedom of speech and the right to remain silent and on the fifth amendment due process right.
the ins then presented with the conviction record and asked him whether it was his name on the record.responded that he did not wish to respond because it against the rights of the united states constitution.counsel then objected to admitting the conviction record into evidence on the grounds that it referred to silverio flores and thus did not relate to the name on the nta silverio.the immigration judge overruled the objection and admitted the conviction record into evidence 
the ins then presented with his immigration visa and asked him to identify it.responded that he did not wish to respond because it against the rights of the united states constitution.the immigration judge admitted the visa into evidence over counsel objection that it was not properly certified and that there was insufficient foundation.the ins then rested.
offered no evidence.during closing arguments,counsel asserted that under the pre definition of aggravated felony,was not an aggravated felon and,therefore,was not deportable.he argued that the amended definition of aggravated felony should not be applied retroactively to a conviction.
the immigration judge found that even though refused to respond to almost all questions,he did admit to his birth in mexico.the immigration judge found that that admission and the immigration visa established mexico as country of birth and nationality.because the evidence showed to be a mexican national,the immigration judge found that the ins had established a prima facie case of removability and that the burden shifted to to contest that finding.
the immigration judge also found that the conviction record reflected last name and that he made no attempt to rebut that it related to him.the conviction record established that had been convicted of two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse of a minor and had received a sentence.based on the conviction record,the immigration judge found that the ins had established that was an aggravated felon as defined by the ina.because had failed to rebut the evidence against him,the immigration judge ordered that lawful permanent residence status be terminated and that he be removed to mexico.timely appealed to the bia,alleging that the admission of the visa and conviction record was improper,that the government had failed to meet its burden,and that the retroactive application of the amended definition of aggravated felony was unconstitutional.on december,the bia rejected the appeal and adopted the immigration judge conclusions.
on february,sought review in this court.the ins opposed request with a motion to dismiss,alleging that this court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the ina bars review of a deportation order for aliens convicted of an aggravated felony,as that term is defined by the ina.on june,we ordered the parties to brief and argue both the jurisdictional issue and the substantive issues in full and we ordered that the motion to dismiss be taken with the case.
ii.analysis 
the ins argues that this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over appeal.the ina provides in relevant part that no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered by the statutory provision making aggravated felons removable.see a c.the ins argues that petition should be dismissed because the immigration judge determined that aggravated criminal sexual abuse conviction is an aggravated felony under the ina,thereby invoking the jurisdictional bar.however,as the government concedes,this court does have jurisdiction to determine whether jurisdiction exists.see xiong ins,cir.further,we have previously held that an alien may challenge his deportability on constitutional grounds directly in the court of appeals provided that he raises a substantial constitutional claim.see ins,cir laguerre reno,cir.therefore,we must first determine whether the immigration judge correctly concluded that was an alien deportable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony.if we answer that question in the affirmative,we must then consider whether has nevertheless raised substantial constitutional claims,so that we may assert jurisdiction over those claims.see,at.
under the ina,a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.see a a iii.in,congress adopted the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat,as part of a sweeping program of immigration reform.iirira amended the ina to substantially expand the definition of aggravated felony to include crimes that had not been included earlier.see iirira a.the ina now defines an aggravated felony to include murder,rape,or sexual abuse of
