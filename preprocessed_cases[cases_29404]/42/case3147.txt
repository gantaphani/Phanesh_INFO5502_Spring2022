at trial on the charge of attempted illegal reentry into the united states,omar argueta rosales presented evidence that he crossed into the united states in a delusional state,believing he was being chased by mexican gangs,and with the specific intent solely to place himself into the protective custody of united states officials.the district court found this evidence plausible,but nonetheless found argueta guilty of the charged offense,ruling the mens rea element of attempted illegal reentry under requires the government to prove only that the defendant knew he was crossing into the united states and that he was not privileged to do so.in united states lombera valdovinos,cir,however,we held it was im possible to convict a previously deported alien for attempted illegal reentry into the united states under when he crosses the border with the intent only to be imprisoned,because attempted illegal reentry is a specific intent crime that requires proof of intent to enter the country free from official restraint.because the district court found argueta guilty under an erroneous legal standard,we vacate his conviction and remand for a new trial or other proceedings consistent with this opinion.
omar argueta rosales was born in mexico in.when he was five,his mother migrated to the united states and he was left to the care of his grandparents in mexico.he lived with his grandparents for four years before reuniting with his mother in los angeles,california.he lived with his mother in los angeles until he was years old.an immigration judge ordered him removed in.
in,argueta was apprehended at the border while attempting to unlawfully return to the united states.in,he pled guilty to attempting to illegally reenter the united states,in violation of,and received a sentence of five years probation.a standard term of his probation provided he shall not commit another federal,state,or local crime.
after returning to mexico,argueta began to abuse methamphetamine.a few days before the border crossing that is the subject of this appeal,he was beaten by gang members in mexico.in the days that followed,according to bruce yanofsky,the psychologist who testified at trial,argueta became increasingly paranoid,he was worried,he started to see people that were following him and was really concerned about his life.
h e was living out on the streets,running around until he got to the point where he felt that his life was in danger and then obviously proceeded to try to cross the border with the account that he gave me that he had the cell phone,that it was a land line well,it was connected to a line in the united states,he was trying to call for help,he was calling repeatedly because he wanted law enforcement to intervene because he had tried the mexican law enforcement to help him and they did do anything for him.so in this state of panic,paranoia,and just losing control of what was going on in his life,fearing for his life,he ended up in the border.
no cell phone was found on argueta person at the time of his arrest,however.
argueta crossed the united states border from mexico,about one and miles west of the san ysidro,california,port of entry,on november.at the border,argueta climbed over the approximately foot primary fence,which placed him in the united states.he was at that point between the primary fence and the secondary fence,which is approximately yards north of the primary fence and about feet high.argueta was spotted by border patrol agent oscar alvarado when argueta was approximately yards north of the primary fence.argueta was walking,at a normal speed,in a north and westbound direction.agent alvarado radioed another officer to intercept argueta.
border patrol agent jeffrey schwinn responded.agent schwinn approached in his vehicle to approximately feet away,exited his vehicle and shouted hey to try to get argueta attention.when argueta did not respond,agent schwinn approached argueta.argueta turned around and looked at schwinn,at which point schwinn asked him in spanish where he was born.argueta said mexico city.schwinn asked argueta what country he was a citizen of,and he said mexico,so schwinn proceeded to ask him if he had any immigration documents allowing him to enter the united states,and he said no.at that point,argueta began to walk towards schwinn,and schwinn told him to head back south and return to mexico.when argueta did not take that suggestion,agent schwinn told him he was going to place him under arrest,and argueta said something to the effect of you do what you got to do.
about two hours after his arrest,two border patrol agents interviewed argueta at the imperial beach border patrol station in san diego.during the beginning of the interview,which was conducted in english,argueta appeared calm and rational.early in the interview,argueta asked to make a statement,saying i t important.it relates to what happened at my house.one of the agents told argueta he would be able to make a statement later.at one point during the interview,one of the agents asked argueta,when did you last enter the united states,and this discussion followed 
a.last was five years ago.five years ago,almost five and a half.
q.how did you enter the united states 
trying to go through the line walking.
through where 
i was walking through calexico,from mexicali to calexico.
q.the port of entry 
q.what is your destination in the united states,city and state 
los angeles,california.
do you have any fear of persecution or torture should you be removed from the united states 
the agents did not follow up on argueta claim of persecution.
toward the end of the interview,when the agents asked argueta whether he wanted to say anything else,argueta made apparently delusional statements for two minutes,referring to people who were in the cell with him even though the only people there were argueta and the two border patrol agents 
just that i come the people who i with right now in the tank are the people who were at my house.
q.in here in the cell 
inaudible.and also,i wanted to ask you guys if it coincidental or unintelligible.and that when one of the unintelligible started asking me what up.i told them i noticed i recognize the skinny guy,the one they put at the end.unintelligible the other one with white shorts unintelligible.he started taking his hand out.before that i told the skinny dude,hey,i know you,bro.it hurts me,because that my wife,you know.
but then again,i do know what going on.like i said,i was going nuts over there.i could remember.i had to ask my wife.i mean,there some pictures i seen.i ca recognize certain people unintelligible.i was going through it and not only unintelligible that the people that are after me.unintelligible.
in february,argueta was charged with attempting to reenter the united states,in violation of a and b he was separately charged with violating the terms of his probation.the district court appointed yanofsky to determine whether argueta was competent to stand trial.after argueta was found competent,the case proceeded to a bench trial.at trial,yanofsky testified that,on the day argueta climbed over the border fence,he was suffering from a psychosis caused by heavy methamphetamine use.according to yanofsky,argueta was operating under a delusion that individuals were chasing him and trying to kill him,prompting him to climb over the border fence.an expert proffered by the government,mark kalish,disagreed with yanofsky conclusion that argueta was suffering from psychosis.
at the close of evidence,the parties presented closing arguments to the district court.the elements of the crime of attempted illegal reentry under are the defendant had the purpose,conscious desire,to reenter the united states without the express consent of the attorney general the defendant committed an overt act that was a substantial step towards reentering without that consent the defendant was not a citizen of the united states the defendant had previously been lawfully denied admission,excluded,deported or removed from the united states and the attorney general had not consented to the defendant attempted reentry.united states gracidas ulibarry,cir en banc.
here,only the first element was in dispute.relying on united states lombera valdovinos,cir,argueta counsel argued the government can not prove specific intent beyond a reasonable doubt because the evidence in this case showed that argueta entered the united states under the psychotic belief that he was being chased by armed gunmen in mexico,but he specifically while that may be the motive,he specifically intended to enter to find protection by turning himself in to the border patrol.according to argueta counsel,argueta was not guilty of the crime of attempted illegal reentry if the evidence showed that his specific intent was to go into custody.counsel maintained that,under lombera valdovinos,if someone specifically intends to enter the united states to go into custody,they affirmatively not guilty under the attempted reentry charge of.
the district court rejected argueta argument.in the court view,the specific intent element of attempted illegal entry would be satisfied so long as argueta knew he was vaulting the fence into the united states and he knew that that was wrong.the court rejected the proposition that argueta could negate the specific intent element merely by showing he intended to enter into custody,disagreeing with argueta argument that the reason of coming over here to turn yourself in is enough to defeat conscious purpose.according to the court,if the defense was right that the desire to turn yourself in,even if it based on a delusion,is enough to defeat conscious purpose,the appellate court will tell us.i do think it is.
having rejected argueta legal argument,the court proceeded to find the specific intent element proven beyond a reasonable doubt because argueta knew he was crossing into the united states and knew he did not have permission to do so,facts argueta did not dispute.accordingly,the court found argueta guilty of the crime of attempted illegal reentry.in addition,solely on the basis of that conviction,the court also found argueta guilty of violating the terms of his probation.the court later sentenced argueta to months in custody on the attempted illegal reentry conviction and an additional months in custody on the probation violation,to be followed by three years of supervised release.argueta timely appealed both judgments,and the two appeals have been consolidated in this court.
conclusions of law following a bench trial are reviewed de novo.see oswalt resolute,cir united states knapp,cir if a jury instruction misstates elements of a statutory crime,the standard of review is de novo.
this case is controlled by lombera valdovinos,where we held it was im possible to convict a previously deported alien for attempted illegal reentry into the united states under when he crosses the border with the intent only to be imprisoned,because attempted illegal reentry is a specific intent crime that requires proof of intent to enter the country free from official restraint.at.
in lombera valdovinos,a border patrol agent was patrolling the border between the united states and mexico,sitting in a marked border patrol vehicle between the primary fence,which marks the actual border,and the secondary fence,located about feet north of the primary fence.see id.with binoculars,the agent saw the defendant and four or five others standing on the mexico side of the border,about yards away from the agent.see id.the agent then looked away for about seconds when he turned back,he saw the defendant,alone and now on the united states side of the primary fence,walking directly toward him.see id.when the defendant continued to walk toward the agent,the agent drove toward him.see id.when they met,the defendant stated,i want to see an immigration judge,admitted to being a citizen of mexico and,when asked if he had any legal basis for being present in the united states,answered no.id.he also said he wished to go back to jail.id.the agent then searched and arrested the defendant.see id.
because the defendant had been deported before,he was charged with attempted illegal reentry,in violation of.see id.after a jury returned a guilty verdict,the defendant moved for judgment of acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure.see id.at.the district court denied the motion,and the defendant appealed.see id.reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,we held that no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.see id.at.
we explained that,for purposes of,enter has a narrower meaning than its colloquial usage.id.at.an alien has not entered the united states under unless he does so free from official restraint.id.quoting gracidas ulibarry,at.attempted illegal reentry,in turn,requires proof of specific intent,more particularly the specific intent to reenter without consent.id.at citation omitted quoting united states leos maldonado,cir.official restraint,we further explained,encompasses restraint by any government official,not just officials of the department of homeland security.id because all of the evidence showed the defendant intent was to be taken into custody,id.at,we held that no rational trier of fact could conclude the defendant was guilty of the specific intent crime of attempted illegal reentry,id.at.
as the government now concedes,the district court misapplied lombera valdovinos here in order to convict argueta,the government was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that argueta crossed into the united states with the specific intent to enter the country free from official restraint.id.at.it was not sufficient that argueta knew he was crossing into the united states and knew he did not have permission to do so.if argueta sole intent was to be taken into custody,then no rational trier of fact could conclude he was guilty of the specific intent crime of attempted illegal reentry.id.at.the district court verdict thus rested on an erroneous legal standard.
when a district court in a bench trial has made a legal error regarding the elements of an offense,the error is reviewed using the same harmless error standard that would apply to an erroneous jury instruction.see wilson united states,cir.an error in describing an element of the offense in a jury instruction is harmless only if it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.united states liu,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also united states driggers,cir.accordingly,the question here is whether it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the district court would have found argueta guilty absent the error.the government argues the district court error was harmless on two independent theories.we address them in turn,finding neither persuasive.
the government argues lombera valdovinos applies only when there is no evidence of anything other than the intent to be taken into custody.in the government view,where,as here,there is substantial evidence of the defendant specific intent to enter the united states free from official restraint,lombera valdovinos is of no import,even if there is also substantial evidence of the intent to enter into custody.we disagree,and take this opportunity to clarify lombera valdovinos.
it is true that in lombera valdovinos we said this case presents a rare set of factual circumstances where there is no evidence of anything other than the intent to be taken into custody.at emphasis added.we made that statement,however,in the course of reviewing the denial of the defendant rule motion for judgment of acquittal.see id.at.under that standard,we were required to affirm the defendant conviction so long as any rational trier of fact could have found he possessed the specific intent to enter free from official restraint.see id.thus,by pointing to the complete absence of contrary evidence,we were simply applying that highly deferential standard of review.we did not hold that any evidence of an unlawful intent would compel a conviction.we now clarify that where,as here,there is contradictory evidence regarding the defendant intent,it is for the trier of fact to determine whether the government has proven unlawful intent beyond a reasonable doubt.the government contention that lombera valdovinos is limited to cases in which there is no evidence of a specific intent to enter the united states free from official restraint is without merit.we reject the government argument the district court error was harmless on this ground.
that being said,we also clarify that the government need not prove that entry free from official restraint was the defendant sole intent.the government must prove only that argueta had a specific intent to enter the united states free from official restraint,not that this was his only purpose.see lombera valdovinos,at noting the defendant cross ed the border with the intent only to be imprisoned emphasis added united states shabban,as shabban concedes,evidence that a defendant had multiple intentions does not mean there was insufficient evidence of the requisite statutory intent.united states julian,cir a defendant need not facilitate someone interstate or foreign travel with the sole or principal intent that he engage in prostitution in order to be liable under section,so long as prostitution was a significant motive.united states fairchild,cir holding that only one of the defendant intentions must meet the elements of the offense wayne lafave,substantive criminal law ed.it may be said that,so long as the defendant has the intention required by the definition of the crime,it is immaterial that he may also have had some other intention.similarly,if argueta actually intended to sneak into the country,and changed his plans only when he was spotted by the border patrol,he again would be guilty.lombera valdovinos,at.
in the alternative,the government contends the error was harmless because there was overwhelming evidence of argueta intent to enter free from official restraint.we again disagree.
there was,to be sure,evidence that argueta crossed the border with the specific intent to enter free from official restraint.he scaled a border fence in an area in which,according to one border patrol agent testimony,there was a chance of evading detection.if he had wanted to turn himself in,he could have presented himself at the port of entry located less than two miles away.when he crossed into the united states,argueta was walking away from agent alvarado rather than toward him.when agent schwinn first shouted to argueta,he did not stop.in his initial encounter with agent schwinn,argueta did not say he was seeking protective custody.when asked his destination during his interview,argueta identified los angeles.
evidence also pointed in the other direction,however.argueta crossed into the united states in broad daylight in a heavily patrolled area.when agent alvarado spotted him on the united states side of the primary fence,he was walking normally,not running.when he was confronted by agent schwinn,argueta did not run.when agent schwinn offered argueta the opportunity to climb the fence back into mexico rather than being arrested,argueta declined the offer evidence fully consistent with argueta contention that he crossed into the united states to enter protective custody.yanofsky testified argueta was under a psychosis,suffering from delusions,and had entered the united states to seek protection,testimony the district court credited.argueta told yanofsky he made numerous calls to before reaching the united states border in a further attempt to obtain protection from united states authorities although no phone was found on argueta person when he was arrested.in his interview,argueta referred to people chasing him and said he was in fear of persecution and torture and argueta bizarre behavior at the interview confirmed his delusional state.although argueta did not cross at the port of entry,the district court found this was consistent with argueta perceptions of an immediate threat to this life.although argueta told the agents his destination was los angeles,he could have easily misunderstood this question in context as referring to his earlier crossing into the united states.
for these reasons,it is not clear beyond a reasonable doubt the district court would have found argueta guilty absent its misapprehension of the specific intent element.the error therefore was not harmless 
in his concurring opinion,judge bybee suggests our court should use this case as a vehicle to reconsider en banc three sets of circuit precedents our holdings in cases such as united states oscar,cir,and united states pacheco medina,cir,that,for immigration purposes,entry is a term of art that requires not only physical presence in the united states but also freedom from official restraint our holding in united states gracidas ulibarry,cir en banc,that attempted illegal reentry under is a specific intent crime and our holding in united states lombera valdovinos,cir,that official restraint encompasses restraint by government officials other than those of the department of homeland security dhs.in our view,each of these precedents rests on a solid footing.
judge bybee would have us reconsider our longstanding view that,for immigration purposes,entry is a term of art requiring not only physical presence in the united states but also freedom from official restraint.as judge bybee recognizes,this principle was established more than a century ago,see,ex parte chow chok,aff cir,and has long been recognized not only by this court but also by the supreme court,see kaplan tod.united states ju toy,other federal circuits,see,dimova holder,cir correa thornburgh,cir parra rojas att y,cir united states angeles mascote,cir vitale ins,cir nyirenda ins,cir,and the board of immigration appeals,see,matter of martinez serrano,bia matter of pierre,bia.judge bybee offers no persuasive justification for casting aside this longstanding and widely accepted understanding of what it means to enter the united states.
judge bybee perhaps believes this understanding of entry should be preserved for immigration purposes generally but should not apply to criminal immigration laws such as,and.concurrence at.here again,however,judge bybee view conflicts not only with the longstanding law of this court but also with the law of other circuits.see,united states macias,cir angeles mascote,at united states cardenas alvarez,cir united states kavazanjian,cir united states vasilatos,cir.we see no reason for adopting one meaning of entry for immigration purposes generally but a different meaning for criminal immigration laws,much less doing so to create a circuit split.
indeed,there are at least two persuasive reasons for continuing to adhere to this longstanding and widely accepted doctrine.first,as judge bybee recounts,the doctrine has been around for decades,and,although congress has amended the criminal immigration laws in the interim,it has never called into question or expressly overruled the firmly established judicial gloss on entry.as the supreme court has observed on many occasions,congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it a statute without change.forest grove sch.dist,d quoting lorillard pons,d see,hing sum holder,cir interpreting the word admission in a a in light of existing bia precedent requiring freedom from restraint 
second,the official restraint doctrine is a practical necessity.in its absence,mere physical presence in the united states,without permission,would give rise to criminal liability for illegal reentry under.see united states barragan cepeda,cir listing the elements of.we doubt congress intended to make criminals out of persons who,for any number of innocent reasons,approach immigration officials at the border.because in a literal and physical sense a person coming from abroad enters the united states whenever he reaches any land,water or air space within the territorial limits of this nation,freedom from official restraint must be added to physical presence before entry is accomplished.vasilatos,at.
judge bybee also questions our holding in united states gracidas ulibarry,cir en banc,that attempted illegal reentry is a specific intent crime,citing four circuits that have rejected that proposition united states rodriguez,cir united states morales palacios,cir united states peralt reyes,cir united states reyes medina,at cir unpublished.concurrence at.all four of those cases,however,were decided before the supreme court decision in united states resendiz ponce,d,which confirmed that the attempt prong of incorporates the common law meaning of attempt,including an element requiring the specific intent to commit the underlying crime.resendiz ponce confirms that gracidas ulibarry was correctly decided.
finally,judge bybee questions our holding in united states lombera valdovinos,cir,that official restraint encompasses restraint by any government official,not just officials of dhs,the department of homeland security.concurrence at.he contends official restraint has always been limited to physical restraint or surveillance of an alien by a government officer operating at or just inside the border.concurrence at.
official restraint,however,need not be by immigration officers,correa thornburgh,cir see,zhang slattery,cir shipwrecked alien restrained by local police upon reaching shore,superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized in city of new york permanent mission of india to united nations,cir edmond nelson,aliens seeking entry by sea restrained by the master of a rescuing ship,acting pursuant to government regulations matter of yam,bia alien found at the border and taken under guard by local police to a medical facility,and it need not be at the border,see kaplan tod.holding a girl was under official restraint even though she was handed over to the hebrew sheltering and immigrant aid society,which in turn allowed her to live with her father.
the position judge bybee advances in his concurrence is contrary not only to this precedent but also to the position the government itself argued to us in lombera valdovinos,where the government expressly rejected the proposition that only department of homeland security restraint constitutes official restraint under section.the government argued there that an alien is not deemed to have entered unless he is free to go at large within the united states,the very principle we followed in lombera valdovinos.judge bybee,therefore,is seeking to relitigate a rule of law the government expressly advocated for in lombera valdovinos and which it has not asked us to reconsider now.
nor has judge bybee suggested a rationale for criminalizing conduct such as that engaged in by the defendant in lombera valdovinos.lombera valdovinos crossed the border,walked directly up to a border control agent and asked to be taken into custody.he never sought to evade detection.he never sought the freedom to go at large within the united states.he neither sought nor gained a foothold in the united states.kaplan,at.we see no reason congress would have intended to reach such conduct.
judge bybee alternatively suggests lombera valdovinos should be reconsidered on a practical ground because it would allow defendants to avoid liability for attempting to reenter the united states by opportunistically asserting,after detection,that they crossed into the country solely to be placed into official custody.concurrence at.he argues requiring the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the specific intent to enter the united states free from official restraint imposes too great a burden on prosecutors.
this speculation seems unfounded.when a person is spotted by border patrol agents crossing into the united states,away from an official port of entry,this alone is compelling evidence that the person intends to achieve not only physical presence in the united states but also freedom from official restraint.united states quintana torres,cir noting an alien presence in the united states would provide convincing proof of the alien intention to be here unless adequately explained away,much as a face covered by jam near a jam jar is convincing proof of unless otherwise explained.certainly there may be unusual cases in which persons could be acquitted of attempted illegal reentry where,as in lombera valdovinos,they cross the border,walk directly up to a border control agent and ask to be taken into custody.but such cases present a rare set of factual circumstances.lombera valdovinos,at.in the more than years lombera valdovinos has been on the books,it has not,to our knowledge,hindered effective prosecution of those who attempt to enter the united states unlawfully.indeed,we are aware of only a single case itself in which an individual has been acquitted on this ground.
because the district court applied an incorrect legal standard,we vacate argueta conviction and sentence in and vacate the revocation of supervised release and sentence in.we remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
vacated and remanded.
i agree with the majority that the standard that governs argueta rosales case is supplied by united states lombera valdovinos,cir.because the district court failed to apply that standard,and because we are bound by lombera valdovinos,i concur in the majority judgment vacating the conviction and remanding this case for retrial.op.at.
in all other respects,however,i dissent.i am convinced that lombera valdovinos was wrongly decided and that our understanding of when an alien is free from official restraint has reached an absurd position.under lombera valdovinos,an alien is not guilty of attempted illegal reentry even if he crosses into the united states surreptitiously and outside a port of entry,so long as he tells border control that he came in hopes of remaining under restraint by any government official even in a federal prison far from the border once in the united states.judge rymer rightly pointed out in dissent from lombera valdovinos that this novel and unduly expansive definition of official restraint makes no sense and creates a puzzling loophole in the law of attempted illegal reentry.see lombera valdovinos,at rymer,dissenting.the passage of time has done nothing to blunt the force of her critique.it is time we revisited lombera valdovinos.
i begin by tracing the history that led up to lombera valdovinos,because it was a case in which what past was prologue.william shakespeare,the tempest act,sc.over roughly the last years,the term entry has taken on a narrower meaning than its colloquial usage in the context of immigration law.lombera valdovinos,at.for purposes of,an alien is considered not to have effected an entry into the united states unless he not only cross es the border,but does so free from official restraint.united states hernandez herrera,cir.the provenance of the official restraint doctrine and the future of the doctrine,as evidenced by lombera valdovinos and this case should make us rethink the concept of what it means to enter the united states.
courts adopted this peculiar definition of entry freedom from official restraint because,for many years,immigration law drew a distinction between exclusion and deportation.excluded aliens were those who were summarily sent home at the border,in contrast to aliens who were afforded the more elaborate process of deportation because they were already physically in the united states.landon plasencia,d.see zadvydas davis,d the distinction between an alien who has effected an entry into the united states and one who has never entered runs throughout immigration law.the distinction was a crucial one.by virtue of their presence in the united states,aliens in deportation proceedings had greater procedural and substantive rights than aliens in exclusion proceedings an administrative hearing and an appeal,the right to designate the country of deportation,and the right to seek voluntary departure.landon,at.by contrast,an excludable alien is a determination at the border,usually at the port of entry.landon,at.as the court explained in zadvydas,certain constitutional protections available to persons inside the united states are unavailable to aliens outside our geographic borders.but once an alien enters the country,the legal circumstance changes,for the due process clause applies to all persons within the united states,including aliens.at.see generally david martin,graduated application of constitutional protections for aliens the real meaning of zadvydas davis.
the distinction between excludable and deportable aliens required courts to confront a largely metaphysical,but tricky immigration law problem what was to be done about aliens who physically crossed the united states border but never reached the point of being able to move freely within the country and mix with the general population the paradigm example for this is an alien who presents himself at a port of entry and is taken to a secondary inspection area,technically across the international border,for further investigation into whether he is authorized to enter the united states.was the alien now entitled to a deportation proceeding because border agents walked him a few feet across the border the courts responded to this conceptual ambiguity about which due process rights apply in the immigration context by developing the legal fiction that entry is not accomplished until a person is free from official restraint.united states parga rosas,cir.under this legal fiction,an alien who never made it out of a port of entry,who was held temporarily by the united states,or who crossed the border at some other place but was never outside the control of the border authorities,would be deemed not to have entered the united states despite having done so in a literal sense.see,kaplan tod.w hile she was at ellis island she was to be regarded as stopped at the boundary line and kept there unless and until her right to enter should be declared.united states ju toy.holding that an alien detained at a port of entry,although physically within our boundaries,is to be regarded as if he had been stopped at the limit of our jurisdiction,and kept there while his right to enter was under debate.
although it was relatively easy to determine whether an alien entered the united states when he presented himself for inspection at a port of entry,it was more complicated to determine if an alien had entered the united states when he was interdicted inside the united states,but near the border.the case generally credited with inaugurating the official restraint doctrine in this area is a chinese exclusion case,ex parte chow chok,aff,cir.see lombera valdovinos,at pacheco medina united states,cir.in that case inspectors had tracked eight chinese aliens as they crossed from canada into the united states.the aliens were kept in sight,stopped a quarter of a mile inside the united states,and taken into custody.chow chok,at.the aliens filed for a writ of habeas corpus,contending that,because they had successfully entered the united states,they could only be deported,not excluded.the court found,however,that the aliens had not successfully entered the united states because from the moment when they crossed the border,they were in the actual,though not formal,custody of the inspectors.id.at.accordingly,they were only entitled to administrative processing and could be excluded.
although the entry fiction doctrine began life as a means of excluding aliens at or near the border without affording them deportation proceedings,it soon crossed over into the realm of criminal law.courts began to interpret the term enter,in criminal statutes,as a term of art whose meaning roughly corresponded to the contours of the entry fiction doctrine in immigration law.
for example,in united states vasilatos,cir,a greek seaman who had previously been deported from the united states falsely represented to an immigration officer at the port of philadelphia that he had never been deported and thereby gained temporary admission to the united states.id.at.the seaman stayed on his ship until it called at baltimore,where he disembarked and headed inland.when he was apprehended in new york a year later,he was charged with illegal reentry.id.at.the government alleged that the seaman had entered the united states at philadelphia,making that city the proper venue for his trial the seaman argued that his entry had occurred at baltimore and that baltimore was thus the proper venue.id.
the illegal reentry statute did not define what constituted an entry into the united states,and there was no general definition of the term elsewhere in title,so the third circuit understandably looked to the official restraint cases for guidance as to when an entry occurred.the court observed that administration of the immigration laws has long proceeded on th e theory of entry and saw no reason to disturb that theory in the context of the criminal law.vasilatos,at.it therefore held that the seaman had entered the united states at philadelphia,where his fraudulently obtained clearance for temporary admission had first given him freedom from official restraint,rather than at baltimore,where he had physically landed in the country.id.
after the relevant events in vasilatos occurred,but before the third circuit issued its decision,congress enacted the immigration and nationality act of,which collected and reorganized the various provisions of american immigration law in one place title.the act definitional provision defined the term entry very broadly as any coming of an alien into the united states,from a foreign port or place or from an outlying possession,whether voluntarily or otherwise.a.but despite the facial breadth of this definition,the courts were unwilling to do away with the traditional requirement of freedom from official restraint.rather,they simply assumed without much explanation that a had incorporated the preexisting judicial doctrine of official restraint.see,in re dubbiosi,acknowledging the adoption of a but stating that w e do not believe,however,that this definition removes the requirement of establishing not only physical presence,but also freedom from official restraint,before entry is accomplished.
at our first opportunity,in united states oscar,cir,we adopted the same view of what constitutes an entry for criminal purposes.oscar and an accomplice arranged for two honduran nationals to be driven to the san ysidro point of entry,where the hondurans lied to customs officials and said they were united states citizens.the hondurans were taken to secondary inspection and later arrested.id.at.oscar was subsequently convicted under of aiding and abetting an illegal entry into the united states.
we reversed the conviction,holding that oscar could not be guilty of aiding and abetting because the two hondurans had not committed the underlying offense of illegal entry under.we acknowledged that the two had come into the united states i n a physical sense when they moved to secondary inspection,which ostensibly was enough to satisfy the broad definition of entry in the act.oscar,at.but we agreed with vasilatos and dubbiosi holdings that entry,for purposes,requires freedom from official restraint.id.at.we reasoned that although vasilatos and dubbiosi were not factually analogous to oscar case,it made sense for us to adopt their approach to entry because congress had chosen to define entry in a,and it was unlikely that congress would define a term in if it intended the term to have different meanings in different contexts.id.at that consideration,along with the rule of lenity,led us to conclude that the hondurans had not entered the united states because they had not left the port of entry and thus never escaped official restraint.id.at.
