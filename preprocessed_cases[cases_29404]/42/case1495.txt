in this case,defendant robert best was seized by the coast guard from beyond the territorial sea of the united states and indicted for attempting to smuggle aliens into the country.we must decide whether best,whose vessel was sailing under a brazilian flag,may be tried in federal district court even though the united states did not obtain brazil consent to intercept the foreign vessel and seize the defendant.the district court entered an order dismissing the indictment,holding that the court lacked jurisdiction because the defendant had been seized in violation of international law.on appeal,the government contends that the court has the power to try the defendant despite any violations of international law.
because it is well established that a court power to try a defendant is ordinarily not affected by the manner in which the defendant is brought to trial,and because we conclude that no exceptions to this general rule apply here,in light of the facts surrounding the defendant seizure,we will reverse the district court dismissal order and remand the case for trial.
on may,the united states coast guard patrol boat nunivak was patrolling the waters near croix,virgin islands.that evening,the patrol boat spotted a large,wooden cargo vessel named the cordeiro de deus approximately sixteen nautical miles east of croix.this placed the vessel within the nautical mile contiguous zone of the united states,but outside the country territorial waters according to the government,at the time the coast guard spotted the vessel on radar,the cordeiro de deus appeared to be on a standard smuggling route headed for john or thomas.after the vessel failed to respond to several radio calls,an officer of the nunivak formed a boarding team and instructed it to contact the cordeiro de deus.he further instructed the boarding team to ask right of visit questions of the crew and to seek consent to board the vessel.
traveling in a small,inflatable boat,the boarding team approached the starboard side of the cordeiro de deus and observed five men standing on that side of the deck.a member of the boarding team who was a spanish interpreter asked the men questions in both english and spanish,but determined that they spoke neither language.one of the crew members went inside the boat and came back with a small brazilian flag.because the interpreter knew that portuguese is spoken in brazil and that spanish and portuguese have many words in common,he communicated to the crew in spanish and with hand signals.
the crew members understood that the coast guard sought to come aboard and indicated their permission for the boarding team to do so.best was one of the five men standing on the deck of the cordeiro de deus and was identified by the other men as the captain of the vessel.when asked about their destination and cargo,the men indicated that they were en route to martinique to buy cigarettes and that their last port of call was brazil.the boarding team also asked to inspect the vessel documents.in response,the crew produced paperwork from brazil and one document that contained a stamp from suriname.the united states claims that the boarding team was unable to determine the nationality of the cordeiro de deus from these documents.the vessel bore no markings of a homeport.
the boarding team next began a safety inspection.during the inspection,two members of the boarding team discovered a group of chinese nationals that appeared to be hiding in the cargo hold.the boarding team reported its findings to the nunivak,which,after contacting coast guard authorities,was instructed to escort the cordeiro de deus close to croix so that agents from the united states immigration and naturalization service ins could interview the individuals aboard the vessel.two ins agents boarded the cordeiro de deus late the next afternoon and determined that there were chinese nationals on board.the next day,with the assistance of a chinese interpreter,the ins agents interviewed the chinese nationals.that afternoon,after transporting the chinese nationals and all of the crewmembers to croix,the agents interviewed best and,on the following day,completed interviews with the other crew members.
on the morning of may,the government presented best and four others for an advice of rights on the criminal charge of alien smuggling.a grand jury returned an indictment charging best with conspiring to bring illegal aliens to the united states in violation of a a v i and bringing illegal aliens to the united states in violation of a a i on august,best filed a motion to dismiss the indictment,arguing that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over him because the united states had taken him from the high seas in violation of international law.the district court agreed with best,holding that the united states was required to obtain consent from brazil under international law before it could seize best from the cordeiro de deus and try him for violating the immigration laws.because the united states failed to secure such consent,the court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over best and entered an order dismissing the indictment on october.
the government filed a motion for reconsideration on november,and a notice of appeal on november,due to the filing of the notice of appeal,the district court denied the government motion for reconsideration for lack of jurisdiction on november.
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case pursuant to and.we have appellate jurisdiction under.because whether the district court properly dismissed the indictment for lack of jurisdiction is a question of law,we exercise plenary review.united states ezeiruaku,cir.
at issue in this appeal is whether the district court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant charged with violating the immigration laws and seized from a foreign vessel on the high seas.it is well established that a court power to try a defendant is ordinarily not affected by the manner in which the defendant is brought to trial.see frisbie collins.upholding conviction of defendant who had been kidnapped in chicago by michigan officers and brought to trial in michigan ker illinois.holding that court power to try defendant for crime was not impaired by forcible abduction of defendant from peru see also united states,cir noting that j urisdiction over the person of a defendant in a federal criminal trial whether citizen or alien,whether arrested within or beyond the territory of the united states,is not subject to challenge on the ground that the defendant presence before the court was unlawfully secured quoting united states winter,cir.this general rule,commonly referred to as the doctrine,rest s on the sound basis that due process of law is satisfied when one present in court is convicted of crime after having been fairly apprised of the charges against him and after a fair trial in accordance with constitutional procedural safeguards.frisbie,at.
