when does an order of removal become final for the purpose of seeking judicial review panels of our court have reached varying conclusions,creating unnecessary confusion as to the timeliness of petitions for review and our jurisdiction to entertain them.we reheard this matter en banc to clarify the issue of finality of the board of immigration appeals bia decisions.today,we adopt a straightforward rule when the board of immigration appeals issues a decision that denies some claims but remands any other claims for relief to an immigration judge ij for further proceedings a mixed decision the bia decision is not a final order of removal with regard to any of the claims,and it does not trigger the window in which to file a petition for review.
as a result,we have jurisdiction to consider petitioner asylum claim,but we remand to the bia in light of singh holder,cir en banc.
sama abdiaziz abdisalan is a year old native and citizen of somalia.abdisalan asserts that she entered the united states in february.on march,abdisalan filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.she claimed that in somalia,she was forced to undergo female genital mutilation and was kidnapped and raped by members of a rival clan.abdisalan appeared at a merits hearing before an ij in.the ij found that abdisalan was credible,but denied her asylum claim as,concluding that she had not demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that she filed her asylum application within one year of arriving in the united states.the ij did,however,grant abdisalan withholding of removal as to somalia 
abdisalan appealed the ij asylum determination,and the government declined to challenge the ij grant of withholding.in november,the bia affirmed the ij denial of abdisalan asylum claim and remanded for background checks related to her withholding claim.abdisalan did not file a petition for review of the bia decision.
in june,the government completed its background checks,and the ij issued another order granting abdisalan withholding of removal.abdisalan again appealed to the bia,challenging the agency previous determination that her asylum claim was.the bia treated this appeal as an untimely motion to reconsider and dismissed it in a september decision.the bia again remanded the matter to the ij for updated background checks.finally,in march,the ij issued an order confirming that abdisalan had completed another round of background checks.this order also reaffirmed the grant of withholding and reiterated that abdisalan asylum claim had been denied.abdisalan then filed in this court petitions for review of the bia decision and the ij order,challenging the finding that her asylum claim is.the two petitions have been consolidated for our review.
a divided panel of our court held that it lacked jurisdiction over abdisalan consolidated petition because she failed to file a petition for review within thirty days of the bia decision affirming the ij denial of her asylum claim.abdisalan holder,cir.a majority of active,nonrecused judges voted to rehear the petition for review en banc.cir.
we have jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction.ye ins,cir.in this instance,whether we have jurisdiction is a purely legal question,which we determine de novo.annachamy holder,cir.
a petition for review must be filed not later than days after the date of the final order of removal.b.this time limit is mandatory and jurisdictional.stone ins,internal quotation marks omitted.as a result,the point at which a removal order becomes final is critical for the purposes of timely petitioning for judicial review.ortiz alfaro holder,cir.
in the ordinary case,this point is easy to determine the clock begins to run when the bia issues a decision that affirms in full the ij order of removal.however,as here,an alien often seeks more than one avenue of relief from deportation in a single application.commonly the alien will seek asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief,or,in the alternative,voluntary departure.the standards for obtaining such relief vary so that,for example,an alien may be able to obtain withholding but not asylum.finality is less obvious when the bia affirms the denial of relief on some of an alien claims for relief but remands to the ij for further proceedings on others in a mixed decision.does that bia decision constitute a final order of removal with regard to the claims denied to date,we have offered conflicting answers to that question.
in go holder,cir,the ij denied the petitioner asylum,withholding,and cat claims.the bia affirmed as to asylum and withholding,but remanded for further consideration of the petitioner cat claim.id.at.after additional proceedings before the ij,the bia affirmed the denial of cat relief.id.at.the petitioner never filed a petition for review of the first bia decision,but he timely filed a petition challenging the second bia decision,seeking judicial review of all three claims.id.we held that because go removal order did not become final until the board rejected each of his claims for relief,our jurisdiction extends to each of his claims.id.at.we acknowledged that the bia first decision may have been the final administrative decision with respect to go eligibility for asylum and withholding relief,but explained that that decision was not a final order of removal because it left open the possibility that go might obtain cat relief and therefore avoid removal.id.at.
we reached a contrary conclusion in li holder,cir.in li,the ij denied the petitioner asylum claim but granted withholding of removal.id.at.on appeal,the bia affirmed the ij denial of asylum,but as in abdisalan case,remanded the matter to the ij to complete background checks required before withholding of removal can be granted.id.at.we held that the bia decision was a final order as to the petitioner asylum claim because it was not the subject of the remand,and the board considered and decided the merits of the asylum appeal before dismissing it.id.at.we therefore concluded that where the bia denies one form of relief and remands for background checks required for alternative relief,we have jurisdiction to consider an appeal of the final order denying relief.id.
in ortiz alfaro,we recognized that go appears to be at odds with li.at.we attempted to sidestep that tension by observing that in both go and li,all administrative proceedings had concluded at the time we decided that we had jurisdiction.id.we held that we lacked jurisdiction over ortiz alfaro petition because administrative proceedings are ongoing in his case.id.despite our efforts in ortiz alfaro,the divided abdisalan panel opinion correctly perceived an intractable conflict between go and li we agreed to rehear this case en banc to resolve that conflict.
the stakes for abdisalan are high if the bia decision was a final order of removal with regard to her asylum claim,as in li,then she lost her opportunity to challenge the agency denial of that claim when she failed to file a petition for review of the decision.but if the bia decision was not a final order of removal,as in go,then we have jurisdiction to review abdisalan asylum claim as part of her subsequent petitions for review.this difference is not without significance both abdisalan and the government urge us to follow go and overrule li.because go approach better aligns with the text of the immigration and nationality act ina and the agency implicit interpretations of the ina,we agree.
we begin with our own jurisdictional statute.we have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal.id.a.congress has defined an order of as the order of the ij concluding that the alien is deportable or ordering deportation.id.a a.the order then becomes final upon the earlier of 
i a determination by the board of immigration appeals affirming such order or 
ii the expiration of the period in which the alien is permitted to seek review of such order by the board of immigration appeals.
a straightforward reading of this text indicates that an order of removal can not become final for any purpose when it depends on the resolution of further issues by the ij on remand.the ina repeated reference to the order suggests that congress contemplated that an alien removal proceedings would typically culminate in one final order of removal.see in re hp inkjet printer,cir interpreting the statutory term the to mean singular in re cardelucci,cir observing that the definite article the particularizes the subject which it precedes and is a word of limitation as opposed to the indefinite or generalizing force a or an quoting black law dictionary ed stone,at holding that an amendment to the ina in abrogated the default presumption that congress visualized a single administrative proceeding in which all questions relating to an alien deportation would be raised and resolved,but that it did so only in the specific context of motions to reopen and reconsider internal quotation marks omitted.if there is only one final order of removal as is true in the absence of a motion to reopen or reconsider it is difficult to conceive how the order could become final at multiple points in time.
congress use of the word final strengthens this view.final commonly means m arking the last stage of a process leaving nothing to be looked for or expected ultimate.final,oxford english dictionary,http last visited.in the legal context,the term final refers to an order ending a court action or proceeding leaving nothing further to be determined by the court or to be done except the administrative execution of the court finding webster third new int l dictionary see also black law dictionary ed defining final as not requiring any further judicial action by the court that rendered judgment to determine the matter litigated concluded.congress use of this familiar term suggests that it did not intend for an order of removal to become final while remanded proceedings are ongoing.
although the statutory text provides a strong indication of how we should treat mixed bia decisions,it does not speak unambiguously to the issue here.scialabba cuellar de osorio.in particular,the dual reference to the order concluding that the alien is deportable or ordering deportation could suggest that two different kinds of orders are covered an alien could be deportable but not ordered deported because he is possibly entitled to some form of relief from deportation.see a a emphasis added.the language of the ina thus does not completely foreclose the possibility that a mixed bia decision could constitute a final order of removal with regard to the claims denied.for further guidance,we turn to the agency interpretations.
neither the bia nor the executive office for immigration review eoir has expressly addressed the issue before us.nonetheless,the agency regulations,and particularly its interpretations of those regulations,bolster the view that a mixed bia decision is not final with regard to any of the alien claims.these,if indirect,interpretations further persuade us that in the absence of a motion to reopen or reconsider,there is only one final order of removal per alien,and that order does not become final until background checks or other remanded proceedings are complete.mejia hernandez holder,cir applying skidmore deference to the bia interpretation proportional to its thoroughness,reasoning,consistency,and ability to persuade 
as a general matter,eoir regulations provide that the bia may return a case to an immigration judge for such further action as may be appropriate,without entering a final decision on the merits of the case.d emphasis added.also relevant to the particular circumstances before us is that a comprehensive set of regulations and bia decisions governs background checks.by regulation,the bia may not grant certain forms of relief,including withholding of removal,until background checks have been completed.d i.if background checks must be completed or updated,the bia may remand to the ij with instructions to carry out the checks.id.d ii a.when a case is remanded to the ij for background checks,the ij is required to consider the results of the identity,law enforcement,or security investigations or examinations,and i f new information is presented,the immigration judge may hold a further hearing if necessary to consider any legal or factual issues,including issues relating to credibility,if relevant.id.h.the immigration judge shall then enter an order granting or denying the immigration relief sought.id.similarly,eoir interim rule governing background checks states that when required checks have not been completed,the board will not be able to issue a final decision granting any application for relief that is subject to the provisions of,because the record is not yet complete.background and security investigations in proceedings before immigration judges and the board of immigration appeals.
the bia has interpreted these regulations in a pair of published,decisions.first,in in re alcantara perez,bia,the board considered how an ij should proceed if background checks reveal that the alien may be ineligible for a form of relief that has already been provisionally granted.the bia concluded that because an order remanding the case for background checks is not a final decision,new information that comes to light on remand permits the ij to examine the case in a different light,including by holding new hearings.id.at.the bia also explained that where the background checks fail to turn up new evidence,the immigration judge will enter an order granting relief,and t hat order then becomes the final administrative order in the case.id.at emphasis added.
in in re m d,bia,the bia again considered the scope of the ij jurisdiction on remand.the bia explained that when a case is remanded to an immigration judge for the appropriate background checks pursuant to h,the immigration judge reacquires jurisdiction over the proceedings.id.at.on remand,the ij may not reconsider the decision of the board,but if the background checks reveal new evidence potentially affecting relief,the immigration judge must consider such evidence before entering an order.id.reiterating its position in alcantara perez,the bia remarked that when it remands for background checks,no final order exists.id.
these agency interpretations shed further light on what the text of the statute already implies in a case like abdisalan,there is only one final order of removal,and when the bia remands to the ij,that order is not final until administrative proceedings have concluded.indeed,under the bia own precedential decisions,the bia lacked authority to issue the final administrative order in abdisalan case because it remanded the matter to the ij for background checks.in re alcantara perez,at.in such circumstances,the bia has made clear that no final order exists.in re m d,at.
in a related context,the supreme court has long interpreted the term final agency action in the administrative procedure act to require that an agency action mark the consummation of the agency decisionmaking process.bennett spear,quoting chicago air lines,waterman.in other words,the action must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature.bennett,at see also sackett epa,holding that an agency order was final in part because its conclusions were not subject to further agency review.in the immigration context,the agency adjudication of an alien claims can hardly be considered fully consummated while background checks or other remanded proceedings which have the potential to affect the disposition are still in progress.
finally,we note that considerations of judicial efficiency also weigh in favor of reviewing a single final order of removal.see,steel shipbuilding,office of workers comp.programs,cir holding that an agency order involving a remand is not a reviewable final order,and reasoning that this rule furthers the same policies as the finality rule embodied in,office of workers comp.programs brodka,cir noting that declining to exercise jurisdiction over agency remand orders furthers the interests of administrative economy and judicial efficiency embodied in the policy against piecemeal appeals.nor is this rule likely to have an unfair impact on petitioners.see ins doherty,a s a general matter,every delay w
