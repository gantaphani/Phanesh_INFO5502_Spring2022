opinion of the court 
this petition for review of an order of removal requires that we determine if a conviction for harboring an alien constitutes an aggravated felony.the immigration judge sometimes referred to as ij concluded that it was,and that the permanent resident alien who is the petitioner here was therefore removable.for the reasons that follow,inasmuch as we agree with the ij conclusion,we must dismiss the petition for review because we lack subject matter jurisdiction.
facts and procedural history 
vinodbhai bholidas patel is a native and citizen of india who was admitted to the united states as a nonimmigrant in.in,he adjusted his status to that of lawful permanent resident.however,on january,he pled guilty to harboring an alien in violation of a a iii of the immigration and naturalization act ina,a a iii,and was subsequently sentenced to five months imprisonment,followed by three years of supervised release.
while he was serving his sentence,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued a notice to appear charging him with being removable based upon his conviction for an aggravated felony as defined in ina a n,a n.the ins alleged that harboring an alien is an aggravated felony rendering patel removable.based upon that notice,the ins eventually took patel into custody and placed him in detention 
at a hearing before an immigration judge on february,patel,through counsel,acknowledged the fact of his conviction,but argued that his crime was not an aggravated felony as defined in the ina.he did not,however,request relief from removal the ij disagreed,and held that harboring an alien was an aggravated felony and that patel was therefore removable as charged.accordingly,the ij ordered patel removed to india.the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed,and this petition for review followed.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
at the outset,we note that there is some confusion surrounding the proper standard of review in cases such as this.we usually afford deference to decisions of administrative agencies when we are reviewing the agency interpretation of a statute the agency is charged with administering.see chevron,natural resources defense council,d.this deference recognizes the agency expertise in addressing issues that often arise when interpreting such statutes.however,we recognize that legal issues that turn on a pure question of law not implicating the agency expertise do not raise the same concerns under chevron.see sandoval reno,cir an issue concerning a statute effective date is not one that implicates agency expertise in a meaningful way,and does not,therefore,appear to require chevron deference.accordingly,when we are called upon to resolve pure questions of law by statutory interpretation,we decide the issue de novo without deferring to an administrative agency that may be involved.ins,d.our analysis here involves a pure question of law because we must determine if patel criminal conviction is an aggravated felony under a c the relevant statute.moreover,inasmuch as our subject matter jurisdiction turns upon that inquiry,the need to defer to the expertise of the ins is attenuated at best.nevertheless,we have previously suggested that some deference is still required under chevron even though we are reviewing a purely legal question such as the bia interpretation of a criminal statute.see drakes zimski,cir.
in drakes,we noted that our decision in sandoval predated the supreme court decision in ins,d wherein the court reversed the decision of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit because the circuit court had not afforded proper deference to the bia interpretation of a statute.however,concerned the extremely sensitive issue of whether criminal conduct that an alien admitted committing in guatemala precluded the alien eligibility for asylum or withholding of deportation from the united states.the alien claimed that his conduct in guatemala should not bar his eligibility for that relief because he committed those crimes as part of a protest against certain policies of the government of guatemala.the ij granted the requested relief holding that the alien had demonstrated a well founded fear of persecution based upon his political beliefs if he was returned to guatemala.the bia reversed.the bia did not decide if the alien had demonstrated a risk of persecution.rather,the bia simply concluded that the alien had committed a serious nonpolitical crime within the meaning of the relevant statute,and he was therefore not eligible for asylum or withholding of deportation.at.however,the court of appeals reversed the bia ruling.that court held that the bia should have weighed certain factors before deciding that the alien guatemalan crimes destroyed his eligibility for asylum or withholding of deportation.the supreme court reversed.in doing so,the court stated 
it is clear that principles of chevron deference are applicable to this statutory scheme in addition,we have recognized that judicial deference to the executive branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context where officials exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations.a decision by the attorney general to deem certain offenses violent offenses committed in another country as political in nature,and to allow the perpetrators to remain in the united states,may affect our relations with that country or its neighbors.the judiciary is not well positioned to shoulder primary responsibility for assessing the likelihood and importance of such diplomatic repercussions.
id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.those considerations were not present in drakes,and they are absent here.ultimately,we did not decide if chevron deference applied to our analysis in drakes because we concluded that the result would be the same whether we afforded de novo or deferential review.that is also our situation here.therefore,we need not now decide the issue of whether deference should be afforded to the bia interpretation of the statutory definition of aggravated felon.just as in drakes,our result would be the same whether we afford the bia statutory interpretation deferential or de novo review.under either scope of review we conclude that the bia did not err in concluding that patel has been convicted of an aggravated felony.
jurisdiction 
under a c of the ina,a c,courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal for an alien convicted of one or more specified criminal offenses,including any aggravated felony however,notwithstanding the seemingly broad restriction of jurisdiction contained in a c,we retain the jurisdiction to determine whether we can review a decision of the bia even though that review entails the same inquiry as a review of the merits of the bia decision,whether the underlying criminal offense is an aggravated felony.therefore,we have jurisdiction here to determine whether patel is an alien,and whether he is removable by reason of having been convicted of one of the enumerated offenses in ina a c.see drakes,at.if both of those conditions are satisfied,a c prohibits further adjudication of the petition for review and we must dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.id.at.however,if either condition is not satisfied,our review is not precluded,and we have jurisdiction to review the bia decision.id.in that instance,the petition for review must be granted and the order of removal vacated.id.simply put,we have jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction under a c.drakes,at.our inquiry here need only focus on the second factor since it is undisputed that patel is an alien.the instant dispute centers instead on whether patel conviction for harboring aliens is an aggravated felony,rendering him removable.the jurisdiction inquiry is,therefore,a merits inquiry because the former supplies the answer for the latter.
is a conviction for harboring aliens an aggravated felony 
ina a a provides as follows 
bringing in and harboring certain aliens 
a criminal penalties 
a any person who 
i knowing that a person is an alien,brings to or attempts to bring to the united states in any manner whatsoever such person at a place other than a designated port of entry or place other than as designated by the commissioner,regardless of whether such alien has received prior official authorization to come to,enter,or reside in the united states and regardless of any future official action which may be taken with respect to such alien

an offense described in paragraph a or of section a of this title relating to alien smuggling,except in the case of a first offense for which the alien has affirmatively shown that the alien committed the offense for the purpose of assisting,abetting,or aiding only the alien spouse,child or parent and no other individual to violate a provision of this chapter.
a n italics added.
patel challenge to the immigration judge ruling is rather literal.he focuses on the statute reference to alien smuggling and argues that his conviction for harboring an alien can not be an aggravated felony because the alien he harbored was already in this country and he patel had no part in the alien illegal admission or entry simply put,he argues that since he was not convicted of bringing the alien into this country smuggling,his conviction for harboring an alien already here is not an aggravated felony.
we disagree.we believe that the parenthetical relating to alien smuggling in ina a n,is descriptive and not restrictive.the phrase is nothing more than a shorthand description of all of the offenses listed in ina a a.congress did not intend it to be a substantive restriction limiting which of the several offenses specified in a a applies to a n.consequently,the offense of harboring an alien in violation of ina a a iii is an aggravated felony rendering patel removable.
this reading of the statute is consistent with that of every appellate court that has considered this issue.see yetter,cir ashcroft,cir united states,cir united states,cir reno,cir united states,cir.we realize that not all of these cases involved petitions for review of removal orders,and concerned the interpretation of the sentencing guidelines.however,those cases are nevertheless relevant to our inquiry.
section b a of the guidelines is entitled unlawfully entering or remaining in the united states,and provides for a level increase in the applicable offense level if a defendant is convicted of illegal after a criminal conviction for an aggravated felony application note one to that guideline states an a ggravated felony is defined at a n,comment.therefore,although the issue arises in a slightly different context when courts are presented with a petition for review of a removal order than when courts must determine the appropriate sentence under the sentencing guidelines,both sets of precedent address the relating to alien smuggling parenthetical in a n.
in interpreting that statute we note,as a matter of general structure and context,that congress included a catalogue of aggravated felonies and described each by reference to criminal offenses outside the confines of the ina,offenses contained in titles,and of the united states code.specifically,subparagraphs d,e,h,i,j,k,l,m,and p of ina a define aggravated felonies by specific reference to section numbers of the code and then include a parenthetical setting forth the general nature of the referenced offenses this leads us to conclude that these parentheticals are intended only as a general illustration of the referenced criminal statutes.the parentheticals thus assist the reader who is attempting to determine whether a particular offense constitutes an aggravated felony.as one court of appeals has suggested 
section a contains a long list of aggravated felonies that it references by section number.without any descriptions of what this litany of numbers referred to,determining whether an offense qualified as an aggravated felony would be a long and arduous process.one would need to look up each section number in the code to get to the right one.the parentheticals here provide an aid to identification only.
at see also united states,at section a contains a long list of aggravated felonies referenced by section number.without any descriptions of what the section numbers refer to,determining whether an offense qualifies as an aggravated felony would be a laborious process,at the function of the descriptive language appears to be to make reading the statute easier,so that one does not have to look up each citation to see what it is about,and to protect against scrivener error in getting the statute from the drafting desk to the united states code.
moreover,this interpretation of the statute is corroborated by the fact that other subsections have parentheticals that are expressly restrictive or limiting.for example,ina a f,defines an aggravated felony as a crime of violence as defined in section of title,but not including a purely political offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.a f italics added.similarly,ina a j,defines an aggravated felony as an offense described in relating to racketeer influenced corrupt organizations,or an offense described in if it is a second or subsequent offense.a j italics added.such parentheticals clearly establish that congress used restrictive or limiting language where it intended a parenthetical to limit or refine a given provision.
with this general structure and context in mind,we turn to the specific provision at issue here.as noted above,ina a n defines an aggravated felony as 
an offense described in paragraph a or of section a of this title relating to alien smuggling,except in the case of a first offense for which the alien has affirmatively shown that the alien committed the offense for the purpose of assisting,abetting,or aiding only the alien spouse,child or parent and no other individual to violate a provision of this chapter.
a n italics added.perhaps the most compelling reason to find that the relating to alien smuggling parenthetical is descriptive and not limiting is as the court of appeals for the fifth circuit has noted that conventional rules of grammar demonstrate that the parenthetical,relating to alien smuggling refers to paragraph a or of section a of this title,not offense,at citing a n.the parenthetical relating to alien smuggling is contained in the prepositional phrase beginning in p aragraph is the subject of that phrase and,therefore,it clearly refers to paragraph a or of section a of this title.id.if the parenthetical were intended to be restrictive,it would have been placed directly after the word offense.the statute would then read an offense relating to alien smuggling described in paragraph a or of section a.id.that wording would be consistent with patel claim.however,that is not what congress did,that is not what the statute says,and we can not amend the statute in that manner.yet,accepting patel argument would result in just such a judicial amendme
