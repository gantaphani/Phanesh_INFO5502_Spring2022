jose lopez vasquez petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia denial of his application for adjustment of status and its denial of his motion to reopen based on new evidence.the bia concluded that lopez vasquez was ineligible for adjustment of status because of a conviction for possession of marijuana for sale in violation of california health safety code section.lopez vasquez contends that the conviction was actually for simple possession of marijuana in violation of health safety code section and that,as a result,he is eligible for relief under lujan armendariz ins,cir,overruled prospectively by nunez reyes holder,cir en banc.we deny both petitions.
in order to understand lopez vasquez arguments,it is first necessary to understand the interplay between the applicable statutory framework and our case law.
the attorney general may adjust the status of an alien if the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the united states for permanent residence.i a.the alien has the burden of establishing clearly and beyond doubt that he is entitled to be admitted and is not inadmissible under.valadez munoz holder,cir quoting c a see also blanco mukasey,cir 
under,an alien who has been convicted of an offense relating to a controlled substance is inadmissible.a i ii.because the burden of proving admissibility is on the alien,valadez munoz,at,an alien with a criminal conviction must prove that the conviction does not relate to a controlled substance or otherwise render the alien inadmissible under.young holder,cir en banc.an alien can not carry this burden by merely establishing that the relevant record of conviction is inconclusive as to whether the conviction was for an offense that would make the alien inadmissible.id.at.
an alien inadmissibility under due to a conviction is generally not affected by the later expungement of the conviction.murillo espinoza ins,cir see a a.the federal first offender act ffoa created a limited exception to this rule for federal defendants.see.under the ffoa,a federal court can put drug offenders who are convicted of simple possession under on probation.a.if the defendants successfully complete probation,the court must discharge them without entering a judgment of conviction.id.an ffoa disposition shall not be considered a conviction for the purpose of a disqualification or a disability imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,or for any other purpose,b,including immigration proceedings.see nunez reyes,at.
in lujan armendariz,we extended the immigration benefits of the ffoa to individuals with expunged state court convictions for simple possession drug offenses where the offenders would have been eligible for relief under the ffoa had their offenses been prosecuted as federal crimes.lujan armendariz,at.we later extended lujan armendariz to cover expunged state court convictions where the drug offense was a less serious offense than simple possession of a controlled substance,such as a conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia.ramirez altamirano holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted,overruled prospectively by nunez reyes,at.
recently,nunez reyes overruled lujan armendariz and ramirez altamirano and held that the ffoa applies to only federal convictions.nunez reyes,at.but nunez reyes applies only prospectively,so we must still evaluate convictions entered by a state court before july,under lujan armendariz framework.id.at.
lopez vasquez claim that he is eligible for adjustment of status hinges on the differences between california health safety code sections and.
section criminalizes the possession of marijuana or concentrated cannabis as well as the possession of marijuana upon the grounds of,or within,any school.cal.health safety code west.at the time of lopez vasquez conviction,a violation of section was punishable by imprisonment in a state prison,imprisonment in county jail,or a fine,depending on the specific circumstances of the violation.id.under california law,a statute that can result in this range of punishments is referred to as a wobbler statute because it provides for either a misdemeanor or a felony conviction.see garcia lopez ashcroft,cir citing code b.whether a wobbler is determined to be a misdemeanor or a felony is controlled by code b garcia lopez,at.as relevant to this case,a wobbler offense is a misdemeanor for all purposes w hen the court grants probation to a defendant without imposition of sentence and at the time of granting probation,or on application thereafter,the court declares the offense to be a misdemeanor.id.at alterations in original quoting code b.
lopez vasquez asserts that a section conviction is a simple possession drug conviction and that he would have been eligible for relief under the ffoa had it been prosecuted as a federal crime.we have not previously addressed this question,and we need not reach it today in light of our conclusion,see infra part iii,that the bia did not err in concluding that lopez vasquez was not convicted of this offense.
section criminalizes the possession of marijuana for sale.cal.health safety code west every person who possesses for sale any marijuana shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison.because section prescribes imprisonment in the state prison as the only available punishment,it is a felony.code.a.in addition,california penal code section b does not apply and,as a result,a court may not designate a section conviction as a misdemeanor.people mauch,th,d holding that a crime punishable only by imprisonment in the state prison is a straight felony that can not be designated as a misdemeanor internal quotation marks omitted.
if lopez vasquez drug conviction was for possession of marijuana for sale in violation of section,he would be ineligible for relief under our framework because,as he concedes,possession for sale is not a simple possession offense that would qualify for treatment under the ffoa.nor is it a less serious offense than simple possession of a controlled substance,and so it would not be treated as if it were an offense under our case law.ramirez altamirano,at.
mindful of this framework,we now turn to the facts of this case.lopez vasquez,a citizen of el salvador,entered the united states illegally in.on may,lopez vasquez pleaded no contest to,and was convicted of,possession of marijuana for sale in violation of health safety code section.the state court minute order states count h s fel poss for sale,and count disposition convicted.the state court suspended the imposition of a sentence,placed lopez vasquez on probation and,as a condition of probation,required him to serve days in county jail.
over a year later,on july,the court held a status conference in lopez vasquez case.at the status conference,lopez vasquez sought a change in his charge for immigration purposes.the court did not rule on this request and,instead,ordered the probation department to prepare a report pursuant to termination and dismissal of the defendant probation.like the minute order for the previous hearing,the minute order for the status conference states count h s fel poss for sale.
in compliance with the court order,a probation officer met with lopez vasquez and prepared a report.the report states that lopez vasquez was convicted of hs poss marijuana for sale.it concludes that lopez vasquez appeared to be fully in compliance with the terms and conditions of his probation and states that the court is respectfully advised to grant him his heart desires as still keeping him on probation will be harmful to his immigrant status.
based on this favorable report,on august,the court deemed lopez vasquez conviction to be a misdemeanor,terminated probation,and set aside the conviction under section of the california penal code the state court records do not state that the court changed the offense of conviction to simple possession of marijuana.in fact,like the previous minute orders,the minute order for the august hearing contains the following notation count h s fel poss for sale.the probation department records also reflect that lopez vasquez conviction was deemed a misdemeanor,that probation was termin
