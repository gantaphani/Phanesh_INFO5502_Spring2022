the petition for panel rehearing is granted.the opinion,wl.lexis cir,is withdrawn,and the following opinion is substituted 
laoi majd,together with his wife and son as derivative beneficiaries,petitions for review of the denial by the board of immigration appeals bia of his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.we deny the petition.
majd,a native of libya holding a palestinian authority pa passport,was admitted to the united states in january as a nonimmigrant visitor.he overstayed his visa and in april was charged by the department of homeland security dhs with removability under a b for remaining in the country longer than permitted.in a september hearing before an immigration judge ij,majd conceded he was removable as charged but requested asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under cat,or,in the alternative,voluntary departure,claiming he was entitled to all such relief because,as a palestinian living in the west bank,he had been persecuted by israeli forces.
majd testified as follows before entering the united states,he and his family lived in ramallah,where he and his wife were bankers.in march,on returning to the west bank from a vacation in jordan,he was stopped by israeli security forces at a checkpoint and detained for hours.he did not say why he was detained,but he claimed that the security forces kicked him while walking up and down the corridor where he was being held and that they questioned him about his job,family,and party affiliations.while he was being detained,his wife,one month pregnant,had to sit in a chair for eight hours without food or water.
in may,majd was arrested while on his way to pick up his sister,was detained for two hours,and again was questioned regarding his destination,family,job,and affiliations.he stated that on both occasions when he was detained,he presented the security forces with an identification card indicating that he was a low security risk.
in march,as he was leaving the bank where he worked,majd noticed tanks and soldiers in the street.the soldiers were shooting from everywhere.majd and another person tried to leave the area but were confronted by an israeli soldier who demanded to know their destination.majd stated he was going home,but the soldier ordered him back inside the bank.
when the soldier was distracted by one of his comrades,majd and the other person tried to escape.the soldiers ordered them to stop,but when they did not obey the soldiers fired upon them.the other individual was shot,but majd made it home safely.majd testified that he had done nothing to deserve detention but confirmed that the building in which he worked housed the office of a fatah leader.
in august,majd took a taxi from ramallah to visit his father.while his taxi was in line at a security checkpoint,another taxi tried to change lanes and pass in front of another car.because getting out of a checkpoint line is generally considered suspicious activity,the israeli forces opened fire.a passenger riding in the same taxi as majd was shot and killed,and majd fainted out of fear.majd eventually reached his destination and did not testify that the israeli forces were shooting specifically at him.
the pa occupied the ground floor and basement of the building in which majd lived.one day,after inspecting the location and suspecting that some pa soldiers has escaped through the building,israeli soldiers searched the building from top to bottom,including majd home.the soldiers broke some objects there,and majd family was terrified,particularly after hearing shots fired in the building.it was that event that prompted majd and his family to take a vacation to the united states to wait for the situation in the west bank to get better.
after majd his wife and son fled to the united states,numerous problems befell his family remaining in the west bank.his cousin was detained by israeli forces,and the cousin blacksmith shop was destroyed.majd brother was detained for three months under an israeli law that permits judges to authorize administrative detention for that length of time majd family,who raised vegetables in addition to holding other jobs,could not bring their harvest to market because of the general unrest in the area and the fact that everything is closed and surrounded by israeli authorities.in particular,the wall the israelis are building to secure the west bank border runs through the middle of his family olive groves,depriving them of their land.
majd offered the testimony of his brother,modard salah jousef majd,via telephone.the brother confirmed that he had been taken and detained for three months by the israelis after telling them that majd had gone to the united states.he also confirmed the destruction of the family olive groves and stated that because of his experiences,he is essentially confined to his village.the telephonic testimony of majd father similarly confirmed majd accounts.
majd also offered the testimony of emily watchsmann,a student at the university of north texas who had visited the west bank in conjunction with an organization known as the international solidarity movement.watchsmann commented on the general conditions of unrest in the west bank but stated that she had no personal knowledge of majd experiences and had never been to ramallah.she explained the usual procedure at security checkpoints and suggested that any vehicle that attempted to evade a checkpoint would be fired upon.
after hearing this evidence,the ij denied majd applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under cat but granted him voluntary departure,allowing him sixty days to leave the country of his own accord the ij ordered majd forcibly removed to israel if he did not depart during that period.
the ij determined that although majd was credible,the mistreatment he suffered did not constitute persecution on account of one of the five statutory grounds that rendered an individual eligible for asylum withholding of removal.the ij found that the harm inflicted on majd did not rise to the level of torture,so relief under cat was unavailable.
majd appealed to the bia,contending that the ij erred in denying him relief,that the rejection of his request for relief contravenes the convention relating to the status of refugees,and that the united states handling of palestinian asylum claims such as his violates the abc settlement agreement,which arose out of a class action lawsuit by immigrants of certain nationalities against the immigration authorities.the bia affirmed without opinion.majd petitions for review.
generally,we have authority to review only the decision of the bia,but where,as here,the bia summarily affirms the ij decision without opinion,we review the ij decision.see mikhael ins,cir.although we review the legal conclusions of the bia and the ij de novo,see,we review their factual findings for substantial evidence.see zhang gonzales,cir.under the substantial evidence standard,reversal of the ij is improper unless we decide not only that the evidence supports a contrary conclusion,but also that the evidence compels it.id.at quoting zhao gonzales,cir.the alien bears the burden of proving the requisite compelling nature of the evidence.see chun ins,cir.
