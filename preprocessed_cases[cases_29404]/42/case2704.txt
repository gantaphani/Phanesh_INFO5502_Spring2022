on december,the district court for the eastern district of wisconsin determined that anton tittjung position as a nazi concentration camp guard during world war ii invalidated his previously issued visa.therefore,the court revoked tittjung citizenship and cancelled his certificate of naturalization.this court affirmed that decision.on march,the immigration court ordered the deportation of tittjung,pursuant to the holtzman amendment,a d formerly a d.the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the immigration court decision,and this court affirmed the decision of the bia.on january,almost six years after his deportation was first ordered,tittjung filed a motion to dismiss,pursuant to.b,seeking to vacate the district court order.the district court denied tittjung motion to dismiss.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm the district court decision.
background 
anton tittjung was born in erdud,yugoslavia on november.beginning in october of,and for the duration of world war ii,tittjung served in the waffen ss,an organization of the nazi government.specifically,tittjung was a member of the totenkopf sturmbann death head battalion,where he operated as an armed guard at the mauthausen concentration camp and its subcamp gross raming 
in,tittjung applied for and obtained a visa to enter the united states pursuant to the displaced persons act of dpa.at no point during the application process did tittjung disclose his association with the ss death head battalion nor his participation in nazi persecution as a concentration camp guard.tittjung applied for naturalization in,once again concealing his nazi wartime service.on january,tittjung was naturalized and became a citizen of the united states.
on september,the government filed a complaint against tittjung asking the district court for the eastern district of wisconsin to revoke tittjung citizenship.the request for revocation was based on evidence which revealed tittjung history as a member of the waffen ss and an armed concentration camp guard at mauthausen and gross raming.the government moved for summary judgment,arguing that nazi concentration camp guards were ineligible for visas under the dpa,and that as a result,tittjung citizenship was illegally procured.on december,the district court granted the government motion.see tittjung.at.the court held that as a concentration camp guard,tittjung had assisted in the persecution of persons because of their race,religion,or national origin.because the dpa,as amended in,made all persons who assisted nazi germany in the persecution of civilian populations of countries ineligible for visas,tittjung was ineligible for a visa when he entered the united states.to be eligible for naturalization,a person must have been lawfully admitted into the united states with a valid immigration visa.see a.the court determined that because tittjung visa was invalid,he was never lawfully admitted into the united states.since tittjung had not satisfied the prerequisites for naturalization,the court revoked his citizenship,set aside its january,order admitting tittjung to citizenship,and cancelled tittjung certification of naturalization.see tittjung.at.because tittjung guard service required his denaturalization as a matter of law,the district court did not address allegations that tittjung misrepresented his world war ii service to visa officials and thereby entered the united states by means of fraud.id.at.this court affirmed the district court order in an opinion dated november,cir,and the supreme court thereafter denied certiorari,d.
as a result of the district court decision,tittjung reverted to alien status and was thus removable.on may,the government commenced deportation proceedings against tittjung.the immigration court,on march,ordered tittjung deportation pursuant to the holtzman amendment tittjung appealed the decision of the immigration court to the bia.on august,the bia affirmed the deportation order and dismissed tittjung appeal.tittjung then filed a motion for reconsideration,which the bia denied on august.on december,this court affirmed the bia decision.tittjung reno,at,reh g denied.on june,the supreme court denied certiorari,d.
faced with an imminent deportation,tittjung filed a motion with the district court for the eastern district of wisconsin,seeking to vacate the denaturalization judgment and dismiss the complaint.tittjung argued that the judgment was void under.b on the ground that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.on april,that motion was denied by the district court.tittjung now appeals,arguing that there is no article iii jurisdiction to redetermine visa eligibility,and on that basis find that tittjung was not lawfully admitted when he was granted citizenship it is an unconstitutional encroachment into an executive function for the judiciary to redetermine visa eligibility since the dpa is no longer in effect,the district court can not make a finding of visa ineligibility and unlawful admission based on that law the court had to make certain factual findings,including that tittjung made a misrepresentation in order to obtain a visa,before it could hold that he illegally obtained a visa and was thus not lawfully admitted.
ii.discussion 
rule b standard of review 
tittjung present motion challenges the jurisdiction of the district court for the eastern district of wisconsin to determine that he was visa ineligible when he entered the united states in.no court may decide a case without subject matter jurisdiction,and neither the parties nor their lawyers may stipulate to jurisdiction or waive arguments that the court lacks jurisdiction.see christianson colt indus.operating,d indiana gas home ins,cir see also united states county of cook,cir.to further that end,it is the duty of this court to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction,but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review.eeoc chicago club,cir citing mitchell maurer.therefore,if the parties neglect the subject,a court must raise the jurisdictional question on its own.christianson,at.however,in unexceptional circumstances,a party that has had an opportunity to litigate the question of subject matter jurisdiction may not reopen that question in a collateral attack following an adverse judgment.see insurance of ireland,compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d.
the exception to the general rule barring collateral attacks on subject matter jurisdiction flows from.b yet that exception is narrowly tailored,such that a lack of subject matter jurisdiction will not always render a final judgment void.only when the jurisdictional error is egregious will courts treat the judgment as void.in re edwards,cir.to be egregious,and thus void under rule b,the error must involve a clear usurpation of judicial power,where the court wrongfully extends its jurisdiction beyond the scope of its authority.see,nesbitt burns,cir edwards,at kansas city southern ry.great lakes carbon,cir.if it is not egregious,the courts say that the court that issued the judgment in excess of its jurisdiction had jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction,and its jurisdictional finding,even if erroneous,is therefore good against collateral attack,like any other erroneous but final judgment.edwards,at.here,the district court did not find any jurisdictional errors let alone egregious ones.we review de novo the denial of a motion to vacate a judgment as void under.b.federal election comm al salvi for senate,cir.
tittjung jurisdictional arguments 
the district court jurisdiction to review a visa 
tittjung overarching claim on appeal is that a district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to review a visa eligibility determination and on that basis vacate an order of naturalization.we note at the outset that tittjung status as visa eligible has been at issue in article iii proceedings for approximately eleven years to date.to say that tittjung has had ample opportunity to raise this issue is to understate the matter.moreover,tittjung has previously admitted that the courts do have jurisdiction to examine his visa eligibility.the original complaint,filed in,specifically alleged that the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to original jurisdiction over all civil actions brought by the government and a jurisdiction to revoke citizenship.tittjung admitted that allegation,and has never challenged the district court determination that it had jurisdiction,either in this court or in the supreme court.therefore,unless an error of the aforementioned egregious nature has been made,res judicata bars tittjung claim.see county of cook,at.
we begin with a.that statute expressly confers jurisdiction upon district courts to decide suits brought to revoke citizenship illegally procured.specifically,the statute reads in relevant part that 
it shall be the duty of the united states attorney for the respective districts,upon affidavit showing good cause therefor,to institute proceedings in any district court of the united states in the judicial district in which the naturalized citizen may reside at the time of bringing suit,for the purpose of revoking and setting aside the order admitting such person to citizenship and cancelling the certificate of naturalization on the ground that such order and certificate of naturalization were illegally procured or were procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation,and such revocation and setting aside of the order admitting such person to citizenship and such canceling of certificate of naturalization shall be effective as of the original date of the order and certificate,respectively 
tittjung argues that a is inapplicable to his situation,as he did not illegally procure his citizenship.according to tittjung,if any illegality took place,it was at the visa procurement phase,when tittjung did not disclose his service as a concentration camp guard.yet those actions,he urges,are in effect shielded from review,as he claims that his certificate of naturalization was based on compliance with all applicable provisions.thus,when the district court in determined tittjung to be visa ineligible and therefore revoked his citizenship,the court,he suggests,traveled beyond the scope granted by a.
we do not believe,nor have we found any case law to suggest that a certificate of naturalization acts as a tabula rasa,thereby precluding us from examining the validity of the visa upon which that certificate was granted.to begin with,supreme court precedent forecloses that argument.in fedorenko united states,the court was called upon to decide whether fedorenko citizenship was illegally procured,and therefore subject to revocation,d.as in the case of tittjung,fedorenko entered the united states under the dpa,was naturalized years later,and was having his citizenship challenged on the basis that his service as a concentration camp guard rendered him visa ineligible.see id.at.t he government was seeking to revoke petitioner citizenship because of the alleged unlawfulness of his initial entry into the united states.after the court determined that fedorenko world war ii service made him ineligible for a visa,it perceived the resolution of the case to be fairly straightforward.id.at.justice marshall,writing for the court noted that supreme court cases have established that a naturalized citizen failure to comply with statutory prerequisites for naturalization renders his certificate of citizenship revocable as illegally procured under a.id.the court observed that the statutory prerequisites required that the individual be lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent residence,and that lawful admission for permanent residence in turn required that the individual possess a valid unexpired immigrant visa.id.at.see also a.because the dpa excluded from the definition of displaced persons eligible for immigration to this country those who had assisted the enemy in persecuting civil ians or had voluntarily assisted the enemy forces in their operations,ch,stat,amended by,ch,stat,fedorenko visa,granted under the dpa,was invalid at the time of issuance.thus,the court found that a provides a federal court with jurisdiction to make a determination of visa eligibility at the time of entrance into the united states and revocation of citizenship based on a finding of visa ineligibility.
we find that supreme court precedent controls and forecloses the type of claim that tittjung now raises.in addition,though we have not to this point expressly addressed this type of jurisdictional argument,we find our previous decisions upholding the revocation of naturalization certificates based on visa ineligibility to be de facto confirmation that tittjung argument is meritless.as stated above,i t is the duty of this court to satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction,but also that of the lower courts in a cause under review,eeoc,at,such that if the parties neglect the subject,a court must raise the jurisdictional question on its own,christianson,at.in united states schmidt,cir,as well as in united states ciurinskas,aff,cir and united states hajda,aff cir,we were faced with denaturalization orders based on determinations of visa ineligibility.that we reached the merits in those cases casts into doubt any suggestion that we do not believe there is jurisdiction to find visa ineligibility and thus revoke a certificate of naturalization 
as we have just noted,this specific subject matter jurisdiction argument has been resolved repeatedly.however,to the extent that previous decisions of this court may have left the matter unclear,we now state unequivocally that article iii courts have jurisdiction to vacate an order of naturalization when that order is based on an illegally obtained visa.here,tittjung status as a former concentration camp guard made him ineligible to receive a visa.fedorenko,at.therefore,when tittjung entered this country,he did so with an invalid visa.by entering this country with an invalid visa,tittjung failed to gain lawful admission to the united states.see a fedorenko,at.because tittjung could not be naturalized until he had first been lawfully admitted for permanent residence,see a,his citizenship was illegally procured.thus,the district court had the power to revoke his certificate of naturalization and cancel his citizenship.see a.consequently,we agree with the court below that there was no jurisdictional error,let alone an egregious one,in the actions of the district court.
separation of powers and jurisdiction 
in addition to the primary subject matter jurisdiction contention set forth above,tittjung presents a number of arguments which he believes negate any federal jurisdiction conferred by a.tittjung first such argument is that the district court redetermination of visa eligibility and declaration that admission was unlawful is an unconstitutional judicial encroachment into an exclusive executive function and it violates the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.for support to his argument,tittjung looks to language in the immigration and nationality act of et act.under section a the attorney general shall be charged with the administration and enforcement of this chapter and all other laws relating to the immigration and naturalization of aliens additionally,tittjung cites to section c,which empowers the commissioner of immigration with any and all responsibilities of the attorney general that the attorney general delegates to her,and section a,which charges the secretary of state with the administration and enforcement of the act and other laws except those powers,duties,and functions conferred upon the consular officers relating to the granting and refusal of visas.thus,tittjung puts forth that article iii courts are without jurisdiction to proceed in reviewing visas and cancelling certificates of naturalization based on their findings of visa ineligibility.
tittjung argument is without merit.while tittjung is correct that our system does delegate specific powers to specific branches of government,he fails to acknowledge that ours is a system of checks and balances.under article,section of the united states constitution,congress is empowered to establish standards for immigration.the act delegates to the executive branch,and specifically the attorney general,the powers of administration and enforcement.in such a situation,t he courts,when a case or controversy arises,can always ascertain whether the will of congress has been obeyed and can enforce adherence to statutory standards.see immigration and naturalization service chadha,d citing yakus united states.and youngstown sheet tube sawyer.the court in fedorenko acknowledged this mandated interplay between the branches as well as the power of article iii courts to review lawful admissions.justice marshall,writing for the court noted this judicial insistence on strict compliance with the statutory conditions precedent to naturalization is simply an acknowledgment of the fact that congress alone has the constitutional authority to prescribe rules for naturalization,and the courts task is to assure compliance with the particular prerequisites to the acquisition of united states citizenship by naturalization legislated to safeguard the integrity of this priceless treasure.fedorenko,at.internal quotation omitted.
we stated above that article iii courts do have the power,in the course of determining whether the statutory prerequisites for naturalization have been met,to examine visa eligibility.were we to hold that separation of powers bars examination of visa eligibility by article iii courts,we would be substantially limiting the impact of.contrary to tittjung assertion,the fact that congress delegated authority to the executive to oversee matters of immigration does not mean that the attorney general was provided with exclusive control for the entire area.section a allows for the district courts to,among other things,revoke or set aside certificates of naturalization which are based on compliance with statutory prerequisites such as a valid visa.furthermore,congress recognized that the judiciary and the executive would both make denaturalization decisions.it is for that reason that h provides that nothing contained in this section shall be regarded as limiting,denying,or restricting the power of the attorney general to correct,reopen,alter,modify,or vacate an order naturalizing the person.given this limitation on the power of the judiciary,the district court was correct to determine that the revocation of tittjung naturalization does not substantially or unconstitutionally infringe on the attorney general authority thus we find no jurisdictional defect,egregious or otherwise in the district court actions.
expiration of the dpa and jurisdiction 
tittjung next argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider his unlawful entry in because the immigration act of and the dpa the laws pursuant to which he was granted his visa were no longer in effect at the time of his naturalization in.specifically,tittjung claims that because these statutes did not exist and were not considered when the milwaukee court entered its citizenship order in,it was nonsensical for the district court to reference and apply those laws during the denaturalization proceedings in support of his position,tittjung cites to ex parte mccardle,where the court determined that the passage of a bill repealing the portion of a statute that conferred appellate jurisdiction on the supreme court over habeas proceedings meant that the court no longer had jurisdiction to hear mccardle appeal.wall.
what,then,is the effect of the repealing act upon the case before us we can not doubt as to this.without jurisdiction the court can not proceed at all in any cause.jurisdiction is power to declare the law,and when it ceases to exist,the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.and this is not less clear upon authority than upon principle.
tittjung position lacks merit.throughout his argument,tittjung goes to great lengths to suggest that his naturalization should not be tied to whether he lawfully procured his visa.rather,he suggests the relevant factor to be that he complied with the statutory prerequisites to naturalization.while we have noted that the district court had jurisdiction to revoke tittjung certificate of naturalization after determining that he was visa ineligible as a matter of law,we have never wavered from our understanding that the basis for the determination that tittjung was removable was that he was never lawfully admitted to this country,a required prerequisite to naturalization under.that statute,which is ultimately the relevant one for purposes of determining naturalization,was in effect in when tittjung was naturalized as well as when this denaturalization case was brought and decided 
in addition,the supreme court analysis in fedorenko makes clear that lawful admission is based on circumstances as they existed at the time of initial entry.the court,in denaturalizing fedorenko,looked to the law that existed when he first entered the united states.lawful admission for permanent residence in turn required that the individual possess a valid unexpired immigrant visa.at the time of petitioner initial entry into this country,a of the immigration and nationality act of,ch,stat,repealed in,provided that n o immigrant shall be admitted to the united states unless he has an unexpired immigration visa fedorenko,at.applying tittjung present argument would mandate the conclusion that the court in fedorenko erred by revoking a naturalization because the law that allowed for the initial entry of the defendant was no longer in effect at the time of the denaturalization.we do not believe it would be proper to reach such a conclusion.
not only would granting tittjung argument require us to challenge supreme court precedent,but doing so would also erode a large portion of a.the dpa was in existence for four years from.the statutory prerequisite for naturalization is five years of continuous legal residence in the united states.therefore,no person could have been admitted to the united states under the dpa and been naturalized within the period of the law existence.as such,according to tittjung position,denaturalization proceedings under a could never be brought against one who entered under the dpa.given that the dpa was intended to prevent those who contributed to the nazi persecution of innocent civilians from obtaining visas to enter the united states as refugees,schmidt,at,it would seem anomalous that the law provides uncontestable permanent residence for those who illegally circumvented it.for these reasons,we conclude that the district court committed no error in cancelling tittjung naturalization which was based on illegal entry under the dpa.
factual findings as prerequisites to jurisdiction 
tittjung posits that even if this court does not agree that his previous arguments negate federal jurisdiction,the district court omission of certain factual findings precludes a determination that tittjung illegally procured his citizenship.the court below found this argument to be a substantive one which is precluded by res judicata and can not be grafted upon a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.yet,in support of the proposition that certain factual findings are within the scope of a rule b review on subject matter jurisdiction,tittjung cites to language in fedorenko which states that in the lexicon of our cases,one of the jurisdictional facts upon which the grant of citizenship is predicated,was missing at the time petitioner became a citizen.at.internal quotation omitted.as we noted above,the term jurisdiction has so many uses that it is commonplace for confusion to ensue regarding the term.see united states krilich,cir see also steel,at.while we express doubt that this argument of tittjung is jurisdictional such that it properly comes within the scope of our review of a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,we assume arguendo that it does and proceed to analyze the claim.
tittjung asserts that the district court was required to find that tittjung made a material misrepresentation under dpa,and that the invalid visa resulted in an unlawful admission,in order to find that tittjung illegally procured his citizenship.we do not dispute that the language of of the dpa states that any person who shall willfully make a representation for
