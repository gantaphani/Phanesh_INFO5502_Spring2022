emmanuel tango sandie petitions for review of a board of immigration appeals bia decision denying him asylum.sandie claims he has a fear of persecution.he alleges that a secret group,the wonde poro society,will kill him,if he returns to his native sierra leone,because he refuses to become their supreme leader.alternatively,if he were to acquiesce and become supreme leader of this group,he claims that he would be tortured and forced to commit murder as part of its leadership initiation ritual.the bia affirmed the immigration judge ij determination that sandie failed to corroborate his story and so failed to carry his burden of proof.because the bia committed no error in reviewing the ij corroboration determination,we will deny sandie petition.
sandie successfully moved to stay his removal while his petition for review was pending.subsequently,sandie sought clarification that his motion to stay removal implicitly included a request to stay the voluntary departure period.because removal and voluntary departure are different measures implicating different equities,we hold that a request to stay a voluntary departure period is not implicit in a motion to stay removal.accordingly,we will deny sandie the relief he seeks.
sandie is a citizen and native of sierra leone.he arrived in the united states in december to attend high school for one semester,entering as a visitor with authorization to remain until june.sandie remained in the united states beyond that date.on march,he applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection pursuant to the convention against torture cat.
in april,the department of homeland security initiated removal proceedings against sandie.before the immigration court,sandie conceded removability and renewed his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under cat.
the ij heard sandie testify in support of his application on november.she denied sandie application on march,finding that sandie testimony was not credible and that,even if his testimony were viewed as weak instead of not credible,he failed to meet his burden of proof due to a lack of reliable evidence to corroborate his testimony.at the same time,the ij granted sandie request to depart voluntarily from the united states.
sandie appealed the ij decision denying his application for asylum.on february,the bia affirmed the ij determination that sandie failed to corroborate his story so that even if sandie testimony were presumed credible,he did not meet his burden of proof.the bia also concluded that sandie had not established that his refusal to become the supreme leader of the wonde poro society was cognizable as a political opinion under the immigration and nationality act,which requires fear of persecution based on race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.this petition for review followed 
we have jurisdiction to review final orders of the bia under.the bia focused its review on the ij determination that sandie failed to meet his burden of proof with evidence corroborating his testimony.because the ij corroboration discussion and determinations are affirmed and partially reiterated in the bia decision,we review them along with the bia decision.see guan gonzales,cir where the bia agrees with the ij conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and,without rejecting any of the ij grounds for decision,emphasizes particular aspects of that decision,we will review both the bia and ij more precisely,we review the ij decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the bia.internal citations omitted see also korytnyuk ashcroft,cir w hile the final order we review is that of the bia t here are some situations in which a court of appeals effectively reviews an ij decision internal quotation marks and citation omitted chen ashcroft,cir inasmuch as the bia deferred to the ij credibility determinations and adopted the reasons the ij set forth,we have authority to review both determinations.xie ashcroft,cir t he bia also appears to have substantially relied upon the adverse credibility finding of the ij.accordingly,we have jurisdiction to review both the bia and ij opinions.the bia expressly stated,however,that it would not address the ij finding that sandie testimony was not credible.consequently,we have no credibility determination to review and we will assume that sandie testimony is credible.kayembe ashcroft,cir.
under b a,the secretary of homeland security and the attorney general have the discretionary power to grant asylum to a person who qualifies as a refugee.a refugee is any person who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself of the protection of,his country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion a a.sandie contends he qualifies for refugee status because he has a fear of persecution on account of a political opinion.he alleges a secret wonde poro society will kill him in sierra leone because he refuses to become their supreme leader.
to establish the existence of a fear of persecution,an applicant must prove an objectively reasonable possibility of statutorily cognizable persecution,leia ashcroft,cir,and that the applicant professed fear is genuine,lusingo gonzales,cir.that means he must demonstrate his professed fear is objectively reasonable and not merely subjective,and that this fear is rooted in persecution recognized by a a.
we review factual findings,including findings of persecution and fear of persecution,under the substantial evidence standard.toure att y,cir.under this deferential standard,findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b see also ins,d to reverse the bia finding we must find that the evidence not only supports that conclusion,but compels also compels the further conclusion that had a fear that the guerrillas would persecute him because of that political opinion.t he overriding consideration here must be the extraordinarily deferential standard mandated by.chen,at internal quotation omitted.
we review legal conclusions de novo.smriko ashcroft,cir.
sandie cites miah ashcroft,cir,to argue that,as a matter of law,the bia must review the ij credibility determination before affirming the ij conclusion that sandie did not meet his burden of proof.according to sandie,the credibility determination is a necessary predicate to the corroboration determination.he claims that a credibility assessment controls the quality and quantity of additional evidence needed to meet the burden of proof.
in miah,the bia had expressly repudiated the ij adverse credibility determination,yet essentially adopted the ij corroboration findings.id.at.we explained 
t estimony found to be incredible by the ij was transformed into credible testimony by the bia.however,the bia does not explain how the transformation affects the degree of corroboration now required for miah to sustain his burden of proof.in other words,now that miah is deemed to be a credible asylum applicant,which of the events on which he bases his claim must he now corroborate and to what degree is the level of corroboration the same as when his testimony was deemed incredible 
id.we concluded that the bia should have conducted an independent analysis of corroboration because the ij corroboration ruling was informed by its adverse credibility determination.id.
miah does not apply here.first,the bia has not transformed sandie incredible testimony into credible testimony.the bia simply did not reach the ij credibility finding.second,unlike in miah,the ij determination that sandie failed to meet his burden of proof with evidence corroborating his story does not depend on her adverse credibility finding the ij corroboration determination was separate and independent from that finding.
the ij denied sandie application for two alternative reasons.on one hand,the ij held that even if sandie testimony were deemed credible,sandie would have to corroborate his story and he failed to do so.on the other hand,the ij explai
