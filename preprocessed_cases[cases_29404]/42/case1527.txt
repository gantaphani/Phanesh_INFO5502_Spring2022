kaixiang zhu was convicted by a jury of conspiring to commit immigration fraud,see,and aiding and abetting fraud and misuse of immigration documents,see a,charges stemming from a green card sting operation.zhu appeals his conviction on various grounds.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
zhu,a native of china,entered the united states in february using a visa authorized for nonimmigrant exchange visitors although his j visa authorized only a temporary stay until august,zhu overstayed his visa and remained in the united states without authorization.zhu subsequently married xiu yun lu,a fellow chinese citizen he had met in the united states.in,zhu wife unsuccessfully attempted to adjust her status to permanent legal resident,and an order of removal to china was entered against her.likewise,ming hui lu,zhu and housemate,applied to adjust his status,but his application was denied and an order of removal was entered against him.
in,federal agents commenced a sting operation in which officer mark butler,who was operating undercover,posed as a private business owner offering to sell bona fide green cards which had been obtained illegally.officer butler,known to his contacts as andrew,claimed that he had a relationship with american immigration officials through whom he could obtain green cards to sell,but andrew indicated the price would be exorbitant at least apiece,and sometimes even in excess of.in this scheme,andrew did not deal directly with individuals who wanted to obtain a green card without having to go through the proper legal channels instead,he used brokers both to identify potential customers in their communities and to communicate with them.the brokers were also tasked with bringing their customers to virginia for a meeting with andrew,which law enforcement agents secretly recorded.
zhu was brought into the green card scheme by chang yun hui hui,an acquaintance from new york who was a broker for andrew.hui spoke very little english but,according to officer butler,he always had someone to translate at hand.their primary form of communication,however,was via email.andrew told hui that the green cards were very expensive and explained that they were real green cards obtained fraudulently,and that they could all go to jail if they did do things exactly the right way.officer butler testified that he wanted to have the price so high that people knew it was illegal.
in order to obtain one of the green cards offered by andrew,purchasers were required to provide certain documents to hui,who would submit them to andrew.zhu gave hui a copy of his chinese passport,two passport photos,and a form to adjust status,which was filled out in english and in zhu handwriting.zhu form was incomplete and contained several misstatements,including,for example,zhu assertion that he was applying with his wife to adjust status.likewise,lu,zhu,and qiao chan zhang,zhu,sought to purchase green cards from andrew and provided passports and form applications to hui.like zhu form,the forms submitted by lu and zhang contained misstatements and omissions.hui sent zhu paperwork,along with the documents provided by lu and zhang,to andrew.andrew then asked hui to bring his customers from new york to virginia purportedly to meet andrew and to be fingerprinted for their green cards.
in august,hui accompanied zhu,lu and zhang,and other customers to the crystal city hilton in virginia.hui brought his customers in small groups to a room rented by andrew,which,unbeknownst to hui and his customers,was wired for audio and video recording.during each meeting,andrew explained to the customers that this is an i mmigration office and that what we are doing is not legal.we can all go to jail.andrew provided several warnings to inform them that this is dangerous,and illegal.nevertheless,zhu permitted andrew to fingerprint him.
for several months after the meeting,andrew and hui exchanged emails about the status of the green cards.in april,andrew sent an email to hui,suggesting that he relax and that he was working on all the stuff you ask for.t hese people need to realize that this is illegal and does work like it would if you go into the immigration office.on april,hui responded,listing customers,including zhu,that still wanted to pay andrew for green cards 
i got your email,please do your best to help them do what they want,i will tell them to wait for your good news.thank you the other cards please follow this order to give them mingxian chen,qiaochan zhang,baodi hu,yingjiao yang,meixia tian,kaiyang zhu,xiuqing wu,xuejiang chen,jinjian lin,jianling lin,jinshun zhu,yuewen zheng,wu lin.please reply thank you 
emphasis added.
finally,in june,hui and his customers were told that the green cards were ready and that they could pick them up in exchange for cash at a hotel in manassas,virginia.zhu,however,was not among the customers who appeared in virginia to purchase a green card,and neither were his lu or his zhang.the customers who appeared in virginia were arrested.
hui was also arrested and charged in connection with the immigration fraud conspiracy.he cooperated with law enforcement agents,submitting to a interview about the green card scheme.agents prepared a report summarizing the details of hui interview which reflected his clear understanding that the means by which he and his customers were obtaining green cards was illegal.according to the report,hui explained that andrew told him hui that he could get the green cards and that he hui knew the process in obtaining green cards was illegal and hui indicated andrew did not mention about the clients green cards being obtained through fraudulent means,but that he hui understood the paperwork for the green cards was not legitimate.hui also acknowledged that he knew it was an illegal process to the documents,and that he knew that taking fingerprints was part of the process of obtaining the green card through fraud.
the report,however,contained a contradictory remark attributed to hui.the report stated that hui specifically identified four customers,including zhu lu and zhang,whom he told that they were obtaining the green cards legally 
hui stated that he advised the four individuals that andrew way of obtaining the green cards was legal and that the green cards are real green cards.hui stated that he knew the legal process to obtain green cards was by applying through citizenship and immigration services cis hui stated that he hui did not think that the green card itself was fraudulent,but knew that the process in obtaining the green card was illegal.hui stated he needed a green card himself and that he knew andrew way of obtaining one was not the proper way.
emphasis added.according to the report,hui did not mention zhu specifically during his interview with the agents.hui pled guilty and was sentenced to fourteen months incarceration.on june,following his release from prison,hui was removed to china.
in,zhu and lu were apprehended in arkansas zhang remained at large at the time of zhu trial.zhu was charged with conspiracy to commit immigration fraud,see,and aiding and abetting the fraud and misuse of immigration documents,see a.prior to trial,zhu moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis that,by removing hui,the government deported a witness material and favorable to zhu defense.the district court denied zhu motion,concluding that zhu had not shown that hui testimony would have been material and favorable to the defense in ways not merely cumulative to the testimony of available witnesses.zhu also moved before and during trial to exclude from evidence an april,email from hui to andrew listing hui customers who were interested in purchasing a green card after the meeting with andrew.the district court disagreed and admitted hui email.after a jury trial,zhu was convicted on both counts.
on appeal,zhu challenges the denial of these motions as well as the district court frequent interruptions of defense counsel examination of witnesses and argument to the jury.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
zhu contends that the removal of hui violated his right to compulsory process under the sixth amendment and his right to a fair trial under the due process clause of the fifth amendment.the appropriate remedy,according to zhu,was dismissal of the indictment.thus,zhu argues the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss.we review a district court legal conclusions with respect to a motion to dismiss the indictment de novo,and its factual findings for clear error.see united states perry,cir.
prior to trial,zhu moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis that,by removing hui,the government deported a witness material and favorable to zhu defense.pointing to a statement in the government report that hui advised four specified individuals that andrew way of obtaining the green cards was legal,zhu argued that,had he appeared as a witness,hui would have testified that he advised all of his customers,including zhu,that his way of obtaining the green cards was legal.zhu primary defense at trial was that he lacked criminal intent that he believed he was legally applying for a green card.thus,zhu contended that hui testimony bears directly on the intent element of the charges against zhu,and that the government knew this but removed hui anyway.
the district court denied zhu motion,concluding that zhu had not shown that hui testimony would have been material and favorable to the defense in ways not merely cumulative to the testimony of available witnesses.the court found no basis in the record to conclude that hui would have testified that he made a similar statement that obtaining green cards in this fashion was legal to all of the customers instead of just to that group of four.moreover,the district court concluded that hui testimony on criminal intent would be cumulative to the testimony of other available witnesses,in light of the fact that zhu was available to testify about what zhu was told about the legality of obtaining the green card through hui.and,finally,the district court reasoned that even if hui appeared and testified as zhu claimed,his testimony,viewed in the context of the entire record,was not reasonably likely to affect the judgment of the jury.
the sixth amendment states that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.const.amend.vi.in united states,the supreme court made clear that this right is implicated by the deportation of an alien whom a criminal defendant wants to call as a witness at trial.the court explained what a defendant must show to establish a sixth amendment claim under the compulsory process clause 
t he right to compulsory process guaranteed by the sixth amendment suggests that more than the mere absence of testimony is necessary to establish a violation of the right.indeed,the sixth amendment does not by its terms grant to a criminal defendant the right to secure the attendance and testimony of any and all witnesses it guarantees him compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor this language suggests that respondent can not establish a violation of his constitutional right to compulsory process merely by showing that deportation of witnesses deprived him of their testimony.he must at least make some plausible showing of how their testimony would have been both material and favorable to his defense.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
of course,the removal of potential witnesses deprives the defendant of an opportunity to interview the witnesses to determine precisely what favorable evidence they possess,and thus the defendant can not be expected to render a detailed description of their lost testimony.id.at.nonetheless,the defendant must make some showing of materiality.accordingly,a defendant raising a compulsory process claim must make a plausible showing that the testimony of the deported witnesses would have been material and favorable to his defense,in ways not merely cumulative to the testimony of available witnesses.id.
and,given the clarity of the prejudice requirement in,it is hardly surprising that the circuit courts of appeal unanimously require this showing of prejudice that resulted from the absence of the deported witness.see,united states gonzales,cir.this first prong is universal the defendant must show prejudice to his case.
a majority of the circuits read as establishing a second requirement as well that the government acted in bad faith in deporting a key witness,in a conscious effort to gain a tactical advantage by suppressing exculpatory evidence.see united states carmen,cir.united states damra,cir.united states,cir.united states,cir.
this court has not directly addressed whether requires a showing that the government deported a material witness in bad faith.the government urges us to adopt the bad faith requirement,premised on the court pronouncement in that immigration policy adopted by congress justifies the prompt deportation of witnesses upon the executive determination that they possess no evidence favorable to the defendant in a criminal prosecution.at.the district court found not a scintilla of evidence of bad faith.indeed,zhu is in this particular fix because of his own decision to flee arrest and live as a fugitive in another part of the country for more than two years.we doubt the government is required to keep a removable alien in the country indefinitely on the off chance that a fugitive from justice is discovered in the distant future and needs the alien as a trial witness.we need not reach the issue of whether bad faith is an element of a compulsory process claim,however,because,as explained below,we conclude that zhu failed to establish prejudice.
zhu argues that hui would have testified that he told his customers,including zhu,that he advised them that the green card scheme was legal.such testimony,zhu claims,would have been both material and favorable to his defense because the testimony bears directly on the intent element of each charge in the indictment and would have established that the first time zhu discovered the process was illegal was in the meeting in virginia with the undercover agents,and that at that meeting,he gave his fingerprints,but never,and never returned.brief of appellant at.
first,we note that zhu contention that hui would have furnished the defense material,favorable and exculpatory testimony rests on a thin reed.it is premised on a single sentence pulled from the government report of hui interview indicating that hui specified four customers whom he told that andrew way of obtaining the green cards was legal.lu was one of the four customers specified by hui,but zhu was not and there is nothing in the report to suggest that hui made a similar statement to every customer.indeed,apart from that single statement,hui repeatedly indicated during the interview that he understood andrew process for obtaining green cards was illegal.there is no basis in the record for concluding that hui would have testified that he told zhu their activities were legal.zhu argument is grounded in speculation,and he can not satisfy the materiality requirement with speculative evidence.united states shealey,cir.defendant must demonstrate actual prejudice,as opposed to mere speculative prejudice to be entitled to dismissal of indictment under due process clause of fifth amendment.
moreover,even if hui had appeared and testified that he stated to zhu that they were not illegally obtaining green cards,such testimony simply would not have been material and favorable to his defense,in ways not merely cumulative to the testimony of available witnesses,at.evidence is material only if there is a reasonable likelihood that the testimony could have affected the judgment of the trier of fact.id.at.materiality must be evaluated in the context of the entire record.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the report shows that hui was well aware of the illegality of obtaining green cards on the black market.zhu form contained numerous false statements regarding his employment status,how he entered the united states and the basis on which zhu claimed he was entitled to a green card.and,it is undisputed that zhu allowed his fingerprints to be taken even after having been warned that what he was doing was illegal and that he could do jail time for purchasing green cards.
zhu can not show that hui speculative testimony would not have been merely cumulative to the testimony of available witnesses.id.at.zhu contends that the report of the interview demonstrates that hui told all of his customers that obtaining a green card through him was legal.hui is not the only witness who could offer testimony as to what he informed his customers regarding the legality of the scheme.zhu lu was with zhu at the august,meeting when hui introduced zhu,lu and his other customers to andrew.lu would have been in a position to verify that hui told him and zhu that they were not breaking the law by obtaining the green cards outside of the uscis.zhu did not call lu as a witness,however,nor did zhu call any other individual who attempted to purchase a green card with hui assistance.because other witnesses could have provided the same testimony that zhu sought from hui,hui testimony was cumulative and therefore not material within the meaning of.
finally,to the extent that zhu styles this argument as a due process claim,we likewise reject it for the foregoing reasons.made clear that the same materiality requirement that applies to a compulsory process claim obtains with respect to a due process claim under the fifth amendment.id.at.to the extent a criminal defendant claims that the deportation of a witness was so fundamentally unfair that it fatally infected the trial,his claim fails unless there is some explanation of how the witnesses testimony would have been favorable and material.id.
zhu next argues that the district court erred in admitting into evidence the april email from hui providing andrew a list of customers,including zhu,who still wanted to obtain a green card after meeting andrew.on appeal,zhu focuses on two grounds for excluding the email there was insufficient evidence to establish the authenticity of the email under rule of the federal rules of evidence and the email contained inadmissible hearsay in violation of rule.the district court denied zhu motion to exclude,and zhu renewed these objections at trial when the government moved to admit the email.we review a district court decision to admit evidence over a rule or rule objection for abuse of discretion.see united states cornell,cir.admission of evidence over rule objection was not abuse of discretion united states bumpass,cir.admission of evidence over hearsay objection reviewed for abuse of discretion.
first,zhu argues that the government could not properly authenticate hui email of april,as required by rule.under rule,t o satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence,the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.fed.evid.a.it is up to the jury to decide whether evidence is that which the proponent claims.united states vidacak,cir.it is t he district court role to serve as gatekeeper in assessing whether the proponent has offered a satisfactory foundation from which the jury could reasonably find that the evidence is authentic.id.the burden to authenticate under rule is not high only a prima facie showing is required.id.
zhu argues that there was significant doubt as to the authenticity of the email purportedly from hui,brief of appellant at,on april,in light of these facts the email was written in english hui spoke little or no english and used an unknown translator to help him write his emails to andrew a third party,liu,wrote an email on may,using hui email account and hui entire collection of emails were not signed the same way every time but used multiple versions of hui in closing.the government produced neither hui nor the translator to testify that hui did in fact author the emails and that they were translated correctly.the district court disagreed,however,and found enough evidence to meet the low threshold that must be met under rule,that this came from hui.the district court also concluded that even though we do know the identity of the interpreter,we do have any reason to doubt that it a reasonable interpretation of what hui was saying.he had,after all,a history and a series of transactions with the agent,and these are all relating to facts that hui and the agent knew about.
we agree with the district court that the government offered enough evidence for the jury to conclude that the email was what the government as the proponent claimed it was an email from hui listing customers,including zhu,who were still interested in obtaining green cards after the hotel meeting with the undercover agents in virginia.officer butler,who played the role of andrew in the sting,testified the april email was part of an email conversation between himself and hui.officer butler explained that hui email was sent from a secret address that only hui and i knew about,and contained information only he would know.this testimony is sufficient to clear the relatively low prima facie hurdle.the reasons identified by zhu to doubt the authenticity of the email go to its weight,not its admissibility,and counsel for zhu was free to highlight these deficiencies during cross examination of officer butler.the district court job was not to find that the evidence was necessarily what the proponent claim ed,but only that there was sufficient evidence that the jury ultimately might do so.vidacak,at internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the email over zhu rule objection.
we next turn to zhu hearsay objection.zhu contends that hui email contained two layers of hearsay.zhu argues that the april email contained hui statements offered for the truth of the matter asserted.the district court concluded that hui email qualified as the statements of a,and therefore was not hearsay.see fed.evid.d e excluding from the definition of hearsay a statement made by the party coconspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.zhu does not challenge this ruling on appeal.
zhu instead focuses his challenge on what he contends was a second layer of hearsay.because hui did not speak english,he received help from an unknown person or persons in communicating with andrew by email.thus,zhu contends that it was unknown whether the translator acted purely as a conduit for the language and thus it was the translator statement and not simply hui statement being offered by the government.brief of appellant at.
our analysis of whether an interpreter translation constituted hearsay is governed by vidacak,in which we considered whether the statements of an interpreter constituted hearsay where he was translating for a criminal defendant who was being interviewed by an immigration officer.see at.we explained that except in unusual circumstances,an interpreter is no more than a language conduit and therefore his translation does not create an additional level of hearsay.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.further,we recognized a narrow exception that is applied where the particular facts of a case cast significant doubt upon the accuracy of a translated confession.id.internal quotation marks omitted.see also united states shibin,cir.i nterpreted testimony might be unusable without the interpreter presence,if the particular facts of a case cast significant doubt upon the accuracy of a translated statement.internal quotation marks omitted.
in order to determine if this narrow exception applies,vidacak identifies four factors for district courts to consider which party supplied the interpreter whether the interpreter had a motive to mislead or distort the interpreter qualifications and language skills and whether actions taken subsequent to the conversation were consistent with the statements translated.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court recognized that it could not fully evaluate these four factors because the identity of hui translator was unknown.the court therefore directly examined the underlying question which these four factors were designed to help courts answer whether the particular circumstances of the case cast doubt on the accuracy
