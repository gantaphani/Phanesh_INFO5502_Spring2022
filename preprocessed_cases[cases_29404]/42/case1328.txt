opinion of the court 
this case presents an issue of first impression in this circuit and requires us to interpret the meaning of actions taken in section c of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat.for the reasons expressed below,we hold that actions taken refers to orders and decisions of an immigration judge ij or the board of immigration appeals bia which apply the aggravated felony definitions in a to determine the availability of hardship relief.because the bia final order denied petitioner dariusz biskupski relief on this basis,we conclude that the order was an action taken within the contemplation of section c.as such,the expanded definition in a for aggravated felonies applied to biskupski.accordingly,the petition for review will be denied.
in december,at age twenty nine,biskupski left his native poland and entered the united states.his visa allowed him to remain until june.however,biskupski overstayed his visa.as of january,biskupski worked as a taxi driver and dispatcher for a company in clifton,new jersey.during his off hours,he moonlighted as a chauffeur,making trips to the local airports and occasionally to points beyond such as washington,philadelphia,and areas within new england.he advertised his services almost exclusively within the local polish community.
after returning home from work on or about january,his told biskupski she had received a call to pick up several polish people in upstate new york and bring them to new jersey.biskupski and his girlfriend departed,their destination being a called the bear den on route,which is in the middle of the akwesasne indian reservation bordering canada in upstate new york.they arrived shortly after midnight on january and met the intended passengers.approximately eleven miles into the return trip,biskupski encountered a routine driving while intoxicated roadblock.state police stopped biskupski,and,after questioning him and his passengers,the police surmised that biskupski was transporting illegal aliens.although biskupski maintained that he did not know his passengers had illegally entered the united states,biskupski was arrested and charged with aiding and abetting alien smuggling,a misdemeanor violation of a a.he pleaded guilty and,on january,he was sentenced to thirty days imprisonment and a fine.
on january,the immigration and naturalization service ins placed biskupski in deportation proceedings by serving him with an order to show cause otsc.in the otsc,the government alleged that biskupski was deportable under a b remaining in the united states longer than permitted,a c i failing to maintain or comply with the conditions of nonimmigrant status under which he was admitted,and a e i knowingly assisting,aiding,or abetting another alien to enter illegally,within five years of his entry into the united states the government subsequently withdrew the allegation that biskupski was deportable under a e i,because the events supporting his conviction occurred more than five years after biskupski admission into the united states.
at an immigration hearing in newark,new jersey on december,the ij found that the government had established biskupski prior conviction by clear and convincing evidence.the ij accepted biskupski application for suspension of deportation,but queried,in light of the passage of iirira,whether biskupski conviction for alien smuggling would render him statutorily ineligible for suspension of deportation.the ij heard testimony from biskupski and his witnesses in support of his application for relief.however,the hearing was continued to permit the parties to address the legal issue of eligibility for suspension.for reasons that are not clear,biskupski case was not reconvened until july.the proceedings were again continued until the final hearing on august.
on april,the ij issued a written decision,superceding a prior oral decision.the ij ruled that biskupski conviction for alien smuggling rendered him ineligible for suspension of deportation and denied that application.the ij also denied biskupski applications for asylum,withholding of deportation and protection under the convention against torture cat biskupski appealed the ij decision to the bia.
on march,the bia dismissed the appeal,ruling that biskupski prior conviction under a a barred eligibility for relief under former section of the of the immigration and nationality act ina,under former section,an alien qualifies for discretionary suspension of deportation by demonstrating both physical presence in the united states for a continuous period of not less than seven years immediately preceding the date of application for such relief and good moral character.a.however,an alien who at any time has been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in subsection a of this section can not demonstrate the requisite good moral character.f.here,the bia found that biskupski conviction was for an aggravated felony as defined by a n.therefore,biskupski could not show the good moral character necessary to be eligible for suspension of deportation.this petition for review followed.
biskupski pleaded guilty to a,which states in pertinent part 
any person who,knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has not received prior official authorization to come to,enter,or reside in the united states,brings to or attempts to bring to the united states in any manner whatsoever,such alien,regardless of any official action which may later be taken with respect to such alien shall,for each alien in respect to whom a violation of this paragraph occurs 
a be fined in accordance with title or imprisoned not more than one year,or both.
this statute has been interpreted to include transporting illegal aliens from one place to another within the united states.see,yetter,cir citing matter of,i n bia.
when congress added the aggravated felony provision to the ina,stat.codified as amended at with the enactment of the abuse act of,pub,stat,the statutory definition of aggravated felony in a did not include offenses under a a or.in,when the ins commenced deportation proceedings against biskupski,his crime of conviction was still not among those constituting an aggravated felony within the meaning of the ina.
it was not until that congress enacted legislation making certain changes significant to biskupski situation.specifically,congress enacted the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,in which it amended the definition of aggravated felony in a n to include an offense described in paragraph a or of section a codified at a relating to alien smuggling for which the term of imprisonment is at least years.aedpa,e,stat.
shortly thereafter,congress enacted iirira,further amending a n by striking the minimum term of imprisonment requirement iirira,a,stat.at.congress expressly mandated that the changes made to the term aggravated felony in a applie d regardless of whether the conviction was entered before,on,or after the date of enactment of this paragraph.iirira,b,stat.at emphasis added.congress dictated that t he amendments made by this section shall apply to actions taken on or after the date of the enactment of this act,regardless of when the conviction occurred.iirira,c,stat.at emphasis added.
the term actions taken is not defined anywhere in iirira.biskupski argues that the term relates to such actions as the initiation of deportation proceedings against him in or the submission of his application for suspension of deportation on august,because these actions occurred,biskupski contends that the definitions of aggravated felony should apply,which did not encompass the crime for which he was convicted.at the other end of the temporal spectrum,the government argues that actions taken means final orders and decisions of the ij or the bia in adjudicating biskupski case.the government asserts that because the bia issued its final decision on march,the iirira amendments to the definition of aggravated felony apply to render biskupski ineligible for suspension relief.
we lack jurisdiction to review final orders of removal against an alien removable as an aggravated felon.a c drakes
