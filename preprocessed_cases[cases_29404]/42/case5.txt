after petitioner noel reyes mata,an unlawful resident alien,was convicted of assault in a texas court,an immigration judge ordered him removed to mexico.mata attorney filed a notice of appeal with the board of immigration appeals bia or board,but never filed a brief,and the appeal was dismissed.acting through different counsel,mata filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings,as authorized by statute.see c a.acknowledging that he had missed the deadline for such motions,see c c i,mata argued that his previous counsel ineffective assistance was an exceptional circumstance entitling him to equitable tolling of the time limit.but the bia disagreed and dismissed the motion as untimely.the bia also declined to reopen mata removal proceedings sua sponte based on its separate regulatory authority.see cfr a.on appeal,the fifth circuit construed mata equitable tolling claim as an invitation for the board to exercise its regulatory authority to reopen the proceedings sua sponte,and because circuit precedent forbids the court to review bia decisions not to exercise that authority dismissed mata appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
held the fifth circuit erred in declining to take jurisdiction over mata appeal.a court of appeals has jurisdiction to review the bia rejection of an alien motion to reopen.kucana holder.nothing about that jurisdiction changes where the board rejects a motion as untimely,or when it rejects a motion requesting equitable tolling of the time limit.that jurisdiction likewise remains unchanged if the bia denial also contains a separate decision not to exercise its sua sponte authority.so even assuming the fifth circuit is correct that courts of appeals lack jurisdiction to review bia decisions not to reopen cases sua sponte,that lack of jurisdiction does not affect jurisdiction over the decision on the alien motion to reopen.it thus follows that the fifth circuit had jurisdiction over this case.
the fifth circuit contrary decision rested on its construing mata motion as an invitation for the board to exercise its sua sponte discretion.amicus asserts that the fifth circuit recharacterization was based on the premise that equitable tolling in mata situation is categorically forbidden.in amicus view,the court construal was therefore an example of the ordinary practice of recharacterizing a doomed request as one for relief that may be available.but even if equitable tolling is prohibited,the fifth circuit action was not justified.if mata is not entitled to relief on the merits,then the correct disposition is to take jurisdiction and affirm the bia denial of his motion.for a court retains jurisdiction even if a litigant request for relief lacks merit,see steel citizens for better environment,and a federal court has a virtually unflagging obligation,colorado river water conservation dist.united states,to assert jurisdiction where it has that authority.nor can the established practice of recharacterizing pleadings so as to offer the possibility of relief justify an approach that,as here,renders relief impossible and sidesteps the judicial obligation to assert jurisdiction.

noel reyes mata,petitioner loretta lynch,attorney general 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice kagan delivered the opinion of the court.
an alien ordered to leave the country has a statutory right to file a motion to reopen his removal proceedings.see c a.if immigration officials deny that motion,a federal court of appeals has jurisdiction to consider a petition to review their decision.see kucana holder.notwithstanding that rule,the court below declined to take jurisdiction over such an appeal because the motion to reopen had been denied as untimely.we hold that was error.
the immigration and nationality act ina,stat,as amended,et,and its implementing regulations set out the process for removing aliens from the country.an immigration judge ij conducts the initial proceedings if he orders removal,the alien has the opportunity to appeal that decision to the board of immigration appeals bia or board.a,c.e very alien ordered removed also 
has a right to file one motion with the ij or board to reopen his or her removal proceedings.dada mukasey,see c a.subject to exceptions not relevant here,that motion to reopen shall be filed within days of the final removal order.c c i.finally,the bia regulations provide that,separate and apart from acting on the alien motion,the bia may reopen removal proceedings on its own motion or,in latin,sua sponte at any time.cfr a.
petitioner noel reyes mata is a mexican citizen who entered the united states unlawfully almost years ago.in,he was convicted of assault under the texas penal code.the federal department of homeland security dhs immediately initiated removal proceedings against him,and in august an ij ordered him removed.see app.mata lawyer then filed a notice of appeal with the bia,indicating that he would soon submit a written brief stating grounds for reversing the ij decision.but the attorney never filed the brief,and the bia dismissed the appeal in september.see app.
more than a hundred days later,mata by then represented by new counsel filed a motion with the board to reopen his case.dhs opposed the motion,arguing in part that mata had failed to file it,as the ina requires,within days of the board decision.mata responded that the motion was not time barred because his first lawyer ineffective assistance counted as an exceptional circumstance excusing his lateness.certified administrative record in.in addressing those arguments,the board reaffirmed prior decisions holding that it had authority to equitably toll the period in certain cases involving ineffective representation.see app.to pet.for cert.see also,in re santa celenia diaz,wl bia.but the board went on to determine that mata was not entitled to equitable tolling because he could not show prejudice from his attorney deficient performance accordingly,the board found mata motion untimely.see app.to pet.for cert.and in closing,the board decided as well that mata case was not one that would warrant reopening as an exercise of its sua sponte authority,at stating that the power to reopen on our own motion is not meant to be used as a general cure for filing defects internal quotation marks omitted.
mata petitioned the court of appeals for the fifth circuit to review the bia denial of his motion to reopen,arguing that he was entitled to equitable tolling.the fifth circuit,however,declined to address the merits of mata claim.reyes mata holder,fed.appx,per curiam.it stated instead that i n this circuit,an alien request to the bia for equitable tolling on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel is construed as an invitation for the bia to exercise its discretion to reopen the removal proceeding sua sponte.ibid.and circuit precedent held that courts have no jurisdiction to review the bia refusal to exercise its sua sponte power to reopen cases.see ibid.the court of appeals thus dismissed mata appeal for lack of jurisdiction.
every other circuit that reviews removal orders has affirmed its jurisdiction to decide an appeal,like mata,that seeks equitable tolling of the statutory time limit to file a motion to reopen a removal proceeding we granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.and because the federal government agrees with mata that the fifth circuit had jurisdiction over his appeal,we appointed an amicus curiae to defend the judgment below we now reverse.
as we held in kucana holder,circuit courts have jurisdiction when an alien appeals from the board denial of a
