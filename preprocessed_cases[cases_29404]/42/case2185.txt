nemer ahmad aoun appeals the denial of his motion to reopen and remand his application for suspension of deportation.the equities of the case warrant reversal of the board of immigration appeals denial and a remand for further proceedings.the board decision in this matter failed to take into consideration lengthy delays,including continuances and an administrative closure in the proceedings,that delayed a decision on aoun application for many years and ultimately prejudiced his ability to have his application for suspension of deportation decided before more stringent immigration rules came into effect.
aoun raises three issues on appeal whether the denial of the reopening of his application for suspension of deportation based on the stop time rule was error whether the board erred in failing to allow petitioner to apply for repapering and cancellation of removal and whether the board erred in denying petitioner application for asylum.
aoun entered the country legally from lebanon in october of on a student visa.aoun is a shiite muslim who,as a palestinian,describes himself as stateless.aoun graduated from the university of detroit in may with a degree in electrical engineering.in the winter of,he registered as a student at eastern michigan university with the intention of studying computer science,but dropped out for financial reasons.aoun therefore became deportable for failure to comply with the conditions of his status which required him to be a student if he wished to remain in this country legally.immigration and nationality act,a and a.aoun then contacted the ins seeking to adjust his status.he did not wish to return to lebanon because,among other things,the country was engaged in war at that time.
aoun claims that,upon contacting the ins,he was put in contact with john owens of the investigations unit of the ins.aoun claims that owens told him that his status could be adjusted if he helped the ins gather information about certain people,mostly fellow lebanese in the detroit area.in exchange for the assistance,the ins extended aoun visa on a basis.aoun claims that he was also in contact with the fbi and cia and that the cia asked him to attend local meetings of the palestine liberation organization and shiite muslim groups.he also claims he was asked to return to lebanon as an agent for the united states but he declined.when aoun lost his car and could no longer attend the meetings and gather information,the ins stopped the monthly renewal of his visa.see transcript of june,hearing.while we have no reason to doubt aoun testimony,most of the testimony concerning his work for the united states government is uncorroborated and not particularly relevant to our decision in this case except to highlight the role of the united states government in raising aoun expectations that by helping the government he would be able to remain in this country permanently.
in november,aoun sought asylum in the united states.he based his asylum application on the fact that he would be persecuted if returned to lebanon because he was a stateless person as a palestinian and because people in lebanon would know he provided information about fellow arabs to the united states government.his asylum application was denied in july and,one month later,in august,he was served with an order to show cause why he was not deportable.
at his deportation hearing on june,aoun withdrew his suspension of deportation application based on his attorney erroneous assumption that a one day trip by aoun to an amusement park in canada in broke aoun seven years of continual physical presence in the united states,a requirement for demonstrating eligibility for suspension of deportation aoun asylum application and application to withhold deportation were both denied on june,and aoun filed timely appeals to the board of immigration appeals.in december,aoun filed his appellate brief concerning the denial of his asylum application and the denial of his application to withhold deportation and,recognizing that the earlier withdrawal of the application for suspension of deportation had been based on an erroneous understanding of the law,moved to remand his case to afford him the opportunity to reapply for suspension of deportation.before the board ruled on the appeals,the proceedings were continued indefinitely so that aoun could pursue legalization.order of board of immigration appeals.the order stated that the appeals could be reinstated upon written request by either party.on january,the ins requested that the appeal be recalendared and reinstated because aoun had not filed for legalization by may,and,in any event,was ineligible because aoun was not out of status before january,as required by statute.a b.
the next document in the record before us is a motion to recalendar appeal filed by the ins on december.the motion states that the ins believes that the appeal was administratively closed by the office of the chief immigration judge because aoun is a native of lebanon of palestine descent and because lebanon was designated by the attorney general under the temporary protected status program,which was terminated for lebanon on april.on june,the board of immigration appeals issued an amended reinstating the proceedings,dismissing aoun appeal and denying his motions for remand and for oral argument.no explanation was given for the extensive time lapse between the motion to reinstate aoun appeal in april and the order on june.in that order,the board allowed aoun days to file a motion for reopen his application for suspension of deportation and aoun filed a timely motion to reopen and remand on june.the board summarily denied aoun motion on august,noting only that aoun physical presence in the united states began on october,and ended with an order to show cause on august,thereby making him ineligible for suspension due to less than seven years continuous physical presence.

with the amendment,congress changed many aspects of immigration law,including replacing deportation proceedings with removal proceedings and,correspondingly,replacing suspension of deportation with cancellation of removal.cancellation of removal provides the same general relief as suspension from deportation,but the eligibility requirements are somewhat stricter.the new law became effective on april.a key change in the law under the amendment concerned the calculation of time of an alien continuous physical presence in the united states.prior to the amendment,accrual of continuous physical presence could continue while the alien was in deportation proceedings.after passage of the amendment,the initiation of deportation proceedings stopped the clock on an alien accrual of time to satisfy the continuous physical presence requirement.under the amendment,any period of continuous residence or continuous physical presence in the united states shall be deemed to end when the alien is served a notice to appear or when the alien is convicted of one of several specified offenses,whichever is earliest.illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of c,stat,immigration and nationality act d,d.this is referred to as the stop time rule.
