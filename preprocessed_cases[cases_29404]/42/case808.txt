background 
petitioner is a citizen of the dominican republic who has been a lawful permanent resident of the united states since august.he has been convicted of numerous crimes in new york,and it is the timing of his most recent convictions that give rise to the legal issue presented by his petition.for purposes of addressing claim,we observe that on october,petitioner was convicted upon a guilty plea of two counts of attempted robbery in violation of new york penal law and was sentenced to years in prison.while incarcerated,was served with an order to show cause charging him with deportability under former section a a ii of the ina for having been convicted of multiple crimes of moral turpitude not arising out of a single course of conduct.was paroled on august,and released into the custody of the immigration and naturalization service ins,from which he was released after posting an bond.
thereafter violated his state parole by striking and grabbing the driver of an ambulance,which caused the ambulance to crash into a parked car,ejecting the driver from the ambulance.following this parole violation,was returned to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence for attempted robbery.meanwhile,the ins requested that deportation proceedings be administratively closed during his incarceration,and on february,the ij granted the unopposed request.
on march,pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment in the second degree in violation of new york penal law and was sentenced to time served.he was subsequently released from prison on september,having completed the remainder of the sentence on his attempted robbery convictions.
absence from the new york state penal system was.on december,he was convicted following a bench trial of petit larceny in violation of new york penal law and menacing in violation of new york penal law.he was sentenced to time served and three years probation.
approximately three years later,on december,the ins reopened deportation proceeding and,on august,the agency amended the charges of deportability to include conviction for petit larceny.appeared before the ij on january,and conceded deportability under ina section a a ii in light of his convictions for two or more crimes involving moral turpitude,not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct,a a ii specifically,his attempted robbery convictions and his petit larceny conviction.he applied for a waiver of inadmissibility under former section c of the ina,which the ij denied on the ground that petitioner petit larceny conviction rendered him ineligible for such relief.the bia dismissed the appeal,concluding that the repeal of section c of the act prior to conviction precluded him from such relief with respect to that conviction.see in re,no.this petition followed.
iii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
concedes that he is deportable under a a ii because his two convictions for attempted robbery qualify as two or more crimes involving moral turpitude.we lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal against an alien who,like,is removable under a a ii,where,as here,both predicate offenses are subject to a sentence of one year or more see a c.we may,however,review constitutional claims or questions of law raised by a petitioner in such circumstances.see id.a d ali mukasey,cir.because petition calls upon us to determine his statutory eligibility for discretionary relief under former ina section c,we proceed to address that claim.see channer dep t of homeland,cir noting that scope of review under a d includes petitions based on errors of law,including the erroneous application or interpretation of statutes and determinations regarding an alien statutory eligibility for discretionary relief internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted phong thanh nguyen chertoff,cir the phrase questions of law encompasses,inter alia,an alien statutory eligibility for removal and relief from removal.internal citations omitted.
standard of review 
when the bia issues an opinion,the opinion becomes the basis for judicial review of the decision of which the alien is complaining.yan chen gonzales,cir quoting niam ashcroft,cir.where,as here,the bia does not adopt the decision of the ij to any extent,we review the decision of the bia.see id.
we review underlying questions of law and the application of law to fact de novo.roman mukasey,cir.w hen our jurisdiction depends on the definition of a phrase used in the ina,a statute that the bia administers,and when the intent of congress is unclear and the agency interpretation is reasonable,we defer to the bia in accordance with chevron,natural resources defense council,d.james mukasey,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,no such deference is warranted where,as in this case,the challenged bia decision is unpublished,and,in any event,the text of the statute is clear.phong thanh nguyen chertoff,at citations omitted.
eligibility for section c relief 
the question of law presented by this appeal is whether was statutorily eligible for waiver of inadmissibility under former section c,despite the fact that this statutory section was repealed by iirira in,well before petitioner conviction for petit larceny.we hold that was eligible and that the bia erred in concluding otherwise.
repeal of section c 
under former c,legal permanent residents who were subject to deportation,but who had resided in the united states for seven consecutive years,were eligible to apply for a discretionary waiver of deportation.martinez ins,cir.as we have explained,t he decision of whether to award section c relief involved only a balancing of the adverse factors evidencing an alien undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented in his behalf to determine whether the granting of a section c waiver appear ed in the best interests of this country.kai tung chan gantner,cir second alteration in original quoting in re marin,accord martinez ins,at.
in,section c relief was first restricted and then eliminated.section d of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,d,stat,which took effect on april,eliminated eligibility for section c relief for aliens convicted of specified crimes.see domond ins,cir.shortly thereafter,iirira,enacted on september,and effective on april,repealed section c altogether.see iirira b,stat.at.iirira replaced section c relief with the more restrictive procedure for cancellation of removal under ina section,codified at a see blake carbone,cir.
iirira section c and ina section c relief 
the ij and bia concluded that,because conviction for petit larceny occurred after the effective date of iirira,he was necessarily ineligible for relief pursuant to repealed section c see in re,no,at.specifically,the bia ruled that t he fact that was already in deportation proceedings at the time of his conviction is irrelevant t he respondent is not eligible for section c relief with respect to the removability stemming from his conviction.id.we disagree.
for aliens who were in exclusion or deportation proceedings as of the title effective date of april,the savings provision in iirira section c clearly states that the amendments made by this subtitle including the repeal of section c shall not apply,and the proceedings including judicial review thereof shall continue to be conducted without regard to such amendments.iirira c.construing this language in tablie gonzales,cir,this court noted that iirir
