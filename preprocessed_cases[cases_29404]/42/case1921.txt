rafael mendez,convicted of harboring illegal aliens,appeals only from the district court denial of his motion to suppress evidence.he challenges the constitutionality of law enforcement officers entry of his home and investigation to confirm the presence of illegal brazilian immigrants.we hold that the government agents investigatory procedures in this case were reasonable under the totality of the circumstances.the judgment is affirmed.
background 
the nature of the investigation was developed in a district court evidentiary hearing.on august,two immigration and customs enforcement ice agents in dallas,texas received information from the ice office in boston,massachusetts that approximately seven to nine undocumented brazilian aliens were being harbored at a dallas residence.a computer search revealed that the residence was owned by rafael mendez,a cuban national living in the united states under political asylum.in the afternoon,the agents surveyed mendez residence.its barred windows,covered in dark drapes or blinds,a high security fence,and two large capacity vans parked in the driveway,all suggested that it could be used to harbor illegal aliens.
three or four additional ice agents arrived in unmarked vehicles sometime after.they decided that undercover agent angel rivera,posing as a civilian looking for his brazilian relative,would knock on mendez door.children out on the street near the house foiled the plan by screaming at rivera and calling him a narc.concerned for his safety,agent rivera retreated.
the ice agents then settled on a joint knock and talk with two uniformed dallas police officers.none of the officers secured a warrant before approaching mendez house.while the ice agents wore plain clothes,all of the government officers carried holstered sidearms.the agents and officers surrounded the house,and agent rivera walked to the side door,which appeared to be the main door.the door was wide open but the screen door was closed.agent rivera could see four people sitting at a table inside,including mendez,whom agent rivera recognized from a photograph he had seen in mendez immigration records.
agent rivera knocked on the screen door,and,speaking in spanish,asked mendez to step outside.when mendez did so,agent rivera identified himself,showed mendez his credentials,and explained that he had information that there were illegal aliens inside the house.in response to the agent question,mendez denied that there were other people in the house besides those at the table.mendez further stated that he had no problem consenting to agent rivera going inside and taking a look.
agent rivera testified that,upon entering the house,he saw,contrary to what mendez had just told him,seven or eight people sitting on a couch watching television in the living room.the people did not appear to understand his questions in english or spanish until he said the word brazil,provoking a nod from one of the individuals.believing these individuals to be brazilian illegal aliens,agent rivera called on his radio to the ice agents and police officers outside,who then entered the house.the agents and officers performed what they considered a protective sweep,searching only for people,but not evidence,in each room.as part of this effort,the only agent present who knew portuguese spoke although not fluently to the suspected illegal aliens for approximately thirty to minutes,attempting to identify their immigration status.
agent rivera simultaneously returned outside,read mendez his miranda rights,and placed him under arrest.agent rivera then asked mendez whether he would execute a written consent to search form.mendez told agent rivera that he had little education and was unsure whether he had the authority to allow police to search his house,as it was in the process of being sold.rivera assured him that he possessed proper authority to consent,and called for mendez wife.when she arrived,rivera explained and read the consent form to both mendez and his wife in their native spanish.mendez signed the form,and the agents began searching the house.
during their search,the agents seized date books,notepads and business cards,all which appeared to be related to an alien smuggling operation.when questioned about these items,mendez told agent rivera that he ran a transport business and that he kept good records.mendez wife volunteered to retrieve the records and brought several documents outside to agent rivera.the agents also found business ledgers under mendez mattress that listed names,countries of origin,amounts of money,and destination of aliens.
after being given miranda warnings again at the dallas district immigration office,mendez provided a voluntary statement detailing his involvement,since,in the transportation of aliens within the united states.
on september,a federal grand jury charged mendez with two counts of conspiracy and harboring illegal aliens.mendez moved unsuccessfully to suppress all of the evidence seized and statements elicited as a result of the warrantless search of his house.he then pled guilty to count two of the indictment harboring aliens in violation of a a iii and v ii in exchange for the government dropping count one,but reserved his right to appeal the motion to suppress.he timely filed this appeal.
ii.discussion 
this court reviews the district court factual findings in connection with a suppression motion for clear error and its fourth amendment conclusions of law de novo.united states brigham,cir citations omitted.the evidence is considered in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.id.
mendez argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence because the initial consent he gave agent rivera to search his house did not extend to the other agents present,who therefore entered his house without consent the agents had no basis to perform a protective sweep and his later written consent to enter and search his home was ineffective because of the earlier violations.we address each argument in turn.
initial consent 
the district court found,over disputed testimony,that mendez gave agent rivera consent to enter his house.mendez contends,however,that because his consent did not extend to the other agents present at the scene,the other agents entrance into his house violated his fourth amendment rights.the government responds that mendez consent for one rivera was effectively consent for all six or seven other agents on the facts of this case and in the absence of any limitation on his consent.
the district court did not rule on the scope of mendez consent,as the court approved the officers entry into the house and detention of the brazilians on a hybrid protective view rationale.nevertheless,the deficiency can be overlooked,because this purely legal issue was raised in the trial court and concerns undisputed facts.see ballard united states,cir stating that reviewing court may affirm on grounds other than those relied upon by the district court.the supreme court holds that t he standard for measuring the scope of a suspect consent under the fourth amendment is that of objective would the typical reasonable person have understood by the exchange between the officer and the suspect florida jimeno,d.although objective reasonableness is a question of law,factual circumstances are highly relevant when determining what the reasonable person would have believed to be the outer bounds of the consent that was given.united states,cir.
the facts preceding agent rivera entry into the mendez home have been recounted above.in particular,the ice agent explained his search for illegal entering the house.a reasonable person observing the exchange between agent rivera and mendez would conclude that mendez authorized a search of his house for people who might be illegal aliens,and that is exactly what transpired.on entry,agent rivera immediately noticed seven or eight people sitting in the living room.he ascertained that they did not respond to the english or spanish languages except to acknowledge one word brazil.believing that the individuals in the living room were the illegal immigrants about whom he had earlier been i
