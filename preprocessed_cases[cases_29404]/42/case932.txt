in reviewing these decisions,the principal question before us is whether the bia erred in concluding that saleh remains convicted of a removable offense for federal immigration purposes even though the state court amended its judgment of conviction to effectively expunge his conviction of a removable offense under state law.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that the bia did not err because the amendment was secured solely to aid saleh in avoiding immigration consequences and was not based on any procedural or substantive defect in the original conviction.we therefore deny the petition.
background 
saleh,a native and citizen of yemen,was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident in.in,saleh was convicted in a california state court,following his plea of nolo contendere,of receiving stolen property in violation of section a of the california penal code the offense carries a maximum sentence of imprisonment,see cal.a,although the court imposed a lower sentence in july,the immigration and naturalization service ins commenced removal proceedings charging that saleh was removable under a a i because his crime qualifies as a cimt,committed within years after the date of admission,for which a sentence of one year or longer could have been imposed.
subsequently,for the announced purpose of escaping adverse immigration consequences,saleh moved in california state court for an amendment of the judgment convicting him of receiving stolen property,effective nunc pro tunc,so that he would instead stand convicted of petty theft in violation of section of the california penal code.because this is not a crime for which a sentence of one year or longer could have been imposed,it is not a removable offense.in a declaration accompanying saleh motion,his counsel expressly referred to the immigration consequences of saleh original conviction,stating that the alternative disposition of petty theft,which carries a six month maximum sentence would not have the adverse immigration consequences.moreover,no evidence or argument presented to that court identified any substantive or procedural defects in saleh conviction.the california court granted the motion.
saleh thereafter asked the ij to terminate the agency removal proceedings,arguing that petty theft is not a removable offense.the ij denied the motion,reasoning that,despite the california court amendment to the judgment of conviction,saleh remained convicted of receiving stolen property,a removable offense for federal immigration purposes,because the amendment was not based on any showing of innocence or any suggestion that the conviction had been improperly obtained.instead,the ij found that the conviction was amended solely for the purpose of circumventing the immigration laws of the united states.
after the ij denied saleh motion to terminate his removal proceedings and the bia declined to entertain his interlocutory appeal of that decision,saleh contested removability and sought relief from removal.he initially filed a form,a prerequisite to obtaining a waiver of deportation under former section c of the ina.subsequently,however,saleh abandoned his application for c relief and instead filed a motion to substitute an application for cancellation of removal the ij found saleh removable and denied his application for cancellation of removal as untimely.
the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision and dismissed the appeal.relying on its prior decision in matter of pickering,bia,the bia agreed with the ij that saleh remained convicted of a removable offense for federal immigration purposes because the amendment of the judgment of conviction was not based on any substantive or procedural defect in the underlying criminal proceedings,and saleh was therefore removable.saleh filed a timely petition for review.
ii.analysis 
in his petition,saleh argues that the bia erred in finding him removable and in denying his application for cancellation of removal.in support,he argues principally that a the bia interpretation of the ina,under which he remains convicted of a removable offense,is not entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d and violates,which obliges federal courts to give full faith and credit to state acts,records,and judicial proceedings and b the bia erroneously concluded that he was ineligible for cancellation of removal.we reject each of his arguments.
a.did the bia err in concluding that saleh remains convicted of a removable offense for federal immigration purposes 
is the bia interpretation of the ina at issue in this case entitled to deference under chevron 
the bia determined that saleh was removable pursuant to a a i,which makes removable any alien who i is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years or years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident status after the date of admission,and ii is convicted of a crime for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed.the bia properly concluded that saleh original conviction for receiving stolen property,in violation of cal.a,satisfies these requirements.see michel ins,cir.although saleh thus stood convicted of a removable offense under state law at one time,he subsequently secured an amendment of the state judgment in an effort to avoid adverse immigration consequences and not because of any procedural or substantive defect in the original conviction.therefore,the issue before us is whether,under these circumstances,saleh remains convicted of a removable offense for federal immigration purposes,viz.within the meaning of a a i and the ina definition of conviction,a a 
this is a question of federal statutory interpretation.we have previously observed that w hether one has been convicted within the language of federal statutes is necessarily a question of federal,not state,law,despite the fact that the predicate offense and its punishment are defined by the law of the state.united states campbell,cir alterations in original,citation omitted dickerson new banner,d holding that in the absence of a plain indication to the contrary,it is to be assumed when congress enacts a statute that it does not intend to make its application dependent on state law alterations in original,citation omitted.
we review the bia interpretation of the ina under the familiar analysis set forth in chevron,d.see ins,d.first,we determine whether the provision in question is ambiguous i f the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute,and thus entitled to deference.id.at.
turning to the first step of this analysis,we conclude that congress intent on the treatment of vacated or amended convictions under a a is ambiguous.saleh was deemed removable because,inter alia,he is an alien who is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude,a a i,and conviction is defined,in pertinent part,as a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court,a a.this language permits a spectrum of possible interpretations.on one end of the spectrum,congress may have intended that where an alien receives any type of through an amendment nunc pro tunc,an expungement,or some other immigration law should treat the conviction as if it never occurred,regardless of the reason for the relief.under this view,the expungement means that the defendant no longer is convicted of the original crime and there is no longer any formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court.on the other end of the spectrum,congress may have intended that no relief whatsoever should have any effect on whether an alien stands convicted of a removable offense,again,regardless of the reason for the relief.or,congress may have intended some middle position that certain types of relief would affect an alien conviction status under the ina,but others would not,depending upon the reason for the relief.neither the relevant statutory language nor legislative history allows us to conclude that any of these interpretations represents congress unambiguous intent.see,pinho gonzales,cir ins,cir.
accordingly,we turn to chevron second step,which directs us to consider whether the bia adopted a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.in making this assessment,i t is not necessary that we conclude that the agency interpretation of the statute is the only permissible interpretation,nor that we believe it to be the best interpretation of the statute.skubel fuoroli,cir citing chevron,at.rather,to affirm the bia determination,we need only conclude that the agency interpretation is rational and consistent with the statute.protection advocacy for persons with disabilities mental health addiction,cir quoting sullivan everhart,d.
the bia has adopted an interpretation of a a that distinguishes between convictions vacated on the merits,which the bia does not treat as convictions within the meaning of the provision,and convictions vacated for other reasons,including to avoid immigration hardships,which the bia continues to treat as convictions.because saleh conviction fell into the latter category,the bia concluded that the nunc pro tunc amendment did not affect his conviction status for removability purposes.for reasons to be discussed,we reject saleh contention that the interpretation is unreasonable 
over the last years,there has been a consistent broadening of the meaning of conviction in the ina.until,the ina did not contain a statutory definition of conviction,and for most of that time,the bia generally took the position that an alien whose conviction is vacated or expunged under state law no longer stood convicted of a removable offense for federal immigration purposes.see matter of ozkok,bia.in,the bia acknowledged,albeit in a somewhat different context from the instant case,that its own prior approach was unduly deferential to state definitions of conviction and had thus frustrated congressional intent f orm has been placed over substance,and aliens who are clearly guilty of criminal behavior and whom congress intended to be considered convicted have been permitted to escape the immigration consequences normally attendant upon a conviction.id.at.accordingly,the bia attempted in ozkok to remedy the problem,adopting a broader test for determining whether a conviction existed for federal immigration purposes.
but congress was of the opinion that the bia had not gone far enough.see francis gonzales,cir noting that congress subsequently indicated its dissatisfaction with the ozkok test when it amended the ina to change the definition of conviction in.congress therefore codified,for the first time,a definition of the term conviction in the ina.see a a see also francis,at.this definition was specifically intended to broaden the definition of conviction under the ina that had been previously used by the bia.see francis,at noting that t he applicable definition of conviction was narrower prior to congress intervention than it is today.in particular,congress expanded the ozkok definition by including convictions where the adjudication of guilt was deferred.as the conference report on the amendments explained,there exist s in the various states a myriad of provisions for ameliorating the effects of a conviction.as a result,aliens who have clearly been guilty of criminal behavior and whom congress intended to be considered convicted have escaped the immigration consequences normally attendant upon a conviction.conf.at.
interpreting the new definition,the bia identified two primary aims that it believed congress sought to accomplish to focus the conviction inquiry on the original determination of guilt and to implement a uniform federal approach.matter of,bia.relying on these rationales,the bia,in a series of cases culminating in matter of pickering,bia,reversed on other grounds,pickering gonzales,cir,further expanded the definition of conviction beyond the particular procedural mechanism considered by congress in its amendments to the ina.in pickering,the bia concluded that congress objected generally to many state actions allowing aliens to escape the immigration consequences normally attendant upon a conviction,conf.at,and that congress did not intend to allow an alien to escape those consequences by means of a state vacatur that was not on the merits.pickering gave effect to this objective by holding that the federal immigration consequences of all relief will be determined by considering the state court motivation in granting the relief,avoiding immigration hardships,recognizing the defendant rehabilitation,or a substantive or procedural defect in the predicate conviction.specifically,the bia held that 
t here is a significant distinction between convictions vacated on the basis of a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings and those vacated because of events,such as rehabilitation or immigration hardships.thus,if a court with jurisdiction vacates a conviction based on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings,the respondent no longer has a conviction within the meaning of section a a a a.if,however,a court vacates a conviction for reasons unrelated to the merits of the underlying criminal proceedings,the respondent remains convicted for immigration purposes.
relying in part on this reasoning,the bia in the appeal now before us concluded that saleh remained convicted of the original removable offense because the amendment to saleh judgment of conviction was obtained solely to avoid immigration hardships and not to remedy a procedural or substantive defect in the underlying proceedings.
the bia interpretation in both pickering and the instant case is reasonable.for one thing,the interpretation is entirely consistent with congress intent in enacting the amendments to broaden the definition of conviction and advances the two purposes earlier identified by the bia it focuses on the original attachment of guilt which only a vacatur based on some procedural or substantive defect would call into question and imposes uniformity on the enforcement of immigration laws.second,from a practical perspective,while state convictions are a useful way for the federal government to identify individuals who,because of their criminal history,may be appropriate for removal,there will still remain individuals who are guilty of morally turpitudinous conduct,see michel,at,and therefore suitable for removal even though they do not have a conviction for a removable offense under state law.dickerson,at.noting that state convictions provide a convenient,although somewhat inexact,way of identifying especially risky people and that t here is no inconsistency in the refusal of congress to be bound by state actions that vary widely from state to state and that provide less than positive assurance that the person in question no longer poses an unacceptable risk of dangerousness.internal citations omitted.under pickering,these individuals will remain removable,as congress intended.
