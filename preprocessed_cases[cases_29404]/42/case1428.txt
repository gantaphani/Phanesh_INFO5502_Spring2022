a motion to reopen a removal order issued in absentia must be filed within days of the order.the primary issue before us,an issue of first impression,is whether the time limitation is mandatory and jurisdictional,or whether it is analogous to a statute of limitations and therefore can be equitably tolled.if it is the latter,we must decide whether fraud constitutes a basis for equitable tolling.
we hold that the time limitation can be equitably tolled,and can be tolled for fraud.as such,we will remand this case to the board of immigration appeals bia for it to determine whether fraud was,in fact,perpetrated on petitioner by his legal representatives and,if so,whether the time limitation was sufficiently tolled so as to render the motion to reopen timely.
jose borges entered the united states on february,with a tourist visa.the and naturalization service ins commenced removal proceedings in august of,alleging that he was an illegal overstay.borges hired an immigration services company,entra america entra,in january of to provide him with representation.what he was provided with,he alleges,was representation that amounted to fraud.
entra and alfred placeres.
adela ivan was the owner of entra.she told borges that she was a paralegal,but that borges would be represented by one of entra immigration attorneys,alfred placeres.she also told him that placeres would file a motion seeking a change of venue from new jersey,where the removal proceedings were pending,to new york,where borges lived,and that placeres would represent borges on an adjustment of status petition based on his marriage to jolie lamarca,a united states citizen.
on january,a change of venue motion which,placeres tells us,we prepared,was filed by placeres.one week later,on january,borges appeared at the immigration court in newark,new jersey.no attorney accompanied him.the immigration judge ij denied the change of venue motion and told borges that if he did not return on february,he would be deported.borges contacted ivan,and she allegedly told him,supposedly at placeres behest that placeres would not appear in court that if borges went to court without an attorney,he would be deported and that because borges had a pending application for adjustment of status,he could not be deported.borges did not attend the proceedings on february,and the ij ordered him removed from the united states in absentia.
in the meantime,on january,borges married lamarca.one month later,an immediate relative petition form and an adjustment of status petition form were,by placeres.the documents were not only erroneously filed with the ins in new york,and not with the immigration court in new jersey but erroneously indicated that borges had never been the subject of removal proceedings.unaware of the immigration court orders,the ins in new york issued borges an employment authorization based on the pending petitions,and an adjustment of status interview,which was scheduled for february.given those facts,borges assumed that the in absentia order had been vacated.
first motion to reopen 
in april of,borges received a letter from the ins telling him to report to the hemisphere center in newark for deportation to venezuela.borges went to the entra office and showed the letter to ivan,who told him that placeres had taken care of the in absentia order of removal by filing the adjustment of status petition,and reassured him that placeres would file a motion to reopen and formally vacate the in absentia order.
on april,a timely motion to reopen and reconsider was filed with the immigration court.it sought to vacate the in absentia order solely on the ground that the motion for a change of venue had been wrongly denied it never mentioned the pending adjustment of status petition or gave any reason for borges failure to appear on february.the ij denied the motion and served a copy of the decision on placeres.borges,who was not served,believed the motion had been granted.
during the period of his representation,it does not appear that placeres ever spoke to borges,much less met with him.
jamal jbara.
borges and his wife attended the adjustment of status interview in new york on february or.they were represented by jamal jbara,another attorney working out of entra.jbara told borges not to mention that an order of removal had issued.borges,who believed the order had been vacated anyway,complied with that instruction.the and petitions were granted,and borges was approved for permanent residence.
in april,borges planned to travel to venezuela to visit his mother,who was ill.he contacted jbara to make sure that he would be able to the united states because he had not yet received his green card.jbara told borges,apparently for the first time,that the order of removal had not been vacated.
on may,borges and jbara again met with the ins officer who had conducted the adjustment of status interview.the officer voided the permanent residence stamp he had earlier placed on borges passport,replaced it with a stamp that said pending,and said he was transferring the case to new jersey.the ins never commenced formal proceedings to rescind the approval of adjustment of status.
also on or about may,jbara agreed to file a motion with the immigration court to reopen the removal proceedings.he did not do so.rather,he simply submitted a proposed joint motion to reopen to the office of the district counsel from may of until the summer of,when he retained a new attorney,borges regularly called jbara to ascertain the status of the motion to reopen,and jbara consistently led him to believe that the motion was still under consideration by the ij.
second motion to reopen 
on january,borges,represented by present counsel,paul,filed another motion to reopen with the immigration court.the motion alleged that ivan,not placeres,had performed all of the legal work during the critical months that placeres was supposedly representing borges,and that borges had been defrauded by placeres and ivan into believing that a licensed and experienced attorney was representing him.according to borges,those fraudulent representations led him to believe that he had nothing to worry about and kept him from discovering how serious his situation was and that,in fact,he remained under an in absentia order of removal.indeed,he continued,the order of removal would not have been entered had it not been misrepresented to him that if he went to court,he would be deported.he argued that the period within which to file a motion to reopen the in absentia removal order should,therefore,be tolled until september of,when he learned of the fraud.he also argued that the ineffective assistance of an exceptional circumstance excusing his failure to appear at his february removal hearing.
on march,the immigration court denied borges motion to reopen because it was untimely and because he had not complied with the procedure under matter of lozada,bia for raising a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.in april of,borges filed a timely motion to reconsider,arguing that he had in fact complied with the lozada requirements the ij denied the motion,finding it,too,untimely and finding that there was no reason to disturb the finding of noncompliance with lozada.borges appealed both decisions to the bia.
on february,borges was apprehended by officials from the dhs and was taken to a detention center in jamaica,new york.on march,the bia dismissed his appeal.the bia determined,as relevant here,that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim does not qualify as an exception to the requirement for filing a motion to reopen,an argument borges had not made,and determined that borges had failed in some unspecified way to comply,as an initial matter,with lozada and that this fundamental defect could not be remedied by his subsequent compliance.the bia did not address borges argument that the requirement should be equitably tolled because of fraud.finally,the bia concluded,based on the competing affidavits of borges and placeres,that placeres denial that he told ivan to tell borges not to appear at the february removal hearing had the ring of truth and,thus,that borges had not established the prejudice component of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.borges timely appealed to this court,and on april,we issued a stay of removal pending appeal

equitable tolling 
borges concedes,as he must,that his motion to reopen was well outside of the window for seeking rescission of his february,in absentia order of removal,and he has never argued to the contrary.respondent,however,has continually misconstrued what borges has consistently argued is the basis for equitably tolling this period.
borges has always argued,and argues now,that the period should be equitably tolled because ivan and placeres defrauded him by leading him to believe that placeres was doing all of his legal work,by making fraudulent representations about the status of his case,and by telling him,among other things,that if he went to the immigration court for his february hearing,he would be deported.were it not for this fraud,he argues,he would have appeared at his removal proceedings and an in absentia order of removal would not have issued indeed,given that he was eligible for adjustment of status,he had no reason not to appear.borges also argues that he did not discover the fraud until september,and so,if the period were equitably tolled,the motion to reopen that was filed on january,would be timely.
borges has never argued,and does not now argue,that ineffective assistance of counsel can or should constitute an exception to the time limit,but only that,if and when the period is equitably tolled,ineffective assistance can constitute the requisite extraordinary circumstance excusing a failure to appear.the bia,however,dismissed his motion to reopen in part because it misunderstood this argument.respondent suffers from a similar misunderstanding,as evidenced by his repeated citation to our decision in bejar,which held that alleged ineffective assistance of counsel is not an exception to the regulatory time limit.bejar,at citing in re lei,bia.
correcting the mischaracterization of borges argument only gets us so far,for we must still decide whether the period for reopening an in absentia order of removal is subject to equitable tolling.the determinative factor is whether that time period is jurisdictional or whether it is analogous to a statute of limitations.if it is the former,it can not be equitably tolled if it is the latter,it can be.
several of our sister courts of appeals have weighed in on the issue now before us.the ninth circuit has decided two cases very similar,on their facts,to this one.in lopez ins,the court granted the petition for review,finding that the statute of limitations to reopen an order of deportation is equitably tolled where the alien late petition is the result of the deceptive actions by a notary posing as an attorney for the apparent law office lopez had retained,cir.the notary actions,including telling lopez that he need not attend his deportation hearing,resulted in an in absentia order of removal being entered.see id.at.one year later,the court granted similar relief to an alien who was defrauded by an individual purporting to provide legal representation who took varela money but did not file a motion to reopen or an application for adjustment of status until it was too late to do so.varela ins,cir.more recently,the court held that w here the ineffective performance was that of an actual attorney and the attorney engaged in fraudulent activity causing an essential action in her client case to be undertaken ineffectively,out of time,or not at all,equitable tolling is available.iturribarria ins,cir see also ins,cir.
in both lopez and varela,the court concluded that the relevant time period for reopening an order of removal was analogous to a statute of limitations,and then relied on what lopez describes as the old chancery rule that where a plaintiff has been injured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part,the bar of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is discovered.lopez,at internal citation omitted.based on the fact that t his equitable doctrine is read into every federal statute of limitation,holmberg armbrecht.emphasis in original,tolling was deemed appropriate under the circumstances of both cases.see lopez,at varela,at.
the first,second,fourth,and sixth circuits have more generally considered applying,or have applied,equitable tolling to motions to reopen.see,jobe ins,cir considering,as an en banc court,the equitable tolling argument but dismissing the petition for review on the ground that,even if tolling were available,petitioner had not exercised due diligence iavorski ins,cir concluding that there can be tolling because there is no evidence that congress intended to enact a jurisdictional bar to untimely motions to reopen,but finding that petitioner had not exercised due diligence akwada ashcroft.cir.lexis,taking the same approach as taken by the jobe court scorteanu ins,cir same.
the eleventh circuit,on the other hand,in one of the earlier cases in this area,held that the time period is jurisdictional,and refused to find an exception to the period based on ineffective assistance of counsel.anin reno,cir.this is essentially what we held in bejar.here,however,we are dealing with tolling to permit reopening after days based on allegations of fraud,not an exception on the ground of ineffective assistance to the time period excusing a failure to appear 
therefore,anin does not impact our analysis.
we hold that the time limitation is more appropriately considered as analogous to a statute of limitations and,thus,subject to equitable tolling.island insteel,waters,cir internal citations omitted explaining that statutes of limitations serve the purpose of preventing litigation of stale claims,putting defendants on notice,and preventing plaintiffs from sleeping on their rights.we find it instructive,as we have before,that there is no reference to jurisdiction in the statute or in the legislative history.see,miller new jersey dep t of corrections,cir.given this silence,we see no good reason to believe that congress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to apply.united states brockamp,d emphasis in original.furthermore,we,too,have long accepted the old chancery rule for tolling on the ground of fraud that lopez recites,see,reuther trs.of trucking employees,cir,and follow the ninth circuit lead in applying it in the context seen here.
concluding,as we do,that tolling may be appropriate where there is fraud is not the
