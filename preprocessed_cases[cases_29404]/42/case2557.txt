petitioners marina koval and valeriy vagil seek review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia or board that affirmed the immigration judge ij denial of their request for asylum.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we grant the petition for review,reverse the judgment of the bia and remand the case for further consideration.
backgrounda.facts 
vagil and koval,husband and wife,are natives and citizens of ukraine.they have at least one child who was born in the united states.vagil entered the united states on may,with a visitor visa that was valid until november.on july,koval entered the united states with a visitor visa that was valid until july.they both stayed in the united states longer than permitted,and the immigration and naturalization service initiated removal proceedings.both conceded removability,and koval filed an application for asylum and for withholding of removal on their behalf.at a september removal hearing,koval and vagil testified that they feared returning to ukraine because of their membership in the church of jesus christ of saints the mormon church.
koval presented the following testimony in support of her application.she was baptized into the mormon church around march.at the time,she was a university student in kiev,ukraine.one month after her reception into the church,she received a summons from the soviet intelligence service kgb.according to koval,at the kgb office,she was interviewed by a man who stated that he knew that she had joined the mormon church.the agent also told koval that young americans were visiting ukraine in order to obtain secret information about the country.the agent further said that the american spies were interested in young educated people,and in koval particularly,because she was a physics student with access to scientific research and new materials and super conductivity.he expressed his concern that,as a good citizen,koval should not be in contact with the americans.the agent also requested the addresses of the americans and warned that koval would be punished if she failed to comply.
in may,while koval was on vacation,her dorm room was searched her books about the mormon faith and her diary were missing.a week after this incident,koval again was summoned by the kgb.she was interviewed by the same agent and another man.koval testified that the agents told her that,because she had failed to provide any information and because she was attending the mormon church,she would not be allowed to continue her physics studies.the agents also warned that,if she did not cease her involvement with the mormon church,she would be in some way isolated from the society because they did not want me allegedly to influence other people.
despite these threats,koval was allowed to graduate and to receive her master degree in physics.however,according to koval,she was denied entrance into the program because the kgb had denied her residence a propiska in kiev.koval had earned all a grades and was the only student in her program to receive a red diploma,a mark of distinction.
without permission to stay in kiev,koval moved to her parents home in borispol,ukraine,about kilometers from kiev.she applied for jobs in various departments at the local airport,at two factories and at a school,but she received no interviews.koval testified that she believed that her inability to procure employment was because she had to complete a standardized job application form.the form required her to disclose that she had a sister living in the united states and that she was a member of an american church.ultimately,koval father was able to find her work as a ticket checker at the airport where he was a pilot.she testified that the people who worked in this job were capable only of some really simple jobs.
after one year and a half,koval was hired by an israeli airline.about one month later,however,she had to leave that position because the kgb did not allow her to obtain a passport for business travel outside of the former communist bloc countries.koval was told that she could not receive the passport because her sister lived in the united states and because she was involved with americans.koval later was hired by a polish airline.at some point thereafter,she was granted a passport.in april,she worked in the united states for about one month as an interpreter for a group of kgb agents and airport employees who were attending computer training.according to koval,she was kept under close surveillance,and the kgb held the group members passports and money in the hotel.
koval met vagil at a church meeting in.she testified that,at the time,vagil was twice smaller his size of now because he was completely nervous,he was a nervous wreck.he did live at home.he lost his job.according to koval,vagil told her that sometimes he would not eat for several days and that he had not seen his parents in months.he told koval that the kgb was calling his parents and had interrogated his mother.the agents had told vagil mother that,if they caught him,they would release him from custody with tuberculosis.according to koval,in january,the kgb again summoned vagil parents.koval and vagil decided that he no longer could remain in ukraine.koval bought him a plane ticket from the airline for which she worked and,in an effort to avoid detection,arranged for him to depart on a day different from the one listed on his ticket.koval married vagil two days before he left in may.
after vagil left ukraine,a friend of koval mother called to say that the friend husband was in jail and that the kgb had said they would release him if he reported about koval.koval testified that she began to notice that every time i was working this specific flight,the head of the kgb was present.also,one guy would be next to her all the time allegedly for training,and he would ask her questions such as how to pass information from poland to america.finally,on june,koval again was summoned to meet with the kgb.she decided to leave ukraine at that point.
after koval departure,the kgb directed her parents to sign a paper promising to bring her to the kgb if they saw her again.in august,koval father was found dead.the death certificate listed the cause of death as drowning.koval testified that her father was in excellent physical condition and that she did not believe that he had died of natural causes.koval sister stated in an affidavit that she believed their father had passed away because he could not handle the stress caused by his daughter persecution.koval testified that she never was arrested,detained overnight or physically tortured by the kgb.
vagil also testified on his own behalf.he joined the mormon church in.according to vagil,he began receiving rude telephone calls in from unknown persons who asked him why he was attending the american church.he received about ten such calls between october and december.in january,the kgb interrogated him and told him that he was expected to provide a list of the ukrainian members of his local parish and the names of the missionaries who worked with that church.
the following march,after vagil had failed to provide such information,kgb agents warned him that,if he did not cooperate,they would find the ways to ruin my career,my health,and they would be able just to simply throw me into jail.
in,the kgb came to vagil parents home in search of him the kgb also summoned his parents for questioning and told them that vagil would be harmed if he did not cooperate.vagil became frightened and decided to leave the country.he testified that he never was arrested,detained or physically abused in ukraine his parents still live in ukraine and are employed.
in support of their application for asylum,koval and vagil submitted the testimony of leonid stonov,the international director of the union of councils of jews in the former soviet union,a human rights monitoring organization.he testified that koval application was consistent with his knowledge of the treatment of mormons in ukraine.specifically,he stated that religions such as mormons are considered sects and face pressure from the official russian orthodox church.he also testified that ukraine society discriminates against all religions in that such churches are not allowed to register consequently,they can not build churches,and their activities may be classified as illegal.
koval and vagil also sought to introduce the testimony of yuriy shvets regarding the activities of the kgb and its successor organization,the security service of ukraine sbu,with respect to mormons.shvets had worked as a kgb agent in ukraine from until he was assigned to a department that monitored the daily activities of the churches in the soviet union.shvets stated that he was well aware of the real policy of the soviet government towards religion and of the kgb methods of dealing with those church leaders and believers who did not follow the party line.shvets also stated that he had maintained contacts with the sources he had developed in the kgb.at the time of the removal hearing,shvets was working as a private consultant to the united states government on security issues involving russia and ukraine.
shvets testified that koval account of harassment was consistent with his knowledge of the kgb.he found it inevitable that koval immediately had been in serious trouble for adopting the mormon faith.shvets stated that the growing number of ukraine citizens joining other religious groups has become a grave threat to the influence of the orthodox church.he explained that a young intellectual,such as koval,would have drawn increased attention because she was considered capable of spreading ideological views.according to shvets,the kgb believed that american religious missions were controlled by the central intelligence agency or the federal bureau of investigation.the mormon church still is perceived to have close ties with the united states government.shvets testified to his view that the nature of the sbu essentially has not changed since the collapse of the soviet union.
shvets further testified that he believed that koval fear of persecution should she return to ukraine was reasonable and well founded based on her religious belief and her defiant attitude towards the sbu.he explained that the kgb failed attempt to recruit koval in order to reach american missionaries was a serious security lapse and possibly a political embarrassment because it involved american missionaries.shvets opined that,once koval left for the united states,
she crossed the point of no return.it is the worst nightmare for the sbu.now,they must be sure that she already has reported to the authorities about attempts of the sbu,representing the friendly government of ukraine,to target american missionaries who pay taxes to bring humanitarian aid to ukraine.potential ramifications of such revelations might be personally disastrous to those in the sbu who devised,conducted,and authorized the operation.it represents a great personal security risk for the applicant.i strongly believe the sbu would pay dearly to get hold of her and silence her.
shvets strongly believed that koval life would be in danger should she return to ukraine.id.
in shvets view,vagil faces a similar situation as a mormon,an intellectual and someone who knows of specific sbu activity against mormons and american missionaries.
administrative proceedings 
the ij found koval and vagil to be credible.the ij admitted the testimony of stonov.the ij noted,however,that stonov had defined persecution to mean societal discrimination that is not and the refusal of permits for churches.the ij excluded the testimony of shvets.relying on federal rule of evidence for guidance,the ij determined that shvets was not qualified as an expert regarding the current treatment of mormons in ukraine.specifically,the ij concluded that shvet testimony was not based on sufficient facts or data,insofar as he had not traveled to ukraine in about twelve years and he was not working with issues related to mormons in ukraine.
the ij then concluded that,although koval and vagil suffered hardship and harassment,they did not suffer persecution.the ij relied on the fact that they had been able to practice their mormon faith and that neither was arrested,detained or physically assaulted in ukraine.also,the ij took the view that koval inability to pursue her and her difficulty in obtaining work in her field did not amount to severe economic deprivation.with respect to vagil,the ij concluded that no evidence reflected that the kgb had followed through on its threat to ruin his health and career.finally,the ij gave sizeable weight to koval and vagil ability to obtain valid passports and visas to the united states,which undermined any notion of strict government control.id.
with respect to the fear of persecution standard,the ij concluded that,on the basis of the country reports prepared by the united states department of state and other documentary evidence,there is harassment and bureaucratic delays with religions,but generally there is not severe mistreatment or persecution.the ij again noted that koval and vagil had been able to obtain valid passports and visas to leave ukraine.in addition,the ij decided that,although soon after koval and vagil fled the country their parents were interrogated,nothing indicated that this harassment had continued.
the bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion.
analysisa.standard of review 
where,as here,the bia summarily affirms,we review the immigration judge opinion as if it were that of the bia.huang gonzales,cir.we limit our review to determining if the ij decision is supported by substantial evidence.kharkhan ashcroft,cir.we shall uphold the ij asylum eligibility finding as long as it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.id.quoting ins,d.
koval and vagil challenge the ij denial of asylum on three grounds that past persecution was established based on koval economic deprivation that a fear of future persecution was established on the fact that vagil faces imprisonment in ukraine if returned and that koval faces severe mistreatment through crushing,economic pressure and that the ij erroneously excluded the testimony of shvets.appellants br.at section a of the immigration and nationality act ina,b,grants the attorney general broad discretion to grant asylum to an applicant who qualifies as a refugee.a refugee is defined as any person who is outside any country of such person nationality and who is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of persecution or a fear of future persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.
a showing of past persecution creates a presumption that the applicant has a fear of persecution and therefore should be granted asylum.see b see capric ashcroft,cir.this presumption is rebutted,however,if the government shows by a preponderance of the evidence that fundamental changes in the conditions in the applicant country of nationality have occurred such that he no longer has a fear of being persecuted if returned.b i a see capric,at.the presumption of a fear of persecution also can be overcome by a preponderance of the evidence showing that the applicant could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of his home country and that it would be reasonable to expect him to so relocate.b i b see capric,at.
alternatively,even if the applicant was not subjected to past persecution,he may put forward evidence that he possesses a genuine fear of enduring persecution if returned to his country of origin and that a reasonable person would fear persecution if returned to that country.b capric,at.the objective component of the fear standard requires the asylum applicant to show that a reasonable possibility exists that he would be singled out individually for persecution or that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of an identifiable group,to which the applicant establishes he belongs,such that his fear is reasonable.capric,at citing b.
past persecution 
koval submits that the level of economic treatment she suffered,on account of her membership in the mormon church,before leaving ukraine amounted to past persecution.although
