for ruben challenge to his conviction and sentence,primarily at issue is whether,for sentence enhancement purposes,his prior pennsylvania conviction for the misdemeanor offense of terroristic threats is a requisite crime of violence under of the sentencing guidelines.the record is not sufficient to decide that issue.he acknowledges our precedent forecloses his constitutional challenge to his conviction.we affirm the conviction vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.
in early,a mexican citizen,pleaded guilty to being knowingly and unlawfully present in the united states after a previous deportation,in violation of a and b.the guidelines mandate a of eight for that offense.a.pursuant to guidelines b a ii,the presentence investigation report psr recommended that sentence be increased by levels for his previous deportation following a criminal conviction for a crime of violence cov.the claimed cov was july pennsylvania conviction for terroristic threats,subsequent to which he was deported in.
over objections to the psr and at sentencing,the district court held the pennsylvania conviction was a cov.after a acceptance of responsibility downward adjustment,total offense level was.based on his category iv criminal history,his sentencing range was months.the district court granted the government downward departure motion and sentenced,inter alia,to months.
presents two issues.he acknowledges his challenge to his conviction fails on this record,we can not decide the challenge to his sentence.
concerning his conviction,claims b and are unconstitutional in the light of apprendi new jersey,d.he admits,however,that relief is foreclosed by united states,d,united states dabeit,cir,cert.denied,d,overruled on other grounds by,united states reyna,cir en banc.the issue is raised only to preserve it for possible review by the supreme court.
concerning his sentence,claims his previous conviction in pennsylvania for terroristic threats is not a cov under.the district court findings of fact are reviewed only for clear error its interpretation and application of the guidelines,de novo,united states charles,cir en banc citation omitted.
under,a cov 
i means an offense under federal,state,or local law that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another and 
ii includes murder,manslaughter,kidnapping,aggravated assault,forcible sex offenses including sexual abuse of a minor,robbery,arson,extortion,extortionate extension of credit,and burglary of a dwelling.
application note b ii emphasis added.because terroristic threats is not an offense enumerated in part ii,pennsylvania conviction for such threats can be a cov only if it has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.id.emphasis added.see united states,cir analyzing conviction at issue separately under each part of cov definition united states,cir,cert.denied,d holding offense specifically enumerated as cov need not involve,as an element,use of force.
because the cov definition includes the as an element phrase,a categorical approach is employed in other words,the facts underlying a conviction are not considered.instead,we look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for sentencing enhancement purposes,at.see also taylor united states,d using categorical approach to interpret cov at e.restated,the cov enhancement depends upon whether the predicate offense has the use of force as an element of the crime.united states,cir en banc citations omitted holding use of force required under must be intentional.
for examining the elements of the pennsylvania terroristic threats misdemeanor offense,the version of the statute under which was convicted states 
a person commits the crime of terroristic threats if the person communicates,either directly or indirectly,a threat to commit any crime of violence with intent to terrorize another cause evacuation of a building,place of assembly or facility of public transportation or otherwise cause serious public inconvenience with reckless disregard of the risk of causing such terror or inconvenience.
a emphasis added.a cov,as used in a,is not,however,defined in the pennsylvania statute.in any event,because the terroristic threats statute contains one subsection which arguably qualifies as a cov and two subsections which arguably do not,the government contended in district court and on appeal that we can look beyond the fact of conviction to determine the elements of the statute to which pleaded guilty.
the government is correct that,although the statutory definition of an offense is our primary guide,the categorical approach does not preclude looking beyond the fact of conviction in all situations.united states allen,cir.in taylor,the supreme court examined whether the defendant conviction was a burglary under e and held the sentencing court could go beyond the mere fact of conviction in a narrow range of cases where the jury was actually required to find all the elements of generic burglary.at.taylor hypothesized a burglary statute that includes both entry into an automobile and into a building,in which the guideline provided that did not qualify for an enhancement,but did.id.for such a situation,taylor held that,for enhancement purposes,the sentencing court was permitted to look to the indictment and jury instructions,if they showed the defendant was charged only with burglary of a building and the jury necessarily had to find entry into the building to convict.id.
by extension,where a defendant pleads guilty to an offense,we have allowed the sentencing court to look to the indictment to determine the elements of the statute to which the defendant pleaded guilty,united states,cir treating separately subsections of a comprehensive criminal statute and looking at indictment for sentence enhancement purposes.united states,cir,vacated for reh g en banc,cir,followed taylor and relied on the indictment where the statute of conviction contained disjunctive elements.our en banc court has not decided however,in the light of taylor and,it is proper to look beyond the fact of conviction to determine the elements of the terroristic threats statute to which pleaded guilty.
the record does not contain an information or indictment charging with the terroristic threats offense.instead,it contains only the criminal complaint and a sentencing sheet.
the criminal complaint states was accused of violating the pennsylvania statute.a again,a has three subsections and he did threaten to commit a crime of violence with the intent to terrorize.emphasis added.the complaint also includes the arresting officer affidavit,detailing the facts underlying the arrest.
the sentencing sheet appears similar to a judgment of conviction and lists two charges to which pleaded guilty and the sentence for each,including one charge of terroristic threats it does not,however,cite the section number of the terroristic threats statute or include language indicating which of the three subsections may have been involved.
in sum,only the criminal complaint including the attached affidavit describing conduct indicates that ultimately may have been charged with,and pleaded guilty to,violating a threat to commit any crime of violence with intent to terrorize another,rather than subsection a or a.more is needed.
although the district court noted at sentencing that the criminal complaint was not a charging document,it did not decide whether the documents in the record were sufficient to determine the elements of the terroristic threats statute to which pleaded guilty.instead,at the government urging,it relied on bovkun ashcroft,cir,and held all three subsections of the pennsylvania statute a fit the cov definition,thereby obviating the need to parse the statute subsections.
bovkun addressed a prior version of the terroristic threats statute and held it to be a cov under a,which defines such a crime as,inter alia,an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use or threatened use of physica
