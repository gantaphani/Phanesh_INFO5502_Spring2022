petitioner ibrahim ali koussan appeals from the denial of his request for a waiver of inadmissibility following the administrative determination that he should be removed to lebanon,his native country.before this court,koussan contends that the denial of the waiver under the section c of the immigration and nationality act ina,c,was an unconstitutional denial of equal protection and due process and,alternatively,was based upon the erroneous conclusion that applicable statutes did not contain a ground of exclusion that was comparable to the ground on which the petitioner order of removal was based koussan further asserts that the board of immigration appeals bia erred by designating only a single than a hear the administrative appeal.for the reasons set out below,we find these issues to be without merit and,therefore,deny the petition for review.
factual and procedural background 
koussan,a citizen of lebanon,entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident in at the age of eight and has resided in this country continually since that time.he was indicted in december on a charge that on august,he had knowingly,intentionally and unlawfully distribute d a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine,a schedule ii controlled substance to wit approximately grams of cocaine.koussan eventually pleaded guilty to the cocaine charge on august,exactly one year after the commission of the offense,and was sentenced to months in prison by a judgment order dated november.
years later,in may,an information was returned against koussan alleging a violation of a for making a false statement in a document required by immigration laws.specifically,that instrument charged that o n or about november,koussan falsely stated on an application for naturalization that he had never been an illicit trafficker in narcotic drugs or marijuana and that he had never knowingly committed any crime for which he ha d not been arrested.but,in fact,only three months before the november application,the petitioner had sold the cocaine that led to his conviction,and he had actually been arrested for that offense on september,a full two months before the making of the statements at issue.eventually,koussan entered a guilty plea to the charge and was sentenced by the district court to six months in prison for that offense.
on october,almost three full years after the petitioner was sentenced for the distribution of cocaine,the immigration and naturalization service ins now subsumed into the department of homeland security issued an order to show cause to koussan,thereby initiating deportation proceedings based upon that conviction.in the order,the ins alleged that koussan was removable from the united states both because the conviction qualified as an aggravated felony pursuant to the provisions of a b,see former a a iii of the ina,a a iii,and because the conviction was for a controlled substance offense,see former a b i of the ina,a b i.although koussan conceded at a january hearing that he was convicted of the distribution charge,the ins still filed additional charges of deportability against koussan on august,alleging that the petitioner was also removable from this country because he had previously been convicted of a violation of section of title relating to fraud and misuse of visas,permits,and other admission documents.see former a b iii of the ina,a b iii.
at a hearing conducted on april,an immigration judge found that koussan had been convicted previously of both distribution of cocaine and making a false statement on a document required for immigration purposes in violation of.the immigration judge thus concluded that the petitioner was removable under a b i as having been convicted of a crime relating to a controlled substance,that he removable under a a iii as being convicted of an aggravated felony and,as well,he removable under a b iii as being convicted on a violation of section,title.
koussan appealed that determination to the bia,which remanded the matter to the immigration judge for a determination of the petitioner eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility under c of the ina,c,in light of the united states supreme court decision in ins cyr,d.koussan thereafter submitted an application for such a waiver on november.finally,on december,the immigration judge denied the requested relief,holding that board precedent,matter of,i n bia,does not recognize the availability of section c relief for an alien removable under a b iii of the ina because there is no corresponding ground of inadmissibility should an applicant be seeking such relief upon returning to the united states from abroad.the bia,through a single board member,dismissed koussan subsequent appeal,declining to revisit its prior decision in matter of.the petitioner now seeks our review of that decision.
discussion 
standard of review 
when the bia issues its own separate opinion after reviewing the decision of an immigration judge,we treat that bia ruling as the final agency determination.see morgan keisler,cir.we must review all legal determinations made in such a bia ruling de novo,while granting substantial deference to the bia interpretation of the immigration and nationality act and the ina accompanying regulations.see id.
waiver of inadmissibility under section c of the ina 
in his appeal of the bia decision in this matter,koussan contends that the underlying framework supporting section c waiver determinations is unconstitutionally restrictive and that,in any event,the petitioner satisfied the existing requirements for a grant of such relief.the applicable provisions of the section c of the ina,c,are relatively straightforward.subsection a of section,as in effect prior to the repeal of subsection c,listed numerous classes of individuals who are ineligible to receive visas and who shall be excluded from admission into the united states.emphasis added.subsection c,however,titled nonapplicability of subsection a,provided 
aliens lawfully admitted for permanent resident sic who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years,may be admitted in the discretion of the attorney general without regard to the provisions of subsection a of this section other than paragraphs denying admission to spies,terrorists,assassins,communists,and nazis,among others and c denying admission to polygamists,child abductors,and guardians of excluded aliens.nothing contained in this subsection shall limit the authority of the attorney general to exercise the discretion vested in him under this title.the first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to an alien who has been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies and has served for such felony or felonies a term of imprisonment of at least years.
c thus,at least initially,certain aliens who had established a continuous domicile in the united states for at least seven years,and who had not been convicted of an aggravated felony punished by imprisonment of at least five years,were allowed to reenter the country after a voluntary departure despite the fact that those individuals had previously committed crimes that would have otherwise made them ineligible for readmission.
in,the bia issued a decision that sought to rectify an inequity that could arise in the readmission process solely by chance.because section c relief was available only to aliens detained while seeking readmission into the country,the very real possibility existed that a border official unauthorized failure to deny reentry to an individual who should otherwise have been detained would exclude that individual from later discretionary relief.in other words,if a person otherwise ineligible for readmission somehow was granted such readmission improperly,that person would have no protection during a subsequent deportation proceeding,while another individual who was properly detained upon reentry by immigration officials would be allowed to petition to remain in the country.in matter of,i n bia,the board remedied that problem by extending c relief to lawful permanent residents who commit an excludable offense in the united states,depart and return to the united states after commission of the offense,have not been put in exclusion proceedings upon return,but later end up in deportation proceedings.blake carbone,cir.
despite the bia expansive reading of section c in matter of,the board refused in to extend the scope of the statute to a lawful permanent resident who never left the united states.see matter of,i n bia,aff,cir.nevertheless,the second circuit arrived at a contrary conclusion in francis ins,cir.faced with an equal protection challenge to the differing treatment of lawful permanent residents who departed and returned to the country and lawful permanent residents who remained within the national borders,the court found no rational justification for such a distinction in consequences.recognizing that an alien whose ties with this country are so strong that he has never departed after his initial entry should receive at least as much consideration as an individual who may leave and return from time to time,id.at,the second circuit concluded that section c relief should also be available to deportable lawful permanent residents who differed from excludable lawful permanent residents only in terms of recent departure from the country.id.
the bia followed the second circuit lead and began to address section c requests from lawful permanent residents involved in deportation proceedings but who were similarly situated to persons in exclusion proceedings.blake,at citing matter of silva,i n,bia.as the court noted in blake 
with the equal protection problem identified,the difficult task became one of implementation.how to decide whether a deportee was similarly situated to an excludee answering the question proved most troublesome for the bia,who ultimately settled upon the comparable grounds the ground of deportation charged is also a ground of inadmissibility.matter of wadud,i n,bia.
while the bia,spurred on by the second circuit francis decision,attempted to develop a consistent framework for the expansion of relief under existing immigration law,congress was working at to restrict the availability of section c relief for deportees.as again summarized by the second circuit in blake 
in,congress amended c to remove the attorney general discretion to grant a waiver to aggravated felons who served more than five years in prison.see immigration act of immact,a,stat.six years later,congress eliminated c waivers altogether for lawful permanent residents convicted of an aggravated felony.see antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,d,stat.that same year congress went even further,replacing c with cancellation of removal,which explicitly denies the attorney general discretion to cancel the removal of an aggravated felon.see illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,b,stat.codified at b c.
even in light of these statutory restrictions,however,federal courts,including the united states supreme court in cyr,d,held that c relief remains available for aliens whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who,notwithstanding those convictions,would have been eligible for c relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.because koussan entered his guilty plea to the charge in may to the april,provided in h there is no dispute in this matter that the petitioner may seek a section c waiver even though that statutory provision has subsequently been repealed.
although a lawful permanent resident in koussan position is eligible to seek section c relief,applicable regulations still provide that such relief must be denied if,among other reasons,t he alien is deportable under former section of the act or removable under section of the act on a ground which does not have a statutory counterpart in section of the act.f.because koussan was indeed deportable under former section of the act it was incumbent upon the petitioner,in order to be entitled to a waiver of inadmissibility under applicable procedures,to identify a statutory counterpart in section of the act to the ground upon which the government sought to deport him.
statutory counterpart requirement 
koussan first contends,however,that the regulatory provision requiring that grounds for deportation have a statutory counterpart in the readmission exclusion provisions of section a of the act,a,need not be given effect by this court.in support of that proposition,the petitioner quotes the following portion of the second circuit opinion in blake 
the bia emphasis on similar language is strange.congress designed c to waive grounds of exclusion,not deportation.it never contemplated that its grounds of deportation would have any connection with the grounds of exclusion.by now it should be clear that the history of c relief for deportees began not with an expression of congressional intent but rather with francis.our holding in francis was compelled by the constitution.it was neither what congress wrote nor what congress intended.put simply,congress did not employ similar terms when writing the grounds of exclusion and grounds of deportation because it had no need to,making it an exercise in futility to search for similar language to gauge whether equal protection is being afforded.
unfortunately for koussan,because prior reported decisions of the sixth circuit hold to the contrary,this court is not in a position to adopt such reasoning and conclude that there need not be a comparable ground of exclusion and deportation in gjonaj ins,cir,for example,we noted,numerous courts have held there must be a comparable ground of exclusion for an alien in deportation proceedings to be eligible for section c relief.we decline to change this rule.id.at footnote omitted.likewise,in hamama ins,cir,we reiterated the holding that c relief continues to be available only if the grounds on which the alien is being deported have a counterpart in section a conditions for exclusion and that amendments to the immigration statutes had not altered the law so as to remove the exclusion counterpart requirement.id.
misrepresentation as defined in a c i 
even though we are necessarily constrained by circuit precedent to hold that a petitioner seeking a waiver of inadmissibility must identify a ground of exclusion that is a counterpart or is comparable to the ground supporting deportation,we must still independently determine whether section a of the act does,in fact,contain such a counterpart to,the ground on which koussan deportation rests.at first blush,the ground for koussan conviction under a for fraud and misuse of visas,permits,and other substantively identical to the ground for exclusion listed in section a c i,a c i misrepresentation of a material fact in order to procure a visa,other documentation,or entry into the united states or other benefit provided under the applicable statutory chapter.indeed,one portion of a seeks to punish anyone who knowingly makes under oath,or knowingly subscribes as true,any false statement with respect to a material fact in any application,affidavit,or other document required by the immigration laws or regulations prescribed thereunder.the making of such a knowingly false statement in an immigration document,see a,thus certainly seems comparable to a willful misrepresentation of a material fact in an effort to procure an immigration benefit,see a c i.
the attorney general,however,relying upon the decision of the bia in matter of,contends that such a comparable statutory counterpart does not in fact exist for a section conviction.the bia made clear in matter of that it is not the specific conduct of a petitioner that must correlate to a ground of exclusion.rather,t he essential analysis is to determine whether the deportation ground under which the alien has been adjudged deportable has a statutory counterpart among the exclusion grounds waivable by section c,i n at emphasis added.see also thap mukasey,cir.
in matter of,the bia concluded that a and the willful misrepresentation ground of admissibility at section a c i of the act are neither comparable,substantially identical,nor equivalent,id.citations omitted,in part because section goes well beyond the type of fraud or misrepresentations before an immigration officer that might underlie an alien excludability under section a c i.id.at.although a does prohibit some conduct constituting grounds for exclusion under section a,as the bia explained 
a also encompasses more serious document fraud and misuse offenses not contemplated by the willful misrepresentation language of section a c i,including the crime of selling visas,permits,and other immigration documents 
the acts falling within the reach of a include forging,counterfeiting,and falsifying documents required for entry,as well as the unauthorized possession of equipment designed for the reproduction of such documents,regardless of whether the proscribed acts were performed for personal use to procure an immigration benefit or merely for personal gain,financial or otherwise.the coverage of the statute also extends to fraud or misuse of immigration documents in furtherance of marriage fraud schemes,and knowingly accepting,possessing,or using fraudulent immigration documents,regardless of whether their acceptance,possession,or use is to procure an immigration benefit.furthermore,the language of section a c i makes absolutely no mention of criminal convictions for document fraud or misuse.
id.at citations omitted.consequently,t he vastly greater scope of a is a significant factor in the determination that these provisions are not comparable for section c waiver purposes.id.at.
such a conclusion makes intuitive sense,in light of the determination that it is not the petitioner actual activity resulting in an order of deportation that must find a section a counterpart,but rather the broader ground for deportation that must prove to be comparable to a waiver provision.if a conviction pursuant to section a is the applicable ground for deportation pursuant to the provisions of a b iii,that ground can not be comparable to the section a c i waiver provision because numerous violations of a obviously do not fall within the ambit of section a c i of the act.because we grant substantial deference to bia interpretations of the ina,see morgan keisler,at,we take our lead in this matter from the decision in matter of and hold that koussan was not entitled to a waiver of inadmissibility based upon his guilty plea to the charge of violating a 
crimes involving moral turpitude under a a i i 
again forced to concede that circuit precedent recognizes that a section c waiver is proper only when a lawful permanent resident is deportable on a ground that has a statutory counterpart in section a,the petitioner alternatively submits that he is entitled to consideration for a waiver of inadmissibility because the ground alleged for his violation of a is comparable to another ground for of a crime involving moral turpitude.see a a i i of the act,a a i i.the attorney general disagrees and relies upon bia precedent for the proposition that the ground for deportation lodged against koussan includes all provisions of a,and that parts of that statutory subsection have no counterpart within section a a i i exclusion provisions for crimes involving moral turpitude.
in support of his position,the attorney general cites,among other rulings,the bia decision in matter of wadud,which does not identify a specific act that merits the deportation.instead,the bia decision states merely that wadud was to be deported pursuant to section a of the act,the former version of a.see matter of wadud,i n at.as such,the order of deportation encompassed numerous possible offenses ranging from the simple failure to inform the attorney general of a change of address,see a a,to the felony fraud proscribed by,see a b iii.in light of such generality,the bia ruled that wadud was not eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility because section a did not contain a ground of inadmissibility coextensive with the provisions of a.
wadud contended,however,that section a a i i,a a i i,excludes from admission into the country aliens convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude,and that his fraudulent activities surely fell within that statutory ban.nevertheless,the bia declined to expand the scope of section c relief in cases where the ground of deportability charged is not also a ground of inadmissibility.matter of wadud,i n at.in doing so,the board concluded 
were we to hold otherwise,an anomolous sic situation would result in cases where deportability is charged under section a of the act since most of the offenses described in that section do not involve moral turpitude.to afford section c relief only to those aliens whose crime under section a involved moral turpitude would be to reward those guilty of a more egregious offense for their greater culpability.we are unable to conclude that congress intended such an inequitable consequence to ensue from the implementation of section c.
whereas the government sought generally to deport wadud pursuant to section a of the act and thus did not differentiate among the numerous offenses encompassed by that single legislative provision,koussan august additional charges of deportability specified that the petitioner was to answer claims that he violated section a b iii of the act and that he was convicted on october,in the united states district court for false statement on document required by immigration laws for a violation of title,united states code,section relating to fraud and misuse of visas,permits and other entry documents.consequently,koussan argues that,unlike the situation in matter of wadud,the petitioner proceedings here afford a opportunity to consider whether fraudulent statements made in an immigration document are substantially similar to crimes involving moral turpitude.matter of wadud,contends koussan,is thus clearly distinguishable from the situation presented in this case and should not serve as a basis for denying further examination of the petitioner claim for relief.
nevertheless,we must accord substantial deference to the bia interpretation of the ina and its accompanying regulations.see morgan,at.doing so,we are constrained to agree with the board ruling in matter of wadud that section a of the act does not contain a ground of the ground referring to crimes involving moral can be considered a statutory counterpart to a.see thap,at.
equal protection considerations 
moreover,adoption of koussan argument in this regard would require us to side with the second circuit decision in blake and align this court against every other circuit court that has addressed the issue in a published opinion.see,mukasey,cir,petition for cert.filed,abebe gonzales,cir vo gonzales,cir caroleo gonzales,cir valere gonzales,cir.doing so would also necessarily constitute an implicit adoption of blake conclusion that an equal protection analysis of such a claim inevitably leads to abandonment of the statutory counterpart requirement of f as interpreted by most courts.
in blake,the second circuit determined that it need not defer to the bia interpretation of the statutory counterpart rule.blake,at.instead,the court the concepts presented by the section a grounds of exclusion and the statutory grounds for deportation and chose to examine the circumstances of the deportable alien,rather than the language congress used to classify his or her status.id.at.consequently,under the second circuit equal protection mandates,if a petitioner underlying offense could form the basis of a ground of exclusion if the petitioner were seeking readmission into the united states,that petitioner would be eligible for a section c waiver.see id.at.according to the second circuit,its precedent in francis compels no less and requires that every deportee be treated exactly as if he or she were seeking readmission with an identical criminal history.
koussan argues that this second circuit position involves a recognition that equal protection principles require a court to examine the situation of an individual seeking readmission into the united states and to treat a person in deportation proceedings in exactly the same manner.if,therefore,a lawful permanent resident previously convicted of a vio
