opinion of the court 
factual and procedural history 
this matter comes on before this court on a petition for review of a decision and order of the board of immigration appeals bia dated may,denying petitioner neng long wang wang asylum and withholding of removal and ordering his removal to china.we set forth the background of the case in some detail 
wang,who was born in china on october,is the older of two children.his sister was born in february.before his sister was born,wang parents worked and earned approximately yuan per month.at that time the family lived in a house with a bathroom,living room,dining room and kitchen.wang parents lack formal education and do not speak mandarin chinese,the language apparently used in governmental matters.
though china has a per family policy to control the size of its population,wang parents were unaware of the policy until after his sister was born,an event leading the chinese government to fine the family for having a second child.the local government authority sent a notice to wang parents informing them of the imposition of a yuan fine against them approximately as of exchange rates times their lowest estimated monthly salary by reason of the birth of their second child.wang,however,does not claim that the government imposed the fine on him or that he was responsible for its payment.wang parents could not afford to pay the fine and thus decided to flee.at that time the family left their village and split up,wang going to live with his grandmother in one village while the remaining members relocated to another.the family,however,subsequently reunited and returned to its home.
wang father obtained permission to pay the fine by on an installment basis.nevertheless,the government repeatedly subjected the wang family household to property destruction and harassment because the fine remained unpaid.thus,from the time of his sister birth in february until the date of wang administrative hearing in these proceedings on october,governmental authorities made between ten and sixteen visits seeking payment of the fine.wang testified,every time they show up they always keep on asking us why do we pay up the remaining balance and they start destroying,smashing our chairs and furnitures sic.ar at yet the authorities intrusions into the family life had their limitations as neither wang nor his sister had any trouble attending school,and the authorities never arrested,detained or fined wang.accordingly,it is clear that the authorities did not direct their actions at wang.
wang father left china in to earn enough money to pay the fine.for three years,he worked in argentina and sent money back to china to support his family and to pay the fine incrementally.nevertheless chinese government officials continued to visit the house,causing destruction and continuing to harass the family while wang father worked in argentina.while wang father was in argentina he was kidnapped,in response to which wang mother borrowed from a bank,using the family home as collateral,to pay a ransom.wang father returned to china in but was not arrested or detained on his return.after wang father return,the government continued to harass the family.
in government authorities presented the family with another notice reflecting the yuan fine.this notice did not credit the family with payments already made on the fine.in that same year government officials sterilized wang mother and totally destroyed the family home.id.at.the family,however,was able to recover blankets from the home and subsequently relocated,first to wang grandmother house and then to a home.the wangs previous residence was comprised of two stories and several rooms.
wang father later unsuccessfully attempted to leave china a second time in search of work.the family began to rely on an uncle generosity to survive,but the uncle could not provide the family with enough money to continue to pay the fine.eventually wang parents opened a snack bar business,but government authorities destroyed the equipment of the business late in and started laughing on the way out.id.at.
subsequently,with the help of smugglers,wang physically arrived in the united states on december,at jfk international airport where he was detained.upon his arrival wang applied for admission to the united states,but the immigration service denied that application and instead instituted administrative removal proceedings against him.the notice to appear served on him charged that he was not in possession of valid entry documents and that it was likely he would become a public charge if admitted.wang admitted that the entry document charge was valid,but in an effort to prevent removal he applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture.
wang fears that if he returns to china,the chinese authorities will arrest him because he left the country illegally and the arrest could lead to the imposition of another yuan fine.because wang family lacks the ability to pay this amount,wang fears that he will remain in custody if he returns to china.wang family hopes that he will be able to live safely in the united states and earn enough money so that the family can pay its debts.
an immigration judge held a hearing on wang application following which the judge issued a written decision and order dated november,denying wang application for asylum but granting his application for withholding of removal.the government appealed the decision and order of the immigration judge to the bia to the extent it granted wang request for withholding of removal and wang to the extent it denied him asylum.the bia sustained the government appeal and ordered wang removed to china on june.
wang timely filed a petition for review of the bia decision with this court and simultaneously filed a motion with the bia for reconsideration of its june,decision,arguing that it failed to address his.the bia granted wang motion for reconsideration and vacated its june,decision on may,however,in the same decision,the bia sustained the government appeal for a second time,dismissed wang,and ordered his removal.
wang filed a timely petition for review of the bia may,decision on june,with this court.he then moved to withdraw his original petition for review and on july,we granted that motion.at that time we also stayed his removal pending the disposition of these proceedings.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the bia had jurisdiction in this matter under b,and we have jurisdiction to review the final order of removal under section a of the immigration and nationality act ina,a.see chen ashcroft,cir.
congress has directed us to treat the bia findings of fact as conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.ina b b b b see ins,d.a determination of whether an asylum applicant has suffered from persecution or whether that individual has a fear of persecution is factual and thus is entitled to deference.abdille ashcroft,cir.
we review the bia attempts to fill gaps in the ina under the supreme court direction requiring us to respect the interpretation of the agency to which congress has delegated the responsibility for administering the statutory program,but also under the direction that the courts decide pure questions of statutory construction.ins,d see fatin ins,cir quoting the court statement in chevron,natural resources defense council,d that if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute chang ins,cir quoting the supreme court in chevron,at.at,to state that we will not substitute our own judgment for that of the bia,but we must also reject any interpretation by the bia that is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.
iii.discussion 
determination framework 
section b of the ina,b,provides the attorney general with discretion to grant asylum to a refugee,with certain exceptions.in general,a refugee is any person who is outside any country of such person nationality who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.ina a a a a.an applicant has the burden to establish that he fits within this definition of refugee.a.
an applicant may establish his refugee status by showing either that he has been subject to past persecution or has a fear of future persecution.the persecution,however,must be on account of one of the five statutory bases.b.it is presumed that an applicant who establishes that he suffered past persecution has a fear of persecution.b.the government may rebut this presumption,however,by showing by a preponderance of evidence that t here has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a fear of persecution in the applicant country of nationality or that the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant country of nationality.b i a b.
congress has provided that a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization,or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program is deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion.ina a b a b.similarly,a person who has a fear that he will be subject to such procedures or will be subject to persecution for resisting such procedures is deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.ina a b a b.
while the decision to grant or deny an applicant asylum is discretionary even if he establishes that he meets the statutory eligibility requirements,the government must grant withholding of removal,with certain exceptions,to an applicant if he demonstrates a clear probability that,upon return to his home country,his life or freedom would be threatened on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.ina b a b a ins stevic,d.in harmony with the asylum regulations,the regulations governing withholding of removal provide that an applicant bears the burden to establish eligibility for withholding of removal and if the applicant establishes that he suffered persecution in the past,it shall be presumed that the applicant life or freedom would be threatened in the future b.as in cases involving applications for asylum,the government may rebut this presumption by showing that a change in circumstances has removed the basis for the applicant to have a fear of persecution or by showing that the threat is not.b.
under the convention against torture,an applicant is entitled to withholding of removal if he establishes that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c.the regulation defines torture as any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted by a public official for certain purposes.a.
b.the decisions of the immigration judge and the board of immigration appeals 
the immigration judge recognized two potential bases for wang application for asylum.the first basis was that he and his family had suffered past persecution resulting from his parents violation of china family planning policies.the second basis was that wang is a member of a particular social group consisting of poor and uneducated chinese who are forced to pay a heavy fine far larger than they can afford for violating the family planning policies.the heavy fine,the theory goes,forces members of this particular social group to turn to international smuggling operations to search for work in foreign lands and the chinese government directly and indirectly supports those smuggling organizations.the immigration judge summarily dismissed the second basis due to a lack of evidence that official chinese government policy is either to encourage alien smuggling or to support such endeavors.ar at.accordingly,the immigration judge focused on wang first basis,past persecution due to his parents violation of the family planning laws.wang does not pursue his second argument vigorously in these proceedings,which we note,in any event,insofar as the record here reveals,could not be substantial.rather,he focuses on his first argument predicated on china family planning policies.
the immigration judge found that the chinese government actions against wang and his family amounted to persecution where the respondent mother was forcibly sterilized and where the family home was completely destroyed when his parents were unable to pay the family planning fine.id.the immigration judge acknowledged that wang parents were the government primary targets,but stated that t hese actions against the respondent sic parents effectively extended to the respondent,who found himself without a home.id.at.while the immigration judge was not prepared to rule that a child may legally take the place of a spouse for all purposes,the judge did conclude that there is sufficient evidence in this record to establish that this respondent was directly affected by the chinese government persecution of his parents and can legally stand in their shoes as one who has been persecuted.id.
nevertheless the immigration judge did not grant asylum to wang because the judge concluded that sufficient adverse factors weighed against a discretionary grant of asylum.id.at.those factors included the circumstance that wang was not fleeing direct persecution,had attended school,the past persecution was not based on physical harm,and he did not leave china to escape future physical harm.primarily,however,the immigration judge relied on the fact that wang family had hired smugglers to transport him to the united states as the discretionary basis for denying his application for asylum.the immigration judge determined that b y granting asylum to otherwise marginally aliens,such as this young respondent,such results accomplish little more than to reward the smugglers and provide more incentive for other families to put their children into harm way.id.at 
even though the immigration judge reasoning led the judge to deny a grant of asylum,the judge determined that wang had met the burden of proof for a grant of withholding of removal because he had established a clear probability of persecution upon his return to china.inasmuch as a grant of withholding of removal is not discretionary if the statutory requirements are met,the immigration judge ordered that wang removal be withheld.wang also sought relief under the convention against torture,but the immigration judge did not address this claim due to the grant of withholding of removal.
the government appealed and in a june,decision,the bia sustained the government appeal.the bia concluded that wang failed to establish either past persecution or a fear of future persecution based on any one of the five statutory grounds for granting asylum.id.at.the bia dismissed wang argument regarding his fear of imprisonment upon return to china predicated on his action in leaving the country illegally because he did not prove that the exit policy in china constitutes punishment for invidious reasons rather than being a law of general applicability.id.at.the bia found that the harm that wang claimed from past persecution stemming from his parents violation of the family planning policies was too indirect to establish past persecution.id.because the board found the connection to be too tenuous,it agreed with the government that wang did not prove his eligibility for asylum protection.without further discussion,the board also determined wang to be ineligible for protection under the convention against torture and for withholding of removal.
wang moved for reconsideration on the basis that the bia failed to address his in its june,decision.the board granted wang motion for reconsideration,vacated its june,decision and order,and entered a new decision and order dated may.wang petition for review addresses the may,decision and order.
in this second decision and order d
