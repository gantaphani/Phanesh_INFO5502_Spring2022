celia morales is a mexican citizen who has resided in the united states since her original entry without inspection in.after briefly returning to mexico to attend to her gravely ill mother,morales repeatedly and unsuccessfully attempted to reenter the united states in march.ultimately,she was arrested and convicted for the latter attempt.upon morales release from imprisonment,the immigration and naturalization service ins initiated removal proceedings,and morales in turn applied for cancellation of removal.the immigration judge ij ruled that morales brief absence from the country rendered her ineligible under the statute for cancellation of removal,and on that ground only,rejected her petition.the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed without opinion under its streamlining procedure.because we conclude that the statute did not preclude this relief for morales,we grant her petition for review and remand for further proceedings.
morales first entered the united states without inspection,illegally in june at age.she is married to a lawful permanent resident of the united states and is the mother of four citizen children,ranging in age from nine to years old.as far as this record shows,morales remained in the united states from the time of her entry until early march,when she returned to mexico to visit her ailing mother.on march,after about two weeks in mexico,morales reentered the united states without inspection.the border patrol promptly detained her informally,and she voluntarily returned to mexico.these events repeated themselves on three more occasions over the course of six days.morales testified that each time the border patrol just took me,threw me around,and turned me back.importantly,she never appeared before an immigration judge,and no removal proceedings were initiated.on march,the border patrol apprehended morales as she entered the country without inspection for the fifth time.this time the authorities took matters more seriously.morales was charged with,and pleaded guilty to,illegal entry in violation of and,and was sentenced to days imprisonment,which she served.
upon completion of her sentence,morales was released into the custody of the ins,which initiated removal proceedings.shortly thereafter,morales applied for cancellation of removal under b.on january,an ij found that morales return to mexico by the immigration service was meaningfully interruptive of her physical presence,and therefore she could not satisfy the ten years of continuous physical presence required for eligibility for cancellation of removal.see b a.on this basis,the ij denied morales application for cancellation of removal and ordered that she be deported to mexico.morales appealed to the bia,which affirmed without opinion under its streamlining procedure on october.see a.this petition for review followed.
before we reach the merits of morales appeal,we must address several preliminary matters.the first concerns this court jurisdiction over her petition for review.we have an independent obligation to ensure that subject matter jurisdiction is proper before proceeding to the merits,even where,as here,neither of the parties has raised this as an issue in the case.smith am.life acc.ins,cir.the governing statute is a b,which reads as follows 
b denials of discretionary relief 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,no court shall have jurisdiction to review 
i any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section h,i,or of this title,or 
ii any other decision or action of the attorney general the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general,other than the granting of relief under section a of this title.
section,which is included in the list in part i,governs cancellation of removal.the question before us is whether this statute was intended to preclude all judicial review whatsoever,or only judicial review of the way in which the attorney general exercises his discretion.at first blush,the language of the statute appears to be quite broad read literally,it would preclude judicial review even of a decision by the attorney general to deny cancellation of removal to all muslims,or a decision by the attorney general to eliminate this form of relief from the statute altogether.in other areas of immigration law,however,courts have resisted such an extreme position.instead,relying on the proposition that at a minimum,jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction exists,see jideonwo ins,cir,courts have exercised the authority to decide whether the particular alien claim falls within the scope of the statute.see,yang ins,cir deciding whether the alien had committed one of the enumerated crimes that leads to automatic,and unreviewable,removal from the united states.
although it is true that morales ultimately wants cancellation of removal,that is not the relief she is seeking before this good reason,as we have no power to grant that relief.instead,she seeks to have the attorney general consider her petition for cancellation of removal under the correct interpretation of the eligibility requirements set forth in b.that is not the same as requesting review of the grant or denial of cancellation of removal,any more than the request by certain caucasian applicants to the university of michigan for a admissions process necessarily included a demand for a spot in the class.see gratz bollinger,d relief requested included damages,an injunction requiring reformation of the admissions process,and only lastly an order requiring an opportunity to transfer to the university.morales petition only indirectly concerns the ultimate grant or denial of cancellation of removal its focus is on the meaning of the statutory criteria that cabin the attorney general decisionmaking.in that respect,it is much like yang,where the only issue was whether the petitioner had committed the kind of crime that led to removal.
although our conclusion that a b does not foreclose review of this narrow set of questions is consistent with the fact that the statute expressly refers to denials of discretionary review in the caption,we recognize that the caption alone is of limited help in understanding the actual text of the law.compare ins cyr,d holding that a section captioned elimination of review by habeas corpus did not eliminate all such review.we come to this result instead because the statute does not clearly indicate that the exclusion from judicial review is so extreme as to purport to authorize the attorney general to disregard both the constitution and the statutory criteria set forth by congress.as we suggested in fornalik perryman,cir,a case may fall outside a b scope because the petitioner is challenging a pure error of law,not the exercise of discretion.id.at ashcroft,cir we retain jurisdiction under a b to review the purely legal and hence question whether the applicant adult daughter qualifies as a child for purposes of the exceptional and extremely unusual hardship requirement.citations omitted.
we have taken the same approach to the very next subsection of the statute,a c,which provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in certain enumerated sections.in applying a c,we have held that all persons ordered removed retain the right to judicial review of the antecedent,questions,such as whether they are aliens and whether they have committed disqualifying crimes.gill ashcroft,cir see also bosede ashcroft,cir we have held before on a number of occasions that the provisions in the amendments to the immigration laws do not prevent us from determining whether the alien is being removed for a permissible reason.
our conclusion is also consistent with the decisions of the other circuits that have already confronted the question before us,namely,whether the determination that an alien has established continuous physical presence for purposes of b a is subject to judicial review.in kalaw ins,cir,the ninth circuit considered whether a b barred judicial review of a bia determination that an alien had not satisfied the continuous physical presence requirement for suspension of deportation,the equivalent of cancellation of removal under prior law.id.at.the court concluded that continuous physical presence must be determined from the facts,not through an exercise of discretion.id.it further stated that t here are legal standards guiding this inquiry,and we have reversed the bia determination when it applied the wrong standard.id.internal citations omitted.it concluded that a b do es not remove appellate jurisdiction over an alien challenge to the bia denial of an application for suspension of deportation solely on th e ground of continuous physical presence.see also falcon carriche ashcroft,cir.citing kalaw,the fifth circuit recently held that whether an alien satisfies the continuous physical presence requirement is a nondiscretionary determination because it involves straightforward statutory interpretation and application of law to fact.ashcroft,cir.that court too concluded that it had jurisdiction to review whether the petitioner was ineligible for cancellation because he lacked the required continuous presence.id.
we find this analysis persuasive and join our sister circuits in holding that the meaning of the term continuous physical presence is a question of statutory interpretation.as such,it falls outside a b rule.we thus are free to proceed to decide the antecedent,question whether the ij correctly interpreted the rules determining when a break in physical presence has occurred.
before answering this question,we offer a brief comment on the procedural posture of this case.as noted above,the bia gave this case only streamlined review.the bia streamlining procedure set out in a provides that a single member of the bia may affirm,without opinion,the results of an ij decision if the member determines that the result reached in the decision under review was correct that any errors in the decision under review were harmless or and that a the issue on appeal is squarely controlled by existing board or federal court precedent and does not involve the application of precedent to a novel fact situation or b the factual and legal questions raised on appeal are so insubstantial that review is not warranted.if a case is streamlined,the ij decision becomes that of the bia for purposes of judicial review.georgis ashcroft,cir.thus,while t his court reviews only the final determinations of the bia,in practical effect this means the ij decision in a case like this one.
streamlining has its institutional costs,however,and it seems that they were incurred in this case.unfortunately,the procedural short cut the board took may have caused it to overlook the ij reliance on a defunct legal principle and one of its own intervening decisions.we do not know that,of course,because the thinking of the responsible bia member is entirely opaque.we turn perforce to the ij opinion,which offers the rationale for the decision that the agency must now defend.
the statute governing cancellation of removal is.it is important to recall that this statute permits the attorney general to cancel removal not only for aliens who were lawfully admitted for permanent residence,see a,but also for aliens who are inadmissible or deportable from the united states,see b,if the alien 
a has been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than years immediately preceding the date of such application 
b has been a person of good moral character during such period 
c has not been convicted of certain enumerated offenses and 
d establishes that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien spouse,parent,or child,who is a citizen of the united states or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
the statute goes on to specify special rules relating to continuous residence of physical presence in d it is the rules specifying the proper treatment of certain breaks in presence,d,that lie at the heart of morales case 
treatment of certain breaks in presence 
an alien shall be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical presence in the united states under subsections b and b of this section if the alien has departed from the united states for any period in excess of days or for any periods in the aggregate exceeding days.
morales petition for cancellation of removal required the ij to determine whether,for purposes of d,she had failed to maintain continuous physical presence in the united states because she had departed from the united states for any single period in excess of days or for several periods that in the aggregate exceeded days.if,as the ij thought,morales illegal reentries had the effect of starting the clock anew,then she is not eligible for cancellation of removal.if,on the other hand,those reentries did not have this effect as a matter of law,then the ij decision was based on an erroneous foundation.the number of days morales was gone was undisputed she was out of the country for less than days.the ij nonetheless decided that she was ineligible under the statute because,in his view,departures for periods shorter than those specified in d could also qualify as breaks in physical presence for purposes of b a.
in reaching this result,the ij relied on the superseded fleuti doctrine,under which an alien innocent,casual,and brief departure from this country was not a break in physical presence,see tapia ashcroft,cir,whereas when an alien left the united states for a reason that is inconsistent with the policies reflected in this country immigration laws,the interruption of residence thereby occurring would properly be regarded as meaningful.selimi ins,cir quoting rosenberg fleuti,d.the ij reasoned that i n light of the ambiguity in the heading of d whose heading is worded treatment of certain breaks in presence emphasis added,rather than treatment of all breaks in presence the fleuti doctrine and the concept of meaningfully interruptive departures still exist under the current law.as morales return to the united states could not be considered casual,and certainly not meaningless,the ij concluded that she could not establish continuous physical presence and thus was ineligible for cancellation of removal.
the ij analysis fails to take into account the fact that the fleuti doctrine was superceded by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,stat,iirira.see tapia,at in re,bia thus,we find that the fleuti doctrine does not survive the enactment of the iirira as a judicial doctrine.under the iirira,t he physical presence requirement does not include the innocent,casual,and brief standard,and instead opts for a quantitative absence outside the country for more than days at a time,or days in total,breaks the physical presence requirement.tapia,at emphasis added,at noting that the previous use of the brief,casual,and innocent concept was not carried forward by congress in the iirira new cancellation of removal provisions.before this court,the government has acknowledged that the ij erred in relying on the fleuti doctrine.it is also clear from the facts that morales was nowhere near either the or the period established by the statute.we see no warrant for the ij to read this statute as establishing only a maximum number of days,rather than a administrative rule.
the government has attempted to salvage the ij not his reading of the arguing that this was a harmless error in light of the bia subsequent decision in in re,bia,which was decided after the ij decision in morales case but before the bia summary affirmance,holds that a departure that is compelled under threat of the institution of deportation or removal proceedings is a break in physical presence for purposes of b.id.at.
helps the government,however,only if it applies to morales situation.as we explain in more detail below,it does not.furthermore,this is a theory that is entirely absent from the ij opinion,and thus we have no reason to think that the ij or the bia would have extended to morales distinctly different circumstances.while government counsel may think that there is a good reason to do so,a lawyer arguments can n
