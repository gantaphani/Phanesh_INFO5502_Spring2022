jarbough is a native and citizen of syria.in march,he entered the united states as a authorized to remain until june of that year.jarbough overstayed his visa,and in december he filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat jarbough claimed to have suffered persecution in syria on account of his being a druze and on account of a political opinion imputed to him by the syrian government.
jarbough conceded that he filed his asylum application more than one year after his arrival in the united states.however,he claimed that extraordinary circumstances excused the delay.see a b,d.specifically,in may,jarbough consulted with an attorney not counsel in the present appeal.jarbough described his troubles in syria,and the attorney opined that jarbough had little hope of winning asylum.when the meeting ended,the men went their separate ways.critically,though,the attorney neglected to mention the deadline for filing an asylum application.according to jarbough,this negligent omission was an extraordinary circumstance capable of tolling the deadline.
as to the merits,jarbough styled his application as a mixed motives case.see singh gonzales,cir.he claimed that the syrian government decision to persecute him resulted from a number of factors.first and foremost,he was a druze.jarbough claimed that the syrian government has traditionally suspected the druze of collaborating with the israelis.second,jarbough had served in the syrian military and worked as a civilian employee of the ministry of defense.third,he had been in communication with his uncle,a resident of the golan heights.in early,jarbough uncle visited his family in syria for the first time since the war.jarbough and his uncle subsequently spent two days together.this apparently raised the suspicions of the syrian intelligence authorities.jarbough claimed that these authorities believed he was an israeli spy and,for that,they persecuted him.
a few weeks after the visit from jarbough uncle,syrian intelligence officers seized jarbough from his home and took him to their facility.the officers placed jarbough in an interrogation room that contained wires and electrical cables.they told jarbough,i f you do tell the truth you will have the feel of it.appendix app.although the officers did not use the electrical devices,they repeatedly screamed at jarbough and jabbed their fingers and fists into his shoulder.after four hours of interrogation,they released him.
ten days later,the authorities seized jarbough again.this time he remained in their custody for two days.once again,the officers cursed and screamed,yelling,you are a spy,all of you are.app.in the interrogation room,jarbough saw machines that looked similar to torture devices he had seen on television.the officers did not use the devices,but they did administer a series of kicks,shoves,and pushes.after two days,the officers released jarbough and told him to remain in his house.jarbough had some bruises,but he did not go to a doctor because his injuries did not really require immediate medical intervention.app.shortly thereafter,he left for the united states.
jarbough recounted these tribulations at an august hearing before an ij.at the beginning of the hearing,jarbough attorney asked for a continuance.he wanted a delay to secure the expert testimony of professor joshua landis,a scholar in the historical plight of the syrian druze.the ij responded that she was finishing th e case today.app.her next available hearing date was in april,and she viewed an delay as unacceptable.rebuffed,jarbough attorney instead submitted an article by professor landis.see joshua landis,shishakli and the druzes integration and intransigence,in the syrian land processes of integration and fragmentation philipp schaebler,reprinted in app.the ij stated that she would certainly take note of th e article.app.
jarbough attorney also sought to introduce the testimony of norris.like jarbough,is a syrian druze.he was prepared to describe the syrian government persecution of his family.according to counsel,this evidence would show that people similarly situated to jarbough have disappeared are being killed based on the fact that they are d ruze.app.the ij refused to allow it.she reasoned that testimony would effectively require her to entertain asylum applications.app.nonetheless,jarbough counsel did submit an affidavit from.in it,spoke generally about the druze religion,discussed the persecution of the druze by the syrian government,and stated that on feb ruary,his father was killed in battle with the syrian army.app.
with these preliminary considerations disposed of,jarbough took the stand and testified.during the hearing,the ij repeatedly sustained objections that jarbough counsel was asking leading questions.at one point,there occurred a rather testy exchange between the ij and jarbough attorney.jarbough was describing the cables he had seen in the intelligence facility interrogation room.counsel asked,what kind of cables were these app.at this point,the department of homeland security attorney objected on relevance grounds.jarbough attorney responded,they electrical cables.id.moments later,jarbough parroted,electrical cables.id.this angered the ij.she scolded jarbough attorney and admonished him to s top giving the answers.app.
jarbough testimony continued.the next day,the ij heard closing arguments and rendered an oral decision.she concluded that no extraordinary circumstances excused jarbough failure to comply with the deadline.in the alternative,she found that jarbough had not established eligibility for asylum.the ij also found him ineligible for withholding of removal and cat relief.
on appeal,the bia affirmed.it adopted most of the ij findings and added a few thoughts of its own.specifically,it explained in greater detail why the omission by the attorney jarbough visited did not constitute an extraordinary circumstance.
this petition for review followed.jarbough challenges the bia rejection of his asylum application as untimely,its denial of withholding of removal,and he also contends that several of the ij rulings as well as her conduct violated the due process clause.
we consider first jarbough claim that extraordinary circumstances excused the late filing of his asylum application.under a b,an alien must file an asylum application within one year of his arrival in the united states.a application may be excused if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the attorney general either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application a d.immediately after that provision,paragraph a states that n o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the attorney general under paragraph.a.accordingly,in tarrawally ashcroft,cir,we held that a stripped us of jurisdiction to review a determination that an asylum petition was not filed within the one year limitations period,and that such period was not tolled by extraordinary circumstances.id.at.
after tarrawally,however,congress enacted the real id act of.section of the real id act restored our jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review real id act of a a iii,a d 
the jurisdictional grant of a d is narrowly circumscribed.see saloum citizenship immig,cir higuit gonzales,cir.for instance,it is clear that courts of appeals continue to have no jurisdiction to review discretionary and factual determinations presented in petitions for review.see,di
