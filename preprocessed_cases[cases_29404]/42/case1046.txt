petitioner tatiana pavlova pavlova,a native and citizen of the russian federation,petitions for review of a december,order of the bia,which summarily affirmed an ij july,decision denying her application for asylum,for withholding of removal under the immigration and nationality act of ina,as amended,as well as for withholding of removal under the convention against torture cat the ij found pavlova account of persecution to be incredible.he also concluded that,even if her story were credible,she did not qualify for the relief requested because the mistreatment she described lacked the government involvement necessary to constitute persecution within the meaning of the ina.because the ij credibility finding rested on serious errors,and because he misstated the legal standard governing the level of government involvement needed to support a claim of persecution,we grant the petition for review,vacate the decision of the bia,and remand the case to the bia for further proceedings.
at her removal hearing,pavlova testified that,as a member of the baptist faith,she had been subjected to violence and threats by russian national unity rnu,a russian nationalist group founded and led by alexandr barkashov.according to pavlova,the rnu acts of aggression began in may when rnu members beat pavlova and others for proselytizing in a public park.although pavlova reported this incident to the authorities,the rnu was apparently undeterred.as the proselytizing continued,so did the beatings.in early,pavlova was attacked while walking home from a prayer meeting.later that year,igor nazim,a member of pavlova prayer group,died from injuries sustained in a similar attack.
in march,pavlova and her fellow baptists founded a business,the purpose of which was to print and distribute religious literature.over the next two years,the rnu waged a campaign of aggression to disrupt the operations of this business.the opening salvo in this violent campaign was apparently aimed at vladimir tkachenko,a fellow baptist and one of pavlova business colleagues.in the summer of,tkachenko began receiving threats concerning his role in distributing literature for the business.tkachenko ignored the threats and,in august,was hit by a truck on the street and killed.one year later,in june,two rnu members broke into pavlova home and destroyed office equipment and printed literature.although their activities were temporarily crippled by this setback,pavlova and her colleagues reopened the business a few months later,relocating it in belgorod.any hope of benefitting from the anonymity of the city was dashed when,in november,rnu members appeared at the new business office and threatened pavlova and the others with force unless they shut down operations within one week.when the deadline arrived without the business having been closed,true to their threats,the rnu members destroyed the printing equipment and violently assaulted the workers.during this melee,one of pavlova colleagues,alexander malachev,sustained injuries from which he later died.pavlova herself was knocked unconscious and raped.when she finally awakened at the hospital,she learned that,as a result of the ordeal,her internal organs had been ruptured and that she had to undergo surgery.
unfortunately for pavlova,her travails did not end there.while in the hospital,pavlova provided testimony to the authorities that one of her assailants was a former schoolmate and neighbor,alexander tkachenko.upon her release from the hospital,pavlova began receiving threats pressuring her to change her testimony.then,one day,on her way home from a church service in belgorod,pavlova heard a gunshot and fell to the ground.the bullet had missed pavlova and lodged into one of the walls next to her house.
seeking a safe haven,pavlova moved in with relatives in moscow,but rnu members quickly discovered pavlova new location.pavlova changed addresses again,this time sharing space with fellow baptists who warned her that she was still at risk.aware that she had to spend some amount of time outside of russia in a safe place,pavlova nevertheless did not want to leave russia forever.acting on a desire to visit the united states,pavlova acquired a visa from the united states embassy and an airplane ticket through a tour agency where she was working and left russia.six months after arriving in the united states,pavlova extended her visa when she learned from relatives that it was not yet safe for her to return to russia.after extending her visa,pavlova discovered that a fellow baptist,alexander cazlitin had been killed by rnu fourth such she decided to apply for asylum 
before her removal hearing,pavlova submitted into evidence,inter alia,a passport,visa and other identification two letters from the evangelical house of prayer in new york,indicating that she is a member a photograph of herself showing a pelvic scar a number of articles from news outlets and other materials concerning religion in russia,and in particular,the impact of a law of religion that treats minority christian sects less favorably than the russian orthodox church a death certificate for igor nazin,whom she identified as one of the baptists beaten to death a notice from local administrators that tkachenko,whom she identified as an rnu attacker,had been reprimanded for small hooliganism materials describing rnu,some of which appear to be taken from websites and a supplemental affidavit,describing in detail the incidents of persecution that form the basis for her asylum claims.following an adjournment in her hearing,pavlova submitted,inter alia,a letter from a fellow baptist,elena karabutova,that corroborated rnu violent disruption of the publishing operation and the continuing danger to baptists,and a letter from a gynecologist,jason halper,stating his conclusion,on the basis of a physical examination,that pavlova had operations on both ovaries which could have been necessitated by a rape.halper also testified to this effect after the adjournment.
in an oral decision,the ij provided seven grounds for his adverse credibility determination.first,the ij found it implausible that,having suffered beatings and a rape in russia,pavlova would come to the united states solely for the purpose of tourism.second,the ij questioned why pavlova decided to apply for asylum nearly one year after her arrival in the united states and only after learning of the murder of her fellow baptist,alexander cazlitin.third,the ij regarded as inconsistent pavlova testimony regarding her decision not to see a gynecologist in the united states.fourth,the ij faulted her for failing to mention her rape and the killings of the three other fellow baptists in the statement accompanying her application for asylum.fifth,the ij found it suspicious that pavlova could not accurately describe her medical condition.sixth,the ij found deficient pavlova corroborating evidence.finally,the ij identified certain pieces of corroborating evidence that,despite their availability,pavlova had failed to submit.
as another basis for rejecting pavlova application for asylum and withholding,the ij found that pavlova had not alleged the requisite degree of government involvement in her persecution.the ij concluded that pavlova has at no time indicated that she was ever subjected to persecution,abuse,or harassment by any element of the russian government.
because pavlova failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum,the ij found that she also failed to meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.the ij further concluded that,taking into account pavlova testimony and evidentiary submissions,there is no basis to believe that she has ever been subjected to torture in her home country nor that she would be subjected to torture there upon her return.the ij denied voluntary departure,as pavlova gave no evidence that she could afford to buy a ticket to leave the united states.
on december,the bia summarily affirmed,without opinion,the decision of the ij.pavlova filed a motion to reopen,which was also denied.
where,as here,the bia summarily affirms the ij decision we review the decision of the ij directly.see ins,cir.we defer to the ij factual findings so long as they are supported by substantial evidence,see zhou yun zhang ins,cir,and we afford particular deference in applying the substantial evidence standard to credibility determinations,montero ins,cir.at the same time,however,we will ordinarily affirm an ij only on the basis of the reasons he actually articulated,see cao he lin dep t of justice,cir,and we will vacate the ij decision if he has not applied the law correctly or supported his findings with record evidence,see jin shui qiu ashcroft,cir.
in the present case,we find that six of the seven bases the ij gave for his adverse credibility determination are erroneous.because we can not confidently predict that the ij would reach the same conclusion in the absence of these deficiencies,the ij adverse credibility determination can not stand.xiao ji chen dep t of justice,cir cao he lin,at.
first,the ij made a factual error in characterizing the substance of pavlova testimony when he expressed his understanding that pavlova categorically stated that she did not come to the united states to flee any persecution she had experienced in russia but instead that she came for tourism.the ij found it exceedingly implausible that pavlova would suffer the type of persecution she described and then leave russia for the united states for the sole purpose of engaging in tourism.pavlova,however,never categorically stated that she came to the united states solely for tourism.rather,pavlova testified that she knew that she had to spend some amount of time outside of russia in a safe place,suggesting that at least one reason she left russia was to flee persecution.to be sure,pavlova later testimony and in fact it was for tourism suggests that her statement to the embassy was not a simple pretext for obtaining her visa but that she in fact wished to tour the united states.but at most,all this testimony demonstrates is that pavlova had a dual purpose in coming to the united states to escape persecution and to travel to a country that she wished to visit 
second,the ij compounded the first error when he found highly implausible pavlova explanation for why she waited nearly one year after her arrival in the united states before applying for asylum.the ij found it difficult to believe that,given pavlova detailed history of persecution and the murder of three fellow baptists,pavlova would apply for asylum only after the murder of a fourth.because we think that the ij implausibility finding was the result of flawed reasoning,that finding can not stand,at.
the ij appears to have assumed that the murder of a fourth fellow religious adherent would not create a sufficient increase in fear to overcome pavlova initial reservations about permanently leaving her friends and family in russia and persuade her to seek asylum.in other words,the ij reasoned that if pavlova did not seek asylum when she left russia,after the murder of her three brothers in faith,then it is implausible that a fourth murder would suddenly catalyze her desire to apply.of course,the ij was of the view that when pavlova left russia,she was not concerned about her own safety.as we have already explained,that view was clearly wrong.regardless,to make conjectures about the marginal fear created by a fourth murder as compared to a third is the type of speculation that we warned against in zhou yun zhang,at.
furthermore,we do not believe that an asylum applicant should be required to justify a change of heart with respect to applying for asylum by showing that country conditions have in some way worsened,rather than simply persisted,which appears to be the standard the ij applied.this approach would have the unjust result of effectively barring a particular class of asylum,those who,like pavlova,resolve to seek asylum only after having first decided not proving a fear of persecution based on evidence of past persecution and unchanged country conditions.cao he lin,at a showing of past persecution sets up a rebuttable presumption of a fear of future persecution which can be overcome by a showing,by the preponderance of the evidence,that conditions in the applicant country of nationality have changed sufficiently to destroy the basis for the presumption.quoting jin shui qiu,at.finally,we should note that the ij approach mistakenly treats the process that an asylum applicant undergoes in deciding whether to leave one friends,family,and country forever as if it were a mathematic,predictable,and ignores the reality that the decision to seek asylum is a process that,for many applicants,is personal,inscrutable,and dynamic 
third,the ij failed to address pavlova explanation as to why she did not see a gynecologist in the united states until after november,despite the fact that she had been seeing a gynecologist in russia for the pain she experienced following her surgery.recently,in xiao ji chen,we noted that ijs need not engage in robotic incantations in explaining why they find applicants incredible.at quoting united states brown,cir.we have,however,also repeatedly held that the ij must give reasons for rejecting the testimony of.see,ramsameachire ashcroft,cir jin shui qiu,at anderson mcelroy,cir concluding that the bia acted inappropriately by fail ing to issue a reasoned opinion when it purportedly did consider the entire record.read in light of the ramsameachire line of precedent,xiao ji chen appears to stand for the eminently reasonable proposition that where it is apparent from the record that consideration was given to an applicant testimony,and where we are capable of reviewing the ij consideration for error,it is not necessary for the ij to recite any particular verbal formula.but where it is not apparent on the face of the record that the ij has considered the applicant responses to the ij credibility concerns,we do require the ij to say enough to allow us to understand,and to review,the reasons for rejecting the applicant testimony.
in the present case,the ij appears to have ignored pavlova explanation that she felt no need to see a gynecologist in the united states because her doctor in russia had already identified her medical problem and had prescribed medicine to relieve the pain.pavlova testified that she brought that medicine with her to the united states and that when the prescription ran out,she had a general practitioner in brooklyn refill it.the ij failure to address this explanation was error.
fourth,the ij failed to discuss pavlova explanation for omitting her rape and the killings of four fellow baptists in her statement.pavlova explained that she had filed the application close to the deadline and had been told that there was not time to have a lengthy statement translated.in any case,asylum applicants are not required to list every incident of persecution on their statements,pop ins,cir we hesitate to find that one seeking asylum must state in his or her application every incident of persecution lest the applicant have his or her credibility questioned if the incident is later elicited in direct testimony.ins,cir petitioner failure to file an application form that was as complete as might be desired can not,without more,properly serve as the basis for a finding of a lack of credibility.moreover,pavlova statement as a whole described her persecution in general terms,mentioning no specific incidents rnu members persecute me for my religion.they humiliated and beat me repeatedly i am scared to return to russia because rnu people will kill me there.thus,the ij should not have faulted her for failing to include details about the rape and three killings.
fifth,the ij erred in taking issue with pavlova description of her medical condition resulting from her rape as ruptured internal organs and burst ovaries when,in fact,the medical evidence demonstrated that she had suffered burst ovarian cysts.this minor fault in terminology is,at most,the sort of de minimis,nonmaterial inconsistency that we have often stated may not form the basis for an adverse credibility determination.see,xiao ji chen,at if the testimony provided is otherwise generally consistent,rational,and believable,the presence of some inconsistent testimony need not nec
