background on the federal republic of yugoslavia 
from approximately to,following the death of then yugoslav communist leader josip broz tito,serbians,under the leadership of slobodan milosevic,asserted direct rule over all of yugoslavia,including the formerly autonomous provinces of kosovo and vojvodina.consequently,between and slovenia,croatia,bosnia and herzegovenia,and macedonia all seceded from yugoslavia.on april,the remaining republics of serbia and montenegro formally joined to form the fry,led by president milosevic.milosevic and his party,the serbian socialist party,continued to rule the fry until september,when he was defeated in a federal election though he did not concede defeat until october.
although formally unified with serbia in,the government and people of montenegro retained a distinct identity.specifically,montenegrins were very critical of milosevic brutal police and military campaign against ethnic albanians,many of whom were separatist insurgents.milosevic campaign focused in the southern fry province of kosovo,located within serbia,and lasted from approximately late until june.international response to this ethnic cleansing campaign included nato bombings of serbia and the stationing of nato,russian,and other peacekeepers in kosovo.in june of,kosovo was formally declared a united nations protectorate.
in,vojislav kostunica was elected president of the fry in the federal election that removed milosevic from power.partisan differences between nationalist president kostunica and zoran djinjic,prime minister of serbia and democratic party member,followed the election.finally,in,serbian and montenegrin political leaders began negotiations aiming to forge a more relaxed relationship between the two republics.these talks led to the formal creation of a loose federation called serbia and montenegro on february,legally replacing the former federal republic of yugoslavia.as of november,milosevic is on trial for war crimes,genocide,and ethnic cleansing at the hague.see united states department of state,consular information sheet serbia and montenegro,available at http travel.html united states central intelligence agency,the world factbook serbia and montenegro,available at united states department of state,background note federal republic of yugoslavia,available at.
b.an overview of the treatment of ethnic albanians in montenegro 
at the time of capric asylum hearings in,as a result of control of both the government and a heavily armed police force numbering over,ethnic albanians were subject to widespread discrimination throughout yugoslavia.but their treatment varied significantly from area to area.specifically,ethnic albanians were subject to numerous and more serious human rights abuses in serbia,particularly in the formerly autonomous province of kosovo.although human rights abuses existed in montenegro,they did not generally rise to the level found in kosovo.
the more significant types of mistreatment suffered by ethnic albanians primarily at the hands of serbian police included political killings in,there was a total of such killings,of which occurred in kosovo arbitrary arrest and detention for periods exceeding three days interrogations and severe beatings while detained threats and violence against family members,including the holding of family members as hostages and the arbitrary and illegal searches of homes,vehicles,shops,and offices,typically for weapons,and during which police would confiscate hard currency.
capric testimony about his life in montenegro 
capric is a citizen of the former federal republic of yugoslavia.he was born in montenegro in and lived there until coming to the united states in.capric,his wife whom he married in,and their two sons are albanian ethnic minorities,as well as moslems.
capric began employment with the yugoslav customs service in.he was responsible for railway cargo inspections.his wife,camila,was also employed by the government.since,she worked in a post office in pecurice,bar,montenegro,eventually becoming its manager.to facilitate capric employment in the post office,beginning in,the yugoslav government allowed the caprics to reside in a apartment unit attached to the post office building.
beginning in coinciding with the death of tito and the rise of serbian nationalist control of the fry,the caprics began experiencing difficulties.capric,the vast majority of whom were serbian orthodox,began to ridicule him because of his religion and ethnicity.this continued until he was fired in.also in,capric was called to serve in the yugoslav military he refused to appear.
then in april,the yugoslav government informed the caprics that they would have until january,to vacate their apartment because the old post office was being torn down in order to build a new one.capric was told that if he and his family did not vacate the apartment,he would be placed in jail.the building containing the post office and the capric apartment was eventually torn down in march or april of,and a new post office was built on that same lot.
in june,uniformed police officers entered the capric apartment around two or three in the morning.capric was taken to a police station in bar where he was detained for five to seven days,without adequate food or water.while at the capric residence,the police searched the premises for weapons and money.in addition,the police escorted capric to the post office where they performed a search of those premises as well.however,no weapons were found and no money was confiscated.
also in,capric was fired from his job with the customs service.it is unclear exactly when in capric was fired.some of capric testimony indicates that the police intended his detention at a police station in bar to result in his firing.he also indicated that he was fired because he refused to serve in the yugoslav military in.furthermore,from approximately june until september of,capric was frequently stopped and questioned by uniformed police.
capric also stated that he was a member of the albanian democratic party.however,he indicated no specific dates of membership or other affiliation.capric gave no specific information about participation in party activities.in addition,he stated that he was never detained or questioned about his political affiliations or membership in this opposition party.
unemployed and facing the prospect of finding a new home,capric determined that his family would seek a new life in the united states.just before coming to the in september,capric quit her job and obtained tourist visas for herself and her two sons.capric could not obtain a visa,but instead purchased a passport and visa for under an assumed name.the caprics arrived in the united states in september.by november of,capric,camila,albert,and elvis had all been placed in deportation proceedings.because the caprics entered deportation proceedings prior to april,we apply statutory immigration law as it stood prior to passage of the illegal immigration and reform and immigration act of.see krouchevski ashcroft,cir.
ii.analysis 
the attorney general has broad discretion to grant asylum to an alien who is a refugee.b.refugee is defined as any person who is outside any country of such person nationality and who is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion a a.hence,to qualify for a discretionary grant of asylum,an applicant must establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution.see,toptchev ins,cir.put differently,it is the applicant burden to show that he or she is a refugee.see,cuevas ins,cir,cited in sayaxing ins,cir.
although the statute does not define persecution,we have indicated that it must rise above mere harassment.ciorba ashcroft,cir quoting roman ins,cir.it includes detention,arrest,interrogation,prosecution,imprisonment,illegal searches,confiscation of property,surveillance,beatings,torture,toptchev,at quoting begzatowski ins,cir quoting mitev ins,cir,behavior that threatens the same,sayaxing,at,and behavior such as torture and economic deprivation if the resulting conditions are sufficiently severe,id.however,generalized conditions of hardship which affect entire populations do not rise to the level of persecution.see,sharif ins,cir.
under b,if an applicant proves past persecution,a rebuttable presumption arises that the alien has a fear of future persecution.ambati reno,cir.the government can then overcome that presumption if conditions in the country from which the applicant fled have changed to such an extent that the applicant no longer has a fear of persecution if he or she were to return.b i a.but even if the government demonstrates changed conditions such that the alien need not fear future persecution,asylum still may be granted if the past persecution was sufficiently heinous.see bereza ins,cir,cited in pop ins,cir.
alternately,under b an applicant can affirmatively demonstrate a fear of persecution if his fear is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable in light of credible evidence.sayaxing,at quoting tzankov ins,cir bradvica ins,cir.the subjective fear component turns largely upon the applicant own testimony and credibility.sayaxing,at.but the objective component requires the applicant to prove that either a there is a reasonable probability that he or she will be singled out individually for persecution,b i or that b there is a pattern or practice of persecution of an identifiable group,to which the alien demonstrates he belongs,such that the alien fear is reasonable,b iii.
proof of past persecution or a fear of future persecution is established,in part,by the information contained in the asylum application,including the alien detailed statements about his mistreatment and other evidence,if available,birth certificates,passports,news articles,photos,hospital records,witnesses affidavits.however,in nearly every case,the alien will exercise his due process right to present evidence on his behalf by testifying before the ij about the adversities suffered in his home country.additional documentary or other evidence may be introduced at the hearing as well.
because direct authentication or verification of an alien testimony evidence is typically very difficult and often impossible,the ij evaluates the credibility of the applicant evidence.a credibility analysis assesses the applicant claim only for internal consistency,detail,and plausibility,typically demonstrated by background evidence concerning general country conditions,if available.see in re,wl bia,quoted in abdulai ashcroft,cir.a credibility analysis should not be confused with a burden of proof analysis,which considers and weighs all the surrounding evidence.abdulai,at.if determined to be credible,the testimony of the alien alone may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.in re,at quoting a.
however,if the ij finds the testimony to be incredible,then a convincing explanation of the discrepancies or evidence is required.see,de ins,cir.without such an explanation or corroboration,whether included with the application,presented at the hearing,or submitted via a motion to reopen the case to supplement the record during the pendency of an appeal to the bia,the applicant can not meet his burden of proof and his asylum claim will fail.see,mansour ins,cir affirming asylum denial where applicant testimony was riddled with discrepancies,which the applicant failed to explain except to allege a language difficulty malek ins,cir affirming asylum denial where the applicant testimony was found to be vague,and lacking in internal consistency and plausibility and where corroborating testimony was unpersuasive because the witnesses had limited knowledge of the alien experiences in his home country ahmad ins,cir affirming asylum denial where applicant testimony conflicted with his asylum application,where the ij disbelieved a letter corroborating the applicant membership in a political party,and where the applicant failed to submit additional corroborative evidence.
standard of review 
while we review the legal analysis of the immigration courts de novo,ciorba,at,factual findings such as denials of petitions for asylum and withholding of deportation are reviewed for substantial evidence,ins,d petrovic ins,cir.the bia decision must be affirmed if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.elias,at.quoting a,cited in useinovic ins,cir.we will overturn an agency determination only when the evidence compels that contrary conclusion,ciorba,at quoting bradvica ins,cir,and not simply because we would have decided the case differently,georgis ashcroft,cir quoting ins,cir.in short,our review is highly deferential.georgis,at toptchev,at.
an ij credibility determinations also enjoy highly deferential review,mansour,at,so long as they are supported by specific,cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding,ahmad,at quotations omitted.akin to review of a bia denial or grant of asylum and withholding of deportation,an agency credibility findings should not be superseded simply because an alternate finding could also be supported by substantial evidence.id.citing arkansas oklahoma,d.in sum,these findings of fact should only be overturned under extraordinary circumstances.pop ins,cir ahmad,at listing cases where the ij credibility determinations were not supported by substantial evidence nasir ins,cir.
when,as here,a case is streamlined,the ij decision becomes that of the bia for purposes of judicial review.georgis,at.and with these principles in mind,we turn to capric case.although difficult to discern from petitioner brief,we understand capric to be making essentially three claims.first,he argues that he was denied due process of law because a he testified without an interpreter in his initial immigration hearing on april,hearing b the state department country profile of asylum claims and country conditions for for april profile was so unduly prejudicial that after reading the profile,the ij was unable to fairly evaluate capric claims.second,capric argues that the ij adverse credibility determination was in error.third,if we find the evidence provided by capric to be credible,then he proved he suffered past persecution and a fear of persecution should be presumed.alternatively,and again premised upon a finding that capric is credible,he otherwise affirmatively demonstrated such a fear.we find none of these arguments persuasive.
b.the due process claims 
aliens in the united states are entitled to due process.kerciku ins,cir citing zadvydas davis,d t he due process clause applies to all persons within the united states,including aliens,whether their presence here is lawful,unlawful,temporary,or permanent.ambati reno,cir.and these rights apply in a deportation proceeding.podio ins,cir citations omitted.due process requires that an applicant receive a full and fair hearing which provides a meaningful opportunity to be heard.kerciku,at.we review de novo capric claims that his due process rights were violated because a he testified without an interpreter at hearing b the profile was unduly prejudicial.id.
an alien is required to raise and exhaust his remedies as to each claim or ground for relief if he is to preserve the right to judicial review of that claim.see abdulrahman ashcroft,cir mojsilovic ins,cir.although due process claims generally do not require exhaustion because the bia does not have authority to review constitutional challenges,when those issues involve procedural errors correctable by the bia,applicants must raise such claims as part of their administrative appeal.sayaxing,at.to prevail on a due process claim an applicant must show prejudice.roman ins,cir citing mojsilovic ins,cir.prejudice can be found only when the due process transgression is likely to impact the results of the proceedings.rusu ins,cir quoting jacinto ins,cir.
lack of interpreter 
a due process challenge alleging a failure to be heard meaningfully because no interpreter was provided is procedural in nature and therefore must be raised before the bia.see,malek ins,cir.respondent alleges capric failed to exhaust his administrative remedy as to this issue,thereby waiving it here.while capric stated in his notice of appeal that the deportation hearing did not comport with the requirem e nt of due process,there was no explicit elaboration in his subsequent bia appeal brief.the appeal brief does contain a cursory mention of the interpreter problem 
the ij in his decision about credibility states that the respondent is fluent in english,this is an overstatement.the respondent does speak and understand some english but as can be seen in the transcript he is far from fluent.after the respondent initially attempted to testify in english,the ij stopped the hearing because he felt an interpreter was needed.
citations omitted.although capric appeal to the bia did not frame the lack of an interpreter problem explicitly in due process terms,the combination of both his notice of appeal and his later brief were arguably enough to alert the bia to the issue.see,abdulrahman,at.regardless of whether the issue was properly preserved for appeal,the claim is easily determined to be meritless.
capric failed to either allege or demonstrate any prejudice resulting from his testimony at hearing.at his attorney suggestion,capric did testify in english at hearing.however,it quickly became apparent that capric needed an interpreter,and the ij sua sponte terminated the hearing.at the second hearing in,an albanian interpreter was provided.capric does not argue that any evidence was misunderstood or otherwise obscured because of language difficulties in hearing.nowhere does he question the capability of the interpreter provided in hearing.his basic argument is that the adverse credibility finding was somehow the result of his testimony given in english in hearing.
however,even now capric does not identify any specific testimony from hearing that the ij relied upon in his decision.instead,when referencing capric testimony,the ij referred exclusively to testimony given in hearing,where capric was assisted by an interpreter.furthermore,hearing provided capric with a full opportunity to testify on his own behalf and to clarify any points of confusion which he perceived to have resulted from hearing.hence,capric has not demonstrated,or even alleged,that he was prejudiced by his attorney decision to have him testify in english at hearing 
moreover,due process requires a meaningful opportunity to present a claim,but imposes no obligation to ensure that the alien actually makes a meaningful presentation.rusu ins,cir.capric,through counsel,suggest ed and agreed to testify in english at hearing.thus,to the extent that capric alleged language problems were,we can provide no relief.rusu,at but nazarova ins,cir vacating a deportation order entered in absentia on due process grounds when alien would not take the stand without the interpreter,who was late amadou ins,cir finding a due process violation where specific and identifiable misinterpretations led to an adverse credibility determination.
the state department profile 
a due process challenge alleging unduly prejudicial documentary evidence is also procedural in nature and therefore must be raised before the bia.as previously quoted,capric stated in his notice of appeal that the deportation hearing did not comport with the requirement of due process.but he failed to make any specific or even general allegations regarding the profile in his subsequent bia appeal brief.this was not enough to alert the bia to the issue.indeed,capric brief to this court contains the first mention of the allegedly prejudicial nature of the profile.had capric properly brought this argument to the bia attention,it could have granted the usual remedy of a new hearing,with a new ij excluding the profile entirely or in part.because capric did not raise this issue before the bia,he may not raise it now.
even if we did have jurisdiction to review this issue,capric claim is meritless because he suffered no prejudice as a result of the ij decision to admit the profile into evidence.first,he had a full opportunity to rebut and challenge the opinions expressed in the profile.see gailius ins,cir.second,nothing in the transcript of either hearing or demonstrates that the profile irreparably colored the ij view of ethnic albanians as a group.last,the ij decision did not refer to any portion of the profile which could possibly be construed as prejudicial.even the language which petitioner vigorously takes issue with when viewed in its complete context,can not be considered unduly prejudicial.essentially,petitioner argues that because the ij obviously read the profile he was improperly influenced by it.pet.reply br.at.this conclusory logic is neither persuasive,nor legally sufficient.even assuming the profile is impermissibly inflammatory,which we find it is not,the petitioner has not suffered any identifiable or even likely prejudice.in short,this argument is an attempt to cloak a substantial evidence challenge to the ij decision in due process constitutional garb.
c.the credibility determination 
the ij adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence and deserves our deference.in his decision,the ij cited no fewer than seven discrepancies between capric original application filed in october of and completed in his own hand application,his amended application filed in july of,completed by capric attorney and signed by capric application,and his testimony at hearing in.also,the ij noted capric failure to explain each of these discrepancies during his testimony at hearing.at least four of the inconsistencies go to the heart of capric claim.de ins,cir reasoning that minor inconsistencies or omissions will not support an adverse credibility finding,but discrepancies involving the heart of the asylum claim do quoting ins,cir see malek,at clear inconsistencies between application and testimony support adverse credibility determination pal ins,cir but chanchavac ins,cir reversing adverse credibility determination where inconsistency merely was that alien highlighted certain details in his original application which were omitted in his later application ins,cir finding that an applicant testimony is not per se lacking in credibility simply because it includes details that are not set forth in the asylum application.
first,capric responses to the question,why are you seeking asylum,were inconsistent.on application he wrote,to live in a free country raising my two sons in freedom without being a fraid to say who or what they are.i run from war since i consider this an u njust and illegal war.a war against minorities and a war against religion.sic.on application capric indicated that he and his family were under a fear of persecution stem ming from capric being moslem.capric also stated he refused to appear for military service,was fired because of his religion and failed to find alternate employment,was arrested and detained for one week,and was forced out of his home.however,in his testimony capric did not explain why he made no mention of his religion,his job loss,his arrest,or the forcible taking of his home in application.
second,capric responses to the question,what do you think would happen to you if you returned to the country from which you are claiming persecution,were inconsistent.on application,he wrote t hey the serbs would persecute me or even put me in jail for leaving the country.on application he indicated that he and his family would be subject to incarceration or death because they are moslem because he refused military service.he offered no explanation at hearing why he failed to mention in his original application that his family lives might be at risk,a fact the ij reasoned would not likely be forgotten.
third,on application capric unequivocally indicated that neither he nor his family had ever belonged to or been associated with any organizations or groups in montenegro.but on application he indicated that he had been a member of the albanian democratic party and had actually organized many meetings in montenegro.when confronted with this contradiction during hearing,capric gave only a cursory explanation of the organization purpose and did not discuss his alleged efforts to organize meetings nor explain why he failed to mention his membership on application.furthermore,capric presented no corroborating evidence of his alleged party membership.
fourth,and perhaps most disturbing,although it is reasonable to expect particularly invasive events to be mentioned in asylum applications,pop,at,capric unequivocally indicated on application that neither he nor any member of his family had ever been arrested,detained,interrogated,or convicted and sentenced.however,in application capric indicated that he was arrested,detained,and imprisoned by government officials for his refusal to serve in the military the arrest occurred while he was attending a meeting he was imprisoned for one week without adequate food or water and was later stopped by the police on several occasions.furthermore,at hearing capric offered no explanation for the discrepancy between the applications and testified that he was arrested at his home at two or three in the morning and was held by police for five days,in conflict with both application and.neither did capric offer any explanation regarding his failure to mention in application the frequent stops and inquiries he endured at the hands of the police.
the ij also found unbelievable and insufficiently corroborated capric allegation that the government demolished his family apartment as part of an effort to force albanians and moslems out of montenegro.capric testified that the property and building they resided in were owned by the government.the caprics resided there either or at a greatly reduced rate.the capric were given at least eight months to relocate.finally,the old post office building,in which the caprics apartment was located,was actually torn down and a new post office erected in march or april of.at a minimum,substantial evidence supports the ij decision not to credit capric uncorroborated belief that he and his family were forced out of their apartment due to their religion or ethnicity,rather than because the government was building a new post office.
capric makes much of the ij conclusion that capric was fluent in english.admittedly,and as hearing showed,capric proficiency in english was questionable.however,capric himself indicated on application that he was fluent in english and chose to complete that application in english,without assistance.as application demonstrates,capric could read,understand,and thoroughly respond in writing to the questions asked in the application.at a minimum,capric understood english well enough to comprehend and respond no to the two critical questions which asked whether he or his family were ever involved with any organizations in montenegro and whether they had ever been arrested,detained,or interrogated.his testimony at hearing reveals only a partial inability to communicate orally in english.regardless,at hearing,assisted by an interpreter,capric had a meaningful opportunity to explain the noted inconsistencies and to offer otherwise consistent and supporting testimony.
in short,language difficulties can in no way excuse the significant inconsistencies between the applications and testimony given at hearing.instead,the ij correctly concluded that the application distorted and embellished the hardships faced in montenegro,and amounted to a fictionalized account of persecution,which capric could neither keep straight nor explain at hearing.the discrepancy regarding whether any member of the capric family had ever been arrested,detained,interrogated,or convicted and sentenced,given its memorability,coupled with the other inconsistencies,and capric failure to explain them or offer credible extrinsic corroboration,provides substantial evidence to support the ij credibility finding.we find that this is not the extraordinary circumstance which would demand reversal of the ij adverse credibility determination.
asylum eligibility 
although we need not consider whether if what capric alleges,when assumed to be credible and true,would rise to the level of persecution or demonstrate a fear of persecution,substantial evidence supports the ij conclusion that it does not.there is no doubt as to the hardships ethnic albanians faced in the former fry,but political turmoil alone does not permit the judiciary to stretch the definition of refugee to cover sympathetic,yet statutorily ineligible asylum applicants.sivaainkaran ins,cir.the evidence in this case does not compel a conclusion that capric was either persecuted in the past or has a fear of future persecution.
past persecution 
first,capric alleges that he may have been arrested lost his job as a result of his refusal to serve in the military in.refusal to serve in the military,particularly if based upon religious objections,may be viewed as a political act.see,begzatowski ins,cir.however,he was not arrested and detained until.similarly,he did not lose his government job until.the very government which had attempted to compel his military service had formally broken apart in,and had been replaced with the fry in.thus,the evidence does not lead to the conclusion that he was arrested or fired on account of his refusal to serve in the military two to three years earlier.
also,even if his arrest and detention were the result of his refusal to serve,such events would not necessarily amount to persecution.the law of the fry permits the police to hold suspects for up to hours,or three days.assuming that capric was held for a week without adequate food or water,he did not testify that he was interrogated or physically brutalized while detained.in fact,although in application capric alleged he was stopped frequently by police from june until september of,he was never arrested again,nor ever interrogated.in borca ins,cir,we affirmed a bia finding that an alien had not been persecuted and held that two arrests,two home searches,and numerous threatening phone calls on account of the alien political activities merely amounted to harassment.likewise,in zalega ins,cir,we upheld the bia finding of no persecution where the alien had been arrested,detained,and had his home searched many times over a period.capric mistreatment does not even rise to the level of harms suffered in either borca or zalega and hence,does not compel the conclusion that he was persecuted.
second,as discussed in detail above,there is nothing in the record that shows that the
