vinh tan nguyen nguyen,a native and citizen of vietnam,petitions for review of a board of immigration appeals bia decision dismissing his appeal from an order of removal entered by an immigration judge ij.nguyen argues,inter alia,that the bia erred in concluding that he was inadmissible for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude,and that he is entitled to protection under the convention against torture cat we conclude that the bia did not err in determining that nguyen was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude,because the crime of which nguyen was convicted misuse of a passport to facilitate an act of international terrorism,is categorically morally turpitudinous.we also conclude,however,that the record compels the conclusion that nguyen is more likely than not to be tortured if he is removed to vietnam.thus,we grant the petition with respect to nguyen cat claim,and remand with instructions to grant him deferral of removal under cat.
factual background 
whatever else one can say about nguyen,one can not doubt his enduring opposition to vietnamese communism.in,eight years after his native south vietnam fell to the communists,nguyen fled vietnam as a refugee.he arrived in the united states in,and soon became a legal permanent resident.a decade later,in,nguyen joined a group of vietnamese exiles seeking to overthrow vietnam communist government,who style themselves the government of free vietnam.
nguyen became a prominent member of the government of free vietnam.between and,nguyen traveled throughout the united states to prosthelytize on the organization behalf.between and,nguyen also spread the group message to vietnamese communities in australia and canada.not all of nguyen travel was so mundane,however.in,nguyen traveled to thailand and cambodia from cambodia,he infiltrated vietnam,sneaking across the border through the jungle.there,nguyen served as vice commander of a jungle camp run by the government of free vietnam,spreading the organization political message and training sympathetic vietnamese in.
nguyen next trip to southeast asia was even more dramatic.in april,nguyen traveled to the philippines on a passport belonging to his brother,van duc vo.two months later,on june,the real van duc vo tried to bomb the vietnamese embassy in bangkok,thailand.two months after that,on august,philippine police caught nguyen himself in the act of assembling explosive devices using ammonium nitrate.it was widely reported that nguyen,following in his brother footsteps,planned to bomb the vietnamese embassy in manila.
philippine authorities charged nguyen with manufactur ing,assembl ing,and possess ing explosives.nguyen ultimately pled guilty to a lesser offense.in november,a philippine court sentenced nguyen to between fifty and months in prison.
but nguyen soon escaped from prison and fled the philippines.using yet another false passport,nguyen made his way to ghana.after spending several months in ghana,nguyen left for saipan,in the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands.
the federal bureau of investigation was on nguyen trail.a federal judge had issued a warrant for nguyen arrest nguyen was wanted by authorities for using his brother passport to travel to the philippines.the fbi found nguyen in saipan,and arrested him there on december.accompanied by law enforcement,nguyen was paroled into the united states at agana,guam,on december,
nguyen was brought before the district court for the central district of california,where an indictment charged him with violating,misuse of passport.section provides,in relevant part 
whoever willfully and knowingly uses,or attempts to use,any passport issued or designed for the use of another 
shall be fined under this title,imprisoned not more than years if the offense was committed to facilitate an act of international terrorism as defined in section of this title or years in the case of any other offense 
specifically,the grand jury alleged that nguyen willfully and knowingly used a passport issued and designed for the use of another,to facilitate an act of international terrorism,as defined in title,united states code,section.on november,nguyen pled guilty to misuse of passport in violation of,as charged in count of the single count indictment.nguyen was sentenced to fourteen months in prison.
procedural background 
nguyen immigration parole expired on june.on december,the department of homeland security served nguyen with a notice to appear.the notice to appear alleged that nguyen was inadmissible as an arriving alien not in possession of a valid entry document,see a a i i,and also as an alien who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude,see a a i i.specifically,the notice to appear alleged that nguyen had been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude misuse of passport to facilitate an act of international terrorism under,and inflict ing corporal injury on spouse,in violation of california penal code.nguyen admitted both convictions,without conceding that either constituted a crime involving moral turpitude.an ij sustained both charges of inadmissibility against nguyen,concluding that nguyen was inadmissible as an arriving alien not in possession of a valid entry document,and also as an alien who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.
nguyen applied for deferral of removal under the convention against torture.see a.
in support of his cat claim,nguyen testified and presented six other witnesses at a hearing before a new ij.two of nguyen witnesses testified that they knew people who had been political prisoners in vietnam,and these political prisoners had been physically mistreated.nguyen also presented two witnesses who had,themselves,been political prisoners in vietnam.both of these witnesses testified that they were physically mistreated during their imprisonment.the first witness testified that he was deprived of adequate food and water,and that he watched a fellow prisoner starve to death under similar conditions.the second witness was forcibly injected with an unknown substance,which apparently caused her to lose consciousness it later left her feeling dazed and numb.this same witness was also beaten so badly that her leg was broken,and she was left permanently disabled.
the government presented one witness,a retired harvard law school research fellow who testified about country conditions in vietnam.the research fellow concluded that nguyen was unlikely to be tortured because vietnam does not engage in torture torture is against the law in vietnam,and the vietnamese government would not risk harming its domestic or international reputation by torturing prisoners.likewise,the research fellow opined that though nguyen was sure to be taken into custody in vietnam,and sure to be interrogated he was likely to cooperate with his interrogators,and so the vietnamese government would not need to torture him.
the ij also considered a wide range of documentary evidence detailing vietnam dismal human rights record.for example,the ij considered a human rights watch report,which confirmed that there is compelling evidence of torture and of political prisoners in vietnam,including beatings and electric shock.the ij also considered the state department human rights report on vietnam,which agreed that though t he law prohibits physical abuse police commonly physically mistreated suspects during arrest or detention.
after the hearing,the ij denied nguyen application for protection under cat and ordered him removed to vietnam.
nguyen appealed to the bia,which dismissed nguyen appeal in a reasoned,decision.the bia concluded that nguyen had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude,reasoning inter alia that given nguyen intention to facilitate an act of international terrorism his offense was morally reprehensible.with respect to nguyen cat claim,the bia concluded that nguyen does not point to any substantial evidence corroborating his fear that the vietnamese authorities have become aware of his conviction in the philippines or his other public activities in opposition to the vietnamese regime thus,the bia reasoned,nguyen could not show that the vietnamese government was likely to torture him in connection with those activities.the bia recognized that the record certainly demonstrates that torture sometimes occurs in vietnam,but it does not establish that such severe physical mistreatment is a common occurrence,or that it would more likely than not be inflicted on the respondent personally.
we now consider nguyen arguments that the bia erred in finding him inadmissible and ineligible for cat relief.
discussion 
whether nguyen was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude 
a crime involving moral turpitude is either one that involves fraud or one that involves grave acts of baseness or depravity,such that its commission offend s the most fundamental moral values of society.robles urrea holder,cir quoting navarro lopez gonzales,cir en banc reinhardt,concurring for the majority.though we generally lack jurisdiction to review orders of removal based on a conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude,a c,we have jurisdiction to review the bia determination that petitioner convictions are,in fact,crimes involving moral turpitude in the first place,marmolejo campos holder,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted.
the determination whether a conviction under a criminal statute is categorically a crime of moral turpitude involves two steps,to which different standards of review apply.castrijon garcia holder,cir alteration omitted.first,we identify the elements of the statute of conviction,reviewing the bia conclusions on this point de novo.id.second,we compare the elements of the statute of conviction to the generic definition of a crime of moral turpitude and decide whether the conviction meets that definition.id.on this point,we give some degree of deference to the bia.see marmolejo campos,at.here,in the absence of a precedential bia decision on point,we defer to the bia to the extent that the bia decision has the power to persuade.latter singh holder,cir see also skidmore swift.
applying these principles to nguyen case,we find no error in the bia determination that nguyen is inadmissible for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.on the contrary,we agree with the bia that nguyen conviction for misuse of a passport to facilitate an act of international terrorism,under,is a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude 
the bia did not err in identifying the elements of nguyen conviction.though nguyen argues otherwise,the intent to facilitate an act of international terrorism is an element of his offense.any fact that,by law,increases the penalty for a crime is an element alleyne united states,see also apprendi new jersey.because nguyen pled guilty as charged in count of the single count indictment,he pled guilty to misuse of a passport to facilitate an act of international terrorism,as defined in title,united states code,section.see united states vidal,cir en banc.this intent to facilitate an act of international terrorism,in turn,increased the maximum criminal penalty to which nguyen was exposed prescribes a maximum prison term in most cases,but a maximum year prison term if the offense was committed to facilitate an act of international terrorism as defined in section of this title.because the intent to facilitate an act of international terrorism increased the criminal penalty to which nguyen was exposed,the bia was correct that the intent to facilitate an act of international terrorism is an element of nguyen conviction.
the next question is whether we are persuaded,see latter singh,at,that misuse of a passport with the intent to facilitate an act of international terrorism as defined in section of this title is categorically morally turpitudinous.we are.
misuse of a passport to facilitate an act of international terrorism is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude.n crimes of moral turpitude almost always involve an intent to harm someone,the actual infliction of harm upon someone,or an action that affects a protected class of victim.nunez holder,cir.misuse of a passport to facilitate an act of international terrorism as defined in section of this title categorically involves at least the first and third of these criteria.section defines international terrorism to require violent acts or acts dangerous to human life,a making it clear that anyone misusing a passport with the intent to facilitate an act of international terrorism necessarily holds an intent to harm someone,nunez,at.likewise,defines international terrorism to require the intent to intimidate or coerce a civilian population,to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion,or to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction,assassination,or kidnapping,b i iii.from this,it is clear that anyone misusing a passport to facilitate an act of international terrorism necessarily targets a protected class of victim,nunez,at either a vulnerable civilian population,or that civilian population lawful government.and,like other crimes involving moral turpitude,misuse of a passport to facilitate an act of international terrorism shocks the conscience.id.at.indeed,shocking the public conscience is the whole point of using terrorism as a tool of political coercion.
in short,the bia was correct that nguyen is inadmissible because he has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude nguyen has been convicted of misuse of a passport to facilitate an act of international terrorism,and misuse of a passport to facilitate an act of international terrorism is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude 
ii.whether nguyen is entitled to protection under cat 
though we generally lack jurisdiction to review orders of removal based on a conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude,a c,we retain jurisdiction to review denials of deferral of removal under cat,lemus galvan mukasey,cir.we review the factual findings underlying the bia denial of cat relief for substantial evidence.zheng ashcroft,cir.the substantial evidence standard of review means we must be deferential to the bia conclusions.but deference does not mean blindness.li ashcroft,cir en banc.we will reverse,under the substantial evidence standard,if the evidence in the record compels a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the bia decision is incorrect.tampubolon holder,cir alteration and internal quotation marks omitted see also b b.
in denying nguyen cat claim,the bia contended that nguyen does not point to any substantial evidence corroborating his fear that the vietnamese authorities have become aware of his conviction in the philippines or his other public activities in opposition to the vietnamese regime rather,nguyen seems to assume such awareness.thus,the bia discounted the fact that many political dissidents are imprisoned under harsh conditions in vietnam if the vietnamese government could not identify nguyen as a political dissident,it would not matter whether the vietnamese government tortured political dissidents.in this light,the bia concluded that though country conditions evidence certainly demonstrates that torture sometimes occurs in vietnam the evidence does not establish that such severe physical mistreatment is a common occurrence,or that it would more likely than not be inflicted on nguyen personally.
these aspects of the bia decision are not supported by substantial evidence.on the contrary,the evidence in the record compels any reasonable factfinder to conclude that the vietnamese government is aware of nguyen activities on behalf of the government of free vietnam.because the vietnamese government is aware of nguyen activities on behalf of the government of free vietnam,the record likewise compels any reasonable factfinder to conclude that,if nguyen is removed to vietnam,he is more likely than not to be tortured.
the bia doubts that the vietnamese authorities have become aware of nguyen conviction in the philippines or his other public activities in opposition to the vietnamese regime are not supported by substantial evidence.the record leaves no room to doubt that the vietnamese government knows who nguyen is,and what he has done in the name of the government of free vietnam.for example,the record contains a report from the vietnamese government to interpol describing the circumstances of nguyen arrest in the philippines,and providing detailed information about nguyen personal history.likewise,the record contains an fbi agent sworn statement that the details of nguyen alleged bomb plot were obtained from the government of vietnam.in fact,during nguyen removal proceedings,the government own expert recognized that nguyen case has been so widely known that the vietnamese government would be able to recognize nguyen as soon as he arrived in vietnam.in the face of this uncontroverted evidence,no reasonable factfinder could doubt that the vietnamese government has actual knowledge of nguyen activities in opposition to the vietnamese regime including,for example,nguyen alleged plot to bomb the vietnamese embassy in the philippines 
because the vietnamese government is familiar with nguyen and his activities on behalf of the government of free vietnam,the record also compels the conclusion that,if nguyen is removed to vietnam,he is more likely than not to be tortured.
the record shows that the vietnamese government routinely arrests and imprisons members of the government of free vietnam.as a member of the government of free vietnam known,in particular,for allegedly plotting to bomb a vietnamese embassy nguyen is thus likely to be imprisoned if he is removed to vietnam.
once nguyen is imprisoned in vietnam,the record compels the conclusion that he is likely to be tortured.though the bia was skeptical that severe physical mistreatment is a common occurrence in vietnam,the state department human rights report on vietnam makes clear that severe physical mistreatment is not uncommon in vietnamese custody at all police commonly physically mistreated suspects during arrest or detention.physical mistreatment of the kind documented in vietnamese custody for example,beatings and electric shock constitutes torture.see a i the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering constitutes torture.the political nature of nguyen offenses underscores the likelihood that nguyen will be tortured in custody as the human rights watch report in the record notes,there is compelling evidence of torture and of political prisoners in vietnam,in particular.
though t orture does not include pain or suffering arising only from,inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions,a,the pain or suffering that vietnam is likely to inflict on nguyen would not constitute a lawful sanction.according to the state department human rights report,vietnamese law prohibits physical abuse.
such documentary evidence of country conditions,alone,is sufficient to show that nguyen is likely to be tortured in vietnam.see kamalthas ins,cir c ountry conditions alone can play a decisive role in granting cat relief.but nguyen does not rely on documentary evidence alone.
in addition to nguyen country conditions evidence,the witness testimony that nguyen presented during removal proceedings underscores that he is likely to be tortured if he is removed to vietnam.nguyen presented testimony from two witnesses who knew political prisoners in vietnam.both witnesses testified that these political prisoners were deliberately subjected to physical harm.in at least two cases,vietnamese officials subjected these political prisoners to physical harm in an effort to coerce them into offering false confessions a practice that certainly constitutes torture.see a.moreover,nguyen presented testimony from two witnesses who were actually former political prisoners in vietnam and who,again,were deliberately subjected to severe physical harm rising to the level of torture.one of these witnesses was deprived of adequate food and water,and watched a fellow prisoner starve to death under similar conditions.the other witness was beaten so badly that she was left permanently disabled.such severe pain and suffering constitutes torture.see id.
the government presented no evidence that could,in the mind of a reasonable factfinder,rebut nguyen evidence that he is likely to be tortured.the government sole witness in the removal proceedings,a retired harvard law school research fellow,offered three reasons for his opinion that nguyen was unlikely to be tortured in vietnam.none of these reasons,however,is actually responsive to the other record evidence showing that the vietnamese government tortures political opponents like nguyen.at most,the research fellow offered reasons that vietnam should not torture political opponents like nguyen he did not contradict the record evidence showing that vietnam actually does torture its political opponents.
first,the research fellow argued that the vietnamese government is unlikely to torture nguyen because torture is against the law in vietnam.but the fact that a country laws formally prohibit torture says nothing about whether that country actually tortures people.see hosseini gonzales,cir noting that the iranian constitution prohibits torture,and that the iranian government tortures people.
second,the research fellow concluded that the vietnamese government would not need to torture nguyen,because nguyen would not withhold information when interrogated by the vietnamese government.this conclusion is striking,in the first place,for the implication that the vietnamese government would torture nguyen if he did withhold information or if he were perceived to be withholding information.but,more to the point,evidence in the record shows that the vietnamese government actually does torture political prisoners without regard for whether the vietnamese government needs to torture those political prisoners.indeed,the record shows that the vietnamese government tortures political prisoners for multiple reasons for example,to obtain false confessions and to punish its political opponents that have nothing to do with any need to extract information about potential threats to vietnamese security.
third,the research fellow noted that torture might sully the vietnamese government domestic and international reputation.but here again,speculation that the vietnamese government has reasons not to engage in torture can not counter the vietnamese government actual practice of torturing people.the suggestion that torture is not in vietnam best interest does nothing to contradict evidence showing that vietnam actually does torture people,whether that decision is in vietnam best interest or not.
in short,there is no evidence that vietnam will not torture nguyen upon his arrest there,which is virtually certain.there is substantial documentary and testimonial evidence including,by negative implication,testimony from the government own expert that he most likely would be tortured.notwithstanding the bia contrary determination,the record compels the conclusion that severe physical mistreatment rising to the level of torture is a common occurrence in vietnamese custody,particularly where the vietnamese government political opponents are concerned.therefore,the record compels the conclusion that,because the vietnamese authorities have become aware of nguyen public activities in opposition to the vietnamese regime,nguyen is likely to be arrested,detained and tortured in vietnam.because the record compels the conclusion that the vietnamese government will recognize nguyen as one of its political opponents,and that it tortures its political opponents,the record compels the conclusion that nguyen is more likely than not to be tortured if he is removed to vietnam.
indeed,nguyen case is very similar to a previous case in which we ordered cat relief.in hosseini gonzales,we considered whether a member of the khalq a terrorist group opposed to the iranian government could be removed to iran,or whether he was instead entitled to deferral of removal under cat.at.in hosseini,there was no direct evidence that to quote language from the bia decision in nguyen case torture would more likely than not be inflicted on the respondent personally.nevertheless,there was evidence that the iranian government was likely to identify hosseini as a member of the khalq,and that the iranian government tortured its polit
