isidro,a mexican citizen,pleaded guilty to unlawful reentry into the united states after deportation and was sentenced to months of incarceration.seeks a remand for the district judge to consider whether to impose a lower sentence based on the disparities created by the existence of programs for cases in other jurisdictions.he also argues that the district judge reliance on incorrect information about the prevalence of programs rendered the sentence procedurally unreasonable.because was sentenced before kimbrough united states,and because kimbrough permits district court judges to impose a variance based on disagreement with the policy underlying a guideline here,the disparity,we vacate sentence and remand the case to the district court for resentencing.
background 
a mexican citizen,entered the united states illegally in may,at age fourteen.on september,he was convicted in tennessee state court for attempted criminal possession of less than grams of cocaine with intent to distribute.the judge sentenced him to two years imprisonment.was deported on december,and prohibited from returning.on march,officers executing a drug raid in memphis found and grams of powder cocaine,which he admitted was his.he pleaded guilty in state court to possession of cocaine with intent to sell and received a sentence of imprisonment of months,days.
a federal grand jury subsequently indicted on one count of being found in the united states without the permission of the attorney general after previously having been deported,under a,b.he pleaded guilty.at sentencing,the district judge calculated the base offense level for a violation of as eight,sentencing guidelines manual.added sixteen points for reentry after deportation after being sentenced to over thirteen months in prison for a drug conviction,b a i and subtracted three points for acceptance of responsibility,a,b,for a total offense level of.with a criminal history category of iv,the applicable guidelines range was to months of imprisonment.defense counsel argued that the enhancement was irrational and disproportionate to the offense.he asked the court to reduce the offense level by four based on the fact that like defendants receive such reductions in districts that employ programs for defendants.
the district judge considered the advisory guidelines range and reviewed the sentencing factors listed in a.he noted that had been deported before,that he was involved in drug crime while unlawfully in the united states,and that his offense was serious.the district judge acknowledged that appeared to have a job waiting for him in mexico,but emphasized the importance of deterrence,the need to protect the public,and the possibility that would receive counseling for his drug problem in prison.finally,the district judge addressed argument for a reduction based on the disparity 
let me address,so that the record will be clear if there is another court that is going to review this,on the question of fast track disposition or process that does occur in border states,this court has previously considered that argument in other cases.certainly the court understands that there is a unique situation in the court opinion with regard to border states who utilize this program,regrettably because the number of persons who not only come over the first time,but regretfully are repeat offenders,and it simply a matter of alleviating the courts there and the prison systems in that area to allow persons who have been caught to go back to the country,particularly to mexico.but as hall has indicated,the sixth circuit least in this court indicated that a trial court determination that a fast track program or fast track process is not something that is that if the court decides to reject it,that would not be an erroneous determination.the court believes that tennessee obviously not being a border state,it does have the circumstances that i believe are present in some of the states like texas or new mexico,or things of that nature,where the problem is a major situation.so,the court is not going not believe that is an appropriate manner in which to handle this case.
dist.dkt.doc.sent.tr.at.the district judge imposed months of incarceration and two years of supervised release,a sentence at the low end of the guidelines ranges.before the close of the sentencing hearing,the district judge asked counsel,is there anything else that you need me to address defense counsel asked the court to recommend that serve his sentence close to memphis.the district judge agreed and then asked,anything else,sir defense counsel answered no.id.at.judgment entered on march,and timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the sentencing guidelines are advisory,and we review sentences for reasonableness.united states booker.reasonableness review has two components procedural and substantive.gall united states.procedural unreasonableness encompasses failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.see also united states bolds,cir.substantive unreasonableness focuses on the length and type of the sentence,see united states brown,cir united states liou,cir,and will be found when the district court selects a sentence arbitrarily,bases the sentence on impermissible factors,fails to consider relevant sentencing factors,or gives an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor,united states camiscione,cir internal quotation marks omitted.our overlapping description of procedural and substantive factors shows that the line between them is blurry if not porous.liou,at 
makes two arguments for relief from his sentence,both based on procedural unreasonableness the district judge mistakenly believed that he could not consider the disparity created by the existence of programs in some jurisdictions and not others and in rejecting the disparity argument,the district court relied on erroneous information about which districts employed programs.did not point out the second error at sentencing,but because the district judge did not ask the bostic asked defense counsel only if there was anything else review does not apply and we review for reasonableness.see united states gapinski,cir holding under united states bostic,cir,that the question,anything else for the record,lasker was insufficient to trigger review when objections were not made below.
district court ability to impose a variance based on the disparity 
in imposing punishment,a district judge must consider the sentencing factors listed in a,including the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.a.at sentencing,sought a variance based on a,in light of the fact that defendants in his position routinely obtain reductions in judicial districts that,unlike the western district of tennessee,have programs.this court has previously discussed the origin and nature of these programs 
arose initially in border areas with large illegal immigration caseloads.prosecutors sought to clear their dockets through either or agreements to move for downward departures in return for defendants agreements not to file pretrial motions or contest issues.congress approved and set standards for this process in the prosecutorial remedies and tools against the exploitation of children today act of protect act,stat,which required the united states sentencing commission to promulgate a policy statement authorizing a downward departure of not more than levels if the government files a motion for such departure pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the attorney general and the united states attorney.protect act,m b,stat.the sentencing commission responded by promulgating a new guideline authorizing a reduction.
united states,app x,cir unpublished opinion citations omitted.claims that the district court declined to reduce his sentence under a on the basis of sixth circuit precedent that foreclosed his disparity argument.he now argues that the supreme court decision in kimbrough united states,which allowed sentencing judges to deviate from the guidelines based on policy disagreements,throws that case law into doubt.
we begin by clarifying the state of the law in this circuit with respect to a district court authority to premise a variance on disagreement with the policy of a guideline.the seminal case on point is united states gaines,cir.in that case,this court held that a district court lacks the authority to vary from a guidelines sentence due to the court disagreement with the ratio.id.at.we specifically rejected the defendant argument that a district court has the authority to vary from a guideline on the ground that it rejects a policy underlying it.see id.subsequent cases reaffirmed gaines and relied on similar reasoning.see united states dunlap,cir united states watkins,cir united states ratliff,wl,at cir,unpublished opinion.
after gaines,we noted that district courts are still obligated to sentence defendants individually and to consider all of the factors listed in a.see united states coleman,cir en banc united states webb,cir.but although we urged courts to consider the unique circumstances of each case,we continued to forbid them from sentencing a defendant based on the court disagreement with a guidelines provision.see,united states ferguson,cir quoting the fourth circuit statement in united states moreland,cir,that a sentence may be substantively unreasonable if the court rejects policies articulated by the sentencing commission united states valentine,app x,cir unpublished opinion w hatever the reasons that the sentencing disparity exists,it is not a permissible basis for a downward departure.that some precedents in our circuit did not foreclose district courts from considering sentencing disparities in individual cases,see,united states,cir,does not mean that district courts had authority to reject the policy underlying a guidelines provision,including the disparity.
to the extent that gaines and our other cases suggest that sentencing judges may not reduce sentences based on the disparity,we agree with that any such rule does not survive the supreme court decision in kimbrough.in kimbrough,the supreme court held that a district court may conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the disparity yields a sentence greater than necessary to achieve a purposes,even in a case.kimbrough,at.the court later clarified that the point of kimbrough was a recognition of district courts authority to vary from the crack cocaine guidelines based on policy disagreement with them,and not simply based on an individualized determination that they yield an excessive sentence in a particular case.spears united states,internal quotation marks omitted.since kimbrough was decided,defendants like have argued that its logic allows district courts to disagree with the guidelines policy that the disparity created by the availability of reductions in other districts is not unwarranted.five circuits have addressed this argument.the first and the third circuits have credited the argument,overruling their contrary precedents in light of kimbrough.united states rodríguez,cir united states,cir.the fifth,ninth,and eleventh circuits,by contrast,have rejected the argument and reaffirmed their precedents.united states,cir united states,cir united states,cir split panel.
the latter three circuits distinguished kimbrough by reading it as authorizing district courts to vary based on disagreements with guidelines policy,not based on disagreements with congressional policy,at,at,at.we find this distinction unpersuasive.first,the idea that congress believes the disparity is warranted derives from the protect act,but the act neither forbids nor discourages the use of a particular sentencing rationale,and it says nothing about a district court discretion to deviate from the guidelines based on disparity.rodríguez,at accord,at in effect,while congress intended to create room for courts in jurisdictions to treat defendants in a certain manner,it did nothing to prohibit judges in districts from treating defendants the same way.second,to the extent that congress impliedly communicated that the disparity was warranted,see,at,that fact does not distinguish this case from kimbrough.there,the government had argued that by enshrining the ratio in the mandatory minimum sentences of the anti drug abuse act of,congress had implicitly endorsed the disparity in the guidelines.the court responded that t he statute says nothing about the appropriate sentence within the specified sentencing range,and we decline to read any implicit directive into that congressional silence.kimbrough,at.the court also rejected the contention that congress had endorsed the guidelines disparity by rebuffing a proposal by the sentencing commission to replace the ratio with a ratio.id.at.in rejecting these arguments,kimbrough made pellucid that when congress exercises its power to bar district courts from using a particular sentencing rationale,it does so by the use of unequivocal terminology.rodríguez,at.third,even if congress could be said to have endorsed some disparity between defendants in and districts,it has not endorsed the further disparity that is created by charge bargaining.in some districts,instead of or in addition to moving for a downward departure of up to four offense levels,prosecutors will dismiss certain charges in exchange for a guilty plea.see,at describing these alternative,programs that operate outside the bounds of not only the protect act,but also guidelines.surely,judges in districts in which such charge bargaining is not routine for defendants would be justified in imposing reduced sentences based on the disparity created by this prosecutorial practice.
in sum,kimbrough requires that we repudiate any prior hint that district judges could not grant variances based on the disparity.kimbrough and its case spears made clear that district judges could vary from the guidelines based on policy disagreements.and as we have held,that authority is not limited to the cocaine context,at.
because our precedents at the time of sentencing prohibited district court judges from granting a variance based on a disagreement with a guidelines policy,and because kimbrough put that theory to rest,we remand the case to the district court for resentencing.sufficiently preserved a argument with respect to the guidelines.see doc.def.sent.mem.at.but the district court could not have been aware of its discretion to sentence based on its disagreement with policies or the disparities a sentencing regime creates.the court sentenced before the supreme court decided kimbrough and spears,and in several cases this court had held that district courts lack the power to vary from guidelines provisions when they disagree with the applicable guidelines.see watkins,at dunlap,at gaines,at.in light of those precedents,the district court could not have envisioned the discretion kimbrough and spears give it.
reliance on erroneous information about districts 
next argues that the district court decision not to impose a sentence was based on the erroneous belief that programs did not exist outside of states along the southern border.in fact,programs for defendants also exist in idaho,nebraska,utah,oregon,and washington.dep t of justice,memo,reauthorization of early disposition programs,available at.makes this argument despite having represented in his own sentencing memorandum that only border districts currently employ the fast track program,doc.def.sent.mem.at,and having compared himself to defendants in border districts at the sentencing hearing,doc.sent.tr.at.we need not dwell on this issue,however,as any confusion about the prevalence of programs may be cleared up on remand.
iii.conclusion 
this court cases prior to kimbrough repeatedly held that,while district courts must sentence defendants individually,they can not sentence a defendant by varying from a guidelines provision because they disagree with the guideline.thus,the district court could not have been aware of its ability to use its indepe
