background

on july,qu filed an application for asylum pursuant to,withholding of removal pursuant to b,and protection under the convention against torture cat pursuant to c.in her application for asylum and withholding of removal,qu alleged that she was a victim of human trafficking and involuntary servitude.during a hearing on december,regarding qu asylum application,qu testified that her father,who operated a farm that raised seafood,took out a loan of yuan from zhang.zhang was a big thug in the underground world and had powerful connections in the government.when qu father was unable to repay the loan,zhang visited qu home on the morning of october.zhang demanded that qu father repay the loan or allow qu,who was then years old,to become zhang wife.moreover,zhang threatened to have qu family placed in jail if they reported the incident to the police,claiming to have connections with the police and gangsters.
when qu returned to her family home that evening,zhang kidnapped her and brought her to a guarded home,where she remained for approximately two weeks.on the third day after her kidnapping,zhang attempted to rape qu.zhang slapped and kicked qu and tore off her clothing,but qu was able to fight him off.after that incident,zhang checked on qu every day and threatened to send her to prison if she did not have sex with him or repay the debt.zhang also threatened to cut off her hands and feet if she tried to escape.after approximately a half a month,qu escaped the house and fled to her aunt house.qu aunt paid a snakehead to smuggle qu into the united states.qu departed china on november.on the same day,a local civil summons was issued in qu name for the debt owed by her father.

discussion 
standard of review 
when the bia issues its own opinion rather than summarily adopts the findings of the ij,this court reviews the decision of the bia as the final agency determination.morgan keisler,cir.this court reviews the bia decision using the standard,which requires this court to uphold the bia decision unless it is manifestly contrary to the law.ins,cir internal citation omitted see also koulibaly mukasey,cir.under the substantial evidence standard,this court will uphold administrative findings of fact unless the court finds that any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b see also ins,ramaj gonzales,cir.this court reviews legal conclusions of the bia de novo,patel gonzales,cir,but defers to the agency reasonable interpretations of its own precedents.mukasey,cir.
the attorney general has discretion to grant asylum to a refugee who shows that she has suffered past persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,or that she has a fear of future persecution on these grounds.a.persecution requires more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,unaccompanied by any physical punishment,infliction of harm,or significant deprivation of liberty.singh ashcroft,cir quoting mikhailevitch ins,cir.to show a fear of future persecution,an applicant must demonstrate 
that s he has a fear of persecution in her home country on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion that there is a reasonable possibility of suffering such persecution if s he were to return to that country and that s he is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of such fear.
id.quoting pilica ashcroft,cir.an applicant who establishes that she has suffered past persecution is presumed to have a fear of future persecution.the government may rebut this presumption by showing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that conditions in the country have changed so fundamentally that the applicant no longer has a fear of future persecution.id.citing pilica,at ouda ins,cir.
particular social group 
to establish eligibility for asylum,qu must first show that she was a member of a particular social group for asylum purposes.in,at,this court adopted the bia definition of particular social group set out in matter of acosta,bia.in acosta,the bia defined particular social group as follows 
w e interpret the phrase persecution on account of membership in a particular social group to mean persecution that is directed toward an individual who is a member of a group of persons all of whom share a common,immutable characteristic.the shared characteristic might be an innate one such as sex,color,or kinship ties,or in some circumstances it might be a shared past experience such as a former military leadership or land ownership.the particular kind of group characteristic that will qualify under this construction remains to be determined on a basis.however,whatever the common characteristic that defines the group,it must be one that the members of the group either can not change,or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to their individual identities or consciences by construing persecution on account of membership in a particular social group in this manner,we preserve the concept that refuge is restricted to individuals who are either unable by their own actions,or as a matter of conscience should not be required,to change to avoid persecution.
courts of appeals have deferred to matter of acosta broad interpretation of particular social group as encompassing any group,however populous,persecuted because of shared characteristics that are either immutable or
