opinion of the court 
elias eid and gwen packard eid filed a complaint challenging the denial by the board of immigration appeals bia of the i petition for alien relative filed by packard eid,a united states citizen,that would accord eid,her husband and a,preference status as the spouse of a citizen.the bia denied the petition under c,which requires denying the petitions of aliens who had previously received or attempted to receive immigration benefits based on a marriage entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws.eid and packard eid contended that,because eid did not intend to break the law through his first marriage,c should not apply to him.the district court disagreed,granting summary judgment for the government on one count of the complaint and dismissed the remaining counts for failure to state a claim.despite facts favoring a better result,the statute text leads us to conclude that neither the district court nor the bia erred,as,among other things,the intent to enter into a marriage solely to gain immigration benefits is sufficient to establish intent to evade the immigration laws.
background 
factual and administrative background 
eid is a lebanese national who entered the as a under an hl b visa issued based on a petition by eid employer carolyn pickett a citizen.in october,eid married pickett and they began living together as roommates.pickett filed an i petition the next month to have eid legally established as her husband for immigration purposes.it was granted in december.
obtaining permanent residence based on marriage to an american citizen or legal permanent resident is a process.first,the citizen or permanent resident spouse must sponsor the alien by filing an i petition if granted,it legally classifies the alien as the spouse of the sponsor.once or at the same time as the sponsor files an i petition,the alien must file an i application to register permanent residence or adjust status.
on the basis of his classification as pickett husband,per the granting of the i petition,eid filed an i application.during his interview with the immigration and naturalization service ins in february as part of the application for permanent residence,and presumably in response to immigration officers questioning the legitimacy of the marriage,eid withdrew his i application.at the same time,pickett requested the withdrawal of her i petition already granted in,a request the cis granted.accompanying the withdrawal of the i application,both eid and pickett gave sworn affidavits to the ins officer.in his sworn statement,eid said that he married pickett in order to stay in the,the marriage was never consummated,and the two had no intention on living together as husband and wife.pickett sworn statement was to similar effect.their marriage was annulled in december.
removal proceedings began against eid in december.in november,he married packard eid,an american citizen,with whom he had a son in.packard eid filed a new i petition on eid behalf in september.citizenship and immigration services the cis determined the marriage of eid and packard eid collectively the eids to be genuine,but denied the i petition in december.it concluded that it must deny packard eid petition under c because of pickett sham petition on eid behalf and their respective statements to the ins.
packard eid appealed to the bia,which remanded to the cis with instructions to issue a notice of intent to deny noid and to allow the eids to present evidence in support of the i petition.the cis issued the noid in july.in response,packard eid provided declarations from pickett and eid that they married out of a naive belief that formal marriage and shared residence were sufficient to obtain permanent residence,along with a statement of packard eid legal arguments against the denial.the cis denied the i petition in september,and packard eid appealed to the bia.it affirmed the cis conclusion that c barred the i petition,termed pickett and eid marriage fraudulent,and dismissed the appeal.
legal background 
the eids filed a complaint with the district court challenging the denial of the i petition in july and an amended complaint five months later.the first count of the amended complaint sought review of the bia denial of the i petition under the administrative procedure act apa,while the remaining counts charged that the decision violated various constitutional provisions and international law.
both the eids and the cis filed motions for summary judgment on the first count of the complaint the apa claim,and the cis filed a motion to dismiss the constitutional and international law counts for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court granted the cis motion for summary judgment and dismissed the remaining counts for failure to state a claim.eid and packard eid filed a notice of appeal,and in their subsequent brief they challenged both the order for summary judgment and the dismissal of the other counts

the district court had jurisdiction under.see chehazeh att y,cir holding that district courts have jurisdiction under the apa to review bia decisions other than a final order of removal.we have jurisdiction under.in cases reviewing final administrative decisions under the apa,we review the district court summary judgment decision de novo,while applying the appropriate standard of review to the agency decision.concerned citizens alliance,slater,cir quoting sierra club slater,cir.under the apa,we review agency actions to determine whether they were arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a

iii.analysis 
the eids assert several reasons why they believe the bia denial of the i petition was arbitrary and capricious.we deal with each in turn.
level of intent required for purpose of evading the immigration laws 
the eids first argument is that the bia rejection of their i petition was improper because the statutory bar of c did not apply.it states in pertinent part 
n o petition shall be approved if the alien has previously been accorded,or has sought to be accorded,an immediate relative or preference status as the spouse of a citizen of the united states by reason of a marriage determined by the attorney general to have been entered into for the purpose of evading the immigration laws 
c emphasis added.at base is the level of intent necessary for a marriage to be for the purpose of evading the immigration laws.the eids argue specific intent to break immigration laws is required.the bia,in contrast,concluded that eid and pickett admissions that their marriage was entered for the sole purpose of procuring the beneficiary lawful status in the united states are sufficient basis to trigger the c bar emphasis added.
we defer to the bia reasonable interpretation of ambiguous provisions of the immigration and nationality act ina pursuant to chevron,natural resources defense council.see ins aguirre aguirre,sarango att y,cir.under the familiar chevron analysis,we ask first whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if so,courts,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.united states.geiser,cir quoting c hen ashcroft,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the question at issue,we give controlling weight to the agency interpretation
