hector claims that he is eligible for asylum and contends that the board of immigration appeals bia erred in ruling to the contrary.because pascual has not established past persecution on account of his political beliefs and because at any rate he has no reasonable fear of future persecution based on changed country conditions,we affirm.
hector is a native and citizen of guatemala and a member of the mayan kanjobal race,one of the country indigenous minority populations.for much of the second half of the century,a civil war raged in guatemala,pitting mostly indigenous,leftist guerrilla revolutionaries against the government and paramilitary organizations.
in responding to the guerrilla forces,the guatemalan government created a civilian patrol to quell the insurrection.in,when pascual was or,the government drafted him into service.in may,after several months of duty,pascual developed a fever and missed his patrol duties for four or five days.because he had not serv ed his term,patrol members sought him out,removed him from his home and repeatedly beat him with a rope.ja.the patrol members made him stand in a hole in the ground for two days,where y ou ca even stoop down.id.although pascual claimed he was honestly sick,the patrol members accused him of joining the guerrilla forces,alleging that he had skipped his duties due to his allegiance to the revolutionaries.id.the mayor of pascual municipality eventually questioned the patrol leaders about pascual detainment and sought his release.although the civil patrol then released pascual,its members continued to threaten him,telling him that he was going to die,and that they were going to do things to him.ja.
pascual continued his service in the civil patrol for seven more months,until february,when five or six of the guerrilla grabbed him on his way to patrol duty and said,you will come with us,you are going to join us because you serving with the government.ja.the guerrillas threatened pascual and his family and forced him to steal chicken and corn for the guerrilla band sustenance.for four and a half months,the guerrillas allowed pascual to change his clothes once every fifteen days and to eat every three.one day,however,when the government engaged the guerrilla forces in battle,pascual slipped away in the confusion and walked home.
upon pascual return,his family told him that the civil patrol had threatened them,beaten his wife and demanded to know whether he had joined the guerrilla forces.pascual father testified that his family was in fear of both the civil patrol and the guerrillas at that point.ja.hoping to escape the turmoil,pascual left guatemala and traveled with his wife through mexico and into the united states in,where they have resided ever since and where they have raised four children.the guatemalan civil war ended in,and the civil patrol disbanded soon after that.
when pascual left guatemala,the rest of his family picked up and moved to another part of the country,about seven or eight hours away in the mountains.ja.they moved to a very quiet mountainous region called barrias,where there is little civilization.ja.while most of pascual family eventually joined him in the united states a naturalized sister,two other sisters,one brother and his still has a brother and a sister in barrias.when asked whether it would be safe to go back and live in this place,pascual responded,i have children.i am the main support of my children who would suffer damages if we have to go.ja.the guatemalan government,pascual said,has never provided anything for mayans t hey never provided for school or anything that we wanted to do.ja.pascual father echoed the point,noting that the guatemalan government is uncaring towards mayans.ja.
the immigration and naturalization service discovered pascual illegal presence and in charged him with entering the country without inspection and with thus being deportable under former ina a b.at a hearing in,pascual conceded his deportability but renewed a previously filed application for asylum relief.pending a final decision on the asylum application,the immigration judge ij ordered pascual to have his fingerprints taken by june,but pascual failed to comply with the order.on january,the ij determined that pascual had thereby abandoned his application for asylum,and pascual appealed to the bia.four years later,the bia summarily reversed the ij decision and remanded his case.
in,at a third hearing,pascual testified about his mistreatment at the hands of the guatemalan civil patrol and his abduction by the guerrillas.the ij found pascual credible but held that he had not met his burden of proving a fear of persecution.neither pascual recruitment by the guerrillas nor his punishment for missing his duty,the ij determined,constituted past persecution on account of his political opinion.in reaching this conclusion,the ij acknowledged the state department country report on guatemala,which catalogued extant rampant violence in guatemala and the economic hardship facing mayan minorities,ja,but found that this is not tantamount to proving a fear of persecution on account of any of the established grounds,ja.even if there had been persecution,the ij added,there were safe places in the country to which pascual could return,undermining his claim of persecution.the bia affirmed without opinion.
the attorney general may grant asylum to a refugee,b,defined as an alien unwilling to return home because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,id.a a.applicants who establish past persecution are entitled to a presumption that they can not return home based upon a fear of future persecution,but the government can rebut this presumption if it establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that a fundamental change in circumstances in the country has undermined any such fear.b i a see also singh ashcroft,cir.
where,as here,the bia adopts the ij reasoning,we review the ij decision directly,singh,at,and we may reverse his determination that pascual was ineligible for asylum only if no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution,ins,d see also b b.in view of the ij unchallenged credibility determination,we accept the substance of pascual testimony.
in,the supreme court rejected a similar asylum claim.at,like pascual,lived in guatemala during the civil war.and likewise was caught between the demands of the government and the guerrillas,prompting him ultimately to resist the guerrilla conscription efforts out of fear of governmental retribution and eventually to flee the country.id.the court rejected claim on the ground that a fear of retaliation from a guerrilla group conscription efforts did not establish that the retaliation would rise to the level of persecution on account of political opinion.id.at.as the court explained,one might reasonably refuse conscription for any number of apolitical reasons fear of combat,a desire to remain with one family and friends,a desire to earn a better living in civilian life,to mention only a few.id.even if decision to remain neutral was itself the affirmative expression of a political opinion,the court said,the record did not compel the conclusion that he reasonably feared the guerrillas would persecute him because of that political opinion,rather than because of his refusal to fight.id.at.to prevail,the supreme court made clear,the alien must establish that the alleged persecution turned on the victim political opinion,not the persecutor.id.at.
pascual claim does not meet this standard.pascual does not claim that he advocated,or indeed held,any particular political view when he lived in guatemala.he instead seeks asylum based on persecution due to political opinions imputed to him by the guerrillas and the government.the supreme court has not decided whether imputed political opinions may form the basis of an asylum claim.see id.assuming arguendo that an erroneously imputed political opinion would suffice.several circuit courts have held that they may.see,morales,cir delgado mukasey,cir balasubramanrim,cir gonzales,cir mem
