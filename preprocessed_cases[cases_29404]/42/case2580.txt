background 
zheng is a native of guangtao village in fujian province in the people republic of china.she married xing dong in.the couple registered the marriage in february and were fined for filing the registration late.zheng gave birth to a son in november without having received a birth permit from the chinese government.she testified that during her pregnancy her husband employer threatened to fire him if she did not have an abortion and that her husband was in fact fired from his factory job after their son birth.zheng submitted a copy of her husband notice of termination,dated february,which corroborates her testimony.the notice states that xing dong resisted the education and persuasion of his supervisors and argued with the birth control officer several times.the notice further provides that pursuant to china population and family planning law and fujian province family planning stipulations,the factory communist party committee terminated xing dong employment in order to maintain our factory honor on birth control matters and to educate other workers in this factory.xing dong left china in march and has since been living in the united states,except for a brief return to china in to attend to his ailing mother.
zheng testified that after her son was born,she and her husband were identified as birth planning targets and she was repeatedly required to submit to involuntary insertion of iuds in order to prevent further pregnancies.zheng testified that chinese birth control officers forced her to have an iud inserted on three specific occasions.the first time,in may,birth control officials came to zheng home and took her to a hospital where doctors implanted an iud.zheng testified that she contracted an infection from the procedure and also suffered from bleeding,headaches,and fatigue,which she attributed to the iud.zheng had the iud removed by a private physician in january.the removal was discovered at a quarterly checkup in may,and a second iud was inserted against her will.zheng again had the iud removed,and it was replaced with a third in december.
zheng provided copies of two written notices of implementation of birth control measures,which corroborate that she and her husband were identified as birth planning targets by the villagers committee of guangtao because they had one child.the notices,dated and,reiterate china birth planning policy and urge that she enthusiastically respond to the calling of the government and report for a female examination by a certain date or face necessary corresponding administrative measures.zheng had the third iud removed in and left china for the united states in.
in her testimony and affidavit in support of her asylum application,zheng stated that she entered the united states through mexico in august,after a journey on foot.however,the government asserts,without citing record evidence,that zheng told an ins agent during her asylum interview that she flew to los angeles and passed through the airport without being stopped by immigration officials.zheng written asylum application contains no details about how she entered the united states,but at her hearing she denied ever having told an immigration official that she arrived in the country at a los angeles airport.
zheng rejoined her husband,who was living in new lenox,illinois,and in july she gave birth to a second child,a daughter.she testified that as the mother of two children,and because of her past violations of china population control policies,she would likely be subjected to involuntary sterilization and other punishment,including jail,if removed to china.
case history 
zheng filed her asylum application in may,just before the birth of her daughter,and also sought withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture cat.after an interview with an ins officer,her petition was rejected and the ins filed a notice to appear charging her with removability under a a.zheng conceded removability and a hearing was held in february before an immigration judge ij.the ij denied all forms of relief and ordered zheng removed to china.
regarding zheng asylum claim,the ij first determined that zheng had not established the time,date,and manner of entry to show that she filed for asylum within one year of arrival in the united states,as required by a b.however,the ij also addressed the merits of zheng asylum application,concluding that she was not credible and thus had not established that she suffered past persecution by the alleged iuds.the ij also denied zheng claim for withholding of removal under b,which is not subject to the deadline applicable to asylum claims.the ij determined that zheng had not demonstrated the clear probability of persecution required for such relief because she was not a credible witness.the ij also relied on this adverse credibility finding to deny zheng claim for relief under the cat.
zheng appealed the ij order of removal to the bia.zheng argued that she was eligible for asylum because she was a refugee within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act ina as a person who resisted a coercive population control program.the ina defines a refugee as a person who is unable or unwilling to return to the country of his nationality because of persecution or a fear of future persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira amended the definition of refugee to cover certain applicants seeking relief from china policy who before the amendment could not establish persecution on one of the five enumerated grounds.see lin ashcroft,cir.
under the amended statute,an applicant may establish past persecution on account of political opinion if she has been forced to abort a pregnancy,has undergone involuntary sterilization,has been persecuted for failing or refusing to undergo either such procedure,or has been persecuted for other resistance to a coercive population control program.a b lin,at.zheng argued that she met the statutory definition because she credibly testified that she suffered past persecution by the involuntary implantation of iuds and resisted china population control policy by having the iuds removed illegally.
zheng also argued that she established a likelihood of future persecution that was credible in light of the family planning policy and practice in china because as the mother of two children,she would face involuntary sterilization if returned to china.zheng asserted that the ij unfairly relied upon state department country reports in his decision in particular,she challenged the ij reliance on the country reports to support his conclusion that in urban areas the one child policy is not strictly enforced and that chinese tend to immigrate for economic rather that political reasons.zheng argued that the state department reports were outdated,internally inconsistent,inaccurate,and too generalized to permit an individualized assessment of her claim.zheng also took issue with the ij conclusion that her husband was unlikely to have been fired for the couple violation of chi
