in this appeal,we consider whether a conviction under any of four california statutory rape penal code c,b,b,or h constitutes the aggravated felony sexual abuse of a minor within the meaning of a.we conclude that each statute defines conduct that is categorically broader than the generic definition of sexual abuse of a minor and grant the petition for review.

after dhs commenced proceedings,admitted the allegations but denied removability and moved to terminate the removal proceedings.on july,the immigration judge ij denied the motion to terminate the proceedings and found removable as an aggravated felon under a a iii,a a iii of the immigration and nationality act ina,as that term is defined in a a.that provision defines aggravated felony as murder,rape,or sexual abuse of a minor.a a.the ij appeared to rest this decision on conviction under california penal code c,the statutory rape law which criminalizes sexual intercourse with someone under and three years younger than the defendant,who is not the defendant spouse.the ij relied at least in part on our withdrawn opinion in valencia gonzales,cir,which found that c was a crime of violence and hence an aggravated felony.the ij recognized that was being removed for sexual abuse of a minor,not a crime of violence.the ij did not have the benefit of the valencia panel amended opinion holding that c is not a crime of violence under a f.see valencia gonzales,cir.
appealed the ij decision to the board of immigration appeals bia,which dismissed the appeal on october.the bia found no merit to argument that because the sexual acts were consensual,no violence was used and that there is no evidence of potential harm to the victim.instead,the bia relied heavily on its own published opinion,bia,in which the bia adopted a guide to help identify offenses which constitute sexual abuse of a minor.the bia concluded that the state of california necessarily proved that engaged in conduct which constituted sexual abuse of a minor within the meaning of the guide adopted in,in order to convict under the four california statutes.the bia affirmed the ij finding that had been convicted of an aggravated felony,citing all four of the statutes of conviction.this timely petition for review followed.

we review de novo the legal question of whether a conviction under the relevant california statutes constitutes sexual abuse of a minor within the meaning of a a.see gonzales,cir en banc.
to determine whether a conviction under c,b,b,or h constitutes sexual abuse of a minor within the meaning of a a,we apply the familiar categorical approach set forth in taylor united states,d.the categorical approach requires us to make a categorical comparison of the elements of the statute of conviction to the generic definition of the crime,and decide whether the conduct proscribed by the statute is broader than,and so does not categorically fall within,this generic definition,at quoting ashcroft,cir.we do not examine the facts underlying the offense,but look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.taylor,at.
we begin by determining the generic elements of the crime sexual abuse of a minor.in the absence of specific congressional guidance as to the elements of a crime,courts have been left to determine the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most states.id.at.fortunately,we are not faced with that circumstance here because congress has enumerated the elements of the offense of sexual abuse of a minor at that section provides,in relevant part 
sexual abuse of a minor or ward 
a of a knowingly engages in a sexual act with another person who 
has attained the age of years but has not attained the age of years and 
is at least four years younger than the person so engaging 
or attempts to do so,shall be fined under this title,imprisoned not more than years,or both.
thus,the generic offense of sexual abuse of a minor requires four elements a mens rea level of knowingly a sexual act with a minor between the ages of and and an age difference of at least four years between the defendant and the minor.
although it is unnecessary to survey current criminal law to ascertain a federal definition because congress has already supplied it,such a review shows that the congressional definition comports with the ordinary,contemporary,and common meaning of the words of the term.united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.as it is our duty to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute,duncan walker,d internal quotation marks omitted,a conviction which constitutes sexual abuse of a minor must necessarily contain an element of abuse.we have previously construed the word abuse as physical or nonphysical misuse or maltreatment or use or treat ment so as to injure,hurt,or damage.united states,cir quoting united states,cir see also united states,cir.a survey of relevant statutes makes clear that,under national contemporary standards,although sexual activity with a younger child is certainly abusive,sexual activity with an older adolescent is not necessarily abusive.
the model penal code,a,defines statutory rape as a male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife,or any person who engages in deviate sexual intercourse or causes another to engage in deviate sexual intercourse,if a the other person is less than years old and the actor is at least four years older than the other person model penal code a alteration in original.the majority of states set the age of sexual consent at age and states permit marriage at age if the parents consent.see united states thomas,cir.california is joined by only about six other states in criminalizing sexual intercourse between a and someone about to turn.see statutory rape a guide to state laws and reporting requirements,the lewin group,prepared for the department of health and human services,at.com content publications.pdf statutory rape laws by state,connecticut office of legislative research,april,at www.cga.gov olrdata jud rpt r.htm.states permit sexual intercourse between a and someone who just turned,almost two years younger than california would permit.statutory rape laws by state statutory rape a guide to state laws.in addition,another seven states permit consensual sex between someone who just turned and someone who is close to turning,which california would not allow.statutory rape laws by state statutory rape a guide to state laws.the fact that the vast majority of states do not forbid consensual sexual intercourse with a male or female indicates that such conduct is not necessarily abusive under the ordinary,contemporary,and common meaning of abuse.
our interpretations are in accord.recently,in construing a tennessee statutory rape statute similar to california,we held that c onsensual sexual penetration of an individual between the ages of and by a year old does not necessarily involve physical misuse,injur y,or assault because neither physical force nor resulting physical injury are necessarily implicated and because the tennessee law covered consensual sexual relationships,at alteration in original.we also held that psychological abuse was not necessarily a component of sexual penetration of a for two reasons.first,because the government failed to provide any evidence showing such harm and i n the absence of evidence,we refuse to assume the existence of harm.id.at citing thomas,at.second,because our prior well as common that,while consensual underage sex may be psychologically harmful to a young teen,it may not be harmful to an older one.id.we explained that a teen capacity to understand the nature of sexual relations increases gradually as he or she grows older.thus,an almost year old typically will have a higher level of sophistication about sex than a younger teen or child.id.at.
we and our sister circuits have been careful on other occasions to distinguish laws governing the sexual behavior of younger teenagers from those governing the behavior of.see,united states melton,cir recognizing the trend of treating older teenagers differently but distinguishing alaska law because it applies to those under only when incest or similar familial relationships are involved,at thomas,at united states kirk,cir importantly,the circumstances surrounding sexual contact between a and a are far different from those surrounding sexual contact between a young child and a much older adult.
we have extended that line of thought in the context of other generic offenses as well.in valencia,we held that c is not categorically a crime of violence and thus is not an aggravated felony under a f.as valencia explained,a crime of violence is defined as any offense that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.id.at quoting.we recognized that other circuits had held that the of the victim is the touchstone for determining whether a conviction constitutes a crime of violence under b because a touching without the victim consent presents a substantial risk that force may be used.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.however,n one of our sister circuits has considered whether consensual sexual intercourse with a minor between the ages of seventeen and eighteen the full range of conduct involved here is a crime of violence under b.id.as a result,because california sets the age of majority at eighteen,code a,this case requires us to break new ground.id.thus,we acknowledged a significant difference between sexual relations with someone under and sexual relations with someone between the ages of and.
moreover,we found that the assumption that a minor legal incapacity implies that the proscribed sexual intercourse is may be valid where the minor is a younger child but does not hold true where the victim is an older adolescent,who is able to engage in sexual intercourse voluntarily,despite being legally incapable of consent.id.at.we then examined a number of california cases clarifying that c criminalizes completely voluntary conduct by two consenting parties.id.at.after taking all of this into consideration,we held that because c includes consensual sexual intercourse between a and a minor one day shy of eighteen,and because a minor of this age is fully capable of freely and voluntarily consenting there is no substantial risk that physical force will be used in committing the offense.id.at.see also thomas,at holding that statutory rape between a male and a female is not a violent felony.
judge posner,writing for the seventh circuit,has found that although a year old is unlikely to appreciate fully or be able to cope effectively with the disease risks and fertility risks of intercourse and is likely to have a high risk pregnancy,the government was unable to provide any studies or reasons that would support a conclusion that sex between a year old girl perhaps,we said,a day short of and a year old man poses a potential risk of physical injury to the girl.thomas,at.see also,at refusing to assume psychological harm where the government failed to provide any evidence of it.the seventh circuit acknowledged that there is evidence that a year old girl is at greater risk of physical injury,in the event that she becomes pregnant,than if she were older,as well as at greater risk of disease,but concluded that the risk of sex to year old girls is much greater than the risk to year olds.thomas,at.the seventh circuit based its reasoning in part on the fact that states permit marriage at age and that m ore than percent of the year old girls in our society have had sexual intercourse.id.at.the same arguments apply with greater force to the california statutory rape laws,which criminalize sex acts with a male or female of age as well.in other words,while pregnancy and disease pose serious risks of physical injury to people and under,they do not necessarily pose that same risk to the far more sophisticated group of young women and men.
in sum,congress has defined the crime of sexual abuse of a minor,and its definition is in accord with the contemporary meaning attached to the crime by a majority of the states.
in opposing a generic federal definition based on the plain words adopted by congress,the government argues that when congress amended a a to include sexual abuse of a minor,see illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,a,division c of,stat,it did not intend to refer to the federal criminal offense of sexual abuse of a minor.
in support of its argument,the government notes that while congress has provisions of the federal code to define other aggravated felonies,it did not any such provision when it added sexual abuse of a minor.the fallacy of this argument is apparent upon a comprehensive examination of the list of aggravated felonies.section a includes subsections,some of which other statutory provisions,and some of which do not.significantly,there is a clear distinguishing characteristic between the aggravated felonies that are linked to other statutory provisions and those that are not.those that refer to a broad category of offenses,using a potentially ambiguous phrase,reference other statutory provisions for clarification.on the other hand,those that refer to a specific crime which is already clearly defined in criminal law have no need for a.compare,a b illicit trafficking in a controlled substance,and a f a crime of violence,with a a murder,rape,no and g a theft offense or burglary offense,no.
sexual abuse of a minor falls into the latter category,because it refers to a specific crime.as we have discussed,sexual abuse of a minor is a federal criminal offense.see.it is also a common title for offenses under state criminal codes in all cases,the offenses define what would,in more common parlance,be referred to as statutory rape.thus,like murder,rape,theft,and others sexual abuse of a minor needs no,as the term already denotes a clearly defined criminal offense.if congress had intended the aggravated felony sexual abuse of a minor to be defined differently than the criminal offense sexual abuse of a minor,it could have provided a definition,a different federal code provision,or even
