the south carolina general assembly passed the act,a comprehensive package of laws and regulations regarding immigration,in response to a perceived failure of the united states to secure its southern border and protect its national security.see united states south carolina,d,south carolina i,remanded for reconsideration,doc.cir.legislative supporters of the act said they hoped the bill would encourage persons unlawfully present in south carolina to find a different state to go to.id.the act was signed by the governor in and scheduled to take effect january.
the act contained twenty sections,only three of which are at issue in this appeal.subsections a and c make it a state felony for an unlawfully present person to allow himself or herself to be transported or moved within the state or to be harbored or sheltered to avoid detection violation of those subsections is punishable by a fine not to exceed,up to five years in prison,or both.
subsections b and d make it a state felony,also punishable by a fine not to exceed,up to five years in prison,or both,to transport,move or attempt to transport or conceal,harbor or shelter a person with intent to further that person unlawful entry into the united states or to help that person avoid apprehension or detection 
section makes it a state misdemeanor for any person years or older to fail to carry a certificate of alien registration or alien registration receipt card.a violation of section is punishable by a fine of not more than,up to days imprisonment,or both.
subsection b makes it unlawful for any person to display or possess a counterfeit or false id for the purpose of providing proof of lawful presences in the united states conviction for a first violation of subsection b is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than or imprisonment of not more than days.conviction for a second offense under the section is a felony punishable by a fine of not more than or imprisonment of not more than five years.
in two separate actions filed in the united states district court for the district of south carolina,the lowcountry immigration coalition lowcountry plaintiffs and the united states challenged various sections of the act,largely on preemption grounds.lowcountry plaintiffs is a group of individuals and organizations,including the national immigration law center,the southern poverty law center,and the american civil liberties union of south carolina.
the district court,after consolidating the cases,found sections,and b as well as other subsections of section not relevant here were preempted by federal law and issued a preliminary injunction as to those sections.south carolina i,d.before we could hear the state appeal from that order,the supreme court decided arizona united states,striking down several provisions of an arizona law that,inter alia,made it a state crime for an alien to fail to carry an alien registration document and for an unauthorized alien to apply for,solicit,or perform work.we remanded the instant case to the district court for reconsideration in light of arizona.on remand,the district court let stand its injunction of sections,and b united states.south carolina,d,south carolina ii.

the purpose of a preliminary injunction is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties until a trial on the merits can be held.of camenisch.the traditional office of a preliminary injunction is to protect the status quo and to prevent irreparable harm during the pendency of a lawsuit ultimately to preserve the court ability to render a meaningful judgment on the merits.in re microsoft.antitrust,cir.
before reaching the merits of this case,we must resolve several threshold issues.south carolina argues that lowcountry plaintiffs do not have a right of action to seek an injunction and that,under younger abstention,the district court should have declined to hear the case.both arguments lack merit.
south carolina first presses its argument that lowcountry plaintiffs do not have a right of action under the supremacy clause or to bring their claim.the state does not argue that the united states lacks a right of action.the state argues that because the supremacy clause is not a source of substantive federal rights,it can not be the basis for a private right of action here.the state leans heavily on chief justice roberts dissent in douglas independent living center of southern california,arguing it stands for the proposition that the supremacy clause does not create a private right of action.
douglas concerned three california statutes that reduced payments to medicaid recipients.id.at.the state submitted the changes to a federal agency charged with reviewing any changes to how medicaid payments are calculated.id.but before the agency could complete its review,groups of medicaid providers and beneficiaries filed a series of lawsuits seeking to enjoin the reductions on the ground that they were preempted by federal medicaid law.id.the ninth circuit ultimately affirmed or ordered preliminary injunctions that prevented the state from implementing its statutes and held that the medicaid providers and beneficiaries could directly bring an action based on the supremacy clause.id.at.
the supreme court granted certiorari to decide whether medicaid providers and recipients may maintain a cause of action under the supremacy clause to enforce a federal medicaid law.at.but about a month after oral argument in the supreme court,the federal agency charged with reviewing the payment change approved the reductions.douglas.at.that raised the question of whether the plaintiffs should seek review of the agency determination under the administrative procedure act,rather than in a supremacy clause challenge,and so the court remanded for the ninth circuit to answer that question.id.at.the ninth circuit has not yet answered the question.given the remand based on changed circumstances,the court explicitly stated that we do not address whether the ninth circuit properly recognized a supremacy clause action to enforce this federal statute before the agency took final action.id.at.
chief justice roberts,joined by justices scalia,thomas,and alito,dissented in douglas.he stated that he believed there is no private right of action under the supremacy clause to enforce a a,the relevant provisions of the medicaid act,which requires a state medicaid plan and amendments to meet certain standards of efficiency,economy,and quality of care.noting that the supremacy clause is not a source of any federal rights,the chief justice stated 
indeed,to say that there is a federal statutory right enforceable under the supremacy clause,when there is no such right under the pertinent statute itself,would effect a complete around this court implied right of action and jurisprudence.
douglas.at roberts,dissenting.
the chief justice distinguished the situation in douglas from ex parte young,and its progeny,which present quite different questions involving the assertion in equity of a defense that would otherwise have been available in the state enforcement proceedings at law.douglas.at roberts,dissenting citation and internal quotation marks omitted.he continued,nothing of that sort is at issue here the respondents are not subject to or threatened with any enforcement proceeding like the one in ex parte young.they simply seek a private cause of action congress chose not to provide.id.
we find no merit in the state contention.nothing in the chief justice dissent disturbed the prior holdings of the supreme court or circuit courts that have allowed private parties to seek injunctive relief from state statutes allegedly preempted by federal law.a long line of cases confirms this right of action.see shaw delta air lines,a plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief from state regulation,on the ground that such regulation is preempted by a federal statute which,by virtue of the supremacy clause of the constitution,must prevail,thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under to resolve.local union,united steelworkers of am.massachusetts,cir i n suits against state officials for declaratory and injunctive relief,a plaintiff may invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts by asserting a claim of preemption,even absent an explicit statutory cause of action.loyal tire auto,town of woodbury,cir sotomayor,majority opinion a plaintiff right to bring an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from municipal regulation on the ground that federal law preempts that regulation is undisputed qwest city of santa fe,new mexico,cir a party may bring a claim under the supremacy clause that a local enactment is preempted even if the federal law at issue does not create a private right of action.georgia latino alliance for human rights georgia,cir glahr finding,in a challenge to a georgia immigration law,that private plaintiffs had a right of action,and stating,l ike the other circuits to address the issue head on,we have little difficulty in holding that plaintiffs have an implied right of action to assert a preemption claim seeking injunctive relief quoting planned parenthood of houston se.sanchez,cir.
this court,too,has allowed private parties to assert preemption claims seeking injunctive relief.see aes sparrows point lng,llc smith,cir finding federal preemption,under the supremacy clause,of a local zoning ordinance in a case brought by private companies norfolk ry.city of alexandria,cir finding preemption,under the supremacy clause,of a municipal haul ordinance in case brought by railroad company.as the above cited cases make clear,the state reliance on the douglas dissent is misplaced.
we hold that under the supremacy clause lowcountry plaintiffs have an implied right of action to seek injunctive relief from south carolina act on federal preemption grounds.
south carolina next argues that the district court should have declined to hear the case under younger abstention.a district court decision to decline to abstain under younger harris,is reviewed for abuse of discretion.life partners,morrison,cir.
abstention from the exercise of federal jurisdiction is the exception,not the rule.river water conservation dist.united states.as a general rule,federal courts have a strict duty to exercise the jurisdiction that is conferred upon them by congress.quackenbush allstate ins.one of the limited exceptions to this rule is found in younger,where the supreme court held that federal courts should not stay or enjoin pending state court criminal prosecutions except in special circumstances,such as bad faith or harassment.at.we have explained that younger applies when the requested relief would interfere with an ongoing state judicial proceeding,instituted prior to any substantial progress in the federal proceeding that implicates important,substantial,or vital state interests and provides an adequate opportunity for the plaintiff to raise the federal constitutional claim advanced in the federal lawsuit.laurel sand gravel,wilson,cir quoting moore city of asheville,cir.as there is no ongoing state judicial proceeding here,younger abstention is inapplicable.
south carolina,however,asserts that it is basing its argument on younger warning about federal courts enjoining threatened or anticipated state criminal proceedings.appellant opening br.emphasis in original younger states 
w hen absolutely necessary for protection of constitutional rights,courts of the united states have power to enjoin state officers from instituting criminal actions.but this may not be done,except under extraordinary circumstances,where the danger of irreparable loss is both great and immediate.ordinarily,there should be no interference with such officers primarily,they are charged with the duty of prosecuting offenders against the laws of the state,and must decide when and how this is to be done.the accused should first set up and rely upon his defense in the state courts,even though this involves a challenge of the validity of some statute,unless it plainly appears that this course would not afford adequate protection.
younger,at quoting fenner boykin.those principles,younger stated,have been repeatedly followed and reaffirmed in other cases involving threatened prosecutions.at.the state argues that,based on principles of comity and federalism,it is inappropriate for a federal court to enjoin threatened state criminal proceedings when the federal issue could be raised as a defense in a state proceeding.
we disagree.we have held that younger does not bar the granting of federal injunctive relief when a state criminal prosecution is expected and imminent.age of majority educ.preller,cir en banc.we have also drawn a distinction between the commencement of formal enforcement proceedings,at which point younger applies,versus the period of time when there is only a threat of enforcement,when younger does not apply.telco commc ns,carbaugh,cir,cert.denied.in telco,where a state agency had commenced an investigation of a firm,we held that abstention was not appropriate because the state proceedings were in a preliminary stage.id.at.we observed that the state contention that abstention is required whenever enforcement is threatened would leave a party constitutional rights in limbo while an agency contemplates enforcement but does not undertake it.id.at.further,if younger abstention were to apply,a federal plaintiff would be placed between the scylla of intentionally flouting state law and the charybdis of forgoing what it believes to be constitutionally protected activity in order to avoid becoming enmeshed in enforcement proceedings.id.quoting steffel thompson,second alteration in original.
other circuits have endorsed the telco reasoning.see,guillemard ginorio contreras gomez,cir finding that the telco rule,requiring the commencement of formal enforcement proceedings before abstention is required,better comports with the supreme court decisions in younger and its progeny,in which an indictment or other formal charge had already been filed against the parties seeking relief at the time the federal action was brought.debating literary ass city of new orleans,cir in a scenario similar to telco,finding that younger abstention was inappropriate because there was no ongoing state proceeding.
the supreme court has made clear that injunctions of state criminal statutes may be proper when constitutional rights are at issue 
it is correct that generally a court will not enjoin the enforcement of a criminal statute even though unconstitutional,since such a result seriously impairs the state interest in enforcing its criminal laws,and implicates the concerns for federalism which lie at the heart of younger.but this is not an absolute policy and in some circumstances injunctive relief may be appropriate.to justify such interference there must be exceptional circumstances and a clear showing that an injunction is necessary in order to afford adequate protection of constitutional rights.
wooley maynard,emphasis added citations and internal quotation marks omitted.see also doran salem inn,affirming grant of preliminary injunction to two bar owners challenging town ordinance prohibiting topless dancing,finding younger abstention inapplicable,and holding that,in the absence of a state criminal proceeding,a plaintiff may challenge the constitutionality of the state statute in federal court,assuming he can satisfy the requirements for federal jurisdiction.
following our reasoning in telco,we hold that younger abstention is inapplicable where,as here,state proceedings have not begun against the federal plaintiffs and the plaintiffs seek injunctive relief to protect their constitutional rights.plaintiffs need not wait to be arrested under the challenged sections of the act before they can assert a constitutional claim.they need not live under a cloud of prolonged uncertainty as to their rights.telco,at.the district court was correct to decline to abstain.
we turn now to the merits.the district court issued preliminary injunctions for sections,and b of act,finding those sections preempted by federal immigration law and regulations.south carolina ii,d at.the state argues the act is a proper exercise of its police powers and does not undermine or conflict with federal law.courts recognize three types of federal preemption express preemption,in which congress expressly states its intent to preempt state law,cox shalala,cir field preemption,in which congress occupies a certain field by regulating so pervasively that there is no room left for the states to supplement federal law,id.citing fid.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,or where there is a federal interest so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject,arizona.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted and conflict preemption,arising when state law is preempted to the extent it actually conflicts with federal law,cox,at citing pac.gas state energy res.conservation dev.comm n.the supreme court has instructed that conflict preemption includes cases where compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,and those instances where the challenged state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.arizona.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the district court enjoined sections,and b under theories of field and conflict preemption.
we note that the presumption against preemption does not apply here because immigration is an area traditionally regulated by the federal government.this court has declined to apply the presumption against preemption when dealing with a state law that regulates an area with authorized federal presence,such as national banking.epps jp morgan chase bank,cir.we further decline to apply the presumption to state laws that concern immigration,an area with extensive federal presence.see arizona.at observing that i mmigration policy shapes the destiny of the nation and t he national government has significant power to regulate immigration.
sections a and c of the act make it a state felony for an unlawfully present person to allow himself or herself to be transported or moved within the state or to be harbored or sheltered to avoid detection.the district court found these subsections essentially criminalize mere presence.south carolina ii,d at.the state argues that these sections do not punish mere unlawful presence because they require that the illegally present alien take action to transport,harbor or shelter themselves with the intent to further his or her unlawful entry into the united states or to avoid apprehension or detection.appellant opening br.south carolina also presses the argument that these sections only concern the historic police powers of the state and thus should be given great deference.id.at.
the supreme court recognized in arizona that a s a general rule,it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the united states.at.we are to see how an unlawfully present alien,going about her normal daily life,would be able to avoid violating sections a and c of the act.simply staying in one home could be viewed as an attempt to shelter oneself from detection.taking a bus or driving home at the end of the workday would be transport ing oneself to the shelter of one home to avoid detection.the broad sweep of these sections violates the clear rule of arizona that unlawful presence is not a criminal offense.
in an analogous case,the eleventh circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction against a section of an alabama statute that prohibited state courts from enforcing a contract to which an unlawfully present alien was a party.united states alabama,cir.the court found the statute to be extraordinary and unprecedented,and criticized its broad sweep essentially,the ability to maintain even a minimal existence is no longer an option for unlawfully present aliens in alabama.id.at.in finding the section preempted,the court noted that it burdened a capability that,in practical application,is essential for an individual to live and conduct daily affairs.id.at.
in essence,sections a and c operate to criminalize unlawful presence,a stance plainly at odds with federal law.under federal law,unlawfully present aliens are subject to civil removal proceedings.see.a principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials.arizona.at.this discretion is necessary because it involves policy choices that bear on this nation international relations.id.the state,by criminalizing what congress has deemed a civil offense and entrusted to the discretion of the executive branch,is pursu ing policies that undermine federal law.id.at.sections a and c are thus conflict preempted because they stand as an obstacle to the execution of the federal removal system and interfere with the discretion entrusted to federal immigration officials.they make criminals out of aliens attempting to do no more than go to school,go to work,and care for their families.arizona.at m aking criminals out of aliens engaged in unauthorized work aliens who already face the possibility of employer exploitation because of their removable status would be inconsistent with federal policy and objectives.
the district court was correct to enjoin sections a and c because they criminalize actions that congress has,as a policy choice,decided are a civil matter.we hold that sections a and c are preempted by federal law.
sections b and d of the act make it a state felony to transport,move or attempt to transport or conceal,harbor or shelter a person with intent to further that person unlawful entry into the united states or to help that person avoid apprehension or detection.the district court found the provisions present a classic case of field preemption.south carolina i,d at.the sections are similar to a federal statute that makes it unlawful to transport or move or conceal,harbor or shield an unlawful alien.a a ii and iii.while the federal law authorizes state and local law enforcement officers to make arrests for violations under the statute,prosecution is at the discretion of federal prosecutors and the cases are brought in federal court.id.c.
the state argues that it is possible to comply with both the federal and state harboring laws,and that the state law is not field preempted because the federal regulations do not provide a full set of standards.id.provisions of the united states code,however,show otherwise.the immigration and naturalization act the ina provides for penalties against third parties engaged in a full set of harboring and transporting offenses the ina authorizes penalties against those who conceal,harbor,or shield unlawfully present aliens from detection,a a iii those who encourage or induce aliens to enter the united states without lawful authorization,id.a a iv those who transport an alien within the unit
