opinion of the court 
on november,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued an order reinstating a prior order of deportation against petitioner antonio pursuant to section a of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira appeals,arguing that section a does not apply to him because he was previously deported as opposed to removed applying section a in his case would be impermissibly retroactive because he was deported prior to april,the effective date of iirira the reinstatement order was invalid because it did not specify where and when he illegally reentered the united states and because his counsel was not notified of its issuance and the deportation order which underlies the order of reinstatement is vulnerable to collateral attack.
we have jurisdiction pursuant to section a of the immigration and nationality act,which is codified at a,and will affirm for the reasons we summarize as follows.first,section d of iirira provides that any reference in law to an order of removal shall be deemed to include a reference to an order of exclusion and deportation or an order of deportation.there is no reason to limit the applicability of this provision in the ways that advocates.second,while was deported prior to the effective date of iirira,he does not allege that he illegally reentered the united states prior to it.thus,the consequences of his actions at the time that he illegally reentered are the consequences he faces now.third,neither the fact that the ins did not specify where or when reentered nor the fact that his counsel was not notified that reinstatement proceedings had been initiated invalidates the reinstatement order which was issued in this case.finally,while may be able to collaterally attack the underlying deportation order elsewhere,we are precluded from reviewing it in a reinstatement proceeding.see a.
is a native mexican and citizen of mexico who entered the united states without inspection in,when he was five years old.he became a lawful permanent resident in.in,he was convicted of corporal injury to parent and of vehicle theft,and in,he was convicted of burglary.later in,the ins issued an order to show cause charging him with deportability as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.an immigration judge found that was deportable as charged and that he was not eligible for relief from deportation,and ordered him deported to mexico,who was not represented by counsel,waived his right to appeal to the board of immigration appeals.on january,he was deported to mexico.
although,pursuant to a a ii i,was barred from the united states for ten years following his removal,he reentered within that time.on october,the ins served him with form,entitled notice of to reinstate prior order,which alleged that he was removed on january,and that he had illegally on an unknown date and at an unknown place.on november,the ins issued a final order of reinstatement against him 
the first question presented is whether section a,which gives the attorney general the authority to reinstate a prior order of removal where an alien has illegally reentered the united states,also permits the reinstatement of a prior order of deportation before iirira,individuals who were ineligible for admission into the united states and were never admitted into the united states were referred to as excludable,while aliens who had gained admission,but later became subject to expulsion from the united states,were referred to as deportable.united states,cir.after iirira,aliens who were previously referred to as excludable are termed inadmissible,and the term removal proceedings covers proceedings applicable to both inadmissible and deportable aliens.id.thus,a reference to an order of removal would encompass an order of deportation.see bejjani ins,cir iirira replaced the concepts of exclusion and deportation with the concept of removal omar ins,cir iirira eliminated the previous legal distinction between deportation and removal proceedings united states,cir same united states pantin,cir same.
essentially argues that,in spite of these changes,the words deportation and removal are not interchangeable,thus attempting to limit the applicability of section d of iirira,which provides as follows transitional purposes of carrying out the immigration and nationality act,as amended by this subtitle any reference in law to an order of removal shall be deemed to include a reference to an order of exclusion and deportation or an order of deportation.
argues that section d does not apply as broadly as it appears,because if it did it would render superfluous congress reference to orders of exclusion and deportation in iirira d j,which amended a and which penalizes aliens who reenter the united states after having been denied admission,excluded,deported,or removed.this argument has been rejected by several courts of appeals.see,at any distinction between deportation and removal is legally insignificant for purposes of united states,cir same pantin,at same.we,too,will not ignore the plain language of section d or the other provisions of iirira which eliminate the distinction between deportation and removal,in order to read section d j.
second argument with regard to section d is that it only applies to transitional rules cases,which are those cases in which the alien was in exclusion or deportation proceedings before iirira effective date,but in which a hearing was not held until after the effective date.see iirira c.in such cases,the attorney general can elect to apply the provisions of iirira.argues that section d permits only those final orders of deportation or exclusion which were entered in transitional rules cases to be treated as removal orders in future reinstatement proceedings.
does not point to anything in the statute or in the cases to support this interpretation of section d.the transitional rules are contained in section c of iirira,which is captioned transition for aliens in proceedings and which begins by limiting its applicability to aliens in exclusion or deportation proceedings before iirira effective date.while section d is captioned transitional references,it provides that it applies to any reference in law,for purposes of carrying out the immigration and nationality act.in addition,if section d applied only to those transitional rules cases where the attorney general chose to apply iirira,it would be unnecessary,because,as noted above,iirira eliminates the distinction between deportation and exclusion proceedings and subsumes both under the rubric of removal 
argues,next,that iirira reinstatement provision was impermissibly retroactive as applied to him because the underlying deportation order was issued prior to iirira effective date.to determine if a statute applies to events which occurred prior to its enactment,a test is applied.see landgraf usi film products,d perez elwood,cir.first,a court must determine whether congress intent with regard to temporal reach is clear from the language of the statute.if it is not,the court must determine whether application of the statute to conduct would have a retroactive effect.if so,the court should presume that the legislation does not apply to the conduct in question,and apply it only prospectively.perez,at.
with regard to the first prong of the landgraf test,argues that congress intent that the reinstatement provision not be applied retrospectively is clear,for the reasons given by the ninth circuit in ins,cir.see also bejjani,at same thus,he argues that congress clearly did not intend retrospective application because while the prior reinstatement provision specified that it applied to aliens who unlawfully reentered the united states after having previously departed or been deported pursuant to an order of deportation,whether before or after june,the new reinstatement provision is silent.compare f repealed in with iirira a.while the omission of retroactivity language provides some support for argument regarding congress intent,it does not constitute an express mandate regarding the statute temporal reach.see landgraf,at.
also points to several sections of iirira which implicate
