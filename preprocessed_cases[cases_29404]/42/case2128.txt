hisham dawood petitioner petitions this court for review of the decisions of the immigration judge ij denying his request for a continuance and voluntary departure,and the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his motion to remand.the government contests our jurisdiction to hear petitioner claims.for the following reasons,we hold that we have jurisdiction to review all petitioner claims except his request for voluntary departure.however,we deny the petition on the merits.
background 
petitioner is a native of israel and a citizen of jordan.he entered the united states as a visitor for pleasure on september.his authorization expired on march.petitioner remained in the country after the expiration of his authorization.on january,petitioner married shaheerah jean storrs,a citizen of the united states.on april,petitioner was convicted in the shaker heights,ohio,municipal court of five counts of criminal simulation in violation of a of the shaker heights codified ordinances.he was also convicted,on the same day,and in the same court,of criminal simulation in violation of a of the ohio revised code.
the former immigration and naturalization service initiated removal proceedings against petitioner on december.in its notice to appear nta,the charged petitioner with being subject to removal pursuant to title a b and a a ii,as an alien who,after admission,remained in the united states for longer than he was permitted,and who was convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude.at the initial hearing held on august,petitioner admitted to an ij all but one of the factual allegations in the nta.he only denied that the crimes for which he was convicted arose from more than a single scheme of criminal misconduct.thus,he admitted that he was removable pursuant to title a b.petitioner also requested voluntary departure.the ij continued the proceedings until july,based on an certification filed by petitioner wife.
the july,hearing was continued until may,in order to permit petitioner to seek a labor certification.the labor certification never materialized.in august of,petitioner finalized his divorce from his first wife.five days before his may,hearing,petitioner married his second wife.petitioner second wife filed a second on his behalf.
at the may,hearing,the ij determined that petitioner was removable as charged,and ordered him deported to jordan.at the beginning of that hearing,the ij,exercising her discretion,denied petitioner request for a third continuance based on the second filed by petitioner new wife.the ij cited the number and length of the prior continuances,the fact that the second wife would have been aware of petitioner pending deportation proceeding prior to her marriage to him,and petitioner criminal convictions as reasons for declining to exercise her discretion.the ij also expressed some frustration that petitioner had not informed the court of his pending divorce at the july,hearing where the second continuance was granted finally,the ij denied petitioner voluntary departure.
petitioner appealed the ij rulings to the bia where he made a motion to remand.the bia affirmed the ij and denied the motion.petitioner now asks this court to review the ij decisions on the denial of a continuance,the ij denial of voluntary departure,and the bia decision denying his motion to remand.petitioner also contests the ij decision with respect to whether his convictions stemmed from a single scheme of criminal misconduct the government contests our jurisdiction to hear the appeal.the government also,in the alternative,contests the merits of petitioner arguments.
jurisdiction 
we must first address the question of whether this court has jurisdiction over petitioner claims.we review the existence of subject matter jurisdiction de novo.ammex,cox,cir.petitioner asserts that this court has jurisdiction to review the ij denial of voluntary departure,the bia denial of his motion to remand his case to the ij,and the ij denial of a continuance.we address each argument in turn.
title a grants judicial review of final orders of removal except as provided in subsection b.however,title a b i,regardless of whether the judgment,decision,or action is made in removal proceedings,strips courts of jurisdiction to review any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section h,i,or of this title.voluntary departure is addressed in.thus,this court lacks jurisdiction to review the ij denial of voluntary departure.see f.
this court has already determined that it has jurisdiction over the bia denial of a motion to remand.see pilica ashcroft,cir.in pilica,this court held that a motion to reopen that does not involve the consideration of relief on the merits should not be treated as regarding the granting of relief under.id.accordingly,this court held that it had jurisdiction over the bia denial of a motion to remand.id.similarly here,the motion for remand involves procedural issues,not the merits of petitioner claims.thus,the government arguments to the contrary are unavailing.
the question of whether this court has jurisdiction to review the ij denial of a continuance requires a more nuanced discussion.title a b ii strips courts of jurisdiction to review any other decision or action of the attorney general the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general,other than the granting of relief under section a of this title.the phrase this subchapter refers to subchapter ii of chapter of title.zafar attorney general,cir onyinkwa ashcroft,cir.see also van dinh reno,cir.
in cdi information services,reno,cir,this court applied a b ii in holding that it lacked jurisdiction over the decision denying an immigrant an extension of his visa.we determined that a and its accompanying regulation,c,gave the attorney general discretion to decide on visa extensions and,because of that discretion,under a b ii,the court lacked jurisdiction.see id.
the government notes that petitioner appeals only the denial of his motion for a continuance and not his removability.the government argues that a,which reads an immigration judge shall conduct proceedings for deciding the inadmissibility or deportability of an alien,and now codified at,which reads the immigration judge may grant a motion for continuance for good cause shown,give the ij discretion over the granting of continuances.apparently,the government concludes that the ij decision to grant or deny a continuance when presiding in a removal proceeding is a decision within the discretion of the attorney general,with the result that this court is stripped of jurisdiction pursuant to a b ii.the government reaches this conclusion by relying on onyinkwa and on this circuit decision in cdi information services.onyinkwa,at whenever a regulation implementing a subchapter ii statute confers discretion upon an ij,iirira generally divests courts of jurisdiction to review the exercise of that discretion.citing cdi info,reno,at.
in onyinkwa,the eighth circuit relying on this court opinion in cdi information services found that it lacked jurisdiction to rule on whether an ij improperly denied onyinkwa a continuance.onyinkwa,at.the onyinkwa court did recognize an exception to the rule for situations where a showing of a substantial violation has been made.id.in relying on cdi information services,we believe that onyinkwa misapplied our precedent.cdi information services dealt with an application for a visa extension.section a and the regulation it enables,c,give the attorney general discretion over the granting of visa applications.in contrast,continuances are governed by a and,which give ijs discretion over the granting of continuances.the attorney general is not given discretion to order removal in contested removal proceedings,and the government does not so contend.section a b ii only applies to the portions of subchapter ii left to the attorney general discretion,not the portions of subchapter ii that leave discretion with ijs in matters where ijs are merit that are subject to our review.zafar,at ashcroft,cir.thus,under the plain language of a b ii,the sections the government points
