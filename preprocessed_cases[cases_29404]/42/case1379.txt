opinion of the court 
it is a hallmark of the american system of justice that anyone who appears as a litigant in an american courtroom is treated with dignity and respect.that expectation must be met regardless of the citizenship of the parties or the nature of the litigation.in a country built on the dreams and accomplishments of an immigrant population,a particularly severe wound is inflicted on that principle when an immigration matter is not conducted in accord with the best of our tradition of courtesy and fairness.
the case now before us exemplifies the severe wound inflicted when not a modicum of courtesy,of respect,or of any pretense of fairness is extended to a petitioner and the case he so valiantly attempted to present.yet once again,under the bullying nature of the immigration judge questioning,a petitioner was ground to bits.that immigration judge conduct has been condemned in prior opinions of this court.see,sukwanputra gonzales,cir intemperate and remarks interjected by the immigration judge,none of which had any basis in the facts introduced,or the arguments made,at the hearing fiadjoe attorney general,cir bullying and brow beating by the immigration judge continuing hostility towards the obviously distraught petitioner and his abusive treatment of her throughout the hearing,reducing her to an inability to respond and an oral decision,later sanitized,which was crude and cruel.
on the day on which oral argument was heard in this case,a deputy assistant attorney general appeared,at our request,to explain what,if any,procedures are followed when repeated conduct of this nature is seen.it is not coincidental,we think,that on that same day the attorney general announced a comprehensive review of the immigration courts.in a memorandum to immigration judges referenced during argument,the attorney general made the following statement 
i have watched with concern the reports of immigration judges who fail to treat aliens appearing before them with appropriate respect and consideration and who fail to produce the quality of work that i expect from employees of the department of justice.while i remain convinced that most immigration judges ably and professionally discharge their difficult duties,i believe there are some whose conduct can aptly be described as intemperate or even abusive and whose work must improve.
he concluded his statement by reminding immigration judges that t o the aliens who stand before you,you are the face of american justice and insist ing that each be treated with courtesy and respect.we agree that most immigration judges ably and professionally discharge what surely are difficult duties.we write because one of them,the donald ferlise,has seen fit on more than one occasion,including that now before us,not to do so.
we begin with a taste of the conduct which so troubles us,conduct which tainted the entire proceeding.at the very outset of the hearing,petitioner abou cham said,in english,that he was born in.

towards the end of the second day of the hearing,and immediately after excluding evidence cham sought to present,judge ferlise went after cham one last time.

petitioner abou cham,now years of age,is a citizen of the gambia.he claims to have entered the united states on or about february,in chicago,using the gambian passport of his cousin,fotou cham,who lives in the united kingdom.on april,cham filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and for relief under the united nations convention against torture cat with the former immigration and naturalization service ins,now the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement bice.on june,the ins initiated removal proceedings against him by issuing a notice to appear.judge ferlise held hearings on april,and june,denied relief,and ordered cham removed to the gambia.cham filed a timely appeal with the board of immigration appeals bia.on october,the bia dismissed the appeal.a timely petition for review to this court followed.
cham based his application for relief on his relationship with his uncle,dawda jawara,who was president of the gambia until he was ousted by a military coup on july.jawara and his family,including cham,are members of the people progressive party ppp,a political party that has since been banned by the gambia new regime.because of their association with jawara and the ppp,four of cham unless have been attacked arrested and jailed since the coup.his uncle,oshous njie,who was head of the gambian central bank in jawara government was imprisoned for two years.another uncle,bana njie,a doctor,was stabbed by members of the new regime.two other uncles were jailed when the coup occurred.
at the time of the coup,cham was fifteen years old.after two days of violence following the coup,cham escaped alone to neighboring senegal to live with his aunt.he lived and attended high school in senegal until,but left senegal for the united states when his aunt informed him that there were people looking for him and in my mind,those people were nobody else but the people connected to the people in power in gambia.as noted above,cham cousin,fotou cham,helped him by getting him plane tickets to england and then to chicago,and by allowing him to use his gambian passport to make the journey.cham fears that if he returns to the gambia he will be arrested because he will be easily recognized by members of the current regime.cham mother still resides in the gambia his father is deceased.
cham submitted an affidavit from jawara,written in,which confirmed jawara status as former president of the gambia and his relationship to cham.additionally,cham submitted a letter from osman salla,jawara former ambassador to the united states,which warned that cham life could be in danger should he return to t he gambia.
cham also documented the fact that seven members of jawara family have been granted asylum in the united states.judge ferlise admitted the documents,but declared that we do boot strap one case on the other and i do see the relevance of that group exhibit.according to cham,the ppp party is still banned in the gambia,and its members are still being arrested and harassed,with their property and travel documents taken away.t here no peace in that country.
in an oral decision rendered immediately after the hearing concluded,judge ferlise denied cham applications for relief and ordered him deported to the gambia.there is no question that judge ferlise intended his decision to be bulletproof,and so every i was dotted and t was then some.first,finding that cham failed to present any proof of when he entered the united states,judge ferlise found that cham failed to demonstrate that he filed his asylum application within one year of entry,as required by a b.second,he found that cham testimony was totally incredible,and that t here is no portion of the respondent testimony that makes sense to this court.as the basis for this finding,he cited numerous supposed inconsistencies in cham testimony and his demeanor.third,on the basis of cham total incredibility,he found that cham has fabricated his entire case in chief,has fabricated his testimony,and has filed a frivolous application for asylum.
fourth,assuming that cham testimony was credible,judge ferlise found that cham has not presented a scintilla of evidence that he has ever been persecuted,and has failed to establish a fear of persecution or establish that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted again if he is returned to the gambia.finally,assuming that he was considering cham for asylum and further assuming that cham was credible and that he had in fact been persecuted in the past,judge ferlise concluded that cham application would still be denied because he could avoid future persecution by simply returning to senegal where he lived for years without any problem.
on appeal,the bia adopted and affirmed the denial of cham substantive claims for the reasons stated by judge ferlise.however,the bia reversed judge ferlise finding that cham filed a frivolous asylum record did not disclose that the application was knowingly fabricated and judge ferlise failed to provide a sufficient explanation for why he came to that conclusion.the bia had jurisdiction under b.we have jurisdiction under section a of the immigration and nationality act ina,a.we will review the immigration judge opinion to the extent it was adopted by the bia.see abdulai ashcroft,cir.
we began with a reminder of the dignity,respect,courtesy,and fairness,that a litigant should expect to receive in an american courtroom.these words,quoted by us at the very outset of this opinion,are not merely advisory or aspirational.indeed,although cham has no constitutional right to asylum,he was entitled,as a matter of due process,to a full and fair hearing on his application see abdulrahman ashcroft,cir abdulai,at.a full and fair hearing would have provided him with a neutral and impartial arbiter of the merits of his claim and a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on his behalf.abdulrahman,at citing schweiker mcclure,d ins,cir.cham received neither.
no person may be deprived of his interests in the absence of a proceeding in which he may present his case with assurance that the arbiter is not predisposed to find against him.wang ag of the united states,cir quoting marshall jerrico,d.it is crystal clear that judge ferlise presumed cham application to be without merit before even a shred of testimony had been presented,and treated cham accordingly.indeed,early in this opinion,when we used the phrase ground to bits,we did not do so idly.from the very beginning of the hearing in this matter until the very end,judge ferlise continually abused an increasingly distraught petitioner,rendering him unable to coherently respond to judge ferlise questions.this,of course,enabled judge ferlise to then conclude that cham testimony was totally incredible because of inconsistencies and because his demeanor was that of an individual not telling the truth.
beyond the belligerence,there was wholesale nitpicking of cham testimony with an eye towards finding inconsistencies and contradictions that judge ferlise undoubtedly believed would nail the lid shut on cham case and nitpicking it was.for example,cham was fifteen at the time of the coup and testified,nine years later,that the coup took place in june when in fact it took place in july.while we are at a loss to understand the relevance,much less the materiality,of this discrepancy,judge ferlise made much of this obvious contradiction,convinced that the date of such a traumatic event would be forever seared in cham memory.indeed,the fact that cham made this mistake about an event which occurred years earlier when he was little more than a boy so exercised judge ferlise that he found that it has a negative impact on his credibility and the credibility of his case in chief.id.
another example.judge ferlise began his opinion by pointing out that cham originally testified that he was born in.then he changed it to the year,then he changed it back to the year,and finally settled on being born september.it is,of course,immaterial to cham claim of persecution whether he was born in or.moreover,it is clear from the dialogue that took place between cham,the interpreter,and judge ferlise that cham was being required by judge ferlise to say the month of his birth in the wolof language and was unable to do so.it is clear,as well,that the interpreter did not know all of the months in wolof.when cham was finally permitted to give the date of his birth in english,he answered accurately and without hesitation.and,of course,there was the exchange,quoted above,in which judge ferlise ignored the fact that cham said he was fifteen and focused on the contradiction between fourteen and going on sixteen.cham was unable to explain this contradiction,and judge ferlise concluded that w henever the court sees a respondent testimony impeaching subsequent testimony during a hearing,the credibility of the respondent and the case in chief naturally suffers.id.
we do not pause to consider the various other even more minor discrepancies judg
