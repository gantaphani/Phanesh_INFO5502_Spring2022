petitioner allan nolan,an alien being held by the united states government for removal from the united states following his conviction of an aggravated felony,see a a iii,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york,richard arcara,judge,dismissing his petition for habeas corpus on the ground that the immigration and naturalization service ins board of immigration appeals bia or board erred in refusing to terminate his deportation proceedings in order to permit him to apply,pursuant to of the immigration and nationality act ina,for naturalization on the basis of his prior service in the armed forces of the united states.the district court dismissed the petition on the ground that the bia did not err because nolan is ineligible for naturalization under ina by reason of his inability to show good moral character,see d.on appeal,nolan argues principally that the district court erred in upholding the bia decision because ina does not require a showing of good moral character.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the denial of the petition.
background 
the pertinent facts are not in dispute.the ins which has ceased to exist as an independent agency,certain of its functions having been transferred as of march,to the department of homeland security,see homeland security act of,stat,commenced removal proceedings against nolan in.nolan sought to forestall his removal by becoming a naturalized united states citizen pursuant to certain provisions of title of the version of the united states code relating to the naturalization of aliens who served in the armed forces of the united states armed forces.the only issues on this appeal concern the meanings of those provisions and related regulatory provisions.
nolan personal history 
nolan is a permanent resident alien who entered the united states at the age of in.in,he enlisted in the united states army and served during the vietnam conflict.he was honorably discharged approximately three years later the discharge.sometime thereafter,nolan reenlisted for a second tour of duty.in,he was discharged under conditions other than honorable the discharge.
in,nolan pleaded guilty to federal narcotics offenses,to wit,conspiracy to possess,possession with intent to distribute,and distribution of cocaine,in violation of a and.as those offenses are aggravated felonies within the meaning of the ina,see a b,the ins commenced proceedings for nolan removal from the united states under,inter alia,a a iii any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.
b.the administrative proceedings 
in the removal proceedings before an immigration judge ij,nolan asserted,inter alia,that as a veteran who was on status during the vietnam conflict and who was honorably discharged in,he was eligible for naturalization under ina.that section,with some exceptions,provides that an alien may,without satisfying certain of the usual preconditions,become a naturalized citizen of the united states if he has served honorably in an status in the united states armed services during a period in which the armed forces were engaged in military operations involving armed conflict with a hostile foreign force hereinafter wartime,and,if separated from such service,he was separated under honorable conditions.a.nolan moved for termination of the removal proceedings pursuant to the subsection f of regulation f,but see.june,omitting subsection f from,in order to permit him to apply for naturalization under ina.regulation f provided that 
a n immigration judge may terminate removal proceedings to permit the alien to proceed to a final hearing on a pending application or petition for naturalization when the alien has established prima facie eligibility for naturalization and the matter involves exceptionally appealing or humanitarian factors in every other case,the removal hearing shall be completed as promptly as possible notwithstanding the pendency of an application for naturalization during any state sic of the proceedings.
f emphasis added.
in an oral decision of the immigration judge dated march,ij decision,the ij denied nolan motion for termination of the proceedings,ruling that,for two reasons,nolan had not established prima facie eligibility for naturalization.first,the ij interpreted ina as requiring that an alien entire service be honorable.ij decision at.the ij found that nolan did not satisfy that requirement because his discharge was other than honorable.
second,the ij ruled that nolan was ineligible for naturalization under because he could not show good moral character.ij decision at.the ij noted that b,with exceptions not relevant to nolan,provides that a person filing an application under subsection a of this section shall comply in all other respects with the requirements of this subchapter,b,and that ina a,also with exceptions not relevant here,provides that n o person shall be naturalized unless such applicant during all the periods referred to in this subsection has been and still is a person of good moral character,a.the ij concluded that incorporates the requirement found in a.he noted that,consistent with this interpretation of ina,an ins regulation,d,expressly requir es a showing of one year good moral character for section purposes.ij decision at.
because ina defines as aggravated felonies the narcotics offenses of which nolan was convicted,see a b,and provides that n o person who has been convicted of such an aggravated felony,shall be regarded as,or found to be,a person of good moral character,f,the ij reasoned that nolan could not meet requirement of good moral character.the ij accordingly denied nolan motion to terminate the removal proceedings and ordered nolan removal.
nolan appealed the ij decision to the bia.in an order dated october,bia order,the bia dismissed the appeal.the board mentioned the ij second,but not his first,rationale for refusing to terminate the removal proceedings,and it discussed neither rationale but stated that it found no error in the proceedings.bia order at.in addition,the board ruled that nolan had not met the procedural requirements for establishing his prima facie eligibility for naturalization,regulation f,in order to permit the ij to terminate the removal proceeding.the bia noted that in matter of cruz,wl bia,involving a substantially identical predecessor of regulation f,it had 
h e ld that prima facie eligibility may be established by an affirmative communication from the immigration and naturalization service or by a declaration of a court that the alien would be eligible for naturalization but for the pendency of the deportation proceedings or the existence of an outstanding order of deportation.
at.in the present case,the board found that nolan failed to meet this test because 
he ha d not submitted an affirmative communication from the service stating that but for the removal proceedings he would be eligible for naturalization.in fact the service opposed the respondent naturalization application.
bia order at.
c.the decision of the district court 
following the bia decision,nolan filed his present petition for habeas corpus in the district court pursuant to.he asserted that the ij had erred in imposing a good moral character requirement in connection with an application for naturalization under and refusing to terminate the removal proceedings in order to permit him to apply for naturalization under that section.the petition principally sought an order directing the bia to consider nolan application for termination of the removal proceedings without imposition of the requirement.over the ins objection,nolan deportation was stayed pending disposition of his habeas petition.
the ins moved to dismiss the petition for failure to state a claim,contending,inter alia,that nolan is statutorily ineligible for naturalization under ina for both of the reasons stated by the ij.thus,the ins argued first that that section does not apply unless the alien entire military service was honorable and that nolan can not make that showing in light of his discharge under other than honorable conditions.second,the ins argued that requires a showing of good moral character and that nolan can not make that showing in light of his aggravated felony convictions.
the motion to dismiss was referred to magistrate judge kenneth schroeder.in a report,recommendation,and order dated august,the magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant the motion to dismiss only on the basis of the second ground argued by the ins and relied on by the ij.as to the first ground,the magistrate judge recommended that the court reject the interpretation of as requiring an applicant to show that his military service was honorable in its entirety,noting that that interpretation rested on a conflation of the provisions governing the granting of naturalization with a provision governing the revocation of naturalization.as to the second ground,the magistrate judge,after reviewing the ina provisions and legislative history,concluded that contains a requirement.on the premise that nolan conviction of the narcotics offenses to which he pleaded guilty definitively bars him from establishing good moral character,the magistrate judge recommended that the habeas petition be dismissed.
in an order dated september,the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendations in full.judgment was entered denying nolan requests for relief and dismissing the petition.
this appeal followed.the ins eventually consented to a stay of nolan deportation pending disposition of this appeal.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,nolan contends that the district court erred in ruling that ina requires an applicant for naturalization under that section to make a showing of good moral character.he argues that contains no such requirement and that proper statutory interpretation does not warrant reading such a requirement into that section.the ins,in addition to opposing those contentions and arguing that the dismissal of the petition may be upheld on the alternative ground that nolan was required to show that his entire military service was honorable,contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain nolan petition.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court had jurisdiction and that it correctly concluded that the bia properly dismissed nolan appeal for lack of an adequate prima facie showing of eligibility for naturalization under because that section contains a requirement.
jurisdiction of the district court 
the ins makes two challenges to the jurisdiction of the federal court to entertain nolan habeas petition.neither contention has merit.
the ins argues first,citing sol ins,cir,that the district court lacked jurisdiction because nolan has not raised a pure question of law regarding the nontermination of his removal proceedings.ins brief on appeal dated january,ins brief,at.this contention is somewhat puzzling,given the ins simultaneous concession that nolan does not contest the bia factual finding that he did not present any communication from the ins or a court,as required id.the concession is,for nolan makes only legal arguments,centering on his contention that the ij and the bia erroneously viewed ins as including a requirement.this case is thus unlike sol,in which the petitioner did not assert that the ij and bia made any error of law he alleged merely that their decisions were not adequately supported by the record.see id.at.we found that federal jurisdiction under did not extend to such nonlegal claims.nolan,in contrast,contends that the ij refused to grant his motion for termination of the proceedings because of an erroneous interpretation of the ina,and he challenges the decision of the bia which,inter alia,found no error in the ij rulings.we think it plain that the habeas court may entertain such questions.see,ins cyr,d.
further,the real essence of this segment of the ins argument seems to be its contention that nolan does not challenge the board interpretation of f ins brief at.that contention,however,goes to the sufficiency of nolan legal arguments rather than to the district court jurisdiction to entertain them.in any event,as discussed in part.below,we regard the manner in which the board applied regulation f to nolan as dependent on its interpretation of ina as incorporating a requirement,the legal ruling that nolan challenges.
the ins second jurisdictional contention is that the attorney general exercise of prosecutorial discretion as to when to commence and hence to terminate proceedings is not subject to review under a b ii g ins brief at.this contention too is wide of the mark,as nolan did not challenge a prosecutorial decision by the attorney general not to withdraw its petition for his removal.rather,he petitioned for habeas,see,ins cyr,at.discussing longstanding distinction between judicial review and habeas,making a purely legal challenge to the ruling that a person makes no prima facie showing of eligibility for naturalization under without a showing of good moral character.such decisions as to the proper interpretation of the statute are adjudicative,not prosecutorial,and are subject to review by a habeas court.see,id.at.
good moral character as a requirement of ina 
turning to the merits of nolan contention that the district court,the bia,and the ij erred in interpreting ina as requiring an applicant under that section to show good moral character,we look first to the language of the statute.for the reasons that follow,we find the face of the statute unclear but we conclude that the ins interpretation of as incorporating a requirement is reasonable and thus must be upheld.
the statutory provisions 
section,entitled naturalization through service in the armed forces during world war i,world war ii,korean hostilities,vietnam hostilities,or other periods of military hostilities,begins,in pertinent part,as follows 
a requirements 
any person who,while an alien or a noncitizen national of the united states,has served honorably in an status in the military,air,or naval forces of the united states during a period beginning february,and ending on a date designated by the president by executive order as of the date of termination of the vietnam hostilities or during any of a number of other specified periods and who,if separated from such service,was separated under honorable conditions,may be naturalized as provided in this section if at the time of enlistment or induction such person shall have been in the united states or certain of its possessions,or on board a certain type of united states vessel,whether or not he has been lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent residence,or at any time subsequent to enlistment or induction such person shall have been lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent residence.the executive department under which such person served shall determine whether persons have served honorably in an status,and whether separation from such service was under honorable conditions 
b exceptions 
a person filing an application under subsection a of this section shall comply in all other respects with the requirements of this subchapter,except that 
he may be naturalized regardless of age,and notwithstanding the provisions of section prerequisite to naturalization burden of proof of this title as they relate to deportability and the provisions of section alien enemies of this title 
no period of residence or specified period of physical presence within the united states or any state or district of the service in the united states shall be required and 
service in the military,air or naval forces of the united states shall be proved by a duly authenticated certification from the executive department under which the applicant served or is serving,which shall state whether the applicant served honorably in an status during a period specified in subsection a and was separated from such service under honorable conditions.
a and b emphases added.the final subsection of,entitled revocation,provides that 
c itizenship granted pursuant to this section may be revoked in accordance with section of this title if at any time subsequent to naturalization the person is separated from the military,air,or naval forces under other than honorable conditions,and such ground for revocation shall be in addition to any other provided by law.the fact that the naturalized person was separated from the service under other than honorable conditions shall be proved by a duly authenticated certification from the executive department under which the person was serving at the time of separation.
c.as can thus be seen,nothing in ina itself states that a showing of good moral character is a prerequisite for naturalization under that section.
however,as indicated,ina b provides that,with specified exceptions principally with regard to age,residence,and physical presence,an applicant under a shall comply in all other respects with the requirements of this subchapter.b.section is part of subchapter iii of chapter of title subchapter iii encompasses ina.ina a,which is entitled requirements of naturalization,provides,in part,as follows 
a residence 
no person,except as otherwise provided in this subchapter,shall be naturalized unless such applicant,immediately preceding the date of filing his application for naturalization has resided continuously,after being lawfully admitted for permanent residence,within the united states for at least five years and during the five years immediately preceding the date of filing his application has been physically present therein for periods totaling at least half of that time,and who has resided within the state or within the district of the service in the united states in which the applicant filed the application for at least three months,has resided continuously within the united states from the date of the application up to the time of admission to citizenship,and during all the periods referred to in this subsection has been and still is a person of good moral character,attached to the principles of the constitution of the united states,and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the united states.
a emphases added.given b incorporation by reference of other ina sections,should be read as importing any requirements set forth in a,except to the extent that itself provides that those requirements need not be met.because does not expressly state that a showing of good moral character is not required,the requirement found in a could be read as being incorporated into.
on the other hand,a states that good moral character is required during all the periods referred to in a itself,which are periods of residence in the united states,residence in a pertinent district,and physical presence in the united states.because b provides that for naturalization under a no period of residence or specified period of physical presence shall be required,it may be that also was not intended to compel any showing that another ina section requires in connection with a period of residence.
as against that reading,we note that a requires a showing not just that the applicant was of good moral character with respect to the specified periods of residence and physical presence,but also a showing that the applicant is of good moral character.a that during all the periods referred to in this subsection applicant has been and still is a person of good moral character emphasis added.use of the conjunctive and the present tense suggests that congress intended that section to be broader than requiring good moral character merely during past periods of residence and physical presence,and intended that an applicant must also show good moral character at the time of his naturalization application.for an applicant exempted from the residence and presence requirements,it is plausible to infer that the showing of good moral character at the time of his application was intended to remain a requirement.nonetheless,linguistic purists could argue that the precise phrase used in a still is of good moral character emphasis added connotes continuity,which logically can not be shown if there is no relevant prior period.in sum,the precise interplay between and is hardly clear.
the question of whether includes a requirement for alien veterans who served in status is further clouded by the terms of a companion section,ina,which relaxes residence and physical presence requirements for an alien who served in the armed forces but not in status,see a,and which,at least to an extent,explicitly requires a showing of good moral character.subsection c of provides that an applicant whose military service for the united states was not continuous must allege and show,inter alia,
good moral character during any period within five years immediately preceding the date of filing such application between the periods of applicant service in the armed forces such allegation and proof shall also be made as to any period between the termination of applicant service and the filing of the application for naturalization.
c.and subsection e,entitled moral character,provides that 
a ny such period or periods of service under honorable conditions,and good moral character,during such service,shall be proved by duly authenticated copies of the records of the executive departments having custody of the records of such service,and such authenticated copies of records shall be accepted in lieu of compliance with the provisions of section a of this title.
e.thus,expressly requires a showing of good moral character during the applicant periods of service,between his periods of service,and after his last period of service and until his application for naturalization.in light of the fact that both and deal with the naturalization of persons who have served in the armed forces differentiating between persons who served in status during wartime and those who did not and the fact that the two sections,enacted together in,contain some clearly parallel provisions,it is difficult to infer that the substantive differences between the sections were not intended.thus,given the explicit references to requirements in c and e,and the absence of any mention of good moral character in any part of,the appropriateness of interpreting as including such a requirement for naturalization is simply not clear from the face of the statute.
the ins interpretation of 
the ins,which was the agency primarily charged by congress to implement the public policy underlying the immigration and naturalization laws,ins miranda,d see a authorizing the attorney general to promulgate regulations under the ina delegating the authority of the attorney general to the commissioner of the ins,had interpreted ina as including a requirement that the applicant show good moral character.ins regulation,at all relevant times has provided,in pertinent part,that 
t o be eligible for naturalization under section a of the act,an applicant must establish that he or she 
d has been,for at least one year prior to filing the application for naturalization,and continues to be,of good moral character 
d.when a statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,and the executive agency entrusted with administration of the statute has given an interpretation of the statutory scheme,we ask whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute,chevron natural resources defense council,d,and,if it is,we accord considerable weight to the agency interpretation,id.at.if the agency construction of the statutory scheme it is entrusted to administer 
represents a reasonable accommodation of conflicting policies that were committed to the agency care by the statute,we should not disturb it unless it appears from the statute or its legislative history that the accommodation is not one that congress would have sanctioned.
id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.in assessing the reasonableness of the agency construction,
it is not necessary that we conclude that the agency interpretation of the statute is the only permissible interpretation,nor that we believe it to be the best interpretation of the statute.rather,in order to affirm the bia determination,we need only conclude that its interpretation is reasonable and that it considered the matter in a detailed and reasoned fashion.
mugalli ashcroft,cir quoting michel ins,cir.
in the present case,as discussed in part.above,the statute is ambiguous.the potentially conflicting policy concerns here are the specific desire to provide aliens who have served in the united states armed forces with benefits in the form of relaxed requirements for naturalization,and the general goal of attempting to ensure that persons admitted to united states citizenship through naturalization be of good moral character.proof of good moral character clearly is a requirement for most applicants and it is explicitly required for persons who served in the armed forces at various times in status.notwithstanding congress desire to reward aliens who have served the united states in its armed forces,it hardly seems unreasonable for the ins to have inferred that congress would not have intended to single out persons trained experienced in physical confrontations for elimination of the requirement of good moral character.we are thus inclined to view the ins interpretation that includes a requirement as reasonable.
we also find confirmation for this conclusion in our review of the ina legislative history.
the legislative history 
the ina was enacted in,superseding the nationality act of the act.the act conferred special naturalization benefits on aliens serving in the united states armed forces and although,as originally enacted,it made no distinction between peacetime and wartime service for naturalization purposes,it generally required such aliens to show good moral character.
section of the act,as originally enacted,exempted from the normal residence requirements a person who has served honorably at any time in the armed forces for a period or periods aggregating three years and who,if separated from such service,was separated under honorable conditions,if the application for naturalization was filed while the applicant was in the service or within six months after the conclusion of his service.a.subsection c of that section provided that one whose military service for the united states was not continuous must show,inter alia,good moral character during and between the applicant periods of service,and between his last period of service and his application for naturalization.id.c.subsection e specified the type of records needed for proof of a ny such period or periods of service under honorable conditions,and good moral character.id.e.
in,a new section,was added to the act,opening a window of opportunity for certain aliens who had served in world war i or earlier wars.section allowed such a person to be naturalized within one year after december,with the residence requirements applicable to most aliens reduced to two years,during all of which period he has behaved as a person of good moral character.supp.v.
in,another new section,was added to the act.section dealt with persons who served honorably in status during either world war i or world war ii.subsection a provided that such a person was eligible for naturalization without the usual period of residence in the united states,if he either was present in the united states or one of its possessions at the time of enlistment or induction or was thereafter lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent residence.see a supp.v.subsection b provided that 
there shall be included in the naturalization petition the affidavits of at least two credible witnesses,citizens of the united states,stating that each such witness personally knows the petitioner to be a person of good moral character 
in sum,the act as originally enacted expressly required a showing of good moral character during and between an alien noncontinuous periods of service.the amendment expressly required such a showing for all aliens who served in world war i or earlier wars.and the amendment,the last substantive alteration before the act was superseded by the ina,expressly required a showing of good moral character by all alien veterans of world wars i and ii.
in,congress undertook a reappraisal and extensive revision of the act,culminating in the passage of the ina.part of the revision created different residence and presence to those set out in the present ina and those aliens who had served in status and those who had not.section,then as now,said nothing explicitly with respect to good moral character.section,then as now,explicitly required showings of good moral character with respect to the periods during and between service,see id.e and c.although the language of these two sections thus differed,we have seen no indication in the legislative history that congress intended to alter the scope of the provision for relaxation of the naturalization requirements,the amendment that required all alien veterans of world wars i and ii to show good moral character.
the report of the house of representatives committee on the judiciary dated february.house report,reprinted in,in addressing eligibility to naturalization,discussed six categories of provisions,to wit,those dealing with race,literacy,residence,good moral character,subversives,and special classes eligible to naturalization,to wit,alien enemies and children.house report at,reprinted in at.there was no section focusing solely on persons who served in the armed forces the benefits accorded to such persons were discussed only in the section of the report dealing with residence,in its subsection dealing with exceptions to the residence rule.house report at,reprinted in at.in that discussion,detailing differences in the showings that must be made by aliens who served in status in world war i or ii and those who did not,there was no express reference to good moral character.see id.
the section of the house report dealing with good moral character stated,in pertinent part,that t he bill carries forward the provision of existing law that the petitioner for naturalization shall,during the period of residence,have been a person of good moral character.house report at,reprinted in at.it also pointed out that 
t here is also a new provision in section e of the bill to the effect that in determining whether or not the petitioner has been of good moral character for the requisite period,the court shall not be limited to the petitioner conduct during the period immediately preceding the filing of the petition,but may take into consideration as the basis for the determination the petitioner conduct and acts at any time prior to that period.
id.in this good moral character section of the house report,there was no differentiation between and aliens indeed,there was no mention of naturalization through service in the armed forces at all.had congress intended to eliminate the requirement that aliens who had been in status show good moral character,we would have expected that change to be mentioned in the legislative history.
in,congress amended to extend its benefits to aliens who served in status in vietnam,as well as those who would later see active duty during any such other periods to be proclaimed by the president as wartime.see supp.v.the june,report of the senate committee on the judiciary on the version of the bill that eventually became law in.senate report,reprinted in,noted the lengthy tradition of providing for the expeditious naturalization of noncitizens who have rendered honorable service in the armed forces of the united states,id.at,reprinted in at.it stated that,over the years,t he rewards embodied in these enactments consistently have been in the form of relief from compliance with some of the general requirements for naturalization applicable to civilians,reprinted in at,and that e xemptions granted wartime servicemen and veterans have been more liberal than those given for services rendered during peacetime,reprinted in at.but the senate report went on to observe that r elief from some of the general requirements has not included exemption from the establishment of good moral character,id.emphasis added and it stated that t he policies reflected in these earlier enactments have been continued in the immigration and nationality act,id.
comparing with,the senate report identified only three basic differences 
the peacetime serviceman must have a minimum of years service,the wartime serviceman h
