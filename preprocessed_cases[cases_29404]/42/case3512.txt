petitioner barbarito perez mejia petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia dismissing an appeal from an order of removal to mexico.at the outset of the removal proceedings before an immigration judge ij,perez mejia counsel admitted that perez mejia had been convicted in of possession of cocaine for sale in violation of california health and safety code section and conceded that he was removable as a result.on that basis,the bia found that perez mejia was removable under a a i ii and that he was ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to h.
perez mejia argues that the government failed to meet its burden of proving that he was removable because the bia and the ij were not permitted to rely on his counsel admissions.he also asserts that a criminal docket from his conviction that was introduced into evidence by the government was insufficient to establish that he was removable because the document did not indicate what substance he possessed for sale.additionally,perez mejia contends that the government is estopped from removing him on the basis of his conviction because it knew about the conviction when it granted him legal permanent resident lpr status in.finally,he argues that he is eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility because his conviction predated his admission as an lpr in.
for the reasons stated below,the petition is being denied.
factual and procedural background 
at the time of the proceedings before the ij,perez mejia was a native and citizen of mexico.he was married to an united states citizen,with whom he had two children.in,perez mejia was convicted of possessing a narcotic for sale under california health and safety code section.sometime later,he applied for adjustment of status to become an lpr.during his adjustment interview with the department of homeland security dhs,perez mejia disclosed his conviction.despite the fact that his conviction should have rendered perez mejia inadmissible,he was granted lpr status in.
in,perez mejia departed the united states.when he returned,perez mejia applied for admission into the united states as a returning lpr at the los angeles international airport.however,an immigration officer noted perez mejia conviction and initiated removal proceedings against him.
on december,perez mejia was served with a notice to appear nta.the fourth allegation in the nta asserted that he was convicted in the superior court of los angeles,county of los angeles,state of california,for the offense of,possession for sale of a controlled substance,to wit cocaine,in violation of section of the california health and safety code,a felony.the nta charged that perez mejia was removable pursuant to a a i ii as an alien who was convicted of a drug offense involving a controlled substance listed in of the controlled substances act.
removal proceedings commenced before the ij on january.however,the proceedings were continued after perez mejia counsel informed the ij that he intended to collaterally attack perez mejia state court conviction.when the proceedings resumed on may,the government provided the ij with a copy of the criminal docket from perez mejia criminal case.the docket indicated that perez mejia was convicted of poss narc cntrl subst for sale in violation of california health and safety code section,but did not identify the controlled substance.perez mejia stated that he was not ready to address the allegations in the nta and the proceedings were again continued in order to allow perez mejia to pursue his collateral attack on his conviction.perez mejia counsel told the ij that he was attacking the conviction on the basis that perez mejia possessed a controlled substance for personal use,rather than for sale.
when the removal proceedings resumed on may,perez mejia was again represented by counsel.in a colloquy with the ij,perez mejia stated that his attorney was authorized to speak on his behalf.the following exchange then took place between the ij and perez mejia counsel 
the court counsel,ready to go forward with pleadings 
petitioner counsel yes,your honor 
the court concede he was properly served with the nta 
petitioner counsel yes,your honor.
the court have you explained the nature of these proceedings to him 
petitioner counsel yes,i have.
the court waive formal reading of the nta 
petitioner counsel yes,your honor.
the court on behalf of your client,how do you pleads sic to the four allegations and the one charge of removability 
petitioner counsel we concede the allegations,your honor.
the court i sorry,do you admit allegations through 
petitioner counsel yes,your honor.
the court and do you concede removability 
petitioner counsel yes,your honor.
the admission to allegation four in the nta was an admission that perez mejia had been convicted in of possessing cocaine with intent to sell it in violation of california law.
after these admissions and the concession of removability,the ij noted that he had been given a copy of the criminal docket from perez mejia criminal conviction.the ij asked perez mejia counsel if that why you conceded or admitted allegation of the nta,concerning his conviction.perez mejia counsel responded affirmatively.the ij next inquired whether perez mejia wanted to designate a country to which to be deported and perez mejia counsel selected mexico.the ij then asked what relief perez mejia was seeking.perez mejia counsel stated that he planned to apply for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to h,but that he needed another continuance to complete the collateral attack on perez mejia state court conviction.another continuance was granted.
the final hearing before the ij was held on july.the ij stated that perez mejia had admitted all allegations and conceded removability.perez mejia counsel then agreed that he want ed to go to the relief phase of the case to address perez mejia application for a waiver of inadmissibility under h on the ground that he was married to an united states citizen.the government argued that perez mejia was not eligible for a h waiver because,in the context of a drug conviction,such waivers are available only where the conviction is for a single offense of simple possession of grams or less of marijuana.h.perez mejia counsel stated that he had no argument in response.the ij stated that he agreed with the government.
the ij then considered whether the government was estopped from removing perez mejia on the basis of a conviction of which it was aware when perez mejia applied for lpr status.the ij expressed the view that perez mejia had benefitted from a mistake by dhs and,therefore,that the government was not estopped from declaring perez mejia to be inadmissible.perez mejia counsel did not offer any evidence or argument to refute this conclusion.
finally,the ij considered perez mejia application for voluntary departure.he concluded that perez mejia was not eligible for such relief because his conviction qualified as an aggravated felony,as defined in a b.
in his final decision,the ij stated that perez mejia admitted all allegations and that b ased on admissions removability has been established by clear,convincing and unequivocal evidence.the ij also stated that perez mejia conceded removability and,therefore,removability was not an issue in this case.id.the ij then noted that the government had submitted a criminal record that showed perez mejia had been convicted of possession for sale of a narcotic substance in violation of california health and safety code section.
when discussing perez mejia application for a h waiver,the ij departed from the rationale on which he relied at the july,hearing.instead of concluding that perez mejia was ineligible for a waiver because he was not convicted of simple possession of less than thirty grams of marijuana,the ij stated that perez mejia ineligibility turned on the fact that he was convicted of an aggravated felony.the reason that the ij altered the rationale for his decision is not explained.the ij also held that the government was not estopped from relying on perez mejia conviction because perez mejia benefitted from a mistake made by dhs when it considered his application for lpr status,and was not prejudiced by that error.finally,the ij concluded that perez mejia was not eligible for voluntary departure because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony.
perez mejia timely appealed to the bia.in his brief,perez mejia argued that the government was estopped from relying on his conviction as a basis for removal and that the ij erred in finding perez mejia ineligible for a h waiver.perez mejia argued,based on the text of the statute,that an lpr is only ineligible for a h waiver if he commits an aggravated felony after he is admitted.
the bia adopted the ij decision and added its own analysis.it first found that perez mejia was removable in light of the record of conviction and,more particularly,since perez mejia conceded the charge.next,the bia rejected perez mejia estoppel argument for several reasons.the bia noted that perez mejia could not meet his burden of establishing affirmative misconduct beyond mere negligence,as required by watkins army,cir en banc.with regard to perez mejia argument that the ij erred in finding him ineligible for a h waiver,the bia concluded that perez mejia was ineligible for a waiver because his offense was a violation of a state controlled substance law.
following the bia decision,perez mejia timely filed this petition for review.
ii.discussion 
perez mejia presents three arguments on appeal.first,he contends that the government did not meet its burden of proving that he was removable because an alien admissions alone can not establish removability and because the criminal docket from his conviction was insufficient to establish that he possessed for sale a controlled substance that renders him removable.second,perez mejia argues that the government is estopped from removing him on the basis of a conviction about which it knew when it granted him lpr status in.finally,perez mejia asserts that he is eligible for a h waiver because his conviction occurred before he was granted lpr status.
these are questions of law over which we have jurisdiction,see a d,and which we review de novo.hamazaspyan holder,cir see shin mukasey,cir jurisdiction to consider effect of alien admissions on removability and merits of estoppel claim where alleged misconduct by government employee occurred prior to decision of attorney general to initiate removal proceedings where,as here,the bia conducts its own review rather than adopting the ij decision,we review the bia decision except to the extent that the ij opinion is expressly adopted.hosseini gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
removability 
as indicated earlier,perez mejia claims that the government failed to meet its burden of proving that he was removable.he argues that the statute under which he was convicted,california health and safety code section,criminalizes possession for sale of a controlled substance,acetylfentanyl,that is not a substance that triggers removal.as a result,perez mejia contends that his conviction requires the application of the modified categorical approach,a procedure that limits the information that can be considered to determine whether the conduct that led to an alien conviction amounted to a removable offense.see s yong holder,cir we have previously found that california law regulates the possession and sale of many substances that are not regulated by the federal controlled substances act ruiz vidal gonzales,cir to establish removability,the government must prove that the controlled substance at issue is not only listed under california law,but also contained in the federal schedules of the federal controlled substances act.when the modified categorical approach must be employed,an alien factual admissions may not be used as evidence to establish that he is removable,unless those admissions are included in the narrow,specified set of documents that are part of the record of conviction,such as a plea agreement.see s yong,at tokatly ashcroft,cir huerta guevara ashcroft,cir.accordingly,perez mejia argues,his admissions to the factual allegations in the nta and his concession of removability were not sufficient to establish his removability.
however,the rule against relying on an alien admissions does not apply universally.in barragan lopez mukasey,we held that an alien admissions to each factual allegation against him constitute d clear,convincing,and unequivocal evidence that satisfied the government burden of proof,cir.similarly,in shin,we held that where the alien concedes removability,the government burden in this regard is satisfied.at quoting estrada ins,cir.the instant case presents an opportunity to clarify when an alien admissions may be considered and render him removable.
as explained below,admissions by an alien to facts alleged in an nta,and concessions concerning matters of law,made in the c pleading stage of removal proceedings are binding,just as admissions made by a defendant in an answer to a civil complaint are binding in a judicial proceeding.see hoodho holder,cir admissions during pleading stage are binding roman mukasey,cir per curiam same am.title ins.lacelaw,cir statement in an answer in a civil case is a binding judicial admission.however,if material issues remain in dispute,or the ij is not satisfied that the alien admissions or concessions are sufficient to resolve all issues,the removal proceeding enters the d evidentiary stage.at the d stage,if the modified categorical approach is applicable,the evidence that the ij may consider in deciding whether the alien prior conviction renders him removable is limited to certain documents.see s yong,at tokatly,at.under this modified categorical approach,any admissions and other statements made by the alien after the c pleading stage may not be considered.see s yong,at tokatly,at huerta guevara,at.
more specifically,removal proceedings are conducted pursuant to a regulation,after the ij advises an alien of certain rights and places him under oath,the alien is required to plead to the notice to appear by stating whether he or she admits or denies the factual allegations and his or her removability under the charges contained therein.c if the alien admits the allegations and removability,and the immigration judge is satisfied that no issues of law or fact remain,the immigration judge may determine that removability as charged has been established by the admissions of the respondent.id.if removability is not determined during this c pleading stage,the removal hearing enters an evidentiary stage during which the ij receives admissible evidence on any issue not resolved to his satisfaction at the pleading stage.id.d 
the import of the regulation has been recognized by the second circuit.see hoodho,at roman,at.in essence,if the ij is satisfied by the alien admissions and concession of removability during the pleading stage,the relevant issues are resolved and the proceedings do not enter the evidentiary stage in which disputed questions of removability are decided based on admissible evidence.
in hoodho,counsel for an alien conceded the truth of the factual allegations in the nta and conceded that he was removable as charged.at some alterations original.despite these concessions,the alien argued on appeal that he was not removable.id.the bia rejected the alien appeal on the basis that he was bound by his attorney concessions.id.the second circuit agreed that the alien was bound by his attorney statements where the record did not plainly contradict the concession.id.at.the court noted that the acceptance by an ij of a plausible concession of removability is an unremarkable feature of removal proceedings.id.it stated that a petitioner can not disavow that concession because,in hindsight,it might have been preferable for him to have contested removability,rather than to have conceded it.id.the second circuit held that admissions made by an alien counsel during the pleading stage may be accepted so long as the ij is satisfied that no issues of law or fact remain.id.at quoting c the second circuit also rejected the alien argument that the ij was required to inspect the alien conviction record to confirm that there was a factual basis for his admissions.id.at.in response to the alien argument that the ij was required to apply the modified categorical approach to his prior conviction,the second circuit held 
the ij did not have occasion to apply the modified categorical approach to the alien conviction because the alien conceded removability in so doing,the alien did not press the government to develop the record in support of an inquiry along the lines specified by the modified categorical approach,nor did the alien request that the ij make such a determination.indeed,his concession obviated the need for such efforts on the part of the government and the ij.
id.at citing selimi ins,cir.
the second circuit added that,f acts admitted by a party are judicial admissions that bind th at party throughout th e litigation.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in reaching this conclusion it relied upon a treatise,which explains that 
judicial admissions are not evidence at all.rather,they are formal concessions in the pleadings in the case or stipulations by a party or counsel that have the effect of withdrawing a fact from issue and dispensing wholly with the need for proof of the fact.thus,a judicial admission,unless allowed by the court to be withdrawn,is conclusive in the case 
id.quoting mccormick on evid.ed.the second circuit concluded that a dmissions by parties are not subject to judicial scrutiny to ensure that the admissions are fully supported by the underlying record and that there is no basis to subject judicial admissions made in removal proceedings to a more stringent standard.id.
the second circuit reasoning with regard to judicial admissions is consistent with our jurisprudence concerning any other civil litigation.as we have held,j udicial admissions are formal admissions in the pleadings which have the effect of withdrawing a fact from issue and dispensing wholly with the need for proof of the fact.am.title ins,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.factual assertions in pleadings are considered judicial admissions conclusively binding on the party who made them.id.a statement in a n answer is a judicial admission.id.like the second circuit,we hold that admissions and concessions made by an alien at the c pleading stage of removal proceedings have the same effect as judicial admissions in civil litigation.
in another case decided shortly before hoodho,the second circuit addressed facts comparable to those in this case and found that counsel admissions and concession made during the pleading stage were binding.in roman,an alien with lpr status applied for admission to the united states at an airport.see at.removal proceedings were commenced against him because he had been convicted of a new york state drug crime.id.at his initial removal hearing,the alien counsel admitted the factual allegations in the nta and conceded that the alien was removable.id.at.he then obtained several continuances to afford time to collaterally attack the alien state court conviction.id.considering the question of whether the ij was prohibited from relying on the alien own admissions through his attorney as the sole evidence establishing removability based on a prior conviction,the second circuit held that the ij actions were explicitly authorized by c.id.at.the court went on to note that the alien did not allege that the admissions were inaccurate or that the lawyer representing him was ineffective.id.at.therefore,the admissions made by the attorney were deemed to be binding on his alien client.id.
although decisions in this circuit do not reference,our jurisprudence concerning the effect of an alien admissions in removal proceedings is consistent with the regulation and its application by the second circuit.for example,in shin,an alien attorney admitted to the ij that the alien was not in possession of valid immigration documents and that she was,therefore,removable.see,cir.when she challenged her removability on appeal,we held that o n the basis of the alien concession,the government burden is satisfied.id.at.
similarly,in barragan lopez,an alien admitted the factual allegations contained in the nta during the pleading stage,including the allegation that he had been convicted of solicitation to possess marijuana for sale,but challenged the legal conclusion that the conviction rendered him removable.see at.because removability was contested,the proceedings entered the evidentiary stage.id.at.the ij applied the categorical approach to the undisputed facts and found that the statute under which the alien was convicted was categorically a removable offense.id.on appeal,the alien argued that the government had not satisfied its burden of establishing that he was removable.id.at.we rejected the claim,holding that the alien admission to each factual allegation considered by the ij and the board for removal was conclusive concerning the facts and found no error in the application of the categorical approach to find that the alien was removable.id.therefore,barragan lopez is consistent with d,which provides,in part,that when a removal case enters the evidentiary phase no further evidence need be received as to any facts admitted during the pleading.d.
as we have also held,in certain circumstances an alien admissions may not be used to establish removability.see,s yong,at huerta guevara,at.these decisions,too,are consistent with.
in s yong,the nta charged that the alien had been convicted of a drug crime under california health and safety code section a,but did not identify the controlled substance.at.the alien,appearing pro se,admitted that the charge in the nta was accurate.id.the ij then proceeded to ask the alien about a conviction record that was not admitted as evidence,which purportedly stated that the alien conviction involved mdma,or ecstacy.id.at.in response to this further questioning,the alien admitted that his conviction involved ecstacy.id.based solely on the alien statement and the unidentified conviction document not made part of the record,the ij found that the alien had committed a controlled substance offense within the meaning of the immigration laws and,therefore,that the alien was removable.id.at.
in s yong,the alien initial admission to the charge in the nta did not establish all of the facts necessary to determine whether he was removable because 
california law regulates the possession and sale of many substances that are not regulated by the federal controlled substances act and therefore section is categorically broader than section a b i of the ina.this means that a conviction under section does not necessarily entail a controlled substance offense under section a b i of the immigration statute,and we must look further to determine whether yong conviction renders him removable.
id.at citations omitted.accordingly,it was necessary for the ij to proceed to the d evidentiary stage to resolve the issue of whether the alien had been convicted of a removable offense.under our jurisprudence,the ij was required to apply a modified categorical approach under which he could look beyond the language of the statute to a narrow,specified set of documents that are part of the record of conviction.tokatly,at see also s yong,at.this is a narrow exception to the usual categorical approach.s yong,at.it does not permit considering statements from an alien unless included in the narrow set of documents that are part of the record of conviction.id.because the only evidence in the record was the alien admission at the evidentiary stage that he was convicted of an ecstacy offense,we reversed the decision.id.at.
similarly,in huerta guevara,the nta alleged that the alien had been convicted of possession of a stolen vehicle under arizona law and charged that the crime was a removable theft offense.at.however,the arizona statute criminalized some conduct that would not render the alien removable and the nta did not specify under what section of the statute the alien was convicted.id.at.accordingly,when the alien admitted,during the pleading stage of her removal proceedings,that she understood the charge in the nta and was not denying it,more evidence was required to determine whether the alien conviction was for a removable offense.id.at.thus,the proceedings moved from the pleading stage to the evidentiary stage.the government responded by introducing a conviction record that the ij accepted as conclusive of removability.however,on appeal that record was found to be insufficient to establish that the alien was convicted of a theft offense.see id.at.the government attempted to salvage its case by asking this court to consider statements in the alien brief on appeal to the bia.id.at.the government argued that the alien description of her conduct in the brief established her removability.id.we disagreed,holding that even assuming,without deciding,that statements in the alien brief could be considered under the modified categorical approach,they were insufficient in the particular case to prove removability.id.
in view of the foregoing,we conclude that,as interpreted by the second circuit in hoodho and roman,is consistent with our relevant jurisprudence and provides the legal framework for deciding this case.in essence,if at the c pleading stage an alien,individually or through counsel,makes admissions of fact or concedes removability,and the ij accepts them,they are binding and no further evidence concerning the issues of fact admitted or law conceded is necessary.if an alien admissions or concession leave material issues in dispute,or the ij is not satisfied with an admission or concession,the proceeding moves to the d evidentiary stage.if the issue concerning removability being addressed at that stage requires applying the modified categorical approach,the ij may rely on facts admitted at the pleading stage,but may not consider any further statements made by the alien unless they are contained in admissible documents.see d when removability is not determined under the provisions of paragraph c of this section,the immigration judge shall receive evidence as to any unresolved issues,except that no further evidence need be received as to any facts admitted during the pleading s yong,at when alien admissions in pleading stage are not sufficient to establish removability and modified categorical approach must be applied,alien statements to the immigration judge after the pleading stage regarding the nature of his criminal conduct may not be considered.
in view of the foregoing,the bia properly concluded that perez mejia was removable.in contrast to the nta in s yong,the nta here expressly stated that perez mejia was convicted of possessing cocaine for sale.it is undisputed that cocaine is a prohibited drug under the controlled substances act.see d.it is also not disputed that perez mejia counsel was authorized to speak for him.when asked how perez mejia wished to plead to the four allegations,which included the charge that he had been convicted of possessing cocaine for sale,his counsel admitted the allegations.this admission was binding.see barragan lopez,at shin,at see also hoodho,at roman,at am.title ins,at.the admission relieved the government of the obligation to present any evidence on the factual question of the nature of the drug offense.hoodho,at.
perez mejia counsel also conceded that the admitted facts rendered perez mejia removable.this concession was correct as a matter of law.see a a i ii inadmissibility resulting from conviction of controlled substance offense.as we have held,where the alien concedes removability,the government burden in this regard is satisfied.shin,at quoting estrada,at.
the ij question about whether perez mejia was admitting the allegation that he was convicted of possessing cocaine because of the record of conviction that the ij had received does not indicate that the ij was dissatisfied with the admission to the factual allegations or the concession of removability and moving from the c pleading stage to the d evidentiary stage.rather,upon receiving an affirmative answer to his inquiry,the ij admitted the record of conviction without further discussion and promptly asked whether perez mejia wanted to designate a country to which to be deported.this is an issue addressed in f this order of inquiry confirms that the ij was satisfied that perez mejia admissions and concessions obviated the need to take evidence pursuant to d.
if the matter had proceeded to the d evidentiary stage,the record of conviction,which only stated that perez mejia had been convicted under california health safety code section for possessing a controlled substance for sale,would not alone have been sufficient to establish that perez mejia was removable.see ruiz vidal,at.if a d inquiry were being made,the modified categorical approach would have been applicable and any further statements perez mejia might have made during the evidentiary stage could not be considered because they would not have been included in the narrow set of documents that can be considered under the modified categorical approach.see s yong,at tokatly,at.
however,no such additional statements were made or considered in this case.after making the relevant admissions and concessions,and designating mexico as the country to which perez mejia should be deported,his counsel did not discuss,let alone dispute,the adequacy of the proof of removability.rather,he requested a h waiver of removability and voluntary departure,both of which were rejected.
in essence,it appears that perez mejia counsel decided that perez mejia could not,even under the modified categorical approach,successfully contest the fact that perez mejia had been convicted of possessing cocaine for sale and,therefore,was removable.instead,he decided to seek relief from removal.as the seventh circuit has written,c oncessions of this sort,often motivated by tactical and pragmatic considerations,are routinely made in immigration proceedings.selimi,at see also roman,at admission made as tactical decision by counsel is binding.as the seventh circuit concluded in the context of excludability,having formally admitted that he was removable,perez mejia can not now contend that the government proof of his removability was insufficient.see selimi,at see also hoodho,at roman,at barragan lopez,at shin,at.
perez mejia also argues that the government is estopped from using his conviction as a basis for removal because dhs knew about the conviction when it granted him lpr status in.this contention is incorrect.
it is well settled that the government may not be estopped on the same terms as a private litigant.watkins,at.a party seeking to raise estoppel against the government must establish affirmative misconduct going beyond mere negligence even then,estoppel will only apply where the government wrongful act will cause a serious injustice,and the public interest will not suffer undue damage by imposition of the liability.morgan gonzales,cir quoting watkins,at.moreover,a party can not obtain estoppel against the government if he did not lose any rights to which he was entitled.id.
there is no single test for detecting the presence of affirmative misconduct each case must be decided on its own particular facts and circumstances.affirmative misconduct does require an affirmative misrepresentation or affirmative concealment of a material fact by the government,although it does not require that the government intend to mislead a party.watkins,at citations omitted.
if a litigant survives this initial inquiry,the court considers four elements to determine if the government is estopped 
the party to be estopped must know the facts he must intend that his conduct shall be acted on or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel has a right to believe it is so intended the latter must be ignorant of the true facts and he must rely on the former conduct to his injury.
morgan,at quoting watkins,at.
both the ij and the bia characterized the decision by dhs to grant perez mejia lpr status in as a mistake.this was not an erroneous conclusion.it was perez mejia burden to prove that the decision to grant him lpr status was affirmative misconduct by dhs.see id.perez mejia offered no evidence of such misconduct,but rather relied on the fact that he obtained lpr status when he should have been denie
