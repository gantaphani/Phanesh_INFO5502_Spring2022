we consider whether the department of homeland security has met its burden of proving that the petitioner,luis felipe juarez alvarado,is removable from the united states as an alien convicted of a violation of state law relating to a controlled substance.see a b i.juarez alvarado pled guilty to attempted possession of a dangerous drug,in violation of arizona revised statute a.he argues that this conviction does not establish his removability for two independent reasons first,because arizona attempt statute is categorically broader than the federal definition and second,because the government has not met its burden of establishing under the modified categorical approach that his conviction involved a substance listed in the controlled substances act.we lack jurisdiction to reach the first argument and are not persuaded by the second.accordingly,we dismiss in part and deny in part his petition for review 
background 
born in mexico in,juarez alvarado was admitted into the united states as a legal permanent resident before his first birthday.he was placed into removal proceedings after his conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia,but an ij granted his application for cancellation of removal in december.
in april,an arizona grand jury indicted juarez alvarado on three counts of offenses.count one,the only count pertinent to this petition,alleged that on april,he had knowingly possess ed a dangerous drug,methamphetamine,a class four felony,in violation of arizona revised statute a.
three months later,juarez alvarado entered a written plea agreement,in which he agreed to plead guilty to modified count one attempted possession of a dangerous drugs sic,a class five felony,committed on the day of april.in exchange,the agreement provided that count one,as originally charged and counts two and three would be dismissed.the factual basis section recited please see the attached description of the statutory elements and factual basis for the offense s to which the defendant is pleading guilty.the attachment has been prepared by the defense and signed by the defendant.the plea agreement is marked as pages.
the record also includes an untitled,undated document,marked as page,that was signed by juarez alvarado,his attorney and the prosecutor the document recites the text of the relevant statutes and further states 
on april,i,luis felipe juarez alvarado,was stopped for a traffic violation.i had a suspended driver license at the time and was placed under arrest.my vehicle was searched,and approximately grams of methamphetamine was found.when asked,i stated that i paid about for the bag of methamphetamine.
at the bottom of the page is a stamp,signed by the deputy clerk on august,certifying the document to be a true copy of the original on file in juarez alvarado criminal case.juarez alvarado contends this document was not part of the plea agreement and seems to have been added later,without his knowledge or consent.
juarez alvarado appeared in court to enter his guilty plea on august.the record does not include a transcript of this proceeding.the court entered a judgment of conviction,finding juarez alvarado guilty of the crime of modified count one,attempted possession of dangerous drugs,a class five felony,and sentencing him to months of intensive probation.
two weeks later,the department of homeland security issued juarez alvarado a notice to appear,charging him with removability under a b i,based on his conviction for a controlled substance offense.juarez alvarado,who proceeded pro se throughout administrative proceedings,denied removability and filed a motion to terminate the removal proceedings,contending that his conviction was not categorically a conviction relating to a substance covered by the csa,and dhs has not met its burden of proving the substance for which he was convicted is covered by the csa.the ij denied his motion,acknowledging that the controlled substance was not specified in the judgment,but concluding that the drug was identified as methamphetamine in part of th e plea agreement.after determining that juarez alvarado was not eligible for cancellation of removal or any other forms of relief,the ij ordered him removed to mexico.on appeal,the bia affirmed the lps decision without written opinion.
standard of review 
under a d,we have jurisdiction to review questions of law when a final order of removal is predicated on a criminal conviction.see mielewczyk holder,cir.whether a particular conviction constitutes a removable offense is a question of law that we review de novo.see id.where,as here,the bia summarily affirms the ij decision,we review the ij decision as the final agency action.pagayon holder,cir quoting zehatye gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
discussion 
we analyze whether a conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for removal purposes by employing the framework the supreme court constructed in taylor united states,d.see mielewczyk,at.we begin by applying the categorical approach,examining only the statutory definition of the crime to determine whether the state statute of conviction renders an alien removable under the statute of removal.id.we next apply a modified categorical approach if the state statute of conviction is broader than the generic federal offense and is also divisible,meaning that it comprises multiple,alternative versions of the crime,at least one of which correspond s to the generic offense.descamps united states,d under the modified categorical approach,we consider a limited class of judicially noticeable documents to determine whether the applicable alternative was the basis of the conviction.united states gonzalez monterroso,cir.
juarez alvarado raises two challenges to the ij determination that his conviction for attempted possession of a dangerous drug is a removable controlled substance offense first,he contends that the arizona definition of attempt is categorically broader than the federal definition.he acknowledges that we have previously held that the arizona and federal definitions of attempt are coextensive,united states taylor,cir,but argues that an intervening unpublished arizona state court of appeals opinion,state garcia,ca cr,wl,warrants revisiting that decision.second,he argues that,under the modified categorical approach,the government failed to prove that his arizona conviction was for a substance listed in the controlled substances act.see s yong holder,cir see also.we address each argument in turn.
before we can reach the merits of juarez alavardo attempt argument,we must determine whether it was properly exhausted.generally,d mandates exhaustion and therefore bars us,for lack of jurisdiction,from reaching the merits of a legal claim not presented in administrative proceedings below.barron ashcroft,cir we conclude that because juarez alvarado did not sufficiently exhaust his argument that the arizona definition of attempt is categorically broader than the federal generic definition,we lack jurisdiction to reach this issue.
juarez alvarado contends that he sufficiently exhausted his attempt argument by arguing that his state law conviction was not categorically a removable controlled substance offense under a b i.although a petitioner need not raise his precise argument in administrative proceedings,vizcarra ayala mukasey,cir,he can not satisfy the exhaustion requirement by making a general challenge to the ij decision,but,rather,must specify which issues form the basis of the appeal,zara ashcroft,cir.juarez alvarado only argument in his brief before the bia concerned the sufficiency of the government proof that the controlled substance involved in his conviction was methamphetamine.see abebe mukasey,cir en banc per curiam holding that when a petitioner files a brief before the bia,he is deemed to have exhausted only the issues raised and argued in that brief.even liberally construing juarez alvarado pro se claims,see vizcarra ayala,at,his brief did not raise a general argument about attempt.see moreno morante gonzales,cir.moreover,neither the ij nor the bia addressed the attempt element of his conviction.see vizcarra ayala,at holding that claims addressed on the merits by the bia are exhausted.accordingly,juarez alvarado failed to exhaust this issue because his argument regarding the controlled substance underlying his conviction was not sufficient to put the bia on notice that he was challenging the categorical match between the arizona attempt statute and the federal generic attempt definition,and the agency did not have an opportunity to pass on this issue.zhang ashcroft,cir.
juarez alvarado argues in the alternative that,even if he failed to exhaust his attempt argument,we may nevertheless reach its merits because the argument was so entirely foreclosed that no remedies were available as of right with regard to it before ijs and the bia.sun ashcroft,cir quoting d under u.d,a petitioner need only exhaust all administrative remedies available as of right.sun,at.a remedy is available as of right only when the agency can give unencumbered consideration to whether relief should be granted.id.at.accordingly,if an issue is entirely foreclosed,such that the agency can not give it unencumbered consideration,it is not available as of right and the statute does not require it to be exhausted,although prudential exhaustion requirements still apply.id.
juarez alvarado specifically argues that because the bia was bound by our conclusion in taylor that arizona definition of attempt is coextensive with the federal definition,at,it could not have given unencumbered consideration to his attempt argument.see in re sanudo,holding that the ninth circuit determination that battery under california penal code does not categorically qualify as a crime of violence is binding on this board and the immigration judges in cases arising within the jurisdiction of the ninth circuit see also jama immigration customs enforcement,d with rare exceptions,the bia follows the law of the circuit in which an individual case arises citations omitted.
although the statute may not require exhaustion if the bia bound by our prior precedent would be precluded from granting relief,those are not the circumstances here.juarez alvarado argument on the merits is that we are no longer bound by taylor because garcia,wl,constitutes a subsequent indication from the arizona courts that taylor interpretation of state law is incorrect.owen ex rel.owen united states,cir see also fdic mcsweeney,cir as a panel,we are bound by our prior decisions interpreting state as well as federal law in the absence of intervening controlling authority.this merits argument falls outside the exhaustion requirement only if the bia was foreclosed from determining whether it remained bound by taylor in light of garcia.accordingly,juarez alvarado futility argument rests on the assumption that the bia would be required to apply circuit precedent even when confronted with a meritorious argument that such precedent no longer constitutes binding law 
our review of bia practice does not support this assumption.instead,we conclude that nothing prevents the bia from giving unencumbered consideration to whether it remains bound by our decision in taylor in light of garcia.in other circumstances,the bia has considered whether circuit precedent remains binding in light of intervening events.see,in re carachuri rosendo,en banc holding that because the precedent in many circuits may well be consistent with intervening supreme court authority,they may need to be followed in removal proceedings,unless altered by the circuits in some respect in re luna aranda,wl june,holding that circuit precedent remained binding because it had not been reversed or meaningfully distinguished by this court and because the subsequent case cited by the respondent did not apply to the respondent case in re hernandez barrondo,wl b,recognizing that although the bia ordinarily would be required to follow a fifth circuit case interpret ing the same statute at issue in this case and conclud ing that it does not categorically define a crime of violence,the situation presented was more complex because that case had been materially augmented by a subsequent en banc decision applying a different methodology to the analysis of divisible state statutes matter of mangabat,declining to apply circuit precedent on an issue when the supreme court granted certiorari on the question,but terminated the case without rendering a decision on the merits garfias rodriguez holder,cir en banc describing how the bia decided it was not bound by circuit precedent when the case on which that precedent rested had been abrogated.similarly,district courts in analogous circumstances apply the same standard as panels of this court to decide whether circuit precedent remains binding after an intervening decision of a court of last resort.see miller gammie,cir per curiam en banc holding that when intervening authority from a court of last resort is clearly irreconcilable with our prior circuit authority,both a panel of this court and district courts should consider themselves bound by the intervening higher authority and reject the prior opinion of this court as having been effectively overruled.
there is accordingly no reason to believe the bia would rigidly apply circuit precedent when confronted with a meritorious argument that such precedent is no longer binding.it follows that if juarez alvarado had raised his attempt argument during removal proceedings and persuaded the bia,the bia would not have been precluded from granting him relief.accordingly,because the bia could have given unencumbered consideration to juarez alvarado argument that taylor no longer constitutes binding law in light of garcia,we conclude that juarez alvarado had an administrative remed y available as of right,and therefore this argument falls within the scope of d l exhaustion requirement.sun,at.
we acknowledge that prudential considerations may well militate in favor of reaching the merits of juarez alvarado attempt argument,fregozo holder,cir noting that this inquiry involves parsing the elements of a state criminal statute to determine whether it criminalizes conduct that falls outside of the generic federal offense,a task for which the bia lacks any particular statutory expertise that would be brought to bear on remand.because issue exhaustion is a jurisdictional requirement,however,see supra note,such considerations may not influence our analysis.having concluded that juarez alvarado did not exhaust this argument before the bia,and that the bia was not precluded from giving the argument unencumbered consideration,we are jurisdictionally barred from reaching the merits.
we therefore turn to juarez alvarado second contention,that the government failed to meet its burden of proving removability because it did not establish that his arizona conviction constituted a controlled substance offense under a b i.to establish removability under a b i,the government must prove that the substance underlying an alien state law conviction for possession is one that is covered by section of the csa.s yong holder,cir.the government does not dispute that arizona definition of dangerous drug is categorically broader than the federal definition of controlled substance.compare.defining dangerous drug,with,defining controlled substance.we therefore apply the modified categorical approach to determine whether juarez was convicted of attempting to possess a substance listed in the csa.see s yong,at.
in the context of a guilty plea,the modified categorical approach inquires whether a guilty plea to an offense defined by a nongeneric statute necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense.young holder,cir en banc quoting united states aguila montes de oca,cir en banc per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.this inquiry considers only the charging instrument,transcript of the plea colloquy,plea agreement,and comparable judicial record of this information.id.citing shepard united states,d.a statement of the factual basis supporting the guilty plea may be considered if specifically incorporated into the guilty plea or admitted by a defendant.parrilla gonzales,cir.
the government contends that it met its burden of showing that juarez alvarado conviction related to a substance
