for many years,richard rosenbaum and his employed numerous illegal aliens,paid them in cash,and failed to withhold federal income tax,medicare,or social security from their paychecks.after being caught,rosenbaum eventually pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the united states and to harbor illegal aliens and to a substantive count of harboring more than one hundred illegal aliens,though not before trying to expatriate his assets and flee the united states.
at sentencing,the district court denied the government motion under section of the united states sentencing guidelines seeking a reduction in rosenbaum offense level for substantial assistance to the government and sentenced rosenbaum to one hundred twenty months in prison.one hundred twenty months represented the statutory maximum sentence possible after imposing sentence on the two counts consecutively,but was also within the advisory guidelines range.rosenbaum appeal claims two errors first,that the district court improperly considered the potential for a future rule b motion when denying the government section motion and,second,that the sentence was substantively unreasonable.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
richard rosenbaum and his were the principals in a company that provided maintenance services in the hospitality industry to businesses,such as restaurant chains,resorts,and theme parks,across the country.a department of labor investigation regarding unpaid overtime at a michigan resort revealed that the company employed hundreds of illegal aliens,paid them in cash,and failed to withhold federal income and unemployment taxes,social security,and medicare from the employees wages.the investigation further revealed that the defendants had taken several overt steps to conceal the company employment of the illegal aliens and otherwise impede the irs collection of lawfully due taxes,and had taken the unpaid tax money out of the company for personal use.all told,the company shortchanged the irs out of upwards of million.
rosenbaum learned of the investigation sometime in the early spring of.his attorneys thereafter commenced plea negotiations with the government.as of february,the plea negotiations had settled on rosenbaum and his two each pleading guilty to one count carrying a maximum of five years in prison.throughout this period,rosenbaum was not assisting the government by providing information for use in other investigations or prosecutions.
concurrent with these extended plea negotiations,rosenbaum was also laying the groundwork for a backup plan to use if the negotiations did not produce a deal acceptable to rosenbaum placing assets in unreachable accounts and fleeing the united states.to further this goal,rosenbaum contacted an individual known as fernando in florida,who supposedly specialized in getting people and their money out of the united states.rosenbaum paid fernando for his services.rosenbaum contacted fernando in february to inform him that the situation,the plea negotiations,appeared fairly ugly and to discuss moving forward with plans for the hunting trip.rosenbaum and fernando then met in person,at which time rosenbaum reported that his intended to accept plea deals but that he could not do the five years in prison his attorneys had negotiated for him.rosenbaum and fernando made plans for rosenbaum to begin operating under an assumed name and to transfer assets out of the country.
unfortunately for rosenbaum,instead of being the for all things expatriation as rosenbaum believed,fernando was actually an undercover agent for immigration and customs enforcement.before rosenbaum could escape the country,the government unsealed a count indictment and arrested rosenbaum in florida.
as a result of rosenbaum extracurriculars,the government took the,plea deal off the table for rosenbaum.instead,the government insisted that rosenbaum plead guilty to two counts and waive any objection to the imposition of consecutive sentences.as indicted,the second count carried a maximum potential sentence of ten years,resulting in a total potential sentencing exposure for the two counts of fifteen years.however,rosenbaum attorneys convinced the government to agree to file a superseding criminal information against rosenbaum so that the second count carried only a statutory maximum instead of ten years.with the maximum sentencing exposure set at ten years,rosenbaum pleaded guilty to two counts and consented to forfeiture of his assets.
the plea agreement contains several relevant provisions rosenbaum expressly waives any objection to the court imposing consecutive sentences to the extent necessary to produce a sentence that falls within the guideline range the agreement obliges rosenbaum to cooperate with authorities in pending or future investigations the agreement discusses the possibility of a motion filed pursuant to guidelines section or criminal rule b and memorializes rosenbaum understanding that filing such a motion rests solely in the government discretion and that whether to grant the motion rests solely within the court discretion and the agreement contains a agreement that prevents rosenbaum prosecution by eleven other united states attorneys in whose district rosenbaum company had operated.
after his arrest and through sentencing,rosenbaum met several times with investigators from the irs and immigration and customs enforcement for debriefing.rosenbaum provided information regarding the operation of his own business recruitment and employment of illegal aliens.although this information apparently resulted in the investigators referring leads to investigators in other districts,as of the date of sentencing no actual investigations or prosecutions had been spurred or aided by rosenbaum information nevertheless,the government filed a motion under section of the guidelines seeking a decrease of up to two offense levels in the calculation of rosenbaum advisory guidelines range due to rosenbaum substantial assistance to the government.
at sentencing,neither side objected to the investigation report,which set rosenbaum offense level at and his criminal history at category i,producing a guideline range of one hundred eight to one hundred months.because the statutory maximum for the two counts to which rosenbaum pleaded guilty was one hundred twenty months,that became the upper end of the advisory guidelines range.
the court then heard extensive argument from rosenbaum counsel regarding rosenbaum assistance to the government,as well as other factors that rosenbaum put forth in mitigation of his punishment.distilling counsel presentation,it appears that rosenbaum argued that five general factors cut in favor of a lower sentence age rosenbaum was years old at sentencing lack of prior criminal activity rosenbaum own poor health the health of rosenbaum son,who is mentally disabled and for whom rosenbaum was the primary provider and rosenbaum cooperation and assistance to the government.the court asked several questions of rosenbaum counsel,heard argument from the government,and listened to rosenbaum own statement.the court then launched into a lengthy explanation of its reasons for denying the government section motion and for imposing the sentence.rosenbaum now appeals both the denial of the motion and the overall sentence.
section motion 
the sentencing court may reduce a defendant sentencing exposure for substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another at two distinct stages,though both require a motion from the government before the court may act.the first opportunity arises at sentencing itself and comes in the form of a motion from the government under section of the sentencing guidelines.a second opportunity exists if,within one year of sentencing,the government moves the sentencing court to reduce the defendant sentence.b.
whether and to what extent to grant a section motion rests within the discretion of the sentencing court,and this court ordinarily do es not have jurisdiction to evaluate the appropriateness of a departure.united states ridge,cir.however,this court may determine whether the sentencing court actions represent the exercise of discretio
