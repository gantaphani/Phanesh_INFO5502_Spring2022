faustin mukadi ilunga,a citizen of the democratic republic of the congo,appeals the denial of his application for asylum and protection under the convention against torture cat.we hold that the rejection of ilunga asylum application,largely on the basis of an adverse credibility finding,was not supported by substantial evidence.we thus remand for further proceedings.
the following description of ilunga travails in the congo and his journey to the united states is based on his asylum application,testimony before the immigration judge ij,and corroborating documentation in the record.the ij adverse credibility determination necessarily called into question the trustworthiness of many of the facts alleged.
before fleeing to the united states,ilunga lived in the congo with his wife and five children.in,he joined the movement for the liberation of the congo mlc,a political party that actively opposed president joseph kabila in the country elections.ilunga was a paid employee and member of the party,participating in highly visible campaign activities and public appearances in the city of lubumbashi.
after the mlc candidate lost the election to president kabila,ilunga political activism endangered him.local police and others loyal to president kabila threatened ilunga life and vandalized his home.the police also killed two mlc supporters with whom ilunga worked during the campaign.increasingly fearful,ilunga wrote a letter to his childhood friend living in neighboring zambia,bernard kabeya,expressing his anxiety while accusing the president of assassinating his father.
the letter was intercepted by government agents working for the congolese intelligence agency,the agence nationale de renseignements anr.on december,an undercover anr agent went to ilunga home,blindfolded him,and drove him to prison where he was interrogated.ilunga admitted that he authored the letter,and the anr agent stated that ilunga would be killed as a result.
the government sent ilunga to prison where he spent more than a month in a small cell shared with jean nkongolo kalala.ilunga suffered daily torture.prison guards stabbed him and poured battery acid in the wounds.they shocked him with an electrical club,routinely whipped him,and raped him.
on february,ilunga and kalala escaped from prison with the help of a guard whom they paid off.the pair fled to zambia in the bed of a truck hauling copper.while ilunga remained in zambia,the government tortured his family,raped his wife,and burned his home.
on june,ilunga and kalala boarded a plane for the united states.ilunga wife and children fled to a zambian refugee camp.
ilunga arrived at washington dulles international airport without a visa.he told an immigration officer that he left his country for political reasons and was looking for asylum.he further specified that he was afraid to go back home and had no doubt that he would be harmed again if he returned to the congo.
at a credibility hearing three weeks later,ilunga attested to his party membership,the threats against him as a result of his political activity,the circumstances surrounding his arrest,the torture he endured in prison,and his escape.the asylum officer determined that ilunga established a credible fear of persecution.
in may,ilunga filed his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection.the application is consistent with the account he gave at the credibility hearing,and it provides greater detail about the arrest and torture in prison,including incidents when ilunga was stabbed,shocked with an electrical device on the genitals,sexually assaulted,and beaten.
for supporting documentation,ilunga provided 
his affidavit,detailing his abuse and escape 
a medical affidavit from michael viola,who examined ilunga in the united states and found that ilunga reporting of his torture history and symptoms are notable because of his consistent and precise description of specific details and the correlation of his history to his present symptoms and physical findings ilunga psychological symptoms are consistent with moderate stress disorder ptsd ilunga physical injuries are consistent with cuts with a sharp object,and his chest wound is consistent with delayed healing of a wound secondary to infection or the reported pouring of acid into the cut and ilunga fear of return to the congo is credible 
an affidavit from kalala,ilunga cellmate,that is consistent with ilunga statements but does not speak to the specific torture that ilunga suffered in prison 
an affidavit from bernard kabeya,ilunga friend in zambia,who confirmed ilunga account of his time in that country 
extensive documentation of country conditions in the congo,including descriptions of violence,executions,forced disappearances,torture in prison,and impunity for rape 
ilunga reissued mlc membership card and a letter from the mlc expressing concern about his survival and attesting that his activism on behalf of democracy in our country has caused him a lot of trouble from the security officers who are in power anr 
photographs purporting to show scars on ilunga body caused by his torture in prison 
letters from ilunga wife and family warning about conditions in the congo and detailing their flight to zambia and 
the refugee card,and registration attestation,issued to ilunga wife by the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr.
ilunga and kalala testified at ilunga removal hearing.ilunga primary language is tshiluba,but he claimed to speak french fluently,and a contract french interpreter translated the proceedings.after reviewing the two days of testimony and the record,the ij found that ilunga was not credible and denied his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.
three pieces of testimony were central to the ij credibility determination.first,the ij cited supposedly inconsistent statements about the location of ilunga torture inside the prison,and whether kalala witnessed it.ilunga,the ij observed,stated that he was beaten away from his cell and that only guards witnessed the beatings.in seeming incongruity,kalala translated testimony provides that these things took place in the same room where they spent their nights and that kalala was there when guards stabbed ilunga.the ij determined that such an inconsistency can not be explained by a translation error,particularly as one claimed to have witnessed the beatings in the same room in which they slept while the other testified to have been taken to a different part of the prison and to have been beaten with only guards present.
second,the ij found inconsistencies in testimony regarding the prayer practices of ilunga and kalala.ilunga,the ij determined,was initially when asked exactly how the cellmates prayed together,and he was vague when pressed about the timing and content of the prayers.moreover,the ij claimed ilunga was hesitant and vague when answering questions about the frequency and timing of prayer.
third,the ij agreed with the government that there were material inconsistencies in the dates on the mlc documentation provided.the date on the membership card and the letter,the ij determined,was the day before ilunga detention,even though ilunga claimed that his wife obtained the documents much later while he was living in the united states.moreover,the ij believed it was significant that the mlc letter did not mention ilunga arrest,which would be expected if it had been written when claimed and if there was a typographical error in the date.
regarding the testimony as a whole,the ij found that ilunga demeanor also supported the adverse credibility finding,noting in a single sentence that ilunga was and appeared uncomfortable answering some questions.the ij added in passing that dhs has also raised some valid concerns regarding plausibility and vagueness.
finding ilunga incredible,the ij determined,necessarily calls into question all aspects of his claim.the ij further concluded in two sentences that ilunga was not entitled to asylum based on any independent evidence unrelated to those credibility findings.
as for ilunga application for cat relief,the ij separately held that there was not sufficient reliable,independent evidence in the record to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the respondent would be tortured if he had to go back to the democratic republic of the congo.
on july,the board of immigration appeals bia upheld each of the ij determinations,largely adopting the ij factual findings and reasoning.specifically,the bia credited the ij account of testimonial inconsistencies,deferred to her demeanor observations,and agreed with her assessment of the documentary evidence.the bia additionally affirmed the denial of cat relief.
the immigration and nationality act ina gives the attorney general the discretionary power to grant asylum to aliens who qualify as refugees.dankam gonzales,cir.to qualify,applicants must establish they are unable or unwilling to return to their country of nationality because of past persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group or political opinion.a see also id.b.an applicant can establish eligibility simply by providing credible testimony about his or her experiences.a.
when the bia affirms and adopts an ij decision,this court reviews both decisions as the final agency action.marynenka holder,cir.an asylum order must be upheld unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.b d.our review of an adverse credibility determination is specifically limited to ensuring that substantial evidence supports it.see qing hua lin holder,cir citing dankam,at.although broad deference extends to the agency determination,it must provide specific,cogent reasons supporting its decision.djadjou holder,cir.
the real id act of requires that credibility determinations be based on the totality of the circumstances,including 
the demeanor,candor,or responsiveness of the applicant or witness,the inherent plausibility of the applicant or witness account,the consistency between the applicant or witness written and oral statements whenever made and whether or not under oath,and considering the circumstances under which the statements were made,the internal consistency of each such statement,the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements,without regard to whether an inconsistency,inaccuracy,or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant claim.
b b iii.as this court has held,omissions,inconsistent statements,contradictory evidence,and inherently improbable testimony are appropriate bases for making an adverse credibility determination.djadjou,at.
the totality of the circumstances standard thus provides an ij with ample discretion in assessing credibility.it does not,however,permit a judge to cherry pick facts or inconsistencies to support an adverse credibility finding that is unsupported by the record as a whole.ai jun zhi holder,cir quoting shrestha holder,cir see also hanaj gonzales,cir the ij can not selectively examine evidence shah att y of,cir same.instead,an ij determination must take into account all the evidence submitted,including independent documentary support.see shah,at.thus,at a minimum the ij must consider the petitioner explanation for any inconsistency to verify that an inconsistency actually exists,and then evaluate whether the discrepancy renders the entire testimony incredible in light of the record as a whole.see shrestha,at.
as described above,the ij based her credibility determination on four grounds testimony about the location of ilunga torture in prison testimony about the prayer practices of ilunga and kalala inside their cell the dates on the mlc membership card and letter obtained by ilunga and ilunga demeanor during testimony.we consider each in turn.
when asked where he was whipped in prison,ilunga first testified that it was inside the cell and then stated he did not understand a question about whether he was in the cell with his cellmate at the time.asked to elaborate,ilunga translated reply was being as they called,they take one out.they whipped you good and they take you back inside.minutes later,when asked why he had told a doctor that he was attacked outside his cell,ilunga stated the abuse was inside the prison but not in the cell where i was staying in.he again struggled to understand questions about whether he was additionally tortured inside the cell.
kalala,meanwhile,testified that he was there when ilunga was tortured,and that the abuse was in the same room where we spent our nights.on,in front of a different translator,kalala stated that the first translator had used the french word for jailhouse instead of room,leading to any discrepancy between his testimony and that of ilunga.
a single testimonial discrepancy,particularly when supported by other facts in the record,may be sufficient to find an applicant incredible in some circumstances.see djadjou,at affirming an adverse credibility finding when the applicant had testified she was in hiding,but an eviction notice indicated that she was in her store on the same day.but such an inconsistency provides inadequate justification when,as here,there is a strong indication it results from translation errors or misunderstanding,particularly when it is belied by an extensive record of otherwise consistent statements and corroborating evidence.see shrestha,at observing that an ij may not cherry pick solely facts favoring an adverse credibility determination while ignoring facts that undermine that result.
as an initial matter,the trustworthiness of any translation,when at issue,must be a relevant factor in the agency analysis of the totality of the circumstances supporting a credibility finding.simply put,there must be reasonable assurances that any inconsistencies in testimony are,in fact,real and not the product of interpretation errors,confusion,or similar factors.see perez lastor ins,cir a n incorrect or incomplete translation is the functional equivalent of no translation the alien must be able to understand the questions posed to him and to communicate his answers to the ij.
as is well established,a defective translation of an immigration proceeding can amount to a constitutional due process violation when the plaintiff can show he or she did not receive a full and fair hearing on his or her claims,rusu ins,cir,and the violation caused prejudice such that the results of the proceedings were likely impacted,id.at citing farrokhi ins,cir.but even absent a constitutional violation,faulty or unreliable translations can undermine the evidence on which an adverse credibility determination is based.he ashcroft,cir citing balasubramanrim ins,cir.
determining whether a flawed interpretation fatally undermines a credibility determination requires an examination of direct and indirect evidence of error.the eighth and ninth circuits have sensibly identified three types of evidence that tend to prove that a translation was incompetent.perez lastor,at tun gonzales,cir adopting the perez lastor framework.as perez lastor established 
first,direct evidence of incorrectly translated words is persuasive evidence of an incompetent translation.second,unresponsive answers by the witness provide circumstantial evidence of translation problems.a third indicator of an incompetent translation is the witness expression of difficulty understanding what is said to him.

ilunga hearing transcript bears all three hallmarks of unreliability.before turning to the specific testimony regarding the location of torture in the prison,it is instructive to examine the hearing as a whole.the two days of testimony were translated by two different interpreters,with nearly all instances of potential confusion arising on the first day.the transcript of that day reveals 
an instance when the interpreter failed to translate ilunga statement that he was sexually assaulted in jail,an omission caught by ilunga attorney,leading to the translator opaque admission after the fact that he thought ilunga was not speaking clearly and this interpreter,perhaps,what he could hear from him sic 
a repeated disconnect between questions and answers see ilunga attorney asked about threats made,and ilunga responded with a statement about damage done in a store the ij asked about how ilunga was arrested,and ilunga replied that he had been told that two of his colleagues had been killed,and that he was afraid ilunga counsel asked ilunga to describe his prison,and ilunga answered i do not know and provided other disconnected answers ilunga attorney asked where his largest scar was,and ilunga pointed to his chest but answered it was on the right arm and on the right knee the government asked about where ilunga wife obtained an mlc letter,and ilunga replied b ecause our party quarters are located in kinshasa the government asked where an event took place,and kalala answered with when it took place 
at least times during the first day testimony when ilunga or kalala stated they did not understand a question see twice,three times,
an instance when ilunga attorney believed the interpreter translated ilunga statement as saying he suffered at the hands of the political party he worked for,instead of the party he opposed 
confusion about whether ilunga testified that he told his wife and children to flee their home while he was still in prison or after 
at least times when the interpreter needed a question repeated see,and 
frequent grammatical errors and questionable word choices see.
those red flags should inspire special caution before an ij parses translated statements to assess inconsistencies.
indeed,here it is impossible to say that ilunga testimony was inconsistent with that of kalala regarding the location of torture because we do not know precisely what the men testified to.instead,the transcript reveals that the cellmates were consistently,and genuinely,confused about the questions regarding location.as one example,the ij observed that kalala stated he saw the torture inflicted on ilunga,in apparent tension with ilunga statement that he was beaten in a different part of the prison with only guards present.kalala,however,was only translated as stating that he was there when the stabbing and beatings took place.thus,even taking the translation on its face,it is unclear whether kalala testified that he saw the abuse or not.furthermore,according to kalala statement during the second day of testimony,the first translator used a french word that connotes jailhouse instead of room when describing the cell in question,causing confusion in his testimony.see.neither the ij nor the bia resolved which word was used,or whether kalala claim was correct.instead,the bia observed that kalala nonetheless testified that ilunga was beaten in the square foot room where they both slept.kalala,however,is only translated as stating that he himself had been beaten in that room,not that ilunga was ever beaten there.
against that backdrop,the ij reliance on the alleged testimonial inconsistency was unfounded 
the ij also based her credibility determination on asserted inconsistencies in testimony regarding the prayer practices of ilunga and kalala in prison.the ij specifically determined that ilunga was initially and then vague when asked about his prayer practices.moreover,the ij found he was hesitant and vague when asked about the frequency and timing of his prayers.
tellingly,the bia did not treat the prayer testimony as inconsistent,but rather as part of the ij demeanor assessment.for good reason.the transcript reveals that there was not a single substantive inconsistency between the testimony of ilunga and kalala.both testified they prayed together.both testified they knelt to pray.and both testified they prayed for their release from jail.nothing more was asked of them.
moreover,any hesitancy and vagueness cited by the ij is consistent with the repeated disconnect between questions and answers throughout the proceeding strong indirect evidence of interpretation problems.the relevant portion of the transcript is as follows 
q how often did you and he pray together 
a i can not say how many times.
q okay.my question is how often how many times a day did you pray with him 
a every time.
q and exactly how did you and he pray together 
a first,after my arrival in the prison,i did not know him and i was afraid of him.i did not want to know who he was.and the day i was cut on the knee,that when i started praying in my native language,in tshiluba.and he heard me praying.then he said we are the same.we are coming from the same region.then he explained to me where he came from.that when we decided to start praying together.
q and my question was,exactly how did you and he pray together 
a i do know.
q you do know how you and he prayed together 
a we kneel down and we pray in our native tongue.
such a labored exchange,when considered in the context of the entire transcript,says more about communication failures than it does about ilunga credibility in answering the questions.see tun,at observing that difficulties in understanding can lend an air of evasiveness and confusion to the proceedings.
the agency credibility determination,however,again failed to consider the quality of the interpretation.and given the otherwise consistent nature of the substantive testimony regarding prayer practices,it was an abuse of discretion to use such testimony to find ilunga incredible.
the ij further cited ilunga mlc membership card and letter from the party as supporting an adverse credibility finding.both are dated december,the day after ilunga arrest ilunga,however,testified that he asked his wife to obtain the documents after he arrived in the united states in.such a discrepancy,the ij concluded,constituted a material inconsistenc y.
the bia,however,failed to meaningfully consider ilunga reasonable explanation for the apparent inconsistency.according to ilunga,mlc officials dated the documents to show no lapse in membership after the anr ripped up his original card when he was arrested.ilunga openly acknowledged in his affidavit and live testimony that the card in the record was a reissued replacement,and that his wife obtained it to help with his asylum claim.moreover,his description of the destruction of his original card at the hands of security officials is consistent with the documented practice for government officials to illegally arrest mlc party members and confiscate their mlc party cards.br.of appellants citing amnesty int l,democratic republic of congo torture and killings by state security agents still endemic october included in the record at.
in rejecting ilunga account,the bia merely observed that he failed to make his explanation before the ij,but the bia cited no authority for why it could not consider the explanation on appeal.we conclude that any ambiguity that may exist about the date on the card and letter is insufficient to sustain an adverse credibility determination given ilunga plausible explanation,the agency conclusory treatment of it,the absence of any contrary evidence,and the extensive record corroborating ilunga claim.the ij presumption that mlc officials should have dated the documents when ilunga wife requested them amounts to speculation and conjecture.see ayi gonzales,cir rejecting an ij speculative leap and determination that a party membership card was forged based on a forensics analysis that showed a paper disturbance on the card zuh mukasey,cir questioning the appropriateness of speculating about foreign documents citing ayi,at lin jian gonzales,cir observing that we will not defer to an adverse credibility finding that is based on speculation,conjecture,or an otherwise unsupported personal opinion quoting tewabe gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the ij,however,also reasoned that if the letter had been written when ilunga claimed,it should have mentioned ilunga arrest.as we have previously observed,letters written by political parties attesting to an individual political involvement need not mention such arrests to be credible.tassi holder,cir finding unpersuasive the government argument that letters describing an individual political activities should have mentioned arrests.in this case,ilunga obtained the document to corroborate his political involvement with the party,not as evidence of his arrest.it is entirely speculative to sugges
