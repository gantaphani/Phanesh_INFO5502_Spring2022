background 
a.the gjerazi family life in albania 
gjerazi,his wife,and their two children are natives of albania.gjerazi testified that he had been an active member of the democratic party,the largest opposition party to the socialist party in albania,since.in november of,gjerazi was elected to the position of secretary for the democratic party in the albanian city of fier,a position he held until july of.he testified that his duties included contacting albanians to promote the ideology of the democratic party as well as maintaining quotas and collecting membership dues for the fier region.he also assisted in preparations for the elections,including sponsoring and organizing democratic party meetings,and was selected to represent the party at a polling station in fier.
not only was gjerazi an active member of the democratic party,but previous generations of his family had similarly taken active roles in opposing the socialist party.in his application for asylum,he stated that his political activism as well as that of past generations of his family resulted in frequent persecution by albanian authorities.for example,during his asylum hearing,he testified that his uncle and his mother uncle had been imprisoned by the communist party for and eighteen years,respectively.as a result of his family history of political activism,when he was a child,the socialist government confiscated land and a store that had been in his family for years.in,the property was returned to gjerazi mother,and,upon her death in,gjerazi became the owner.despite these past problems,gjerazi testified that once the property was returned to his family,he made a good living as a store owner.he drew approximately in profit each month and was considered quite wealthy by albanian standards.
despite his status in albania as a successful business owner,like past generations of his family,gjerazi political activism precipitated several unfortunate events.on june,while en route to a party meeting in tirana,albania capital city,the taxi transporting gjerazi was stopped by two masked men who forced him out of the vehicle and assaulted him,beating him with the butt of a gun and kicking him until he lost consciousness.gjerazi testified that as they beat him,the men stated that he would not be going to meet the celebration in tirana.he did not continue on to tirana or seek medical attention.upon returning to his home that evening,he received an anonymous telephone call during which the caller threatened him with very bad consequences if he did not adjust the election returns in order to ensure the success of the socialist party.gjerazi testified that because he was the person responsible for the polling station in fier,he figured that the callers wanted him to manipulate the results and the scores in order that the socialist party would prevail.although he reported the incident to democratic party officials as well as to the police,no action was taken to locate the assailants or to determine who made the call and the ensuing threat.
three days after he was attacked on the way to tirana,a second major incident befell the gjerazi family.on june,gjerazi son,justin,was kidnapped while playing in his own backyard.gjerazi claimed that two officials from the socialist party,argon mecallin and agim idrizi,were responsible for the kidnaping.he testified that,approximately one half hour after the child abduction,the kidnappers contacted his and conditioned the child release on the socialist party winning the vote in fier.according to gjerazi,his told the kidnappers that gjerazi was not the main at the polling station and that he could not guarantee the results they wanted.gjerazi immediately contacted the police,controlled at that time by the democratic party.while the police were sympathetic,they were unable to secure his son release,so gjerazi enlisted the aid of his wife uncle the uncle located the child and was able to negotiate the boy release in exchange for a ransom of.a few weeks after justin kidnaping,the socialist party won the election,including the local election in fier.
on july,approximately one month after his son abduction and a few days after the socialist party regained control of albania,gjerazi wife,klarita,was accosted and beaten by two masked men.klarita testified that when she arrived home,the men struck her from behind,entered the home,and began calling out for gjerazi.when they discovered he was not in the apartment,they beat her into a state of unconsciousness.after the attack,klarita spent ten days confined in a hospital.shortly after her release from the hospital,gjerazi resigned from his position as a secretary of the democratic party and moved his family to vos kopoje,a town located in a remote mountainous area in southern albania.although gjerazi continued to live in fier,he traveled to vos kopeje regularly,keeping a low profile while deciding what to do with his family store,land,and personal belongings.
gjerazi problems flared up again in april of,when he attended a monthly democratic party meeting.after returning from the meeting,gjerazi apartment was set on fire while he was in the building.although he escaped,his unit was completely destroyed.after the fire,gjerazi moved to vos kopoje with his family.in september of,he returned to fier to attend a peaceful demonstration in protest of the assassination of azem hajdari,a democratic party official.shortly after the demonstration,a warrant was issued for gjerazi arrest,alleging that he had attacked the main offices of the police station.although he received notice of the arrest summons,instead of reporting to the police,he began making arrangements to leave albania.
upon payment of,gjerazi arranged for slovenian passports and transportation,and,on march,he and his family fled albania.after a stop in italy they flew to the united states.gjerazi testified that when he and his family arrived in the united states,he destroyed their slovenian passports as directed by the individuals who provided the passports.in november,the gjerazis filed for asylum.
according to gjerazi,when he left albania,he did not know that he would eventually land in the united states and apply for asylum.during the hearing,he explained that he feared returning to albania with his family because the socialist party was still in power.he testified that his family persecution in albania was motivated by his membership in the democratic party and that he believed current conditions in albania to be the same as they were in.he stated that if he and his family were forced to return,he was concerned that there could be very severe consequences for them,and he speculated that he would be arrested or even killed.
during the asylum hearing,gjerazi wife and daughter also testified about their tumultuous lives in albania and gjerazi involvement with the democratic party.gjerazi wife testified about the beatings she and her husband endured as well as her son abduction.she corroborated her husband testimony about his active participation in the democratic party and stated that she feared for their lives should they be forced to return to albania.the ij also requested that gjerazi daughter,alba,testify.although she recalled her brother kidnaping,not surprisingly,she was unable to add much to the record,including anything about her father political activities 
in addition to the testimony presented by the gjerazi family,dhimo jano,a citizen of albania who left the country in october of,testified on their behalf.jano knew and socialized with the gjerazi family in albania.jano confirmed gjerazi membership in the democratic party and his position as a secretary within the party.he also described an incident that occurred in albania in when he and gjerazi were having coffee.he stated that he observed a member of the socialist party approach gjerazi,point at him,and proclaim,t his is the end of the democratic party.jano also testified that,during the same year,he heard on the local news that gjerazi son had been abducted.
gjerazi recounted that when he left albania in haste,he did not take the time to gather documents to support an asylum application because he had not yet determined what his destination would be or much less that he would eventually apply for asylum in the united states.when he did decide to apply for asylum,he asked his,who was still in albania,to obtain the necessary documentation to assist him in establishing his past membership in the democratic party and to prove his family persecution in albania.
gjerazi submitted numerous documents to the ij in support of his family asylum applications.the ij admitted in evidence documents marked as group exhibit notices to all members of the gjerazi family to appear,group exhibit gjerazi asylum application and additional documents received from the ins pertaining to his application,group exhibit documents which corroborated background information and country conditions in albania,and exhibit the country report on human right practices for albania,issued by the united states department of state on february,the ij excluded from evidence a collection of documents labeled as group exhibit,a through exhibit is a copy of an arrest warrant for gjerazi executed on september,following the demonstration protesting the assassination of azem hajdari.exhibit is the notarized declaration of luljeta gjini,a neighbor of gjerazi in albania,who attested to the beating of gjerazi wife.the declaration was executed on july.exhibit is a medical certificate confirming klarita hospitalization after the attack in her home.the certificate states that klarita was examined on july.exhibits through f are certificates from the commissariat of police.exhibit,dated june,confirms the kidnaping of justin gjerazi exhibit,dated september,states that the gjerazi home in fier was destroyed by fire and,dated august,states that gjerazi was attacked on his way to tirana in april of exhibit,dated july,states that the gjerazi family was persecuted by the communist regime in albania.exhibits and were purportedly issued by the democratic party these documents corroborate gjerazi testimony about his membership in the party,his election as a secretary in,and the incidents of persecution suffered by his family.the final two documents,exhibits and,are copies of gjerazi albanian passport and his democratic party membership card,respectively.
during gjerazi,the government brought up discrepancies between the dates reflected on the documents and the dates of the incidents of persecution alleged by gjerazi.a number of the documents were dated several months after the incidents occurred.when asked about the discrepancies in the dates,gjerazi speculated that employees of the commissariat of police or notaries may have made a mistake while preparing the documents.however,he repeatedly explained to the ij that he was unable to shed any light on the discrepancies in the dates,making clear that he was not the one who procured the documents from the police in albania consequently,he was not physically present to inspect the documents at the time they were either drafted or obtained.furthermore,because questions about the documents did not arise until the time of the hearing,gjerazi was unable to present an affidavit from his to explain the manner in which the documents were obtained and possibly to answer questions concerning the alleged discrepancies in the dates.
c.the decision of the immigration judge 
on june,the ij denied gjerazi application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture.in his oral decision,the ij concluded that certain aspects of gjerazi claim appear to be supported by the country reports and certain aspects of gjerazi claim to persecution based on country conditions as they relate to political conflict between socialists and democrats are not implausible.the ij also found that gjerazi and his family have testified consistently with their written applications for asylum.despite these findings,the ij concluded that the documents submitted in support of their asylum application,specifically group exhibit,raised serious credibility issues.focusing on the credibility issues raised by the documents,the ij determined that gjerazi failed to meet his burden of proof.
the ij stated that the manner in which the documents were obtained and submitted led him to the inescapable conclusion that this claim must be denied and that the use of false passports to enter the triggered a series of questions about the other documents.he also questioned gjerazi decision to dispose of the slovenian passports upon entry into the,wondering why gjerazi did not hand them over to the man who met them at the airport.the ij found that this act raised other questions about the respondent credibility because the record shows that he had submitted copies of an albanian passport for reasons unknown.the ij also took issue with gjerazi testimony that the documents in group exhibit were prepared on the dates of the incidents or shortly thereafter.the ij reasoned,if the documents were actually prepared on the dates which appear on their face this would raise significant questions about why gjerazi would have his obtain those documents when he himself was in albania.furthermore,the ij questioned gjerazi testimony that the documents were photocopies of the original documents and concluded that the documents were not photocopies but were originals.
after excluding much of gjerazi corroborating documentary evidence,the ij concluded that the record failed to establish the motivation of the persecutors.he described the gjerazi family as fortunate,middle class landowners who earned per month running the family store,and stated that w hat this court is willing to accept given all of the questions raised by gjerazi testimony is that gjerazi and his family had money which was targeted by criminals in albania.in spite of the overwhelming evidence of political motive surrounding the attacks on the gjerazi family,including several threatening statements made to the gjerazis and recounted herein,the ij speculated that the kidnaping of gjerazi son and the beating of his wife were motivated by financial gain and were not instigated by the socialist party.
d.the bia opinion 
on july,gjerazi filed an appeal with the bia.on march,the bia issued its decision adopting and affirming the ij decision.in addition to adopting the ij decision,the bia also supplemented the decision and addressed gjerazi contention that he was denied a full and fair hearing because of an incompetent translator the bia found that gjerazi caused the translator difficulties when he failed to alter the rapidity of his speech in order to give the translator time to interpret his testimony.the bia summarily concluded that gjerazi failed to demonstrate that a better translation would have made a difference in the outcome of the hearing.
on may,gjerazi filed a timely petition for appellate review.gjerazi alleges that he and his family have suffered past persecution as a direct result of his political activities.gjerazi makes three arguments in support of his petition.initially,he argues that the ij incorrectly concluded that the physical and mental torture endured by the gjerazis was criminally rather than politically motivated.gjerazi contends that his family was persecuted,at least in part,because of his political activities and membership in the democratic party.next,gjerazi argues that the ij should have granted his family request for asylum because they provided credible,convincing testimony about each incident of political retribution they suffered.finally,gjerazi argues that the ij was on notice of the incompetence of the translator yet he still put undue weight on insignificant details in gjerazi testimony that might have been mistranslated.based upon the record before us,we agree that gjerazi first two arguments alone are sufficient to compel a remand and we need not reach his third argument regarding the alleged incompetence of the translator.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
when the bia adopts the ij decision while supplementing the decision with its own reasoning,the ij decision,as supplemented by the bia decision,becomes the basis for review.niam ashcroft,cir.our review of the bia denial of asylum is deferential we require only that the decision be supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.li gonzales,cir quoting ins,d.we will reverse only if the evidence presented is such that a reasonable factfinder would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed,at.see also b b stating that the administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.
furthermore,c redibility determinations are accorded substantial deference and should only be overturned under extraordinary circumstances.ahmad ins,cir.however,they must be supported by specific,cogent reasons.mansour ins,cir quoting ahmad,at.in addition,these reasons must bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.id.we shall not defer to credibility determinations drawn from insufficient or incomplete evidence,nor shall we uphold a dverse credibility determinations based on speculation or conjecture,rather than on evidence in the record.korniejew ashcroft,cir internal citations omitted.
to be eligible for asylum,gjerazi must demonstrate that he was a refugee under a a.see b a.the definition of refugee includes a person unable or unwilling to return to his home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a,at.the statute does not define the term persecution,but we have held in the past that it may include detention,arrest,interrogation,prosecution,imprisonment,illegal searches,confiscation of property,surveillance,beatings,torture,behavior that threatens the same,and behavior such as torture and economic deprivation if the resulting conditions are sufficiently severe.capric ashcroft,cir internal citations omitted.
there are two avenues available to an alien seeking asylum.see.under b,an applicant who successfully proves past persecution is presumed to have a fear of future presumption that the government can rebut by demonstrating a change in the conditions in the applicant homeland.ambati reno,cir see also diallo ashcroft,cir.alternatively,under b,an applicant can affirmatively demonstrate a fear of future persecution if his fear is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable in light of credible evidence.sayaxing ins,cir quoting tzankov ins,cir.while the subjective fear component turns largely upon the applicant own testimony and credibility,id.at,t he objective component requirement can be met either through the production of specific documentary evidence or by credible and persuasive testimony.gonzales,cir quoting balogun ashcroft,cir.the applicant is not required to establish certain persecution should he return or even demonstrate that persecution is highly probable rather,the applicant need only demonstrate that persecution is a reasonable possibility.see,at.fear of persecution is an objectively reasonable awareness of danger the probability of persecution need not rise to the level of proof of more likely than not.one can certainly have a fear of an event happening when there is less than a chance of the occurrence taking place.see also ahmad,at.
proof of past persecution or a fear of future persecution is established,in part,by the information contained in the asylum application,including the alien detailed statements about his mistreatment and other evidence,if available,birth certificates,passports,news articles,photos,hospital records,witnesses affidavits.capric,at.however,in the majority of cases,the applicant supports his application by testifying before the ij about the hardships he endured in his homeland.given the difficulty in directly authenticating or verifying an applicant testimony,an ij is called upon to make a reasoned and thorough credibility determination.a credibility analysis assesses the applicant claim only for internal consistency,detail,and plausibility,typically demonstrated by background evidence concerning general country conditions,if available if determined to be credible,the testimony of an alien alone may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.id.internal citations omitted 
credibility determination 
the general rule in immigration cases is that an asylum applicant whose testimony is otherwise credible need not produce corroborating evidence to support each and every element of his claim.lin ashcroft,cir.this maxim is especially true when,as here,the asylum claim hinges almost exclusively on specific incidents personally involving the applicant and his family.bace ashcroft,cir.as we noted in korniejew ashcroft,immigration judges should not insist on corroborating evidence when common sense and institutional experience suggest that there is none to be had.at.
in his decision,the ij agreed that gjerazi account of his alleged political persecution was plausible and supported by independent state department reports.he also stated that gjerazi and his family have testified consistently with their written applications for asylum.however,he determined that the documents submitted by gjerazi raised serious concerns about gjerazi credibility.in excluding a number of gjerazi corroborating documents,the ij reasoned that the documents were unreliable because the dates on the documents indicated that they were prepared before the gjerazi family fled from albania.the ij found it significant that gjerazi failed to bring the documentation with him when fleeing albania,opting instead to have his send the documents after the family arrived in the 
contrary to the ij reasoning,which is most troubling,it seems illogical to require a family fleeing a country to take precious time to search for and collect documents in order to corroborate an asylum claim.our primary concern is that the ij failed to acknowledge that gjerazi was not anticipating the need for those documents when or after he fled albania.see,grupee gonzales,cir commenting that it would be difficult to anticipate the need for corroborating documentation while attempting to flee.as we pointed out earlier,gjerazi made clear when he testified that he did not flee albania intending to seek asylum in the.as he explained in his asylum hearing,it was not until he and his family arrived in the that they decided to apply for asylum w hen i first got in united states my initial intention was not to stay here.i just wanted to leave the country,but i did know what i was going to do and then later on i realized that i had to apply for the political asylum and there were certain requirements that i had to meet and membership documents and certification so i asked my to get the certification.it would not have made sense for the gjerazis to wait to obtain documentation to corroborate an asylum claim when,at the time of their departure,they had no intention of seeking asylum.furthermore,the ij failed to recognize that gjerazi left albania in secrecy and fear,while a warrant for his arrest was outstanding,making it for
