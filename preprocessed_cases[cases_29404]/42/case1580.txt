in,suarez valenzuela appeared on a peruvian talk show called the lara bazzo show after being recruited by the show investigator,jason.although suarez valenzuela was promised items in exchange for his appearance,he never received them.suarez valenzuela complained to jason,who spoke with bazzo.when bazzo refused to provide the items,suarez valenzuela and jason threatened to report her to a rival television station.
after suarez valenzuela and jason threatened bazzo,four men in a white van approached them to intimidate jason.each of the men possessed weapons and badges identifying himself as a police officer.suarez valenzuela recognized one of the men as luis,a police officer who allegedly worked for bazzo.the men began arguing with suarez valenzuela and jason,and luis hit jason with his gun.jason fell,injured his head,and died moments later.luis then shot suarez valenzuela in the foot.
following the altercation,suarez valenzuela was taken to the hospital and remained there for nearly two weeks.police officers visited him at the hospital and offered him money in exchange for his silence regarding the circumstances of the shooting.suarez valenzuela refused to accept their offer and told the authorities that luis killed jason.
the police asked suarez valenzuela to testify at luis trial for jason murder,and suarez valenzuela agreed.several months before the trial,luis stabbed suarez valenzuela in the chest to prevent him from testifying.nevertheless,suarez valenzuela ultimately testified against luis,who was convicted and sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment,although he served only three months of that sentence.suarez valenzuela testified that he does not know whether luis remained employed as a police officer following his conviction.
after his release,luis went to suarez valenzuela mother house in an attempt to find suarez valenzuela.luis allegedly destroyed the house.suarez valenzuela initially went to live with his grandmother in order to avoid luis.although luis did not confront suarez valenzuela at his grandmother house,suarez valenzuela continues to fear for his safety because he believes that the police can use a national identity database to locate him anywhere in peru.suarez valenzuela left peru for the united states in and illegally entered the united states in january.
following suarez valenzuela departure from peru,luis visited suarez valenzuela mother house several times with another individual and threatened to kill suarez valenzuela.suarez valenzuela explained that he was unaware whether the other individual was a police officer.luis visited the house for the last time in.luis made the same threats to suarez valenzuela father in.
on february,suarez valenzuela was convicted of misdemeanor petit larceny.the department of homeland security dhs subsequently issued an administrative order of removal based on suarez valenzuela conviction and his immigration status.because suarez valenzuela expressed a fear of returning to peru,dhs stayed his removal and conducted a reasonable fear interview.the dhs asylum officer who conducted the interview concluded that suarez valenzuela had demonstrated a reasonable fear of torture.
suarez valenzuela case was referred to an immigration judge.the immigration judge found suarez valenzuela credible and determined that he was subjected to torture when he was shot,stabbed,and threatened.the immigration judge also noted that,according to the state department country reports on human rights practices for peru,the police regularly threaten victims and witnesses of human rights abuses,and the perpetrators of those abuses are rarely punished.although the immigration judge recognized that security forces have developed human rights training,implementation has been slow and security forces are reluctant to provide information about human rights abuses.the immigration judge also found that it was not feasible for suarez valenzuela to relocate within peru due to the country national identity database,which would allow the individuals who tortured him to determine his whereabouts.in light of this information,the immigration judge found that it was more likely than not that government officials would torture suarez valenzuela or acquiesce to his torture if he returned to peru.the judge therefore granted suarez valenzuela application for withholding of removal to peru under the cat.
dhs appealed the immigration judge order granting suarez valenzuela application.on december,the bia sustained the appeal and vacated the immigration judge order.the bia found that the peruvian government attempts to mitigate corruption had created an environment that was not conducive to officials acquiescence to or participation in torture.the bia also noted that suarez valenzuela had not established that luis remained employed as a police officer.finally,the bia held that there was no indication that government officials have used or will use the national identity database to locate and torture witnesses.the government has since removed suarez valenzuela to peru.
suarez valenzuela filed a timely petition for review.on appeal,suarez valenzuela contends that the bia applied the wrong standard when evaluating his case and that substantial evidence did not support its conclusions.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and a.
to qualify for protection under the cat,an applicant bears the burden of showing that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c.in relevant part,the cat implementing regulations define torture as 
any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.
id.a.a public official acquiesces to torture when,prior to the activity constituting torture,he or she ha s awareness of such activity and thereafter breach es his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.id.a.although evidence of past torture is relevant,it does not create a presumption that an applicant will be tortured in the future.see niang gonzalez,cir.instead,immigration judges should consider evidence of past torture,evidence of gross,flagrant or mass violations of human rights,the country conditions,and whether the applicant could relocate to a part of the country where he or she is unlikely to be tortured.c.
this court reviews decisions to deny cat relief for substantial evidence.see dankam gonzalez,cir.under this standard,administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.we will reverse the bia decision only if the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.ins elias zacarias,d see also rusu ins,cir.
we turn first to suarez valenzuela argument that the bia applied the wrong standard when determining whether government officials would acquiesce to his torture.a court of appeals is not generally empowered to conduct a de novo inquiry into the matter be
