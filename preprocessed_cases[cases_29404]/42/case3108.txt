criminal law 
the panel vacated a conviction for attempted illegal reentry under and remanded for entry of a judgment of acquittal.
the panel held that the district court committed plain error affecting the defendant substantial rights by failing to instruct the jury that in order to be found guilty of attempted illegal reentry the defendant must have had the specific intent to reenter the united states free from official restraint.
the panel held that even if the jury applied the correct legal standard,no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of attempted illegal reentry beyond a reasonable doubt.the panel wrote that if properly instructed on the official restraint doctrine,no rational jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was free from official restraint in the area,or that he intended to be simply by entering that area.the panel wrote that there is likewise insufficient evidence in the record to support the defendant guilt on the theory that he intended to go beyond the area so as to be free to go at large and at will within the united states.
sessions,district judge 
rosario appeals his conviction for attempted illegal reentry under on the ground that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction.also notes that the district court instruction at trial failed to properly inform the jury of the essential elements of the offense.
the lack of an instruction to the jury that had to have a conscious desire to reenter the united states free from official restraint to be found guilty of the crime of attempted illegal reentry was plain error.moreover,we conclude that even if the jury applied the correct legal standard,the trial record provides insufficient evidence to allow any rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of attempted illegal reentry beyond a reasonable doubt.therefore,we vacate conviction and remand to the district court to enter a judgment of acquittal.
background 
prior to his conviction,a citizen of mexico,frequently earned money washing car windows at the mariposa port of entry into the united states in nogales,arizona.the inspection station at the mariposa port of entry lies on territory,about yards north of the border with mexico.as a result,the united states invites foreign nationals and citizens traveling in vehicles to enter territory prior to their inspection by immigration officials.pedestrians are invited to enter the area through a separate,designated lane,and are generally not permitted in the vehicle lanes for safety reasons.border patrol agents have on occasion,however,permitted individuals they presume to be citizens to enter the northbound vehicle lanes on foot.although also not officially permitted,vendors and window washers commonly enter the area from mexico on foot,touting their wares and services to stopped vehicles.
the area is walled off on all sides except at the border with mexico and at the mexican and inspection points,and is monitored by hundreds of government cameras.united states outbound operations officers,armed with automatic rifles,monitor southbound lanes north of the mexican government inspection points.law enforcement agents stationed at the border sometimes screen individuals entering the area for those who could pose a safety threat and prevent them from entering the area.
subject to this intermittent screening and control,foreign nationals enter the area on territory on a daily basis,either in vehicles or on foot.occasionally,border patrol agents attempt to arrest and detain individuals present on foot in the area who the agents believe,based on their behavior and appearance,do not have legal status in the united states,without inquiring about their intent to go past the port of entry.when approached by border patrol agents,vendors and other individuals who do not intend to enter the united states beyond the area often flee the area and return to the mexican side of the border.pedestrians attempting to enter the united states without inspection sometimes run up the southbound lanes,bypassing the inspection points.
before his arrest and conviction in,was previously removed from the united states three times,and was once previously convicted of illegal reentry.he was first removed in,before he began his work.since he began working at the mariposa port of entry,he has twice been arrested in the area and subsequently deported,in and.after his arrest,he was charged with illegal reentry and pled guilty to the offense.
around the time he was arrested in,entered the area at the mariposa port of entry to wash windows almost every day,including on the weekends and in the afternoons and evenings.on april,two border patrol agents,agent adam erfert and joshua thomas,saw on surveillance cameras.the agents testified at trial that they became suspicious of intentions because he appeared to be looking around and monitoring his environment,and because of his attentiveness and proximity to the southbound vehicle lanes.the two agents approached and,despite efforts to evade the agents grasp,arrested him.was eventually charged with attempted illegal reentry in violation of in a superseding indictment returned on october.the case proceeded to trial.
at trial,the district court judge instructed the jury on the elements of the offense of illegal reentry in the following manner 
t he government must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt first,the defendant was removed deported from the united states second,the defendant had the conscious desire to reenter the united states without consent third,the defendant was an alien at the time of his attempted reentry into the united states fourth,the defendant had not obtained the consent of the attorney general or the secretary of the department of homeland security to reapply for admission into the united states and fifth,the defendant did something that was a substantial step toward committing the crime.
during the course of argument for a directed verdict,and outside the presence of the jury,the judge stated to counsel that the only question at issue was the defendant intent 
after receiving the instruction on the elements of attempted illegal reentry,the jurors expressed confusion about the intent requirement.the jurors asked,does,as a matter of l aw,illegal reentry into the united states include the element of intent to stay in the united states or is there no mention of such intent in the statute in response,the court referred the jurors to the instruction it had already given on the elements of the offense.did not object to the instructions at trial.
on october,the jury convicted of attempted illegal reentry,the sole count in the superseding indictment.on december,the district court sentenced to months of imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release and imposed a special assessment.filed this timely appeal.
ii.discussion 
improper jury instruction 
although this court generally reviews a jury instruction that misstates the elements of a statutory crime de novo,we review an instruction for plain error in the absence of a timely objection to it below united states kilbride,cir.in order to conclude that plain error exists,we must find an error that is plain and affects substantial rights.id.quoting united states peterson,cir.where these conditions are met,we may only exercise our discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.quoting peterson,at.
plain error 
the district court failure to include an instruction on freedom from official restraint at summation constituted plain error.the fifth and sixth amendments require criminal convictions to rest upon a jury determination that the defendant is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged beyond a reasonable doubt.united states gaudin.jury instructions misstate the essential elements of an offense when they do not adequately link the intent element of a crime with the required object of that intent.see united states,cir.finding plain error because jury instruction did not specify that,where defendant was charged with possession of an unregistered firearm,the jury must find that the defendant knew of the features of his weapon that brought it within the definition of a firearm under the criminal statute,rather than knowing that he had a weapon which happened to have such features,unbeknown to the defendant united states cherer,cir.finding error in jury instructions regarding the elements of a sex crime committed towards a minor where the instruction failed to appropriately connect the requisite state of mind,knowledge,with the statute object,a minor victim.
the crime of attempted illegal reentry under is a specific intent crime that requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the specific intent to reenter without consent.united states,cir.quoting united states,cir.for the purposes of,entry has a distinct legal meaning a n alien has not entered the united states under unless he does so free from official restraint.id.at quoting united states,cir.en banc.accordingly,to convict a defendant of attempted illegal reentry,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant crossed into the united states with the specific intent to enter the country free from official restraint.united states,cir.quoting,at.
the jury instructions here omitted this element of attempted illegal reentry.the district court instructed the jury only that it must find that had the conscious desire to reenter the united states without consent,making no mention of the intent to be free from official restraint.this was plain error 
is not to the contrary.there,this court held that an explanation of the meaning of specific intent is necessary to give guidance as to the proper jury instruction for attempted illegal reentry,at.although did not specifically explain that requires proof that the defendant attempt to enter free from official restraint,there was no dispute concerning whether the defendant in that case was under official restraint,or whether he intended to proceed past the border checkpoint.see id.at.here,in contrast,greater elaboration on the specific intent requirement was necessary because the conditions of the area at the mariposa port of entry,combined with assertion that he did not intend to proceed beyond the inspection points,created ambiguity about intent to reenter free from official restraint.
likewise,our cases finding no error in the omission of a jury instruction on freedom from official restraint when the defendant was found in the united states in violation of do not govern here.see,united states,cir.declining to require a trial judge to instruct a jury on the free from official restraint requirement for entry in a case alleging that the defendant was found in the united states in violation of,where the defendant did not point to evidence that would suggest that his entry was not free from official restraint.but see united states,cir.remanding for new trial where trial judge failed to offer the defendant jury instruction regarding free from official restraint at trial for being found in the united states in violation of,where defendant theory that he was not free from official restraint because he was subject to constant surveillance had a basis in the evidence.we have long recognized that sets forth three distinct offenses enter,attempt to enter,and found in.united states,cir.although an entry,as defined legally,is required before a person is found in the united states,id.at,the government does not need to charge or prove voluntary entry in a found in offense.united states,cir,amended cir.accordingly,because the elements that the government is required to prove in found in cases are not directly parallel to those required to prove attempted illegal reentry,our precedents finding no error where jury instructions did not describe the free from official restraint requirement in found in cases do not bear on the necessary instructions for attempted illegal reentry cases.
ii.the error affected substantial rights 
the lack of a jury instruction regarding freedom from official restraint affected substantial rights.an error affects substantial rights if there is a reasonable probability that the error affected the outcome of the trial.united states marcus.in determining the likelihood that an erroneous instruction affected the outcome of a trial,w e review the jury instructions as a whole,not only the erroneous instructions.we may also examine the arguments made by the parties.united states garrido,cir.internal quotation and citation omitted.moreover,where a jury instruction permits a conviction on either of two alternative theories,one of which is later found to be unconstitutional,the error affects the defendant substantial rights if there is a reasonable probability that the jury convicted the defendant on the invalid theory.id.
here,the government advanced two theories of guilt at summation.the district court instructions permitted the jury to convict on either of those theories.specifically,the government argued that the jury could convict if it found that he had the purpose of illegally reentering the united states,whether it was to make a little money from his window washing business or to scout for traffickers or flee north in the southbound lanes.thus,the prosecution indicated that either entry into the area with the intent to wash windows and then return to mexico,or entry with the intent to move into the united states past the points of inspection,would constitute an entry within the meaning of the intent element of the crime.
our case law clearly does not support the first of those theories.first,the official restraint doctrine was intended to safeguard the presence of uninspected immigrants in precisely the type of area in to which entered and where he remained.the freedom from official restraint requirement addresses the practical concern that failing to require such a finding would lead to the criminalization of individuals who arrive at a port of entry but have not yet had an opportunity to apply for inspection.see,at t he official restraint doctrine is a practical necessity we doubt that congress intended to make criminals out of persons who,for any number of reasons,approach immigration officials at the border.united states vasilatos,cir.explaining that because in a literal and physical sense a person coming from abroad enters the united states whenever he reaches land,water or air space within the territorial limits of this nation,freedom from official restraint must be added to physical presence before entry is accomplished cited with approval in,at.the area at the mariposa port of entry thus serves this function of allowing uninspected foreign nationals to assemble to accomplish a lawful entry.
second,an alien is not free from official restraint when he is in an area that is subject to constant government surveillance,at united states aguilar,cir,superseded by statute on other grounds,stat,as stated in united states,cir.continuous surveillance by immigration authorities can be sufficient to place an alien under official restraint for the purposes of applying the definition of entry to the crime of illegally bringing an alien into the united states.here,the government witnesses testified that the area was subject to surveillance by hundreds of cameras,with small blind spots,and was surrounded on all sides either by walls or law enforcement agents.
the only time that was not under direct camera surveillance was when border patrol agents erfert and thomas were approaching him,with knowledge of his location.such a minor gap in surveillance is not sufficient to break an officer continuous observation necessary to establish official restraint.united states,cir.finding that where border patrol agent observed a defendant from the moment he crossed the border,knew the trail on which the defendant and others were walking,and only lost sight of him for a number of seconds,the defendant was under constant surveillance and therefore not free from official restraint.moreover,attempt to evade arrest by running from the agents is not sufficient to deem him free from official restraint,because he was either s
