we hold that an individual facing prolonged immigration detention under a is entitled to release on bond unless the government establishes that he is a flight risk or a danger to the community.we accordingly reverse the district court denial of petitioner motion for a preliminary injunction.
amadou lamine diouf,a citizen of senegal,was admitted to the united states on a student visa in.the visa expired in june.in december,diouf was found in possession of less than grams of marijuana and charged with a misdemeanor.he pled guilty the following month.
the government initiated removal proceedings against diouf in january,alleging that he was removable because he had remained in the united states after the expiration of his student visa,failed to maintain nonimmigrant status and committed a offense.the immigration judge ij determined that diouf was subject to removal.at diouf request,the judge ordered in lieu of removal that he voluntarily depart from the united states by june.the judge also issued an alternate order of removal and ordered that diouf would be removed to senegal if he did not depart voluntarily by the specified date.diouf waived appeal and posted bond on march.diouf did not petition for review of the voluntary departure order or the alternate removal order.
following his release,diouf retained counsel,hoping to reopen the removal proceedings and adjust his status from nonimmigrant alien to lawful permanent resident based on his planned marriage to a united states citizen.he married on june.although counsel prepared both a motion to reopen the removal proceedings and a request for an extension of the voluntary departure period,he did not file those documents at that time.meanwhile,the deadline for diouf voluntary departure passed.
upon learning that diouf remained in the country beyond the june,departure deadline,immigration and customs enforcement ice sent him a notice requiring him to present himself for removal on september.diouf failed to report as instructed,so ice cancelled his bond,apprehended him at his home on march,and detained him pending execution of the removal order.ice made arrangements for diouf to depart on may,for senegal.when diouf refused to leave on that date,ice continued to detain him.
in late,after obtaining new counsel,diouf filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings,arguing that his first attorney had provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to file a timely motion to reopen after his marriage,to seek an extension of the voluntary departure date and to appeal the voluntary departure order.the ij denied the motion to reopen and the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed.diouf filed a pro se petition for review of that decision in this court and requested a stay of removal.we granted a stay and appointed pro bono counsel to represent him.his petition for review,docketed as,remains pending before another panel of this court.
diouf detention,which began in march,continued throughout this period.to determine whether diouf ongoing detention remained justified,ice conducted custody reviews pursuant to on july,and july.in both instances,ice determined that diouf should remain in custody pending removal because his criminal history and lack of family support suggested he might flee if released.
in november,diouf filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in district court.he requested the court to enter a preliminary injunction for immediate release on the grounds that his lengthy detention violated a and the due process clause of the fifth amendment as an alternative to immediate release,diouf requested a preliminary injunction ordering an immigration judge to hold a hearing at which the government would have the burden of justifying his detention.on january,the district court granted a preliminary injunction requiring a bond hearing before an immigration judge.pursuant to the injunction,the ij conducted a hearing on february,to determine whether diouf prolonged detention remained justified.after receiving evidence from both sides,the immigration judge ruled that diouf did not present a sufficient danger to the community or risk of flight to justify the detention,which by then had extended over months.accordingly,the ij released diouf on bond the same day.
in september,this court vacated the preliminary injunction and remanded to the district court.first,we held that at the time diouf filed his habeas petition,he was detained under a,not a,as diouf and the district court had erroneously assumed.see diouf i,at.second,we held that diouf detention was authorized by statute because,although it was prolonged,it was not indefinite.see id.at.third,we held that the injunction constituted an abuse of discretion insofar as it relied on the erroneous premise that diouf was being detained under a.see id.at.finally,we remanded to the district court to determine in the first instance whether aliens such as diouf,who are detained under a,are entitled to receive bond hearings and to obtain release on bond unless the government proves that they are a danger or a flight risk.id.at dep t of homeland,cir holding that these procedural safeguards apply to aliens detained under a.
on remand,the district court concluded that individuals facing prolonged detention under a are not entitled to a bond hearing and accordingly denied diouf motion for a preliminary injunction.diouf timely appealed.we have jurisdiction under u.a,and we reverse 
standard of review 
we review denial of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.see harris bd.of supervisors,cir.the district court abuses its discretion when it bases its decision on an erroneous legal standard or on clearly erroneous findings of fact.see id.accordingly,whether a requires a bond hearing is a question of law reviewed de novo.
discussion 
we hold that individuals detained under a are entitled to the same procedural safeguards against prolonged detention as individuals detained under a.
when the united states commences removal proceedings against an alien,the attorney general has discretion to detain the alien pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the united states.a if the proceedings result in an order of removal,the attorney general is required to remove the alien from the united states within a period of days,known as the removal period.see id.a a detention during the relatively brief removal period is mandatory.see id.a.the removal period begins on the latest of the date the order of removal becomes administratively final or,if the alien files a petition for review in the court of appeals and the court of appeals orders a stay of removal,the date of the court of appeals final order upholding the order of removal.see id.a b.at all times before the removal period begins and mandatory detention is authorized by a,the alien is subject to discretionary detention under a.
if the alien is not removed during the removal period,continued detention is authorized,in the discretion of the attorney general,by a,the statutory provision at issue here.section a authorizes continued detention beyond the removal period of an alien who has been determined by the attorney general to be a risk to the community or unlikely to comply with the order of removal.id.a.section a encompasses aliens such as diouf,whose collateral challenge to his removal order a motion to reopen is pending in the court of appeals,as well as to aliens who have exhausted all direct and collateral review of their removal orders but who,for one reason or another,have not yet been removed from the united states.
in department of homeland security,f d cir,we addressed the prolonged detention of aliens under a while seeking direct judicial review of their administratively final orders of removal.the petitioner in that case,a legal permanent resident,had been detained in,when the government commenced removal proceedings against him based on his having been convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude.see id.at.the petitioner remained in detention for the next seven years.over that time span,an immigration judge issued an order of removal,the bia affirmed the order,the petitioner filed a petition for review of the removal order in this court and we granted the petition and remanded the matter to the bia.see id.at.the petitioner ultimately filed a habeas petition,arguing that his prolonged detention without a meaningful opportunity to contest the necessity of continued detention violated his right to procedural due process.id.we determined that his habeas petition had merit.first,we concluded that in the context of civil immigration proceedings,prolonged detention without adequate procedural protections would raise serious constitutional concerns.id.at.second,applying the canon of constitutional avoidance to address those concerns,we held as a matter of statutory interpretation that a requires the attorney general to provide aliens with a bond hearing before an immigration judge to determine the necessity of their ongoing detention.see id.at we concluded that an alien is entitled to release on bond unless the government establishes that he is a flight risk or will be a danger to the community.id.at quoting tijani willis,cir.
we now extend to aliens detained under a.we find no basis for withholding from aliens detained under a the same procedural safeguards accorded to aliens detained under a.as was the case in,prolonged detention under a,without adequate procedural protections,would raise serious constitutional concerns,at.to address those concerns,we apply the canon of constitutional avoidance and construe a as requiring an individualized bond hearing,before an immigration judge,for aliens facing prolonged detention under that provision.see id.at.such aliens are entitled to release on bond unless the government establishes that the alien is a flight risk or will be a danger to the community.see id.
the government brief offers several arguments for treating aliens facing prolonged detention under a differently from those detained under a.we address these arguments in turn,but find none persuasive.
direct versus collateral review 
the government primary argument for treating a detainees differently from a detainees is that the former are detained while seeking direct judicial review of administratively final orders of removal whereas the latter are detained while seeking collateral review of final orders of removal through motions to reopen.according to the government,this distinction matters in two ways first,an alien who is subject to a final order of removal and who is merely attacking removal collaterally has a weaker liberty interest in being free from governmental detention than one who is challenging a removal order on direct review and,second,the government has a stronger interest in detaining an alien who is collaterally attacking a removal order because the alien is closer to the point of actual,physical removal from the united states.as we shall explain,these distinctions may have some marginal validity,but they do not justify disparate treatment of a detainees.
detainees liberty interest 
the government may be correct that at the margin,a detainees have a lesser liberty interest in freedom from detention unlike a a detainee,a a detainee is subject to a final order of removal and is thus,at least as a theoretical matter,closer to actual removal from the united states.this difference in status may matter.see zadvydas davis,stating that the nature of the due process protection an alien is due may vary depending upon status and circumstance demore kim,souter,concurring in part and dissenting in part arguing that aliens detained under c should be afforded greater procedural protections than those detained under a because the latter have already been ordered removed and therefore enjoy no lawful immigration status id.at suggesting that persons detained pending removal proceedings have a stronger claim than those detained after entry of a removal order.but the government makes too much of this distinction.regardless of the stage of the proceedings,the same important interest is at from prolonged detention.the liberty interests of persons detained under a are comparable to those of persons detained under a.
minimizing a detainees liberty interests also understates the importance of motions to reopen in safeguarding immigrants rights.as the supreme court has explained,t he purpose of a motion to reopen is to ensure a proper and lawful disposition of an alien claims it is an important safeguard of the alien rights.dada mukasey,emphasis added.motions to reopen afford aliens a means to challenge in absentia removal orders,to set aside removal orders when an underlying conviction upon which the removal was based has been vacated,to raise as in diouf case a claim that the removal order resulted from ineffective assistance of counsel and to raise an argument that new developments would show that removal to a particular country would result in torture or persecution.see amicus br.of immigrant justice ctr.at.
the government interest 
the government also may be correct that it has a marginally greater interest in detaining a detainees than a detainees.the primary purpose of a is assuring the alien presence at the moment of removal.zadvydas,at.this interest strengthens as actual removal from the united states becomes closer in time and more certain to occur.in part,this is because an alien incentive to flee may increase as the removal date approaches.
the distinctions between a and a,however,are not substantial enough to justify denying a bond hearing to all aliens subject to extended detention under a.first,the government has an interest in ensuring that aliens are available for removal if their legal challenges do not succeed whether they are detained under a or a.second,in either circumstance,the government interest in the prompt removal of aliens who have exhausted their legal challenges is served by the bond hearing process itself.if the alien poses a flight risk,detention is permitted.
third,the same concerns about prolonged detention arise irrespective of whether an alien has petitioned for review of an order of removal direct review or an order denying a motion to reopen collateral review.in both situations,it may take years for the petitions for review to be resolved.diouf petition for review from the bia decision denying his motion to reopen,for example,was filed in and remains pending than four years later.thus,although aliens detained pending collateral review may on average be somewhat closer to removal than those detained pending direct review,detention under both circumstances raises substantially the same due process concerns.fourth,although aliens detained under a may on average be less likely to succeed in setting aside their orders of removal,their motions to reopen certainly may succeed,and in many cases do.it is thus far from certain that a detainees such as diouf will be removed.
of course,an alien status,as well as the stage of the proceedings,may be relevant to an immigration judge assessment of whether detention is necessary to ensure an alien availability for removal.as an alien hopes of setting aside a removal order fade,the risk of flight may increase.in the same vein,changed circumstances may justify the revocation of release that at one time was properly granted.nonetheless,although these factors are important enough for an immigration judge to consider at bond hearings,they do not warrant categorically denying to a detainees the right to a bond hearing that a detainees already enjoy.
in sum,although there are shades of difference,a detainees and a detainees are similarly situated.both may be detained for prolonged periods both may succeed in setting aside their orders of removal and both may be detained without bond when necessary to ensure their availability for removal.
legal permanent resident status 
the government also posits that is distinguishable because diouf was an admitted alien before he was ordered removed,whereas the alien in was a legal permanent resident.the government may be correct that legal permanent residents,or lprs,are entitled to greater due process protections than other aliens.see demore,at souter,concurring in part and dissenting in part w e have accorded l
