giuli ivanishvili ivanishvili or petitioner petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia or board that summarily affirmed an immigration judge ij decision rejecting her application for asylum as untimely and denying her application for statutory withholding of removal and her request for withholding under the convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman,or degrading treatment or punishment,res,doc.cat or convention.she alleges she was persecuted in her country of origin because she is a member of an ethnic and religious minority group and asserts that,if returned,she will face further persecution and possibly torture.we believe the facts of petitioner case merit more careful attention by the immigration court than has been afforded thus far,and we therefore remand for reconsideration.
background 
petitioner is a woman from the republic of georgia.although her mother is georgian,petitioner father was originally from south ossetia,a region along the border of georgia and russia,and petitioner considers herself ethnically ossetian.following georgia independence from the soviet union in,south ossetia attempted to secede from georgia,which led to a civil war and the eventual occupation of south ossetia by a regional peacekeeping force in.as a result of the danger to ossetians in georgia during this period,petitioner changed her name to ivanishvili her mother maiden name from gagloshvili her father name to avoid identification as an ossetian.petitioner became a jehovah witness in.
ivanishvili entered the united states on december,on a valid visa that permitted her to remain lawfully in the united states until june.she overstayed this visa.in january,she allegedly paid to an individual named alexey alabushev to file an application for asylum on her behalf.according to ivanishvili,alabushev did not file the application and disappeared without providing her with any receipts or correspondence.in september,ivanishvili allegedly paid another to one tony lan to file an asylum application on her behalf.lan provided petitioner with unsigned receipts,but filed a fraudulent application for a student visa instead of an asylum application.ivanishvili obtained reputable legal counsel in and filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal on july.
in her application,ivanishvili asserted that she suffered severe mistreatment and physical abuse in georgia for being a jehovah witness and ossetian,and stated that she feared future harm and torture in the event of my return to georgia.specifically,petitioner contended that,due to her ethnicity,she suffered humiliation,harassment and even beatings and was denied educational and employment opportunities to which she was entitled.during the civil war in ossetia,petitioner alleged her family was subjected to violence and intimidation at the hands of georgian nationalists and soldiers,and that georgian nationalists vandalized her home by throwing rocks through her windows.she also stated that as late as august,shortly before leaving georgia for the united states,her neighbors assaulted her and threatened further harm if she did not leave georgia and move to ossetia.
petitioner also alleged severe abuse and mistreatment because of her religion.she reported three separate occasions in and when military or police officials accosted her and her fellow worshipers during religious meetings.the officers reportedly beat petitioner,called the worshipers d amn s ectarians,and threatened to kill them.petitioner also alleged that unknown parties vandalized her place of worship in,painting death to sectarians on the wall.
the immigration and naturalization service ins initiated removal proceedings against petitioner by a notice to appear served on august.at her hearing before the ij,ivanishvili conceded removability but sought asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under cat for the reasons stated in her application.in support,ivanishvili submitted numerous documents to the ij,including articles from news sources and organizations detailing the adverse treatment to which ossetians and religious minorities have been subjected in georgia and the state department country report country report on human rights practices in georgia.
ivanishvili testimony regarding religious persecution was consistent with the statements in her asylum application.petitioner did not testify in detail about the reported incidents of ethnic persecution,but did relate an incident from september when armed georgian soldiers allegedly broke into her apartment,beat her with clubs,and threatened to kill her if she did not leave georgia and move to ossetia.as a result of this incident,ivanishvili testified that she moved in with her mother and sought out the jehovah witnesses for spiritual guidance.
the ij issued an oral decision on december,denying petitioner application for asylum and withholding of removal and her request for relief under cat and granting her voluntary departure from the united states.the ij ruled petitioner asylum application was not timely and that she could not prove extraordinary circumstances justifying her failure to timely file.the ij further concluded that petitioner application for statutory withholding of removal was without merit.he questioned ivanishvili testimony because it was relatively general,and because she failed to include the most severe incident of harm based on her september attack by georgian her asylum application.while conceding that the documentary evidence submitted by petitioner,including the state department country report,demonstrated that severe problems exist for ossetians in georgia,the ij nonetheless concluded that the harassment that has been indicated would not constitute persecution within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act.finally,the ij found no evidence that ivanishvili faced a likelihood of torture if returned to georgia and denied her cat claim.
petitioner appealed to the bia on january.in support of her appeal,ivanishvili submitted additional affidavits and news reports substantiating her accounts of abuse,discrimination,and violence against ossetians and jehovah witnesses in georgia.she did not address the ij adverse decision on her cat claim.the board affirmed the ij decision without opinion on january,and ivanishvili petitioned this court for review.
discussion 
i standard of review 
ordinarily we review bia decisions,but when the bia summarily adopts an ij decision as the final agency determination,we review the ij decision directly.ins,cir.an ij factual determinations are upheld if supported by substantial evidence,see,zhang ins,cir,a standard that is slightly stricter than the review we apply to the factual determinations of district courts,but nonetheless one that allows only very narrow grounds for reversal.qiu ashcroft,cir see melgar de torres reno,cir describing the scope of such review as exceedingly narrow.indeed,we will overturn the ij or bia factual determinations only if a reasonable factfinder would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.see zhang,at.
despite these limitations,we retain substantial authority to vacate bia or ij decisions and remand for reconsideration or rehearing if the immigration court has failed to apply the law correctly or if its findings are not supported by record evidence.see qiu,at.moreover,it is not our task to search the record for reasons why a decision of the ij or bia should be affirmed rather,the immigration court must adequately link its decision to the record evidence in a reasoned opinion that properly applies the law,and if the ij reasoning proves inadequate for denying a petitioner claim,we will not hesitate to reverse,at.
ivanishvili asserts on appeal that the ij erred in rejecting her asylum application as untimely and in denying her requests for statutory withholding of removal and withholding under the cat.she also contends the ij erred by not considering the documentary evidence she submitted at her hearing and that the bia abused its discretion by failing to consider the additional documentary evidence petitioner submitted on appeal.
in our view,the ij denial of ivanishvili application for withholding of removal is based on reasoning that,in light of the record,is insufficient for us to permit meaningful review of the decision.we therefore vacate the bia decision insofar as it summarily affirmed the ij denial of petitioner application for withholding and remand to the bia with instructions to vacate that portion of the decision and remand it to the ij for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.in all other respects,we affirm the ij decision.
ii petitioner application for asylum 
we turn first to the ij rejection of ivanishvili asylum application.an alien seeking asylum must apply within one year of her last arrival in the united states or april,whichever is later.see a b a ii.because ivanishvili arrived in the united states on december,she was entitled to have the limit run from april,and should have filed her asylum application by april.petitioner asylum application was not filed until july,more than two years after the regulatory deadline.the ij thus rejected the application as untimely we conclude that petitioner claim can not succeed because she has not complied with the procedural requirements for asserting that extraordinary circumstances excuse her failure to timely file.ineffective assistance of counsel is one such extraordinary circumstance,see a iii,but in order to make such a claim,an alien must file an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to the respondent in this regard inform counsel of the allegations and allow him an opportunity to respond and file a complaint against counsel with appropriate disciplinary authorities,or explain why she has not done so.id.
ivanishvili contends that she paid alexey alabushev to file an asylum application on her behalf in january,before the regulatory deadline,but alabushev did not file the application and absconded with her money.petitioner therefore contends that her failure to timely file was the result of ineffective assistance of counsel.her supporting affidavit,however,simply states that in january she went to an office called immigration service in brooklyn,new york to seek help with filing an asylum application,that she paid alabushev,and that she discovered in april or may that the office was closed and no application had been filed.the affidavit does not contain details about petitioner arrangement with alabushev,including what services he promised,when he intended to file the application,or what evidence petitioner provided to alabushev in support of the application.
moreover,in her testimony and supporting affidavit,ivanishvili offered no evidence that she attempted to determine alabushev whereabouts after he disappeared or attempted to inform him of her ineffective assistance claim.she also did not file a complaint with any disciplinary authority and her proffered reason for not doing she was illegal here and was afraid of doing any move sic if accepted,would effectively excuse all illegal aliens from the complaint requirement.petitioner did not satisfy the prerequisites for bringing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and therefore could not demonstrate extraordinary circumstances excusing her failure to timely file.
iii petitioner application for withholding of removal 
when an applicant is ineligible to apply for asylum due to the time restrictions set forth in a b,the asylum application is construed as an application for withholding of removal.b.to qualify for withholding,the applicant must establish that her life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal on the basis of one of five statutory grounds,race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b a see b ramsameachire ashcroft,cir.if the applicant establishes that she suffered past persecution on the basis of one such statutory ground,eligibility for withholding is presumed,subject to rebuttal.b see,at.the applicant alternatively may qualify for withholding if she can show that it is more likely than not that she would be persecuted on the basis of a statutory ground.b see melgar,at stating that withholding of removal requires a clear probability that the applicant will suffer persecution if returned to the country of removal,that it is more likely than not that she would be subject to persecution.it is worth noting as well that the concept of persecution inheres in the analysis of both asylum and withholding of removal,but it is the burden of proving persecution that differentiates the two,with the latter demanding the more exacting standard.see zhang,at noting the two forms of relief are factually related but with a heavier burden for withholding see also ins stevic,d establishing a clear probability standard for withholding of removal claims ins,d distinguishing between the broad class of refugees subject to discretionary asylum relief and the subcategory of that class entitled to withholding of removal relief.
while the real id act of,stat,has amended both the withholding of removal and asylum statutes explicitly by addressing burden of proof and credibility determinations in their respective contexts,see id.a,c codified at b b,b c,these amendments do not affect petitioner application,which was filed before their effective date,see id.h.
petitioner alleged in the case before us two statutory grounds for withholding of removal,ethnic persecution and religious persecution.her primary evidentiary support for ethnic persecution was her testimony regarding past persecution at the hands of georgian nationalists and government officials and documentary materials about human rights practices in georgia.her primary evidentiary support for religious persecution similarly consisted of her own testimony and background documentary materials showing persecution of jehovah witnesses in georgia.finding her evidentiary support unpersuasive,the immigration court rejected both of her claims.
with respect to ethnic persecution,the ij found that her testimonial evidence and her application were relatively general,meaning that in his view they failed to give sufficient detail about the alleged acts of ethnic persecution.the ij also questioned petitioner credibility because her application failed to mention the most severe incident of ethnic persecution,the september abuse by military officials.finally,the ij found that although the documentary materials proved that there was,in fact,a war between georgia and ossetia and that t here were severe problems between the two ethnic groups,nonetheless,members of her ethnic group were able to return to georgia.with regard to religious persecution,relying on the state department country report and other background evidence,the ij held that although the documentary materials establish ed that there are problems with harassment of jehovah witnesses in georgia,the harassment that has been indicated would not constitute persecution within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act.the ij then denied,without further discussion,petitioner claims under the withholding of removal statute.
the ij discussion of the important claims raised by petitioner does not permit adequate review by this court and therefore requires a remand for further consideration.as noted above,we will vacate the bia or ij conclusions as to the existence or likelihood of persecution insofar as the bia either has not applied the law correctly,or has not supported its findings with record evidence.qiu,at.this means that errors found pursuant to our de novo review of the ij application of law are not necessarily excused because the ij decision might have been reasonable if the error had not been made.it also means that our deferential review of the ij factual findings does not require us to seek alternative grounds for affirmance where the grounds set forth by the ij are insufficient.id.in this case,the ij failed both to support its findings with adequate record evidence and to apply correctly the relevant law.
as to the ij application of law,its opinion failed to distinguish adequately betw
