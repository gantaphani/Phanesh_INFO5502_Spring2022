melake zerai ghebrehiwot,a pentecostal christian who is a citizen of eritrea,petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals affirming without opinion the immigration judge denial of his applications for asylum,withholding of removal and relief under article of the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat.for the reasons that follow,we will grant the petition and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual background 
ghebrehiwot traveled to the united states from sweden as a visitor for pleasure under the visa waiver program,on december.he was denied admission because he presented a false italian passport that had been manufactured for him.after being referred to an immigration judge he sought relief from removal by petitioning for asylum,withholding of removal and relief under the cat.
ghebrehiwot was born in asmara,eritrea in,and is one of eight children.his parents and all of his siblings still live in eritrea.before he left eritrea,ghebrehiwot had attended a university where he trained to become a teacher.
after living in sudan for a number of years,ghebrehiwot traveled to sweden and then to the united states with the assistance of a person named,abraham.ghebrehiwot testified that abraham gave him the false italian passport he presented upon attempting to enter the united states.ghebrehiwot used that passport to travel from sweden to the united states abraham bought ghebrehiwot airline ticket and told him to come to the united states.abraham instructed ghebrehiwot to return the passport to him if admitted without any problems,and he instructed ghebrehiwot to apply for asylum if asked about the fake italian passport.ghebrehiwot did just that when he encountered a problem at the airport.during the ensuing airport interview,ghebrehiwot said that he feared returning to eritrea because he had fled to sudan while a soldier in the eritrean army.he also said that he had been mistreated in sudan because of his religion.when asked if he feared returning to eritrea or the country of last residence,ghebrehiwot answered yes,because they do know me as a eritrean.i do have nothing.if i go home and i show them where i live and they find out that i fled to sudan they will kill me.
on his application for asylum,ghebrehiwot listed both political opinion and religion as the basis for asylum and withholding of removal.he explained as follows when asked about fearing torture as amnesty international is concerned that if i returned back i will be at serious risk of human right violations by the government like hard detention will follow in sudan,due to religious practicing as before i will suffer until killed by the sudan government.in his application,ghebrehiwot stated that he is a member of the pentecostal rhema church in asmara.
at the hearing before the immigration judge,ghebrehiwot testified that his schooling was cut short because he was drafted into the eritrean army in.however,he admitted that he had practiced his pentecostal religion without any problems while in his home country before being conscripted into the army.he also admitted that his family had not experienced any problems in eritrea.he had heard from his family after leaving eritrea,while he was still living in sudan.
during the hearing,the immigration judge asked ghebrehiwot whether his family told him anything important he wished to tell the court the government claims that ghebrehiwot told the ij that he forgot.however,ghebrehiwot claims that the government has misstated the record.according to him,the interpreter said that he had forgotten something and ghebrehiwot responded that his family had provided him with documentary information.
ghebrehiwot claimed that being drafted into the eritrean army was tantamount to mistreatment because he was young and had not finished school.he had been drafted during a war between eritrea and ethiopia.after being drafted,he was stationed on the border between ethiopia and sudan.he claimed that approximately a month after being drafted,he and seven other eritrean soldiers were forced to flee into sudan when the advancing ethiopian forces penetrated to the eritrean border.ghebrehiwot claimed that once he was in sudan,they could not return to eritrea because ethiopian forces continued to occupy the border.
in sudan,ghebrehiwot and the others met a fellow eritrean who took them to khartoum,the capital city.there,ghebrehiwot was taken in by pastor josieth and became part of a protestant christian community.ghebrehiwot continued to live in sudan although he never obtained legal residency there.he testified that he never applied for legal residency because in order to be able to request that,one must have a passport.
ghebrehiwot explained that,although christians live in sudan,it is an islamic country,and he was protestant.ghebrehiwot claimed that,in june,while he was still living in sudan,members of the sudanese army took him from the church he was attending,detained him in an underground jail,and drastically limited his access to food and sanitation facilities.while detained,he and four others were beaten with a hard plastic object.he claimed that,as a result of the beating,his leg was injured,and he was taken to a hospital for one maximum time allowed for a hospital receive stitches.according to his testimony,he was then immediately returned to detention where he was denied access to any additional treatment or medication.
ghebrehiwot was released from prison with the assistance of people working with the eritrean liberation front elf,an exiled party working in opposition to the eritrean government.he claimed that he was released on condition that he and the others would stop practicing christianity.upon his release,the elf loyalists gave him an identification card that was valid for months.however,according to his testimony,that card was never renewed because he did not participate in elf activities due to his religious beliefs.
following his release,he continued living with the sudanese pastor,and worshiping in private.according to ghebrehiwot,while he was in the care of pastor josieth and unable to return to eritrea,legislation was enacted in eritrea that limited the right to practice any but four officially recognized religions.in may,the eritrean government ordered all houses of worship,that were not either eritrean orthodox,roman catholic,lutheran or islamic,to close.according to ghebrehiwot,after that legislation was enacted,the eritrean government systematically rounded up and tortured hundreds of members of nonsanctioned religions,including pentecostals.he said that his eritrean pastor was arrested,held incommunicado,and was in danger of being tortured solely because he did not observe one of the sanctioned religions.
according to ghebrehiwot,the eritrean government also banned adherents of all other religions from governmental positions and it also attempted to purge them from the military.he also testified about individual acts of oppression including subjecting teenage protestant soldiers to torture and imprisoning them in metal containers because they were caught carrying bibles and threatening,beating and incarcerating pentecostal soldiers who refused to renounce their beliefs and return to the eritrean orthodox church.ghebrehiwot claimed that the eritrean government also stepped up its campaign against political dissidents.
ghebrehiwot testified that some of the former soldiers who retreated with him to sudan managed to apply for asylum in malta.however,the maltese authorities rejected their claims and returned them to eritrea where they were detained and held incommunicado.although they were never formally charged,the eritrean president publicly stated that he considered these detainees traitors and spies.that they were then tortured so badly that some were paralyzed,and others were killed.
ghebrehiwot also explained that he feared returning to eritrea because he could have been tortured or killed.he based this fear upon what he claimed happened to others who left the eritrean army and were subsequently returned by the maltese government.he explained that the torture they were subjected to included detention in a style called helicopter and some of them were paralyzed and others faced death because they left eritrea.
ghebrehiwot maintained his fear was justified even though he conceded that,to the best of his knowledge,his brother who is also pentecostal,continues to live and worship in eritrea without experiencing any repression.
ghebrehiwot submitted news articles and country condition reports during his hearing before the ij.some of those reports tell of deserters who sought refugee status in other countries,including sudan.in one article,amnesty international quoted a former deserter who was returned from malta as saying he had been tortured upon return to eritrea.
ii.proceedings before the ij and the bia.
the immigration judge denied ghebrehiwot claim without making a credibility determination.her decision was based upon her conclusion that the evidence ghebrehiwot presented did not establish eligibility for any relief.the ij believed that ghebrehiwot fear of returning to eritrea arose from his desertion from the army,and prosecution for desertion does not ordinarily constitute persecution for immigration purposes the ij acknowledged that legally justified prosecution can be so severe that it rises to the level of persecution and an alien may therefore establish that is a refugee if the unduly harsh treatment is based upon race,religion,nationality,or membership in a social or political group.nonetheless,the ij ruled that since ghebrehiwot had not established that his fear of prosecution for desertion was based upon any of those protected traits,he was not entitled to any relief.
the ij rejected ghebrehiwot claim of refugee status based upon religious persecution because he had never experienced problems in eritrea related to his faith,and his brother remained in eritrea where he continued to observe his religion without any problems.although the ij noted that the background materials and reports ghebrehiwot introduced did show some conflict between the various religious groups in eritrea,the ij concluded that the background material is not supportive of the facts presented she reasoned that ghebrehiwot was never a target of the government in eritrea and therefore the evidence did not support a finding that his subjective fear was reasonable.id.
after concluding that ghebrehiwot was not entitled to asylum,the ij denied withholding of removal and relief under the cat.her only explanation for doing so was as follows the court must necessarily deny the applicant request for withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture which require a more stringent evidentiary burden than asylum.
the bia affirmed without opinion,and this petition for review followed.
iii.standard of review 
where the bia affirms the ij decision without opinion,we review the decision of the ij as if it were the decision of the bia.zhang gonzales,cir.we review the ij denial of relief to determine if the conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.ins,d.ina b b provides that administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.thus,if the applicant seeks to obtain judicial reversal of the denial of asylum,he must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite likelihood of persecution,at.under this standard,a finding will stand if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence in the record when considered as a whole.ins,cir citation and internal quotations omitted.the same standard applies to the bia denial of ghebrehiwot claim for withholding of removal.to reverse the decision below,we must find that the record not only supports that conclusion,but compels it,at.finally,since the ij did not make an adverse credibility determination here,we proceed as if the alien testimony was credible.kayembe ashcroft,cir.
iv.general legal principles 
asylum and withholding of removal.
the attorney general has discretion to grant asylum to a removable alien.see a.however,that discretion can only be exercised if the alien first establishes that is a refugee.id.a refugee is 
any person who is outside any country of such person nationality or,in the case of a person having no nationality,is outside of any country in which such person last habitually resided,and who is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.
a a.the asylum applicant must therefore present some evidence that removal will result in persecution on account of one of the five statutory grounds in order to establish eligibility for asylum.
an applicant who offers credible testimony regarding past persecution is presumed to have a fear of future persecution.berishaj ashcroft,cir citation omitted.the fear of persecution standard involves both a subjectively genuine fear of persecution and an objectively reasonable possibility of persecution.ins,d.the subjective prong requires a showing that the fear is genuine.mitev ins,cir.the objectively reasonable prong requires ascertaining whether a reasonable person in the alien circumstances would fear persecution if returned to a given country.zubeda ashcroft,cir citation omitted.
to satisfy the objective prong,the asylum petitioner must show he or she would be individually singled out for persecution or that there is a pattern or practice in his or her country of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.sukwanputra gonzales,cir quoting b iii a.although applicable regulations do not define a pattern or practice,we have explained that the persecution of the group must be systematic,pervasive,or organized,to constitute a pattern or practice.id.citation omitted.in addition,as with any claim of persecution,the acts must be committed by the government or forces the government is either unable or unwilling to control.id.citation omitted.
withholding of removal is mandatory once the attorney general determines that the alien life or freedom would be threatened because of a protected trait or activity b a.to obtain such relief,an alien must establish a clear probability,that it is more likely than not,that would suffer persecution.see ins stevic,d.because this standard is higher than that governing eligibility for asylum,an alien who fails to qualify for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal.zubeda,at.
relief under the convention against torture.
as noted earlier,ghebrehiwot also sought protection under article of the cat.the cat became binding on the united states in november of when president clinton delivered the ratifying documents to the united nations.doc.iv convention.the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of farra implemented the cat.section,div.stat,codified at.that legislation requires that n o state expel,return refouler or extradite a person to another state where he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.id.accordingly,it shall be the policy of the united states not to expel or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture id.
an applicant for relief under article of the convention against torture bears the burden of establishing that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.sevoian ashcroft,cir quoting c.the united states senate specified this standard,as well as many of the other standards that govern relief under the convention,in several understandings that it imposed on the united states ratification of the convention against torture.id.at citations omitted.unlike asylum or withholding of removal,the cat has no subjective component,but instead requires the alien to establish,by objective evidence,that he is entitled to relief.id.citation and internal quotations omitted.the alien testimony,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.mansour ins,cir citing c.if an alien meets his or her burden of proof,withholding of removal or deferring of removal is mandatory.ina b.
under the applicable implementing regulations torture is defined as an act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession,punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed,or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person,or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind,when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.
a.the regulations also provide 
in assessing whether it is more likely than not that an applicant would be tortured in the proposed country of removal,all evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture shall be considered,including,but not limited to 
i evidence of past torture inflicted upon the applicant 
ii evidence that the applicant could relocate to a part of the country of removal where he or she is not likely to be tortured 
iii evidence of gross,flagrant or mass violations of human rights within the country of removal,where applicable and 
iv other relevant information regarding conditions in the country of removal.
c.in determining whether relief under the cat is warranted,country conditions alone can play a decisive role in granting relief and the relevant statutory and regulatory language does not require that the prospective risk of torture be on account of certain protected grounds.kamalthas ins,cir.
however,i t is significant that even cruel and inhuman behavior by government officials may not implicate the torture regulations.sevoian,at.torture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel and inhuman treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.c i.moreover,the bia has held that torture covers intentional governmental acts,not negligent acts or acts by private individuals not acting on behalf of the government.in re,wl bia.finally,t orture does not include pain or suffering arising only from,inherent in,or incidental to,lawful sanctions.lawful sanctions include judicially imposed sanctions and other enforcement actions authorized by law,including the death penalty,but do not include sanctions that defeat the object and purpose of the convention against torture to prohibit torture.a.
discussion 
ghebrehiwot makes a number of arguments in support of his petition for review.each is discussed separately below 
ghebrehiwot fear of persecution 
an alien may demonstrate that fear of persecution is objectively reasonable by documentary or expert evidence about the conditions in a given country.lusingo gonzales,cir.ghebrehiwot claims that the ij finding that he did not establish a fear of persecution based on his religion was error.he argues that his documentary evidence was itself sufficient to establish a pattern and practice of religious persecution of members of the pentecostal religion beginning after he fled to sudan in november,
ghebrehiwot cites the state department international religious freedom report report which noted that in september,the secretary of state designated eritrea as a country of particular concern under the international religious freedom act for particularly severe violations of religious freedom.report,at.the report includes the following statement about the eritrean government 
the government poor respect for religious freedom for minority religious groups continued to decline during the period covered by this report.the government harassed,arrested,and detained members of pentecostal and other independent evangelical groups and reform movements from and within the eritrean orthodox church,and jehovah witnesses.there were also numerous reports of physical torture and attempts at forced recantations.following a may government decree that all religious groups must register or cease all religious activities,the government closed all religious facilities not belonging to the four sanctioned religions.these closures,the government refusal to authorize any registrations,and the restriction on holding religious meetings continued throughout the period covered by this report.
in addition to the report,ghebrehiwot submitted approximately thirty different articles which he contends document the eritrean government systematic persecution of adherents of disfavored religions,including pentecostals.he claims that the articles recite incidents of the government breaking up pentecostal weddings and arresting everyone identified as a pente.this includes locking up children in metal shipping containers for carrying bibles,arresting hundreds of adults and children simply for being members of an evangelical or pentecostal church,and torturing members of disfavored religious groups until they signed statements repudiating their faith.he notes that one of the articles reported that his pastor was among the detainees arrested and held incommunicado in an effort force him to abandon his faith.
in ghebrehiwot view,these materials establish a pattern and practice of persecution of members of the pentecostal religion thus,he concludes that because he has presented evidence that he is a pentecostal and that there is a pattern and practice of persecution of pentecostals in eritrea,he has demonstrated a fear of future persecution.
the government argues that ghebrehiwot documentary evidence does not support a finding of a pattern and practice of religious persecution of pentecostal christians by the eritrean government.the government also notes that ghebrehiwot brother is also a pentecostal christian,and has remained in eritrea without experiencing religious persecution.in the government view,this undermines ghebrehiwot claim.see,krasnopivtsev ashcroft,cir the reasonableness of a fear of persecution is diminished when family members remain in the native country unharmed,and the applicant himself had not been singled out for abuse.
the government concedes that the state department report establishes that the state department views eritrea as a country of concern,but it argues that the concern does not rest on religious persecution.it contends the evidence shows instances of arrests and detention of journalists,government critics,and members of religious groups,as well as registered religious groups.the documentary evidence also refers to repression of academic freedom and states that the military may be acting independently of the government.in short,the government contends that the materials establish a regime that takes repressive action against those it considers dissidents,but this does not establish a pattern and practice of religious persecution of pentecostal christians.
in addition,the government suggests that ghebrehiwot evidence merely obfuscates the issue because it establishes that any religion other than the four religions,is referred to as pentecostal or pente by factions in the government.the government contends that discrimination on the basis of race or religion,although reprehensible,does not automatically establish persecution.ghaly ins,cir.
as noted above,in rejecting ghebrehiwot claim,the ij observed that there appeared to be some conflict between the various religious groups,but concluded that the background material is not supportive of the facts presented the ij considered ghebrehiwot documentary evidence and his testimony and concluded that ghebrehiwot had not demonstrated a fear of persecution.
the ij focused on the absence of evidence of past persecution before ghebrehiwot left eritrea.however,the ij failed to address the report and the other materials ghebrehiwot submitted that could easily demonstrate an objective basis for a fear of futu
