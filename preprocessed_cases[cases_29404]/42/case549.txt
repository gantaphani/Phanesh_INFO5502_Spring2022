under former section c of the immigration and nationality act ina,the attorney general had authority to grant a discretionary waiver of deportation to aliens who have accrued seven years of lawful permanent residence in the united states.ina c,c repealed.the statute,however,barred application of the waiver provision to an alien who has been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies and has served for such felony or felonies a term of imprisonment of at least years.id.this case presents the question whether an alien aggravated felon,serving a state prison sentence of twelve or more years,whose application for a section c waiver was delayed for several years by an erroneous agency legal interpretation so that he had served more than five years of his felony sentence by the time he could proceed with the waiver application,is now barred by law from seeking a waiver.
background 
the facts are not in dispute.petitioner ramiro fernandes pereira pereira,who is a citizen of portugal,was admitted to the united states on march,as a lawful permanent resident.on july,he pleaded nolo contendere in rhode island superior court to first degree child molestation and first degree sexual assault.the court sentenced him to thirty years imprisonment,with twelve years to serve,eighteen years suspended and eighteen years probation.
on october,the immigration and naturalization service ins initiated deportation proceedings against pereira,charging him with being deportable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony,pursuant to what is now section a a iii of the ina,a a iii.on october,after a hearing,the ij found that pereira had been convicted of an aggravated felony and,therefore,ordered him deported.the ij noted that pereira sought relief under former c of the ina.he found,however,that pereira was statutorily ineligible for c relief because d of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa effective april,which amended section c to read that it would not apply to an alien who was deportable for having committed an aggravated felony,applied retroactively to pereira.
pereira appealed to the bia,arguing,inter alia,that d of aedpa should not be applied retroactively to him because his conviction had occurred before its enactment.on january,the bia affirmed the ij order and rejected pereira challenge to the application of aedpa,following matter of soriano,i n,wl bia.in soriano,the bia found that aedpa amendments eliminating c relief for certain criminal aliens were fully retroactive.id.at.at the time of the bia decision,pereira had served less than five years in prison on his aggravated felony conviction.
in,this court,in effect,reversed the bia position in soriano.see wallace reno,cir.we held in wallace that d of aedpa could not be applied retroactively to aliens who were in deportation proceedings before its enactment.id.at.thereafter,the supreme court reached a somewhat similar result,also favorable to the consideration of pereira c application,in ins cyr.see,d holding that c relief remains available for aliens whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who,notwithstanding those convictions,would have been eligible for c relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.
based on our decision in wallace,pereira and the ins jointly moved the bia to reopen and remand to the immigration court.on may,the bia granted the motion,but noted that petitioner might nevertheless be ineligible for c relief on the basis of a of the immigration act of immact,which precludes an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony and has served a term of imprisonment of at least years from obtaining a section c waiver immact,a,stat.the bia further noted that a criminal alien has no enforceable right to compel the ins to commence proceedings at a time advantageous to his ability to establish eligibility for relief.it also stated that because there was a reasonable possibility that pereira would have served five years in prison before entry of a final order granting him c relief,it was not evident that he had a settled expectation regarding the availability of c relief.because the record did not establish how long pereira had been incarcerated,the bia remanded with instructions to the ij to determine whether pereira had already served at least five years in prison on his aggravated felony conviction.
at a hearing on december,the ij determined that pereira was statutorily ineligible for c relief because he had served some six to seven years in prison.therefore,the ij denied the application for c relief and reentered the order of deportation.on may,the bia affirmed without opinion.
on may,pereira filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the rhode island federal district court.the government moved to dismiss the petition based on lack of personal jurisdiction and pereira statutory ineligibility for c relief.the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation,recommending that the government motion to dismiss be granted and pereira habeas petition denied.on march,the district court denied and dismissed the habeas petition.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
a.the statutory scheme 
an alien convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission to the united states is deportable.a a iii.this court,however,like others has interpreted former c of the ina to give aliens in deportation proceedings,as well as in exclusion proceedings,the right to apply to the attorney general for a discretionary waiver in,section a of immact amended ina c to preclude the granting of waiver relief to an alien who had been convicted of an aggravated felony and had served for such felony at least five years in prison.see supra note.
the availability of c relief was even more drastically curtailed in by d of aedpa,which restricted the attorney general authority to grant discretionary relief from deportation to aliens convicted of certain felonies,regardless of the amount of time they had served.on september,congress enacted the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,section of which repealed ina c and created a new form of discretionary relief called cancellation of removal.see ina,iirira.cancellation of removal is not available to aliens who have been convicted of an aggravated felony.see ina,iirira.
whether an alien continues to accrue time toward the bar to section c relief after the issuance of a final order of removal based upon an erroneous retroactive application of aedpa and iirira is a question of law this court reviews de novo.see costa ins,cir.in reviewing an agency construction of a statute it is charged with administering,we ask two questions whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue and if congress has not so spoken,whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.in this case,congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue by declaring in unmistakable language that the waiver provision does not apply to an aggravated felon who has served for the felony a prison term of at least five years.see supra note.
pereira does not deny that he has by now served more than five years in state prison for an aggravated felony.and on december,when the ij considered pereira remanded request for c relief,he had already been in prison for more than five years.pereira argues,however,that to deny him the right to have his application considered because of the delay caused by the bia prior erroneous legal position would violate his right to due process.he further contends that he is entitled to consideration of his c application nunc pro tunc to the date of his original deportation hearing because the delay in the adjudication of his c application was solely due to the bia erroneous retroactivity determination in soriano.see edwards ins,cir 
the plain language of c and our precedent in gomes ashcroft precludes c relief now 
we must presume that the legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.bank germain,d.the supreme court has stated that when the statute language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d internal quotation marks omitted.at the time pereira entered his plea in state court on july,the immact amendments to section c limited his eligibility for a c waiver of deportation.the plain language of section c,in effect at that time,unequivocally provided that discretionary relief under that section is not available to an alien who has been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies and has served for such felony or felonies a term of imprisonment of at least years.ina c,c repealed.
in arguing that pereira is barred from c relief,the government relies on the logic of our decision in gomes ashcroft,cir.in gomes,the petitioner was convicted of rape,an aggravated felony,on august,and sentenced to six to twenty years imprisonment.he began serving the sentence immediately,and eventually was released from prison nearly a decade later,on may.id.at.on january,the petitioner had applied for a waiver of deportability under former section c of the ina.on october,the ij ruled that,under the recently enacted aedpa,the petitioner was ineligible for former c relief,being an aggravated felon.in the alternative,the ij denied the petitioner application as a matter of discretion.id.on october,the bia affirmed on the first ground and did not consider the ij alternative,discretionary basis for denying relief.id.by this time,the petitioner had been in prison for just over five years.the petitioner filed a habeas petition in district court,which the court denied on the ground that the petitioner had served more than five years imprisonment for his felony conviction.id.on appeal,this court rejected petitioner argument that he had served less than five years at the time he filed his c application.we said there that the relevant date is when the bia issued its decision.id.at.
in reliance on gomes,the magistrate report,adopted by the district court in this case,counted against pereira all the time he served in state prison after the ij,on october,held,erroneously as it turned out,that d of the aedpa applied retroactively.pereira does not question the holding in gomes,but he argues that gomes is inapposite because the due process claim raised here was not raised in gomes and such a claim could not have been raised in gomes because,there,the erroneous,retroactive application of the aedpa amendments did not delay gomes proceedings his time simply ran out.
both in this case and in gomes,the ins original denial of c relief was based upon its erroneous legal conclusion that the aedpa amendments applied not only prospectively but retroactively to any alien convicted of an aggravated felony.on this theory,former c became a nullity even as to those like pereira and gomes whose felony convictions predated enactment of the aedpa.there is,to be sure,at least one difference between gomes and this case.in gomes,the petitioner had served over five years in prison on a sentence for an aggravated felony as of the time the bia issued its final order of removal on october.in the instant case,however,when the bia affirmed the ij original deportation order on january,pereira had served less than five years in prison.not until sometime after the bia granted the joint motion to reopen,based on this court reversal of soriano,had pereira served more than five years in prison.
despite this distinction,we believe that the holding in gomes governs this case.we held in gomes that the time an alien served in prison even after a legally erroneous denial of c relief was to be counted towards the bar in c.at.see also giusto ins,cir reject ing petitioner premise that the timing of the ins initiation of deportation proceedings,rather than the length of time actually served,would determine the availability of the waiver.t he relevant date is when the bia issued its decision.gomes,at citing ins,cir just as we credit aliens for time spent in the country while an appeal is pending before the bia so that they are eligible for c relief,we will also consider the time aliens spend in prison during the course of a hearing for purposes of rendering them ineligible for c relief.
while pereira had not served at least five years in prison for an aggravated felony offense at the time the bia originally affirmed the ij order of deportation,he had served more than five years in prison by the time the bia issued its final order of removal on may.and unfortunate though it may be,any and all eligibility for c relief had by then run out.for the ins to grant,or this court to order,waiver relief now would be to provide a form of relief expressly withdrawn by the statute.the statute states quite flatly that after service of five years imprisonment,the waiver provision shall not apply to the alien.no exception is provided for.see ina c,c repealed 
whether applying the plain language of c to pereira is unconstitutional 
petitioner,indeed,does not strongly urge that,after over five years incarceration,the statutory language would entitle him to c relief.rather he argues that to deny him relief in this set of facts amounts to a violation of his constitutional right to due process of law.he points out that much of the delay was caused by the ins insistence on an incorrect retroactive reading of the aedpa.ultimately,our court and the supreme court forbad retroactive application of the aedpa to aliens like pereira who had pled guilty prior to enactment of the aedpa in presumed reliance on their right to seek discretionary relief under c.see cyr,at.wallace,at.pereira argues that it is unfair to the point of being unconstitutional to count against him the time he spent in state prison serving his felony sentence while awaiting correction of the ins earlier erroneous ruling.he likens his plight to the due process violation that occurs when an alien is saddled with an incompetent attorney whose malfeasance prevents the alien from timely seeking discretionary relief.see generally lozada ins,cir.
here,however,we are not dealing with the breakdown of process occasioned by the ineptness of counsel.rather,we deal with a congressional statute providing that one who has spent at least five years in prison because of an aggravated felony is not entitled to be considered for discretionary relief.congress antagonism towards sheltering aliens who commit felonies has been made clear by its repeated legislation on the subject,all directed at enforcing and expanding its wish to expel such aliens.see supra.
against this backdrop,it seems reasonable to infer that congress enacted the proviso less to provide an avenue of leniency to persons like pereira who would go on to serve longer terms although they,too,could apply within the five years than to assist convicted aliens sentenced to less than a term or,if to a longer term,those who might be pardoned or released before actually serving five years,perhaps because of a subsequent determination of innocence,their exemplary conduct,or some other favorable circumstance.viewing the purpose of c in this light,it would be immaterial to congress that pereira might have slipped under the bar had he been able to seek discretionary relief earlier.the important point,once he served five years in prison,was that he now met all the criteria laid down for mandatory deportation no reprieve,release,or pardon during the five years had occurred to indicate that he was the sort of person congress was willing to let remain.
if the above is the thrust of the the lack of any statutory exception to the rule suggests this to be the only remaining question is whether the constitution forbids congress to adopt such a statute.we see no reason why it does.congress is not required to provide aggravated felons with an avenue for discretionary relief from deportation,and currently does not do so.see ina,a.while congress earlier allowed such relief under c,it limited c to those who had not been imprisoned for over five years a bar already in place when pereira entered his guilty plea in.see ina c,c repealed.while the bar may in some respects fall unevenly,as i
