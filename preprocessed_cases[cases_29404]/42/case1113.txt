the,louis evangelista,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york leonard wexler,judge dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus to prevent his to italy.the district court held that evangelista had been convicted of an offense described in section of title relating to tax evasion in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds,a m ii,for which he was deportable under the immigration and nationality act the ina.we agree with the district court conclusion,although on grounds that differ somewhat from those on which the district court relied.
the district court also held that evangelista was not eligible for a waiver of deportation because he was convicted of the offense at issue after congress had abolished such relief for persons convicted of an aggravated felony.the unavailability of a waiver is not impermissibly retroactive in this case,the district court reasoned,because irrespective of the timing of the underlying criminal conduct,evangelista conviction of the relevant crime occurred when the waiver was no longer available.
background 
the,louis evangelista,is a native and citizen of italy.he has been a lawful permanent resident of the united states since.in,a superseding indictment was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york charging evangelista with various federal tax crimes involving events that occurred as early as.in count of the superseding indictment,evangelista was charged with willfully attempt ing to evade and defeat an income tax by failing to pay said income tax to the internal revenue service and by concealing and attempting to conceal from all proper officers of the united states of america his true assets in violation of.superseding indictment at,united states evangelista,ldw emphasis added.
evangelista pleaded not guilty to all of the counts against him.however,a jury found him guilty on all counts.the district court judgment of conviction,dated october,states that evangelista was adjudged guilty under count of a ttempt ing to evade or defeat tax in violation of.judgment of conviction,united states evangelista,no.cr,emphasis added.evangelista appealed his conviction to this court.we affirmed.see united states evangelista,cir,cert.denied,d.our opinion focused primarily on counts under,not on the section counts.id.at.but we did note in passing that evangelista was convicted of evading personal income taxes in violation of,id.at emphasis added,and that t he jury found evanglista and another defendant guilty on all of the counts with which they were charged,id.at.
as a result of evangelista conviction,on april,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued to evangelista a notice to appear,stating that he was subject to removal from the united states for having been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in the ina,a m ii.section a contains a lengthy list of those crimes constituting an aggravated felony for the purpose of determining who is deportable under the ina.the list includes as an aggravated felony in section a m ii the section relevant to the notice to appear an offense that is described in section of title relating to tax evasion in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds.id.
in removal proceedings before an immigration judge ij,evangelista challenged his potential deportation.he first contended that he had not been convicted of an aggravated felony because there was no clear and convincing evidence that he had been convicted under count of evading taxes,rather than defeating taxes,and that only evading taxes constitutes an aggravated felony under the ina.evangelista also argued that he was eligible for a waiver of deportation pursuant to former section c of the ina,c repealed by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,div.c,b,stat,because at the time of his criminal conduct he was eligible for the waiver.the ij,rejecting evangelista arguments,ordered his removal.
evangelista appealed the ij decision to the board of immigration appeals bia.the bia held that evangelista had been convicted of an aggravated felony within the meaning of the ina.first,the bia concluded that evangelista had been convicted of tax evasion,an aggravated felony under a m ii.the bia relied on the judgment of conviction,which stated that evangelista was found guilty on count for attempting to evade or defeat taxes in violation of,the indictment,which set out count as a charge of both evading taxes and defeating taxes,and our decision on evangelista appeal,which referred to evangelista as having been convicted of tax evasion.second,the bia reasoned that even if evangelista had been convicted under section only of defeating taxes and not of evading them,he would nonetheless have committed an aggravated felony under the ina,because the parenthetical phrase in the relevant section relating to tax evasion is merely descriptive of the substance of section.according to the bia,the parenthetical phrase does not limit the definition of an aggravated felony under section a m ii to those offenses that involve tax evasion,but also includes those that involve defeating taxes.and third,the bia concluded that even if the relating to tax evasion parenthetical phrase restricted the scope of section a m ii to convictions relating to tax evasion under,defeating taxes was relat ed to tax evasion and therefore qualified as an aggravated felony.the bia then held that evangelista was not eligible for a waiver of deportation under former section c because he was convicted and formal deportation proceedings against him were begun only after the section was repealed.the bia therefore dismissed evangelista appeal.see in re evangelista,no.
evangelista then filed in the district court a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to seeking relief from deportation.the court denied his petition.see evangelista ashcroft,d.relying on the conjunctive language in count of the indictment willfully attempt ing to evade and defeat an income tax emphasis added and our opinion on evangelista appeal,the court concluded that there can be no doubt that evangelista was convicted of an offense described in section of title relating to tax evasion in which the revenue lost to the government exceeds.id.at quoting a m ii.the court therefore decided that evangelista had been convicted of an aggravated felony and was deportable.id.the district court also concluded that relief from deportation under former ina section c was not available to evangelista,a criminal defendant who elect ed to go to trial in connection with conduct or a conviction that the repeal of section c,but who was convicted and placed in removal proceedings after the repeal of the statute.id.at.according to the district court,it is the date of conviction,not the date of the criminal conduct or of entry of a plea of not guilty,that controls.the court reasoned that there are no fairness concerns when the defendant elects to proceed to opposed to enters into a plea the repeal of section c.id.at.

discussion 
conviction of an aggravated felony 
any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission to the united states is deportable.a a iii.the ins has the burden of establishing deportability by clear and convincing evidence,which must be reasonable,substantial,and probative.id.c a.
we have no jurisdiction to review a final order of removal against an alien who is removable for having committed an aggravated felony.id.a c.but w e do retain jurisdiction to review the question whether,as a matter of law,a petitioner committed an aggravated felony under the ina.dalton ashcroft,cir.we therefore have jurisdiction to review whether evangelista was convicted of an aggravated felony under the ina.
the ina sets forth a list of offenses that qualify as types of aggravated felonies.among them is an offense that is described in section of title relating to tax evasion in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds.a m ii.in turn criminalizes willful attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by title or the payment thereof.we therefore must decide whether evangelista conviction under falls within the scope of section a m ii,thus rendering him deportable.

scope of section a m ii 
the arguments.evangelista argues that the language of a m ii an offense described in section of title relating to tax evasion in which the revenue loss to the government exceeds together with the rule of lenity,require us to interpret that section to render deportable only persons convicted for tax evasion under,and not those convicted of defeat ing a tax under that section.he contends further that the crime of defeat ing a tax is not a section crime relat ed to tax evasion,under the language of the parenthetical phrase,because e vasion appears to involve concealment of assets,whereas defeating appears to involve improper tax avoidance,unlawfully minimizing one tax liability,or other refusal to pay tax.petitioner br.at.evangelista urges us to conclude that because only tax evasion and section crimes related to tax evasion are aggravated felonies under the ina and because the ins did not meet its burden of proof to establish that evangelista was convicted of tax evasion or a section crime relating to tax evasion,he is not deportable for commission of an aggravated felony under the ina.
the government responds that the language of section a m ii provides that any conviction under is an aggravated felony,as long as the revenue loss to the government exceeds,because the parenthetical phrase relating to tax evasion is merely descriptive of the offenses set out in.and,the government continues,even if section a m ii is restricted to convictions under for offenses described in the parenthetical phrase relating to tax evasion a conviction for defeat of a tax is a conviction under that relat es to tax evasion because there is no legal distinction between tax evasion and defeat of a tax.the government asks us to conclude that evangelista is removable whether convicted under section of tax evasion,defeating taxes,or both.
analysis.there are,it seems to us,at most four offenses described in evad ing a tax defeat ing a tax evad ing the payment thereof and defeat ing the payment thereof.sansone united states,d as this court has recognized,includes the offense of willfully attempting to evade or defeat the assessment of a tax as well as the offense of willfully attempting to evade or defeat the payment of a tax.emphasis omitted.although evangelista attempts to distinguish between defeat ing a tax and evad ing a tax,courts and commentators use the two terms interchangeably.see,id.at.as has been held by this court,the elements of are willfulness the existence of a tax deficiency and an affirmative act constituting an evasion or attempted evasion of the tax.citations omitted united states schwartz,cir noting first that the defendant was indicted for tax evasion and then that the substance of the charge is that he willfully attempted to defeat the payment of taxes ian comisky,lawrence feld steven harris,tax fraud evasion a section defines two distinct crimes the willful attempt to evade or defeat any tax and the willful attempt to evade or defeat the payment of any tax.we conclude from this that whatever differences there may be between them,defeat of a tax is at least relat ed to tax evasion,rendering a conviction for it an aggravated felony within section a m ii.whether evangelista was convicted under of evading taxes,defeating taxes,or both,according to the accepted usage of the terms,he was convicted of an aggravated felony under section a m ii.we therefore agree with the bia reading of section a m ii.
this reading of relating to tax evasion obtains whether the parenthetical phrase in section a m ii has a restrictive meaning,as evangelista argues,or a descriptive meaning,as the government argues and as the bia determined.and inasmuch as we see no ambiguity in the scope of section a m ii as applied to evangelista,the rule of lenity has no place in our analysis.see ins,d noting the longstanding principle of construing any lingering ambiguities in deportation statutes in favor of the alien fong haw tan phelan.we resolve doubts in favor of a construction of a deportation statute in favor of a habeas corpus petitioner because deportation is a drastic measure and at times the equivalent of banishment or exile s ince the stakes are considerable for the individual,we will not assume that congress meant to trench on his freedom beyond that which is required by the narrowest of several possible meanings of the words used.emphasis added.
in united states,cir,cert.denied,d,the fifth circuit took a somewhat different approach in reaching a similar conclusion in a similar case.a n declares an offense described in paragraph a or of section a of this title relating to alien smuggling to be an aggravated felony.in interpreting the parenthetical phrase as descriptive rather than restrictive,the fifth circuit relied on grammatical rules and the structure and context of section a as a whole to determine that the parenthetical phrase modifies paragraph a or of section a of this title rather than an offense.id.at upholding an enhanced sentence that the defendant received for having committed an aggravated felony,as defined by section a n,for his conviction under a a of transporting aliens,which is arguably different from smuggling aliens accord patel ashcroft,cir holding,in reliance on and other cases,that a habeas petitioner conviction for harboring an alien under is an aggravated felony under a n,rendering the petitioner deportable united states,cir holding that a defendant conviction for transporting aliens is an aggravated felony and that the defendant therefore deserved an enhanced sentence united states,cir same.
the court reasoned that traditional rules of grammar indicate that the parenthetical phrase in section a n modifies paragraph a or of section a of this title because of its placement following those words instead of directly after the words an offense,at.it then noted that section a contains a long list of aggravated felonies that it references by statutory section.the court concluded that parenthetical phrases found throughout the statute were included to assist readers in identifying the crimes referred to by the statute,without having to endure the long and arduous process of look ing up each section number in the code.id.at.the court then observed that other parenthetical phrases in that section are expressly restrictive.see id.quoting a f listing as an aggravated felony a crime of violence as defined in of title,but not including a purely political offense for which a term of imprisonment is at least one year and a j enumerating an offense described in section if it is a second or subsequent offense as an aggravated felony.the fifth circuit was of the view that had congress intended the parenthetical phrase in section a n to be restrictive,it would have said so,as it had in the other subsections.id.
we are not entirely comfortable with applying the fifth circuit approach to the case before us.section a l deems to be an aggravated felony an offense described in
