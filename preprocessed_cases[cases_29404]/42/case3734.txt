the consolidated petitions of xun li,xiangzhe cui,and he yun fang present the same question of law police in the people republic of china are alleged to have arrested and tortured chinese petitioners of north korean descent for having provided humanitarian assistance to north koreans seeking refuge in china.the board of immigration appeals bia denied each of the three petitioners asylum applications,characterizing the chinese authorities treatment of the petitioners as prosecution for a criminal of harboring foreign than persecution on account of political opinion.the bia,however,did not rely upon any chinese law that actually criminalizes the provision of food and clothing to undocumented north koreans or other foreigners so as to give rise to a legitimate prosecutorial purpose.see ratnam ins,cir.nor have we discovered a chinese law that prohibits providing assistance to foreign refugees.rather,the bia seems to have imported into china what it perceived would be criminal activity in the united states.the policy of the united states,however,through the north korean human rights act of,has been to encourage the very type of humanitarian assistance provided here.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we hold that when a petitioner violates no chinese law,but instead comes to the aid of refugees in defiance of china unofficial policy of discouraging such aid,a bia finding that the petitioner is a mere criminal subject to legitimate prosecution is not supported by substantial evidence.
background 
china mountainous border provinces contain one of the world most acute humanitarian crises famine in north korea,compounded by political repression,has propelled into china a stream of desperate north korean refugees with few options for survival.according to the department of state,as many as north koreans percent of whom are female have journeyed to china in search of sustenance.see rhoda margesson et,congressional research service report for congress,north korean refugees in china and human rights issues,available at.fas.org sgp crs row rl.pdf hereinafter crs report.the north koreans fleeing their homeland do so at severe risk article of the north korean penal code designates defection as a capital crime.id.at.life in china also entails significant peril,however,as china has developed an unofficial policy of discouraging aid to north korean refugees.id.at to.china similarly has refused to allow agencies,including the high commissioner for refugees,to provide assistance.id.at to.under a bilateral repatriation agreement with north korea,china occasionally deports north korean refugees to an uncertain fate,but most refugees appear to be quietly ignored.id.at to.viewing the north koreans as nothing more than economic migrants,china does not allow them to apply for asylum,id.at,and it will not allow its own citizens to assist the refugees.confronting this stalemate,individual chinese citizens,such as the petitioners here,have defied china policy and provided some relief in the form of food,clothing,and shelter to ameliorate the plight of these north korean refugees.
ii.statement of facts and procedural history 
xun li li is a chinese native and citizen of north korean descent.before he left china,li lived in yanji city,which is located in jilin province,a mountainous region in northeastern china that borders north korea,and worked as a tour guide around,during a difficult time in li life,li met dong hoa cui hoa,a north korean citizen and christian pastor who preached to li about christianity.in time,li decided to convert to christianity.he began practicing in a nondenominational church.the church held services every sunday at the home of one of the members.the services rotated to a different home each week,and there were usually at least ten members at each meeting.yun ho jen jen led the meetings.
in october,hoa asked li to provide shelter and assistance to christian north koreans who were fleeing persecution,and li agreed.in late november,li began providing shelter to two north korean refugees by allowing them to stay in his home.on the evening of december,li church held a small service at his home with other members and the north koreans in attendance.around,the police came to the door,arrested and handcuffed li and the others in attendance,including the north koreans,and took them all to the police station.at the station,the police took the group to an interrogation room.it was approximately when the interrogation began.the police asked,who is your leader when no one responded,the police began slapping each of them on their faces.finally,jen admitted he was the leader,at which point he was taken away from the group.li later learned that jen was sent to a labor camp.
li was the second one to be separated from the group and interrogated individually.the police asked,what was the reason to for you to join the cults and why did you giving asylums to the north korean the police also asked,you know that you giving asylum to those north koreans would be a violation of the law li responded 
i believe in the religion.it my personal to freedom.and then in regard to accommodating the north koreans,they been sufferings and it was very brutal.and it human to rights to give them the protection.and then would it be something in violation the law that to accommodate those suffered people 
li said that he gave this statement to the police b ecause that how he feel s to and without any guilt.thus,li stated his belief that he should aid the north koreans to protect their human rights,and that it was consistent with his religious beliefs to protect them.
the interrogation continued with the police telling li that they wanted a list of all the church members and how they had helped the north koreans.when li refused to disclose the names and to explain how the church members had helped,one interrogating officer began to hit and punch the handcuffed li in the face vigorously.the officer then kicked li backward to the floor and continued punching him as blood began to flow from li nose and lips.once li hit the floor,another officer joined in,and the officers then took turns kicking li in the head and stomach.li,remaining conscious,tried to shield himself from the blows.when li again refused to disclose the names of the church members and to explain their help to the north koreans,the officers told him that he was going to suffer for the consequences.the officers then stripped him down to his underwear and tied him to an electric pole.in the frigid december night,the officers left li,who was bleeding and still handcuffed,exposed to the temperature for nearly an hour.they eventually retrieved li and resumed questioning.li was paralyzed and frozen,and was unable to respond.the officers then told li they had all the evidence they needed the bible and also the north koreans to sentence him to a labor reform camp.li spent fifteen days at the labor camp,where the other inmates continuously beat him up.li family finally secured his release by furnishing a rmb bribe to the police department.in exchange,li was required to sign a letter of guarantee promising to give up his faith,report on other church members,and obey chinese laws.the guarantee also stated that li had to report to the local police station every week,which he did for a short time fearing chinese authorities,however,li decided to seek asylum in the united states.he paid rmb to travel from china to south korea to vancouver to seattle to los angeles,where he requested asylum in may.
the immigration judge ij denied li petition for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat on the basis of an adverse credibility finding.the ij alternatively found that,even if li were credible,his testimony did not establish past persecution because the actions of the officers did not rise to the level of persecution.the ij stated that the beatings li suffered,a lthough certainly not pleasant,were not severe enough to constitute persecution.the ij acknowledged that li continued to suffer some mistreatment at the labor camp,but found this treatment did not constitute persecution because it was not at the hands of the police or any other officials of the government,but rather at the hands of his fellow prisoners.the ij then turned to the question as to whether li was really arrested and sentenced to the labor camp because of the harboring of illegal aliens.the ij assumed that li detention and sentence to the labor camp were a legitimate sanction for violation of the law by that country.the ij reasoned o ne of the charges that li clearly admits is that he was harboring a sic illegal aliens,which is not only apparently a crime in china,but would be a crime in the united states as well emphasis added.the ij failed to cite to any chinese law li had violated.in addition to rejecting the possibility that li was persecuted on account of his political opinion,the ij also found li had failed to demonstrate that he was persecuted on account of religion or any other protected ground.the ij therefore exercised his discretion to not grant asylum to li.the ij also rejected li application for withholding of removal and protection under cat.the bia affirmed without opinion.li timely petitions for review.
iii.standard of review 
when the bia adopts the reasoning of the ij,we review the decision of the ij.see kazlauskas ins,cir because the bia did not independently review the applicant case and instead adopted the ij opinion,we review the decision of the ij.e.we review the ij determination that an applicant has not established asylum eligibility for substantial evidence,see tang gonzales,cir,upholding a determination when it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole,gormley ashcroft,cir quoting ins,d.to reverse a finding we must find that the evidence not only supports that conclusion,but compels it,at.
iv.discussion 
the attorney general may,in his discretion,grant asylum to applicants determined to be refugees within the meaning of section a a of the immigration and nationality act.a a see id.b.an applicant qualifies as a refugee when the applicant is unable or unwilling to return to his home country because of a fear of future persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.navas ins,cir.an applicant may establish a fear of future persecution in two ways proof of past persecution or a demonstration that the applicant has a subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable fear of future persecution.fisher ins,cir en banc.to be eligible for asylum,an applicant must demonstrate a nexus between the alleged persecution and one of the five protected categories.see ins,cir.a showing of past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the applicant has a fear of future persecution.see tawadrus ashcroft,cir.
credibility determination 
we review credibility findings under a substantial evidence standard rivera mukasey,cir.an adverse credibility determination must be based on specific,cogent reasons found in the record.singh gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.one of these reasons must go to the heart of the asylum claim.see li ashcroft,cir.minor inconsistencies in the record that do not relate to the basis of an applicant alleged fear of persecution,go to the heart of the asylum claim,or reveal anything about an asylum applicant fear for his safety are insufficient to support an adverse credibility finding.mendoza manimbao,at.further,the adverse credibility finding must be based on the record before the ij.see shah ins,cir speculation and conjecture can not form the basis of an adverse credibility finding,which must instead be based on substantial evidence.
the ij found that li testimony lacked credibility based on a number of events that the ij had difficulty reconciling.although the ij did not find that any one of these events actually supported an adverse credibility determination,he concluded that considered cumulatively,they undermined li testimony.
the ij justifications for his adverse credibility determination,however,are riddled with speculation,see,and are based on minor inconsistencies that do not go to the heart of the claim,see mendoza manimbao,at.
the ij stated that it difficult to reconcile why the north koreans would be fleeing to china where religion is also prohibited.the ij engaged in impermissible speculation and conjecture in his assumption that the unidentified north koreans aided by li fled north korea,a brutal dictatorship that continues to commit numerous,serious human rights abuses,to escape religious persecution.while there may be many reasons that north koreans seek refuge in china,it is clear that two key elements driving north koreans across the border into china include deteriorating humanitarian due to food human rights violations.crs report,at.thus,the ij relied on impermissible speculation as to the north korean refugees motivation to create an inconsistency where none existed.see shah,at.
the ij also found it difficult to reconcile that some of the fleeing north korean refugees may have gone to south korea as a safe haven,as li testified,while li himself chose the united states as a refuge.the ij could not understand why li did not also want to stay in south korea,especially given that he speaks korean fluently and is of korean nationality.once again,the ij manufactured an inconsistency he thought required reconciliation,this time by speculating as to the individual circumstances of the refugees li aided and li own circumstances,which were quite different.while south korea remains the primary destination for north korean refugees,crs report,at,who transit through china because it is impossible to cross the heavily mined demilitarized zone leading to south korea,li is not a north korean refugee he is a citizen of china and,thus,a chinese refugee.moreover,li explained why he remained only temporarily in south korea fear of extradition back to china.the ij inexplicably failed to even legitimate explanation as to the reason he,as opposed to the north korean refugees,could stay only temporarily in south korea.it goes without saying that china and south korea have a different diplomatic relationship than that which exists between north korea and south korea.while the only record evidence as to south korea extradition policy is li testimony,there is nothing in the record to contradict his understanding that,as a chinese citizen,he would be returned to china if found by the south korean authorities.
the ij next stated that it was difficult to reconcile why exactly li was arrested.li testified that the chinese authorities told him he was arrested for being part of a religious cult and for giving asylum to the north korean refugees.the ij did not find anything that contradicts the fact that li was arrested because he was practicing his religion and sheltering north koreans.rather,the ij credited the arrest,but yet again found an inconsistency based on his own speculation that the police should have ferreted out the purposefully secret religious meeting sooner.however,that the arrest occurred after a year of secret meetings,as opposed to after one week,does not suggest anything about the credibility of the claim.moreover,the ij fully credited li testimony that one of the two reasons for his arrest was giving humanitarian aid to the north korean refugees 
the ij also raised doubts about li testimony that he had held church services in his house about eight times.the ij assumed that li could not be telling the truth because he admit ted that he only participated in the church from october to april when he was on the for his work.the ij erred in reaching this conclusion.li testified that he began attending the church services in october.the ij asked li,and so how many different members houses did you meet at li responded,we have more than of us,so we take the rotations.the ij then asked,so would it be fair to say that you met at your house eight times before the december,meeting li said yes.although it is unclear whether the services rotated to a new house each sunday or just once a month,it is clearly possible that li hosted the services eight times between october and december,although li admitted that,because of his job as a tour guide,he usually could not attend the services between april and september though he did attend when he had the day off,there were still sundays during the on which li could have hosted the services.without knowing how the rotation system worked,the ij improperly speculated that li statement that he held services about eight times was an inconsistency even if this were an inconsistency,however,it still was not a proper basis for the ij adverse credibility finding because it does not go to the heart of the asylum claim.mendoza manimbao,at.whether he hosted the services eight times,or six or four,does not impact the question of whether he was attacked by chinese authorities on december,or whether he would fear returning to china.see singh ashcroft,cir e ven if we were to agree with the ins that this testimony was inconsistent,any discrepancy can not be viewed as an attempt by the applicant to enhance his claims of persecution,and thus has no bearing on credibility.alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted.
the ij also found it difficult to reconcile why it so important for li to come to america so that he can practice his religion when he did not know what the teachings were of the registered christian church of his home town.li testified that he came to the united states to practice his christian religion.the ij did not find anything in the record to contradict li claim that he is a christian indeed,he credited li testimony that he is a practicing christian,but nevertheless suggested that li failure to know the difference between the teachings of the presbyterian church that he attends in los angeles and the teachings of the church in his home town undermines li basis for seeking to practice christianity at his new presbyterian church.li was introduced to a particular branch of christianity and decided to worship within that church,without pursuing other options.what a new christian convert in china would know or even could know about the theological positions of various denominations is pure conjecture.
what we do know from the department of state country report in the record is that the chinese government continued to enforce regulations requiring all places of religious activity to register with the government or to come under the supervision of official,patriotic religious organizations,and that some religious groups,including unregistered protestant and catholic congregations and members of nontraditional religious groups,continued to experience varying degrees of official interference,harassment,and repression.bureau of democracy,human rights,labor,dep t of state,country reports on human rights practices china includes tibet,hong kong,and macau,available at.gov g drl rls hrrpt.it is only logical that li would choose the united states,where his freedom to practice religion is constitutionally guaranteed,as his final destination.
next,the ij stated that li admitted one of the reasons he wanted to come to the united states was for better economic opportunities.a review of the hearing transcript and li asylum application makes clear,however,that li seeks asylum on the grounds of religious and political persecution,and that economic benefits secondary motivation.during the hearing,the government counsel asked li,d id you come to the united states for better job opportunities li said yes.neither the counsel nor the ij asked any questions about this alleged motivation.even if economic opportunities were a secondary motivation,it is not a basis for undermining li wholly consistent testimony that he was persecuted on account of religion and political opinion.li repeatedly stated that he came to the united states to escape religious and political persecution in china.similarly,his asylum application states that he is seeking asylum on the basis of religion,political opinion,and membership in a particular social group,as well as relief under cat.
the ij also illogically discredited li testimony because li paid rmb to escape china,even though he initially thought he might leave china for only a few years.the ij assumed that no one would pay such a large amount of money if he had plans to remain in the united states for only a few years.first,the ij had no basis for concluding that was a large sum of money to secure a refugee safe transit with the necessary documentation from china to the united states.second,if in fact the sum was either relatively or absolutely substantial,it would seem to make li story more,rather than less,of a large sum of money for transit to a destination for only a few years suggests the degree to which li feared for his life.the ij merely speculated that no one would spend to flee persecution by the chinese government.there is no inconsistency in li payment of to travel to the united states to escape persecution,and his hope that one day he could be reunited with his family.
the ij also found a discrepancy where none existed in li testimony about his medical treatment.li testified that he went to yanji hospital after he was released from the labor camp.he stated,i had examination over there,and then they gave me the prescription,the medicine i t was a supplement,vitamins.and then also my stomach was bad and then there some medication for my stomach.li provided a form corroborating his treatment at the hospital.however,li had told the asylum officer that his sister,who is a doctor at a firm,provided his medical treatment.the government counsel asked,so why is it that you submitted to court a document indicating that you went to the yanji city hospital if,in fact,it was your sister who treated you and she works for a big firm li explained,because my sister,even though she works for a large firm,she specialize in looking after the welfare of the employees of the firm.so she not a specialist in that field and that why i needed to go to a specialized hospital.the counsel then asked,y ou saying that your sister treated you and you went to a hospital li responded,it just a examination that i went.the counsel continued to press li y ou only told the asylum officer that your sister was the only one who treated you.li again explained,no,officer i believes that she took care of me at home giving me the injections and also giving me the pills.that li was treated both by his sister and at the hospital does not render his testimony inconsistent.although the record is rendered vague by either translation problems or li failure to understand the question,it does appear that li initially sought his sister help and,then,because his injuries were outside of her speciality,went to the local hospital for examination.regardless,whether li injuries were treated by his sister or at a hospital,or both,does not go to the heart of his claim and has little bearing on the veracity of the persecution he describes.see li,at.
the ij also found that li was not credible because he could not explain why he presented the train ticket as evidence to this court that he now claims was erroneous.li testified that he departed yanji city by train on february,but the ticket stub was dated february.li explained that the conductor made a mistake in writing the date on the ticket,and that he only show ed it to the ij verifying to the fact that i actually depart.in any event,such confusion around dates can not support an adverse credibility determination.see bandari ins,cir any alleged inconsistencies in dates that reveal nothing about a petitioner credibility can not form the basis of an adverse credibility finding.
finally,the ij took issue with li testimony about conversations he had with his family after arriving in the united states in particular,the ij questioned li testimony that his mother had been threatened because the police wanted to know his whereabouts.the following exchange took place during the hearing 
ij okay.why do you fear,sir,going back to china 
li if i ever return then,i will be sentenced.
ij and how do you know that 
li because my family,when i talk to them through the phone,they said you not to return.if you ever return,then you will be arrested.and then to put in jail.so for sure that i do not come back.
ij okay.and why would you thinking that you could return to china in a few years 
li right now my family told me that in china you are not possibly to able to return.
ij i understand that.but when you departed,you did know that.so what were you thinking that a few years would do for you 
li i just wanted to get away to from the chinese authority.
ij have your parents been harassed by the police 
li they came to my home and threatening to my mother saying that you better urge your son to return.
ij did they do anything more than just threaten her what did they threaten her with 
li whether to persuade me to return as soon as possible.and too because your son has violated the law and it could be serious.
ij so did they threaten her with putting her in jail 
we are perplexed as to why the ij even mentioned these statements they only seem to than asylum claim.
the ij adverse credibility determination thus rests upon an illusory foundation of speculation,uninformed conjecture and assumptions,fabricated inconsistencies,and discrepancies having nothing to do with li claim for asylum.on the other hand,the ij credited each aspect of li testimony that actually did support his claim for asylum.for example,the ij fully credited li claim that he had been arrested,detained,and slapped,and sentenced to a labor camp for giving humanitarian aid to north koreans.because we find no specific,cogent reasons in the record supporting the ij adverse credibility determination,singh,at internal quotation marks omitted,we conclude that the adverse credibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence.absent an adverse credibility determination,we must accept li testimony as true.see kalubi,at.
persecution 
persecution is the infliction of suffering or harm upon those who differ in race,religion or political opinion in a way regarded as offensive.gormley,at internal quotation marks omitted.it is well established that physical violence is persecution under a a.see,guo ashcroft,cir finding beatings of a chinese detainee to rise to the level of persecution chand ins,cir physical harm has consistently been treated as persecution.
because the ij found that,even if li had testified credibly,he did not suffer any past persecution on account of a protected ground,we need not remand li asylum application for a determination on this issue.see guo,at.we first address whether the chinese authorities brutal attacks on li rise to the level of persecution,and then turn to the question of whether the persecution was on account of political opinion.
we hold that the ij erred in finding that the actions of the police did not rise to the level of persecution.see gormley,at.accepting li testimony as true,the record compels the conclusion that li was persecuted.see,at.silaya mukasey,cir.as we already described,the officers repeatedly hit li in the face in an effort to extract a confession and to punish him for aiding the north koreans.next,the officers took turns kicking him in the head and stomach as he lay on the floor.they then left the bloodied and still handcuffed li exposed to the freezing december night for nearly an hour.finally,li endured further beatings during the fifteen days of his confinement at the labor camp.the police were either unwilling or unable to control the beatings of li by his fellow inmates.see ins,cir a ffirmative state action is not necessary to establish a fear of persecution if the government is unwilling or unable to control those elements of its society responsible for targeting a particular individual.internal quotation marks omitted kalubi,at finding that harsh conditions in an overcrowded prison cell,even absent physical beatings,established past persecution.li required medical attention at a hospital upon his release.the totality of the circumstances demonstrate that li was persecuted.see chand,at guo,at we look at the totality of the circumstances in deciding whether a finding of persecution is compelled.korablina ins,cir the key question is whether,looking at the cumulative effect of all the incidents a petitioner has suffered,the treatment she received rises to the level of persecution.the ij therefore erred in finding that the beating li suffered did not rise to the level of persecution required by law.
the ij reliance on prasad ins,cir,is misplaced.prasad had been arrested,taken to a police station,and hit on his stomach and kicked from behind.id.at.his captors did not threaten him explicitly,and he was released after four to six hours.id.although we condemned the attack on prasad,we found that it was not so overwhelming so as to necessarily constitute persecution.id.this is clearly far less severe than what the chinese police did to li.further,unlike prasad,who was released after a few hours,li continued to suffer for fifteen days at the labor camp.lastly,the police did explicitly threaten li.thus,the comparison to prasad does not support the ij conclusion.
pretextual prosecution 
we have long distinguished persecution from prosecution.an applicant very well may fear accountability for a criminal act in his native country however,such fear does not necessarily entitle him to the protection of the united states.see chanco ins,cir persons avoiding lawful prosecution for common crimes are not ordinarily deemed refugees.for example,an applicant avoiding prosecution for misappropriating funds may have a fear of returning home,but such fear does not bring him within the protected classes of our asylum law.see mabugat ins,cir.
nevertheless,we also have recognized that persecution and prosecution are not mutually exclusive.indeed,prosecution may serve as the avenue by which agents of the state persecute a disfavored group.violators of the nuremberg laws,for instance,may have been prosecuted under those virulently laws however,one would be to categorize the prosecution as anything other than persecution on account of religion.see ins,cir few could doubt,for example,that any jew fleeing nazi germany in the or would by virtue of his or her religious status alone have established a clear probability of persecution.internal quotation marks omitted.
understanding that persecution may appear in the guise of prosecution,we have carved out exceptions to the general rule that applicants avoiding prosecution for violations of criminal law are ineligible for asylum.chief among these exceptions to the general rule are disproportionately severe punishment and pretextual prosecution.fisher,at see chanco,at although prosecution for a common law crime will not ordinarily constitute persecution,a showing of disproportionate punishment may support a claim that the prosecution is a pretext for persecution on account of political opinion.
we explored the interplay between persecution and prosecution in bandari.there,a christian iranian citizen sought asylum in the united states following a prosecution for interfaith dating.id.at.while in high school,bandari began dating a muslim neighbor,a crime in theocratic iran.id.when police officers caught the two embracing in the street,they summarily arrested bandari,took him to the police station,and began whipping him with a rubber hose until he lost consciousness.he was later sentenced to lashes and a year in a prison.id.at.bandari fled iran to seek asylum in the united states.id.at.we declined to characterize the treatment of bandari as a legitimate criminal prosecution.id.at.while the initial stop of bandari may have been mere law enforcement,the ensuing physical attacks were clearly based on bandari religion.id.we recognized that bandari claim may fall under a analysis,when police motivation sprung from both prosecutorial aims and religious hatred.id.yet,because an asylum applicant need only present evidence from which it is reasonable to believe that the harm was motivated,at least in part,by an actual or implied protected ground,id.at quoting borja ins,cir en banc,superseded by statute,real id act,div.b,title i,a b i,stat,as recognized in parussimova mukasey,cir,bandari met his burden and we granted his petition.
we also have determined that the distinction between persecution and prosecution is less than clear cut when the prosecution lacks legitimacy or proceeds without the process normally due.in ins,we declined to find an actual,legitimate,criminal prosecution when the el salvadorian military accused of being a guerilla who illegally smuggled arms from nicaragua,cir,superseded by statute on other grounds,real id act a b i,as recognized in parussimova,at.the attorney general argued that el salvador has the right to prosecute individuals accused of criminal activity and that such prosecution is readily distinguishable from persecution based on political beliefs.id.we disagreed,finding 
no evidence in the record that an actual,legitimate,criminal prosecution was initiated against indeed,testified that,while a captive of the security forces,he was threatened with death unless he admitted to being a guerilla.we can hardly characterize this as an example of legitimate criminal prosecution.
id.further,we noted that testified that if the security forces found him again,they would kill him without instituting any formal prosecutorial measures.id.we therefore concluded that the government conduct was not in furtherance of a criminal prosecution,but rather was an incident of governmental persecution based on perceived political beliefs.see also chand,at r esistance to discriminatory government action that results in persecution is persecution on account of a protected ground.
when the government lacks a legitimate prosecutorial motive or any other logical reason for the persecution at issue,navas,at,we presume,as a matter of law,that the motive for harassment is political,id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also ahmed keisler,cir that ahmed was beaten absent any due process also supports his claim of persecution on account of a political opinion.ins,cir when a government exerts its military strength against an individual or a group within its population and there is no reason to believe that the individual or group has engaged in any criminal activity or other conduct that would provide a legitimate basis for governmental action,the most reasonable presumption is that the government actions are politically motivated,superseded by statute on other grounds,real id act a b i,as recognized in parussimova,at ratnam,at torture in the absence of any legitimate criminal prosecution,conducted at least in part on account of political opinion,provides a proper basis for asylum and withholding of deportation even if the torture served intelligence gathering purposes.
the ij erred in assuming that li detention and sentence to the labor camp were a legitimate sanction for violation of chinese law.li can not possibly have been legitimately prosecuted.neither the ij nor the attorney general was able to cite to any chinese statute or regulation that criminalizes li conduct,and the record demonstrates that no such law exists.in a sworn affidavit,uc berkeley school of law professor robert berring,who specializes in chinese law and the chinese legal system,attested that,to his knowledge,there is no published law forbidding chinese citizens from providing food and comfort to illegal aliens.similarly,professor cheng,a specialist in chinese criminal law who lived most of his life in china and formerly taught at the nanjing normal university school of law,swears unequivocally that there is no criminal law of any kind written or verbal,formal or informal in china prohibiting citizens from providing food,water,shelter,social assistance or other assistance to individuals who entered china illegally from another country.
international treaties further buttress our conclusion that li conduct was not criminal.china itself has treaty obligations to protect the north korean refugees.china has acceded to the convention relating to the status of refugees and the protocol to that convention.see convention relating to the status of refugees,available at commission on china,annual report,available at http www.cecc.gov pages annual rpt annual rpt ceccann.
because no law prohibits li conduct,when the chinese officials abruptly arrested li in his home and took him to a police station where he endured physical abuse as part of a coercive interrogation aimed at locating north korean refugees and discouraging the provision of humanitarian aid to them,the record compels the conclusion that the officials were not engaged in legitimate criminal prosecution,at finding governmentally inflicted harm without formal prosecutorial measures to be persecution.the only crime li might have committed was failure to cooperate with a police investigation however,he was not accused of this crime by the chinese police.moreover,as we discuss below,the record demonstrates that the police were not motivated by li failure to cooperate.rather,they were motivated by a desire to punish li for defying the unwritten chinese policy of discouraging humanitarian aid to north koreans 
persecution on account of political opinion 
criticism of government actions or policies generally may be considered the expression of political opinion.see ahmed,at a political opinion encompasses more than electoral politics or formal political ideology or action.njuguna ashcroft,cir stating that acting against government corruption may express a political opinion,even when the action in question is assisting two kenyan women to escape from the saudi royal family employ,at it is clear that statements regarding the unfair distribution of food in iraq resulted in iraqi officials imputing an political opinion to.borja,at holding that when borja articulated her political opposition and thereby provoked an immediate reaction from her persecutors,it was clear that no reasonable factfinder could fail to see the role her outspoken political opinion played both then and thereafter in what happened to her.
the ij erred in finding that li was not persecuted on account of his political opinion.the were implementing the unofficial chinese policy of discouraging humanitarian aid to north korean motivated by a desire to brutalize li for defying the policy by providing aid to the north koreans and for expressing opinions contrary to this policy in his words and deeds.persecutors motivation should not be questioned when the persecutors specifically articulate their reason for attacking a victim.see,at.see,kebede,at reversing the ij holding that the petitioner failed to establish that she suffered past persecution on account of political opinion when the petitioner testified that the soldiers who raped her stated during the rape that they were raping her because of her family position in the prior ethiopian regime.
there is direct evidence of the officers motivation in the officers specifically interrogated li about why and how he had helped the north koreans while they were brutalizing him.when li would not disclose the names of the other church members who had provided aid,the officers threatened that li was going to suffer for the consequences.we already have recounted the various ways in which li did in fact suffer at the hands of his persecutors.moreover,before sending li to the labor camp,where he continued to suffer for the consequences,the police told him that they had all the evidence they needed the bible and also the north koreans.the evidence clearly demonstrates that the authorities persecuted li to force him to conform to the government unofficial policy,and that this policy was enforced coercively and without regard to china criminal law.
li refused to obey the nebulous,unwritten policy that undocumented north korean refugees should receive no aid from chinese citizens,rather than leaving the refugees to starve,abject and unsheltered,or reporting them to the government to face repatriation and possible execution.li was motivated by a moral obligation to protect and ease the suffering of the deeds matching the words of the president of the united states and various members of congress who likewise have protested the chinese treatment of north korean refugees.see crs report,at.though li did not explicitly state his political disagreement with the policy until he was detained and interrogated,his actions clearly indicated hi
