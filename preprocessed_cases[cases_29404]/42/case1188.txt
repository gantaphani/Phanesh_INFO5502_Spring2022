opinion of the court 
the immigration and nationality act ina enables an immigrant to obtain a visa as a special immigrant religious worker if the immigrant meets certain statutory criteria,including that he has been carrying on religious work for at least the two years preceding the filing of the visa petition.this case presents the question whether a requirement imposed in the relevant regulation that this religious work have been carried on in lawful immigration status crosses the line from permissible statutory interpretation by the responsible agency to ultra vires regulation contrary to the clear intent of congress.none of our sister courts of appeals have yet weighed in on this issue,but the district court here concluded that the regulation is ultra vires because it contradicts the plain language of the ina.shalom pentecostal church beers,dist.lexis,at.for the reasons set forth below,we agree.we therefore will affirm the district court order as to the invalidity of the regulation but will reverse and remand for further on the remaining visa criteria.
factual background and procedural history 
alencar visa application 
none of the material facts in this case are disputed.appellee carlos alencar,a brazilian national,travelled with his family to the united states on a b nonimmigrant tourist visa in june.the visa authorized alencar to stay in the united states until december,but he has remained in the united states unlawfully since the visa expired.alencar was not authorized to work under the terms of his b visa,nor did he otherwise obtain employment authorization.
alencar has been seeking legal immigration status as a special immigrant religious worker since,when he first petitioned for an i visa petition,which would eventually qualify him to seek permanent residency status.that petition and a second petition filed by alencar in were both rejected by the united states citizenship and immigration service cis.nonetheless,alencar began working as a senior pastor for the shalom pentecostal church the church in and continued in that capacity through the filing of this appeal.
the i petition at issue here was filed by the church on alencar behalf in.cis again denied the petition and,in this instance,did so on the sole ground that the church had failed to establish,pursuant to newly promulgated m and the regulation,that alencar had been performing work in lawful immigration status as a religious worker for at least the period immediately preceding the filing of the petition.app.emphasis added.the cis administrative appeals office dismissed the church appeal,concluding,consistent with the regulation,that alencar religious employment in the united states during the qualifying period was not authorized under united states immigration law.app.
in,alencar and the church filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of new jersey,challenging the denial of the i petition on several grounds,including that the regulation was ultra vires to the ina the district court denied the government motion to dismiss and subsequently granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment,invalidating the regulation on the grounds that the statutory language was unambiguous and that the regulation addition of the lawful status requirement was inconsistent with the statutory scheme the district court further held that any remand would be futile and ordered cis to grant alencar i petition.
b.the visa petition process 
the ina provides for preference in the issuance of visas to five categories of workers priority workers,aliens with advanced degrees or of exceptional ability,skilled workers and professionals,special immigrants,including religious workers,and foreign investors.b.the subcategory at issue in this case the special immigrant religious worker program permits ministers and nonminister religious workers to immigrate in legal status to the united states to perform religious work.a c.in order to become a legal permanent resident lpr through the special immigrant religious worker program,an alien or his prospective employer must complete two steps.first,the applicant must successfully petition cis for an i visa.a,c,m.if granted that visa,the alien may apply to the attorney general for permanent adjustment of status.
this case focuses on the first step of this process.the ina requires that,in order to qualify for an i visa as a special immigrant religious worker,the immigrant must meet three criteria membership in a religious denomination with a bona fide nonprofit religious organization in the united states for two years immediately preceding the petition,intent to enter the united states or change status within the united states solely for the purpose of working as a minister or in another religious vocation,and the carrying on of such religious work continuously for at least the two years before applying.a c i iii 
as it is authorized to do under a,cis has promulgated regulations elaborating on these statutory qualifications.under the regulations,the visa petition procedure begins when either an alien or a person on the alien behalf applies for an i visa.that visa,if granted by cis,classifies an alien as a special immigrant religious worker.the filer must present evidence that the alien meets the statutory requirements as expounded by the regulations.for example,while the statute requires that the alien seek to enter the united states solely for the purpose of carrying on the vocation of a minister,a c ii i,the regulations specify that the intended religious work be both full time and compensated.m.
in,cis amended m to require that an alien have worked either abroad or in lawful immigration status in the united states,and continuously for at least the period immediately preceding the filing of the petition to be eligible for classification as a special immigrant religious worker.m emphasis added.the amendments also added that q ualifying prior experience if acquired in the united states,must have been authorized under united states immigration law.m.the regulation thus disqualifies applicants like alencar who did carry on otherwise qualifying religious work during the two years before they filed a visa application but did so without lawful status.

iii.discussion 
the government raises two issues on appeal.first,it contends that alencar and the church lack standing to challenge the denial of the i petition.specifically,the government contests the constitutional standing of both alencar and the church,alencar standing under cis regulation a iii b,and alencar right to sue under the ina.second,the government argues that the district court erred in ruling that the regulation is ultra vires.we address these issues in turn.
constitutional standing 
article iii of the constitution requires that a plaintiff establish standing in order for his case to be justiciable.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.constitutional standing has three elements injury in fact,causation,and redressability.id.at.here,the government challenges only the third.for an injury to be redressable,the plaintiff must show that it is likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.if the plaintiff is the object of government action,there is ordinarily little question that the action or inaction has caused him injury,and that a judgment preventing or requiring the action will redress it.id.at.
the government asserts that no matter the result of this appeal,alencar will not be eligible for adjustment to lpr status for at least ten years,so that any victory in the current proceeding will be pyrrhic.appellants br.citing app.even if an i visa is granted,the government points out,an alien is statutorily ineligible to adjust status from within the united states if he worked in unlawful immigration status for more than days.c,k.but an alien who seeks to adjust status from outside the united states and was present unlawfully in the united states for one year or more is inadmissible to the united states for ten years from his date of departure.a b i ii g.alencar worked in unlawful immigration status for more than days and has been present unlawfully in the united states for more than one year.hence,he will be ineligible for adjustment of status for at least ten years.
this syllogism,however valid,does not bear on the question of alencar standing to challenge the denial of his i petition on the basis of the legality of the regulation.as a threshold matter,the government contention that relief must be immediate to satisfy constitutional standing finds no support in our precedent.rather,as the supreme court made clear in lujan,redressability hinges on the availability and likelihood of relief,rather than the immediacy of relief.see at.indeed,a requirement of immediate redressability would be particularly inappropriate in the immigration context,where there is frequently a lengthy delay between a favorable decision and the availability of relief.see scialabba cuellar de osorio,d.
in any event,alencar is seeking a visa at this point,not permanent adjustment of status.while obtaining a visa is a prerequisite to applying for lpr status,the ina makes clear that the visa petition process and the adjustment of status process are distinct.compare,with see matter of o,i n,bia the visa petition procedure is concerned merely with the question of status.it does not concern itself with substantive questions of inadmissibility.even the government acknowledges that the ina sets forth distinct criteria for applicants qualifying as special immigrant religious workers immigrant visa and for those seeking to adjust status adjustment of status.appellants br.
we are guided by the supreme court approach in monsanto geertson seed farms,where the court analyzed redressability in the context of proceedings based on the availability of relief at a given step,rather than the likelihood of achieving the ultimate goal.see,d holding that farmers had standing to challenge restrictions on an agency ability to deregulate a product even though their ultimate goal of deregulation could not be achieved without further agency action.in alencar case,that step is the petition for an i visa.if alencar satisfies a criteria,the statute provides in mandatory terms that a visa shall be made available,subject to specified numerical limits.b.thus,as the sixth circuit aptly observed in patel uscis,when an alien visa petition is denied,he has lost a significant opportunity to receive an immigrant visa and that lost opportunity is itself a concrete injury,cir quoting abboud ins,cir.
the government insistence that we determine at the visa petition stage the redressability of a different and potential injury,alencar prospects for eventual adjustment of status,would turn the ina carefully considered statutory scheme on its head.congress has provided for separate and sequential processes to obtain an i visa and to apply for adjustment of status.compare,with.at the second stage,cis not the federal courts ordinarily adjudicates an application for adjustment of status in the first instance,a,and congress has expressly excluded from judicial review the attorney general discretionary decision regarding final adjustment of status.a b i,a it would hardly make sense,then,to base an alien standing at the first stage on a court prognostication about that executive branch decision at the second.
instead,we hold that the injury at that first stage is redressable by judicial action,and appellees therefore have constitutional standing to challenge the denial of the i petition.
regulatory standing 
the government contends that alencar can not proceed,even if he has article iii standing,because a cis regulation,a iii b,authorizes an administrative appeal only by an affected party,which is defined as the person or entity with legal standing in a proceeding,and which does not include the beneficiary of a petition.a iii b.courts have relied on this regulation to uphold agency decisions dismissing visa beneficiaries for lack of standing in the context of administrative proceedings.see,echevarria keisler,cir kale ins,app x cir per curiam unpublished table decision.
we can not agree that this regulation bars alencar claim here.even assuming that it applies outside the context of administrative proceedings,this regulation must be read in tandem with c.as the government points out,c provides that,for most of the visa categories,only the employer has standing to file a petition,rendering the alien the beneficiary and,consistent with the premise of the government argument,not an affected party for purposes of standing on administrative appeal the government overlooks,however,the specific within c,which provides that,for special immigrant religious workers,the alien,or any person in the alien behalf has standing to file.for this category of visa petitioner,the alien is not merely a beneficiary,but instead,either directly or through someone on his behalf,has legal standing.thus,contrary to the government position,the affected party authorized to undertake an administrative appeal,even under cis regulations,includes the special immigrant religious worker himself.
the zone of interests test 
even where standing is otherwise satisfied,an aggrieved party may be precluded from pursuing relief if the interest it seeks to vindicate falls outside the zone of interests protected by the statute invoked.lexmark int l,static control components,d.the government argues that alencar lacks this zone of interest or prudential standing,baldly asserting that the ina primary purpose is to protect american workers,while providing employers with limited access to foreign labor,only when absolutely necessary,and therefore aliens do not fall within any interest protected by the statute.appellants reply br.internal citations omitted.however,the test for actions under the apa is not especially demanding,foreclosing suit only when a plaintiff interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it can not reasonably be assumed that congress authorized the plaintiff to sue.lexmark.at quoting match e be nash she wish band of pottawatomi indians patchak,d.
the text of the ina leaves no doubt that the interests of visa petition applicants,and special immigrant religious workers in particular,are directly related to the purposes of the ina.the statute specifies the five categories of workers who receive preferential treatment in the visa process.u.b.for special immigrant religious workers,it provides visas to the aliens themselves,rather than to their employers,b,and it contains an exception to the general disqualification for unlawful work status,so that these workers may still seek permanent residence as long as they have worked no more than days unlawfully.k.further,while other visa applicants require a certification from the department of labor that no qualified americans are available for the job,religious workers need only show that they have the requisite qualifications.compare.b c and a a with b.
in sum,congress has taken affirmative steps in the ina to enable qualified foreign workers to provide services to religious organizations within the united states.see patel,at collecting authority i see also br.of amicus curiae american immigration lawyers association at.we therefore reject the proposition that alencar interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it can not reasonably be assumed that congress intended to permit the suit.lexmark.at quoting match e be nash she wish.at.
