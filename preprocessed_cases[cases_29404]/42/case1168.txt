opinion of the court 
petitioner sang goo park,a citizen of south korea,was ordered removed in,in part for submitting fraudulent documents in support of his visa application.he now claims that,in the years since the removal order,he has become eligible for a i waiver of inadmissibility.he would like the board of immigration appeals bia or board to reopen his removal proceedings so that he might apply for the waiver,but he faces an imposing obstacle.because of the passage of time,his only route to reopening lies through a,commonly known as the sua sponte reopening provision.under that regulation,the bia may reopen a case at any time.the bia has held,however,that it will do so only in extraordinary circumstances.as a result,the bia discretion in this area is broad so broad,in fact,that we have no meaningful way to review it,thereby depriving us of jurisdiction over orders denying sua sponte reopening.
park petition invokes one of the limited exceptions to the rule against review.he argues,as he did before the agency,that the bia has consistently reopened sua sponte for aliens like him who have become eligible for relief from removal after their cases have ended.by ruling consistently in this way,park contends,the bia has established a rule or settled course of adjudication that it is now bound to follow,or at least from which the bia may not depart without explaining itself.park also points to our two precedential opinions interpreting this settled course exception,chehazeh att y and cruz att y as weighing in favor of our ability to review the bia decision.
park petition gives us an opportunity to clarify our jurisprudence surrounding the settled course exception,which originated over a decade ago but has existed since without a framework.in part,this requires us to interpret chehazeh and cruz,which park reads as being broader than they actually are a mistake he is not alone in making.
under the settled course framework we establish below,park neither shows nor allows us to reasonably infer that the bia has constrained its discretion in a way that would allow our review of its decision denying sua sponte reopening.his other arguments in favor of exercising jurisdiction are unavailing.thus,we will dismiss his petition for lack of jurisdiction.
background 
a entry,accusations of fraud,and immigration removal proceedings 
park entered the united states on a visitor visa in some years later,he applied for an adjustment of status based on an approved immigrant petition from his employer.during the adjustment process,authorities discovered that park,a cook,had said on his visa application that he had been employed at an electronics company a falsehood.charged with being inadmissible due to fraud which he contested and for overstaying the visa which he conceded,park insisted that he was unaware of the information in the application that misstated his employment.park did not otherwise apply for relief from removal at the time,he was not eligible for a i waiver of inadmissibility because he lacked a qualifying relative 
in the end,the presiding immigration judge sustained the fraud charge and ordered park deported to south korea.the bia dismissed his appeal,and we denied his petition for review 
about two and a half years later,park filed his first bia motion requesting sua sponte reopening.through new counsel,park argued,in essence,that apparent inconsistencies in his testimony about whether he had signed the visa documents were due to a flawed translation from korean into english.the bia declined to reopen park case,and we dismissed his second petition for review for lack of jurisdiction 
b park second,current motion to reopen sua sponte 
this brings us to the present.in january,park filed a second motion to reopen his removal proceedings sua sponte,this one premised on his new eligibility for a i waiver of inadmissibility.he asserted that his parents,now permanent residents of the united states and,thus,potential qualifying relatives for the waiver,would suffer great hardship if he were removed.park explained that they reside near him in new jersey,depend on him financially,and suffer from mental distress such as depression and even suicidal ideation associated with his immigration situation.tying these threads together,he argued in his motion that the bia has generally reopened proceedings sua sponte and remanded to the ij,where an alien became eligible for relief from removal subsequent to the final order of removal,either the dhs does not oppose the motion or other positive factors are present,citing a series of unpublished bia cases in support 
the bia denied park motion in a short decision.after noting that park had already filed the one motion to reopen authorized by law and had otherwise filed beyond the applicable deadline,the bia briefly addressed sua sponte reopening based on the totality of circumstances presented,we do not find an exceptional situation that would warrant the board exercise of its discretion to reopen sua sponte.
c park current petition for review 
in his petition,park argues primarily that the bia has impermissibly departed from a consistent pattern of administrative decisions rendered in similar cases.through this settled course and pattern,he argues,the bia has constrained its discretion such that we may exercise jurisdiction and review it for abuse.to support this route to our jurisdiction,he relies again on a series of unpublished bia cases,about ten in all although not the same decisions he relied on before the board.
park also raises secondary but related arguments for how we might properly find jurisdiction.for instance,he reads our opinions in chehazeh and cruz the two prior precedential opinions in which we invoked the settled course exception as granting us jurisdiction over orders denying sua sponte reopening for lack of exceptional situations or circumstances.park asks us to find,once we have asserted jurisdiction,that the bia decision was an abuse of its broad discretion,and to remand to the board with instructions to reopen the proceedings so that his eligibility for the i waiver can be fully considered 
ii.legal background of sua sponte reopening 
we begin with a quick summary of the statutory and regulatory scheme and then move to a discussion of sua sponte reopening.since we have not previously developed a framework to guide the settled course exception,we do so below.
a motions to reopen in the bia our jurisdiction in general 
an alien has the right under statute and regulation to file a single motion to reopen his or her removal proceedings,subject to certain limitations and exceptions to those limitations that are not relevant here we ordinarily have jurisdiction to review the bia denial of such a motion,conducting a highly deferential review for abuse of discretion the bia decision is not disturbed unless found to be arbitrary,irrational,or contrary to law.as always,we are limited in our review to the rationale that the agency provides.
b the bia may reopen sua sponte in extraordinary circumstances 
section a of the immigration regulations contains a provision not found in the statute even when an alien might otherwise be ineligible to reopen his or her case,the bia may nevertheless at any time reopen or reconsider on its own motion any case in which it has rendered a decision.because the regulation speaks of the bia acting on its own motion,this is known as sua sponte reopening although since an alien usually has to ask the bia to act,and in a written request at that,the label is technically inapt 
section a does not say what standard the bia is to apply in deciding sua sponte requests to reopen.rather,it says simply that decisions are within the discretion of the board,which has the discretion to deny a motion even if the party moving has made out a prima facie case for relief.in interpreting the scope of its authority under this regulation and its predecessor,the bia has clarified that it will exercise its discretion to reopen sparingly and in exceptional situations only,and will not use sua sponte reopening as a general remedy for any hardships created by enforcement of the time and number limits in the motions regulations.however,while the bia must be persuaded that the situation is truly exceptional before it will intervene,the presence of an exceptional situation does not compel it to act the bia may still decide against reopening 
c because the bia discretion is near absolute,we generally lack jurisdiction to review its decisions denying sua sponte reopening 
over a decade ago,in ashcroft we held that orders by the bia declining to exercise its discretion to reopen sua sponte are functionally unreviewable,unlike other orders on immigration motions to reopen.relying on the supreme court decision in heckler chaney we explained that because the bia discretion is essentially unlimited,we lacked a meaningful standard against which to judge the bia exercise of its discretion.under the teachings of heckler,this left us unable to exercise jurisdiction despite the general presumption in favor of judicial review of agency decisions other courts have reached substantially the same conclusion 
d development of exceptions to the rule against review 
we have developed two exceptions to our rule against review,and while park invokes only one directly,discussion of both helps to illuminate the kinds of decisions we have and have not ruled to be within our jurisdiction.
the first exception we can review the bia reliance on an incorrect legal premise 
the first exception arises when the bia relies on an incorrect legal premise in denying a motion to reopen sua sponte.in pllumi att y,we held that we may exercise jurisdiction in those cases and remand to the bia so that it may exercise its sua sponte authority under the correct legal framework 
the second exception we can review the bia decision when the bia has constrained its discretion through rule or settled course of adjudication 
i the origin of the exception 
the roots of the second exception are found in itself.in the midst of discussing our lack of jurisdiction in that case,we wrote it is true that if an agency announces and follows by rule or by settled course of adjudication a general policy by which its exercise of discretion will be governed,that exercise may be reviewed for abuse.in so stating,we were borrowing secondhand from the supreme court decision in ins yang in which the court explained in the context of the bia denial of a waiver that unfettered agency discretion could be narrowed by settled practice to the point where an irrational departure from that practice might constitute abuse 
although recognized the possibility of an exception,our observation there was simply an aside.there was no settled practice argued by the parties and,as a result,we did not say anything more about this possible exception to our rule against review,such as what might suffice to invoke it.
ii we reaffirm the settled course exception in chehazeh and cruz 
despite its origin in dicta,the settled course exception to the rule against sua sponte review has twice arisen in precedential opinions since,both times in complex cases where it was far from the only moving part.while neither decision sets out a precise framework for how to evaluate the presence of a settled course,the opinions are nevertheless instructive on what kinds of bia decisions we have found to be within our ambit of review.moreover,both opinions reaffirm the basic principle recognized in we have jurisdiction if the bia discretion is bounded 
in the of the two cases,chehazeh att y we recognized that while the bia discretion to deny sua sponte reopening was indeed unfettered,its discretion to grant reopening which it did in chehazeh to the detriment of the alien was not.b ecause the bia has announced and followed a general policy that it will exercise its discretion to reopen only in exceptional situations,we wrote,we may review a decision to reopen to determine whether it was based upon an exceptional situation.
in the earlier of the two cases,cruz att y the bia order denying reopening failed to mention that the alien criminal conviction,which was the sole ground of removability,had been vacated.instead,the bia summarily denied reopening as and found sua sponte action unwarranted for any reason.observing that both our precedent and the bia own precedent suggested that petitioner cruz was no longer removable,we decided in part that the bia cursory order left the basis for its decision unclear.had the bia in fact considered and rejected cruz arguments or had it done something entirely different as we can review only the rationale the bia provides for its decision,this ambiguity created an untenable jurisdictional conundrum.although we did not ultimately decide whether the bia actually had established a general policy of reopening in cases like cruz,we found jurisdiction and remanded for the bia to at least explain logically its unwillingness to reopen cruz case 
iii our nonprecedential cases inconsistently apply the settled course exception 
while chehazeh and cruz are our sole precedential cases dealing with the settled course exception our nonprecedential cases have addressed it several times.those decisions inconsistently locate the moment where a petitioner allegation of a settled course of conduct suffices to transform an unreviewable bia sua sponte decision into a reviewable one.the majority of them consider the sources identified by the petitioner before deciding whether the bia has constrained its discretion and,thus,whether we have jurisdiction in others,however,we have suggested that the allegation of a pattern or settled course is itself sufficient to confer jurisdiction 
e creating a framework for the settled course exception 
we hold today that the approach taken by the majority of our nonprecedential cases is the correct one to follow,and informs the proper framework to use in settled course cases.it is our view that in order to invoke the settled course exception to our rule against review of orders denying sua sponte reopening requests,a petitioner must establish that the bia has limited its discretion via a policy,rule,settled course of adjudication,or by some other method,such that the bia discretion can be meaningfully reviewed for abuse.the petitioner showing must be persuasive enough to allow the reasonable inference that the bia discretion has in fact been limited.our evaluation of the authorities marshaled by the petitioner logically precedes,rather than follows,a finding of jurisdiction to conduct review although we can of course refer to the bia decision from which the petition arises to determine whether it fits into the pattern alleged by the petitioner.this framework follows from our reasoning in agency discretion that has been limited is reviewable and is thus within our jurisdiction 
the key words in the above formulation are meaningfully and reasonable.a policy so broad as to merely redirect the bia discretion,rather than limit it,will probably be insufficient.the same goes for a pattern of dispositions whose contours are not clearly defined or which is not tailored to the petitioner circumstances.
what happens after the petitioner has made this showing will depend on the circumstances of the particular case.we generally act,as we did in cruz,as a final set of eyes.we ensure that the bia has not incorrectly denied reopening to an alien who would ordinarily be entitled to it under the regular course of action,which might happen if the bia overlooks the core of the alien claim.this holds particularly true when the bia has not explained the decision the petitioner seeks to challenge.
the government argues that to the extent bia decisions can establish a policy,practice,or settled course of adjudication,only published,precedential bia decisions should be considered.it is true that we assigned diminished weight to the legal reasoning in and the deference owed to unpublished bia decisions but otherwise,on review,we treat the published and unpublished dispositions of the agency in the same way.moreover,the immigration and nationality act does not distinguish between the two kinds of bia orders,and their effects do not meaningfully differ for the affected aliens there is no apparent principle that removes u
