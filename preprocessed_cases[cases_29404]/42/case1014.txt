the principal issue in this case concerns whether the mandatory requirement of issue exhaustion in asylum cases is also jurisdictional.the supreme court,in eberhart united states,d per curiam,recently cautioned lower federal courts against conflating mandatory with jurisdictional prerequisites to review.we take the court caveat to heart.such a caveat does not,of course,affect the clearly jurisdictional requirement of d that cases of this sort be brought to the executive office for immigration review,an ij and the bia before they can be considered by courts of appeal.nor is it enough to permit a panel of our court to reconsider past holdings that exhaustion of some asylum questions,claims for relief,is jurisdictional.it is a reason,however,for us to treat as not jurisdictional,though mandatory and hence waivable the requirement of issue exhaustion,something as to which our court has spoken,though we believe not definitively held.as will be apparent,the question is determinative of the asylum case before us.
petitioner lin zhong lin,a citizen of the people republic of china,seeks review of a november,decision of the board of immigration appeals bia,which summarily affirmed an immigration judge ij january,denial of lin application for asylum and withholding of removal under the immigration and nationality act of ina,and for relief under article of the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat,treaty doc,
lin removal from the united states was first ordered in,following an ij determination that,under the version of the ina,lin had failed to establish that he had been persecuted or was likely to be persecuted by the chinese government on account of his political opinion.but in,lin,who had not yet been deported sought and obtained reopening of his application in order to be considered for relief under intervening changes in implementation of cat and the passage of the illegal immigration reform and immigration responsibility act of iirira,which expanded the ina definition of political persecution to include some coercive population control programs see c implementing cat iirira a,div.c,stat,amending the definition of persecution in a.in january,the same ij who had presided over lin hearing denied lin reopened application.the bia summarily affirmed this new denial,and lin now petitions for review of that final decision.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that some of the ij findings were supported by substantial evidence,while others were marked by significant legal errors.although several of those errors were not specifically raised in lin appeal to the bia,respondent opposition to our review of lin petition did not assert lin failure to exhaust.given respondent lack of objection,we hold that we may consider the merits of those arguments.furthermore,because we can not say with confidence that the ij errors did not affect his disposition of lin application,we grant lin petition for review,vacate the final order of removal,and remand lin application to the bia.
background 
because the ij decision rests,in part,on the record from lin hearing,we begin our review of the relevant background with an account of lin entry into the united states and his initial removal proceedings.
the proceedings 
lin entered the united states on or about april,through new orleans,louisiana he was deemed inadmissible and was taken into custody by the immigration and naturalization service ins he remained in custody until june,when he was released on bond.on july,lin,through counsel,successfully moved to transfer venue of his case to new york city,and on september,lin applied for political asylum.
lin form request for asylum asserted that he had been persecuted by chinese authorities because of his family violation of china population control policy.the narrative portion of the form stated that lin had two children,born in and,and that the birth of his second child was unauthorized under chinese family planning laws.as a result,the younger child could not be registered in the family household registration book until lin paid a fine of yuan in.
his application further attested that at the end of,lin wife became pregnant for a third time,and that she was forced to undergo an abortion after family planning officials were informed of the pregnancy.following this abortion,lin himself was ordered to undergo sterilization,and he fled to a friend house.family planning cadres sought lin at his home,and,not finding him there,destroyed some of lin property as punishment.lin wife became pregnant for a fourth time at the end of,and she was subjected to another forcible abortion.once again family planning officials pursued and threatened to arrest lin for sterilization.but lin,following a friend warning,had already left his home in january,ultimately to come to the united states.lin stated that,if returned to china,he would be subject to forcible sterilization and imprisonment because of his violation of china family planning laws.
a hearing on lin application took place before an ij on december.lin,represented by counsel,testified on his own behalf and recounted many of the same facts that he had included in his written application in doing so,he added some further details.he described the fine of yuan for the birth of his second son,as well as his wife third pregnancy at the end of and the forcible abortion of this pregnancy.he dated this first abortion as occurring after the april discovery of his wife pregnancy by the family planning cadres.at the time of this abortion,lin received his first notification that he must submit to sterilization.in order to avoid the procedure,he went into hiding approximately six kilometers from his home.he returned home after three months,upon payment,by his parents and his wife,of a fine of yuan.in july,around the time that lin returned from hiding,his wife was implanted with an iud.approximately ten days later,lin and his wife had the device removed by a private doctor,and soon thereafter,lin wife became pregnant for a fourth time.a government iud check led to the discovery of that pregnancy,and lin wife was forced to undergo a second abortion in december.following this second abortion,family planning officials again sought lin for sterilization,but based on a friend warning,lin had already fled.shortly after,lin left china for the united states 
lin verbal account of the events surrounding his wife december abortion also described an episode not mentioned in his form.lin testified that family planning cadres took his wife to the hospital for the procedure.lin went with them,and while waiting for his wife to emerge from the operating room,he became distraught at the situation.he began verbally to abuse the family planning cadres,calling them murderers and shouting slogans against family planning policy.other individuals in the hospital waiting room were sympathetic and joined in.as a result of this impromptu protest,family planning officials attempted to arrest lin,but he managed to escape 
the ij denied lin application for asylum and withholding of removal in an oral decision of december.this decision was never appealed to the bia.
changes in law and proceedings 
subsequent to the ij decision,two changes in the law applicable to asylum and withholding of removal claims occurred.first,in,congress amended the ina to extend the definition of a political refugee,for purposes of asylum and withholding of removal claims,to individuals subjected to forced abortions or sterilizations,or who were otherwise persecuted for opposition to coercive population control programs.see iirira a,div.c,tit.iii,stat,amending a the following year,the bia interpreted the amended a as making the spouses of individuals who were forced to undergo sterilizations or abortions per se eligible for asylum.see in re,bia see also shi liang lin dep t of justice,cir recounting the changing legislative and administrative positions regarding persecution through family planning in immigration law.
second,in,congress passed legislation to implement,in the immigration context,the convention against torture.see foreign affairs reform and reconstruction act of,div.c,stat,codified as note to.the following year,the attorney general promulgated implementing regulations requiring that withholding of removal be granted to any alien who establishes that it is more likely than not that he or she would be subject to torture if returned to his or her country of removal.see c see also wang ashcroft,cir recounting this legislative history.
on june,following these changes in the law,lin,who had not yet been deported,moved to reopen his application for asylum and withholding of removal,seeking to be considered for relief under the iirira family planning amendment and the new cat regulations.lin submitted a supplemental affidavit in support of his motion.that affidavit stated that if removed to china,lin was likely to suffer torture based on his past subversive activities,on the chinese government demonstrated desire forcibly to sterilize him,and on his violation of chinese laws.after lin motion to reopen was granted,lin submitted additional documentary evidence in support of his asylum and withholding claims,including chinese household registration documents and an affidavit from his wife.
a hearing on lin reopened application was conducted on november,before the same ij who had presided over lin hearing.at this second hearing,lin testified to the following of which were either not discussed in or contradictions of lin testimony.
lin stated that he was married with two sons,one born april,and the second born november.during lin wife second pregnancy,she went into hiding at a friend and relative,and also at her mother home,six kilometers away.lin added that he was fined yuan for the birth of this second son,and that the fine was paid in december,thereby allowing lin to register the child with the government.
according to his version of events,lin wife was implanted with iuds on three separate occasions.the first was after the birth of lin first son.lin and his wife had that iud removed two months later,and the second son was subsequently conceived.another iud was implanted after the second birth,and this device remained in place until.nevertheless,lin wife became pregnant for a third time in.because the iud had failed,lin sought permission for the pregnancy from the chinese government.this request was denied,and lin wife was forced to undergo her first abortion in october rather than,as he testified in,in april.following this abortion,a third iud was implanted.this,too,was removed by a private doctor,and lin wife became pregnant for a fourth time in october.lin testified,as he had in,that this pregnancy was discovered during a routine iud check in november,and that lin wife was subsequently ordered to undergo a second abortion 
as in,lin testified in to having been twice threatened with forcible sterilization by the family planning authorities.the first time,he stated,was after his wife first abortion in october.lin again recounted that he went into hiding to avoid the procedure,and that while he was away,government authorities looking for him searched his home and destroyed some of his property.consistent with his prior descriptions,lin testified that he returned home following his family payment of a fine of yuan.but in contrast to his testimony that he was away for three months,this time lin stated that he fled for approximately ten days.as in,lin testified to a second sterilization threat that occurred following his wife second abortion in late.lin again described that he had learned from a friend that family planning cadres intended to come to his home to take him for sterilization.this prompted lin to flee his home and to leave china for the united states.
as in his first hearing,lin testified that during his wife second abortion,he engaged in conduct at the hospital.his testimony in,however,outlined a less dramatic set of events than those he had described in.lin stated that while he was in the hospital waiting room he was very emotional and resented the birth control policy and said that the policy was not good and that the birth control cadres were inhumane.in response,he was pushed into the security section of the hospital.when his wife emerged from the surgery she was very weak,and lin left the hospital to assist her back home.
when the ij asked lin to account for the discrepancy between his two accounts of the events at the hospital surrounding his wife second abortion,and in particular,the circumstances of his departure,lin floundered,saying that he had been nervous in,and the account given that day was wrong.the ij also questioned lin concerning the differences between his and accounts of the sequence of his wife iud insertions and abortions,and the time during which he was in hiding after the first threatened sterilization.lin stated that he had been mistaken in his testimony,and that during the intervening time,he had spoken with his wife who had corrected him concerning the dates of her medical procedures.he also said,with respect to the period he spent in hiding,that he had made mistakes in because he was nervous and because the law firm representing him had prepared him in a way that he did not understand.
finally,lin testified at the hearing that he feared that if he returned to china he would be persecuted for having been smuggled out.he added that the chinese government was cracking down on smuggling in his home province,and that his wife recently had told him,over the telephone,that a neighbor who was unsuccessful in being smuggled out of china had been arrested and beaten by government authorities,and fined yuan.with respect to his own story,lin testified that his friends and family made arrangements for him to leave the country.a snakehead gave lin papers and a valid passport,which he showed to officials at the time of his departure.
during the hearing,the ij also discussed certain facts contained in lin wife affidavit.the affidavit gave an essentially identical account of the events testified to by lin in,but with respect to her own period of hiding,lin wife stated that she had hidden far away at a friend place.the ij asked why lin wife affidavit asserted that she stayed far away if,as lin had testified,her mother home was only six kilometers away.lin responded that his home was not the only place she went,she went to different places.
at a proceeding on january,the ij delivered his oral decision denying lin application.at the start of this hearing lin counsel informed the ij,for the first time,that lin wife had undertaken divorce proceedings.the ij stated that this development has no bearing on this application and made no further inquiry into this subject,and neither lin nor his counsel offered any further details.
the ij decision on january,found that lin testimony was not credible,and on that basis concluded that lin had failed to meet his burden of proof with respect to any of his claims for relief.the ij stated that significant discrepancies between lin testimony at the hearing of november,and at the prior hearing before this very court on december,suggest strongly that lin was not testifying from actual experience,but that he was actually fabricating testimony.the ij pointed to two categories of discrepancies in support of his conclusion a lin changed testimony concerning the dates of his wife medical procedures and his period in hiding following his wife first abortion,and b lin differing accounts of his alleged hospital protest during his wife second abortion.with respect to these inconsistencies,as well as lin explanations for them,the ij stated 
while the court can understand that the applicant wife would be able to more accurately recall the dates when the iuds were inserted removed and when the abortions took place.sic even if the court were to overlook these discrepancies in the applicant testimony,he has not been able to explain why he fabricated the story about leading others in slogans at the hospital and then escaping from the hospital,and that the cadres were chasing him.
now clearly,this is the type of discrepancy that strongly suggests,well does just suggest,it is direct evidence that the applicant has fabricated his story because there is absolutely no way that someone,because that person is nervous or simply makes a mistake,will casually say under oath that they were shouting slogans and the cadres were chasing him,when in fact this never happened.
the ij also discussed,with respect to lin claim of his wife forced abortions,three aspects of lin documentary evidence an inconsistency between lin testimony that his wife had,during her second pregnancy,gone into hiding at her mother house six kilometers away,and his wife statement in her affidavit that she had hidden far away an apparent discrepancy between lin testimony that his second son was not registered until a fine was paid in december,and the household registry submitted by lin that appeared to indicate that both sons were registered in february and purported variations in dates of registration between a translated household registry and an untranslated registry submitted by lin.the ij also observed that,in light of a state department country report indicating that certificates were issued only for voluntary abortions,lin testimony that he had received such certificates in and belied his claim that the procedures were coerced 
concerning lin future persecution and torture claims,the ij found a that any threat of sterilization faced by lin had been removed by the pendency of his divorce proceedings,b that lin account of having been smuggled from china was burdened by inconsistencies relating to the circumstances of his departure,and c that lin description of his neighbor persecution for smuggling was never mentioned in lin written statement supporting his cat claim.finally,the ij stated with respect to lin cat claim that,even assuming that a threat of sterilization remained for lin,the ij could not find that as a matter of law,sterilization is tantamount to an act of torture.
the bia appeal 
lin timely appealed the ij decision to the bia.his notice of appeal asserted that the ij erred in determining that lin hearing testimony was inconsistent with that presented in.lin elaborated that the ij erred by rejecting lin explanation for his new testimony about the dates of his wife iud insertions and,that he had discussed the issue with his wife in the intervening years,by failing to appreciate that lin testimony regarding his wife experiences was given in the context of asylum law,and by concluding that lin story concerning his sloganeering and detention at the time of his wife second abortion was fabricated,and that this fabrication called into question lin claim that his wife had undergone forcible abortions.additionally,lin contended that his asylum claim had been corroborated,inter alia,by his wife affidavit and by household registration documents.finally,the brief asserted that lin had established that his fears of coercive sterilization and punishment for violation of china exit laws were reasonable and credible.
on november,the bia summarily affirmed the decision of the ij.
arguments raised by lin petition for review 
lin petition for review by us is an extensive list of challenges to the ij decision.several of lin arguments restate or closely track the points made in his appeal to the bia.several other ij errors asserted in lin current petition for review,however,were not argued in lin appeal to the bia.these include that the ij incorrectly found lin account of his wife period in hiding to be not credible that the ij erred in relying on a household registration booklet not placed into evidence that the ij wrongly premised a finding that lin wife abortions must have been voluntary on information contained in a state department country report that the ij had no basis in the record for his finding that lin pending divorce removed any future threat of sterilization in china and that the ij conclusion that forcible sterilization did not amount to torture was legal error 
lin petition also preemptively argued the jurisdiction of this court to hear issues not argued to the bia.had we been urged by the respondent not to review the arguments that lin failed to raise before the bia,we would likely be bound not to consider their merits.see d foster ins,cir per curiam theodoropoulos ins,cir.but for reasons discussed below,in light of the respondent failure to challenge lin petition for review on exhaustion grounds,we will review all of the issues raised in the petition 
ii.discussion 
eligibility for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief 
asylum under the ina,withholding of removal under the ina,and withholding of removal under the cat require applicants to satisfy distinct burdens of proof.a petitioner burden to establish eligibility is lighter in the context of an asylum claim,but the power to grant such relief lies in the discretion of the attorney general.see jin shui qiu ashcroft,cir.withholding of removal,under either the ina or the cat,requires a greater quantum of proof,though relief is mandatory once an applicant establishes eligibility.id.
to establish eligibility for asylum,an applicant must demonstrate that he is a refugee within the meaning of the,that he has suffered past persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,or that he has a fear of future persecution.see b a islami gonzales,cir.if a petitioner seeks asylum based on a showing of past persecution,that is only the first of two hurdles that an alien must meet in order to merit a favorable exercise of discretion.islami,at internal quotation marks omitted.a showing of past persecution triggers a rebuttable presumption of future persecution,which the government can defeat,inter alia,by demonstrating a change in conditions in the country of origin that eliminates the danger.id.on the other hand,where a fear of future persecution is demonstrated,an applicant for asylum need not additionally establish the existence of past persecution in order to be eligible for relief.id.
withholding of removal also requires an applicant to show that he or she falls within one of the categories designated for refugee status by the ina.but to obtain this form of relief,an applicant must clear the higher hurdle of showing that it is more likely than not that,were he or she to be deported,his life or freedom would be threatened on account of the characteristic rendering him or her a refugee.see b a islami,at zhou yun zhang ins,cir.
similarly,an individual seeking withholding of removal on the basis of a claim under the cat must establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.ramsameachire ashcroft,cir quoting c.torture is defined,for purposes of a cat withholding claim,as any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person by persons acting in an official capacity.a see also ramsameachire,at discussing same.
judicial review of final agency determinations 
factual findings by the bia are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.our court interprets this statutory language as a statement of the substantial evidence standard,which requires that an ij findings be supported by reasonable,substantial and probative evidence in the record.islami,at jin shui qiu,at substantial evidence review in the immigration context is slightly stricter than the standard that the circuit courts typically apply in reviewing a district court factual findings,yet we will not reverse the ij simply because we disagree with his evaluation of the facts.quoting aruta ins,cir.where,as here,the bia summarily affirms an ij decision pursuant to its streamlining regulations,e i,we directly review the factual and legal findings contained in the opinion of the ij.see dhoumo bia,cir per curiam.
when reviewing an ij credibility findings,we afford particular deference in applying the substantial evidence standard.zhou yun zhang ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this deference is at its highest point where an ij credibility determinations are based on observation of the applicant demeanor but it ebbs where credibility determinations are based on analysis of testimony.see jin chen dep t of justice,cir.in reviewing an ij conclusions regarding credibility,we examine whether the ij has provided specific,cogent reasons for the adverse credibility finding and whether those reasons bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.zhou yun zhang,at quoting ins,cir.
questions of law,including what quantum of evidence will suffice to discharge an applicant burden of proof,are reviewed de novo.islami,at.and,an ij use of an inappropriately stringent standard in assessing an applicant testimony is a legal,rather than a factual,error.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
our review of decisions by the bia is governed by the recognition that a judicial judgment can not be made to do service for an administrative judgment.li hua lin dep t of justice,wl,at cir.june,quoting sec chenery.stemming from this foundational principle,a denial of immigration relief stands or falls on the reasons given by the ij or bia,li zu guan ins,wl at cir.june,because it would usurp the role of the agency for a reviewing court t o assume a hypothetical basis for the ij determination,even one based in the record,cao he lin dep t of justice,cir.except in rare circumstances,then,the proper course is to remand to the agency for additional explanation or investigation.twum ins,cir quoting ins ventura,d per curiam.
yet agency errors do not always warrant remand,and our circuit has recently developed standards for determining whether remand of asylum or withholding claims would amount to an empty and unnecessary formality.see li zu guan,wl at.we have determined that remand to the bia is futile a when the ij articulates an alternative and sufficient basis for her determination b when her reliance on the erroneous aspect of her reasoning is substantially tangential to her findings or c when overwhelming evidence in the record makes it clear that the same decision is inevitable on remand,or,in short,whenever the reviewing panel is confident that the agency would reach the same result upon a reconsideration cleansed of errors.li hua lin,wl at relying on cao he lin,at and xiao ji chen dep t of justice,cir.implementing this test within the confines of chenery requires a careful balancing,which different panels dealing with diverse fact patterns may well strike differently.see ming xia chen bia,cir stating,in the context of panels differing assessments of adverse credibility findings,that p anels will have to do what judges always do in similar circumstances apply their best judgment,guided by the statutory standard governing review and the holdings of our precedents,to the administrative decision and the record assembled to support it.
with these delicate standards in mind,we turn to the specific issues raised by lin petition for review.
c.our jurisdiction to consider issues not raised below 
our jurisdiction to hear the full scope of arguments presented in lin petition for review has not been contested.several issues raised in that petition,however,were not included in lin brief on appeal to the bia,and as discussed below,they alter the proper disposition of lin petition for review in light of our court doctrine of issue exhaustion and the government failure to invoke this doctrine,we must consider the nature of issue exhaustion under the ina and its potential for waiver by a party.
the judicial review provision of the ina states that we may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.d.thus,in the context of lin asylum and withholding of removal claims,we have jurisdiction to review the final order of removal entered against lin,so long as a decision has been rendered on his application by an ij and appealed to the two administrative remedies available to him as of right see b,b see also theodoropoulos ins,cir holding that a petitioner express waiver of his right to appeal to the bia deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction to hear his subsequent petition for review.we have repeatedly characterized this exhaustion of administrative remedies as mandatory.see ivanishvili dep t of justice,cir gill ins,cir foster,at.in the present case,lin pursued and completed both tiers of administrative review.
the question we face in the instant case is whether the exhaustion of administrative remedies available to the alien as of right further requires,as a matter of statutory jurisdiction,that an immigration petitioner raise before the bia all issues contained within his or her petition for review to this court,or whether,instead,the requirement of issue exhaustion is a one that is subject to waiver.sims apfel,d contrasting,in the social security context,exhaustion of administrative remedies with issue exhaustion.while our court has consistently applied an issue exhaustion requirement to petitions for review from the bia,we have not evaluated the origin of this requirement,and thus its susceptibility to waiver by the government.
in some recent cases,our court has spoken in a manner that seemed to conflate d statutory jurisdictional requirement of exhaustion of remedies with the separate requirement of exhaustion of issues.but we did so without exploring the distinction.compare,theodoropoulos,at stating,in the context of a habeas petitioner failure to appeal an ij decision to the bia,that this failure to exhaust administrative remedies deprived the district court of subject matter jurisdiction to entertain his habeas petition and ins,cir finding that a petitioner triggered a clear jurisdictional bar based on failure to exhaust administrative remedies when he had voluntarily departed during pendency of his bia appeal,which constituted a withdrawal of his appeal to the agency,with foster,at citing theodoropoulos and for the proposition that,where the ins challenged the petitioner failure to raise before the bia all issues contained in the petition for review,a failure to exhaust statutory exhaustion requirements such as d constitutes a clear jurisdictional bar internal quotations omitted 
we now find ourselves obliged to face squarely the nature of our issue exhaustion requirement.in undertaking this inquiry,we are mindful of the supreme court recent admonition that inferior courts must use great caution in distinguishing mandatory from jurisdictional rules.see eberhart united states,d per curiam clarity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the label jurisdictional not for rules,but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases jurisdiction and the persons personal jurisdiction falling within a court adjudicatory authority.quoting kontrick ryan,d.our court recently performed this task of clarification in the context of exhaustion requirements for the employee retirement income security act erisa a b,a b,finding that such requirements were a affirmative defense.see paese hartford life accident ins,cir describing the court task as to determine whether the administrative exhaustion requirement under erisa a b is truly jurisdictional in the article iii sense,or is more akin to a rule,which would be an affirmative defense subject to equitable considerations such as waiver,estoppel or futility.
the use of jurisdictional language in cases like foster,none of which expressly considered the question of whether the attorney general might waive an argument as to issue exhaustion,can not,without more,be held to govern cases in which the government has failed to raise an exhaustion argument.today we hold a that d does not make issue exhaustion a statutory jurisdictional requirement,b that as a result,a failure to exhaust specific issues may be waived by the attorney general,c that in the case before us such a waiver occurred,and d that,therefore,in our discretion we may choose to review lin arguments not previously made to the bia.
our conclusion in this regard rests primarily on the language of d,which,as the eighth circuit has noted,does not expressly proscribe judicial review of issues not raised in the course of exhausting all administrative remedies see gonzales,cir while some statutes governing judicial review of administrative agency decisions explicitly require exhaustion of issues the exhaustion requirement of d does not do so by its terms.in contrast,as the supreme court observed in sims,congress has,in other contexts,expressly written issue exhaustion requirements into statutes.see sims,at.noting that the court prior cases addressing issue exhaustion reflect the fact that requirements of administrative issue exhaustion are largely creatures of statute see also,e national labor relations act provision proscribing judicial review of any objection that has not been urged before the board,its member,agent,or agency a securities and exchange act of provision providing that judicial review of an order of the securities and exchange commission is limited to objection s urged before the commission.
in the absence of an express statutory requirement,the supreme court,interpreting the social security act,has said that it is not necessarily the case that an requirement is an important corollary of any requirement of exhaustion of remedies.sims,at.see also id.at.holding that a judicially created requirement is inappropriate in the context of social security proceedings.moreover,the high court has also suggested that the same distinction applied to exhaustion requirements for federal habeas review.the court stated that a habeas petitioner who has defaulted his federal claims in state court meets the technical requirements for exhaustion there are no state remedies any longer available to him.coleman thompson,d emphasis added.significantly,the exhaustion requirement in the current version of b,as well as in the version at issue in coleman,closely tracks the language of d see theodoropoulos,at t he exhaustion requirement set forth in d echoes that in.compare b an application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the state,with d a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.
we are persuaded,both on the language of d and on these authorities,that the exhaustion of all administrative remedies available to an alien as of right under d does not a statutory a petitioner for relief from removal raise to the bia each issue presented in his or her petition for judicial review.therefore,in the context of d,the failure to exhaust individual issues before the bia does not deprive this court of subject matter jurisdiction to consider those issues.
that conclusion does not mean,however,that petitioners seeking review of their removal orders are ordinarily excused from issue exhaustion.quite the contrary.normally,the requirement of d that federal courts review only final orders of removal has the effect of imposing a bar to the review of issues not raised to the bia.that requirement has been read by us,by the supreme court,and by other circuits to mean that when the bia issues an opinion in a petitioner administrative appeal,and that opinion constitutes the final agency determination,we may consider only those issues that formed the basis for that decision.see,jin shui qiu,at stating that we may affirm a decision of the bia only upon the basis of such reasoning as was applied by the board see also sec chenery.a reviewing court,in dealing with a determination or judgment which an administrative agency alone is authorized to make,must judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.yatskin ins,cir a reviewing court should judge the action of an administrative agency based only on reasoning provided by the agency.
it follows that,when an applicant for asylum or withholding of removal has failed to exhaust an issue before the bia,and that issue is,therefore,not addressed in a reasoned bia decision,we are,by virtue of the final order requirement of d,usually unable to review the argument.gill,at holding,in a case involving a reasoned opinion by the bia,that we may consider specific,subsidiary legal arguments,or arguments by extension,that were not made below where the petitioner did raise all bases for relief and general issues to the bia.
but such is not the case when,as here,the bia order is not the agency determination we review.when the bia invokes its summary affirmance authority pursuant to its streamlining regulations,the decision of the ij constitutes the final agency determination,see e,and the entirety of that both issues that were and issues that were not raised to the before us on review.see yu sheng zhang dep t of justice,cir per curiam stating,in upholding the bia streamlining regulations,that b ecause we may not affirm the bia on grounds that it did not explicitly adopt,our review will necessarily be confined to the reasoning of the ij internal quotation marks omitted see also albathani ins,cir because the summary affirmance is only of the result and not the reasoning,this means that courts of appeals are forced to review a decision which may or may not contain the reasoning of the bia.the court thus reviews the bia decision without knowing its basis the courts will continue to have the ij decision and the record upon which it is based available for review.
for this reason,the first circuit recently opted to exercise the attorney general issues that an asylum petitioner had not fully developed before the bia.see singh gonzales,cir rejecting the attorney general claim that an alien objections to an ij rejection of his withholding of removal and cat claims were unexhausted where the claims had been only perfunctor ily raised in a bia appellate brief,and reasoning that because the bia invoked its summary affirmance procedure,it had affirmed the entire opinion of the ij.
that said,the fact that courts of appeals are not from reviewing issues not raised to the bia does not mean that they must or,ordinarily,will consider such arguments.doctrines of issue exhaustion,which courts invoke even in the absence of statutory exhaustion requirements as an analogy to the rule that appellate courts will not consider arguments not raised before trial courts,sims,at,will usually mean that issues not raised to the bia will not be examined by the reviewing court.consistent with the strong prudential rationale for requiring all issues raised on appeal to have been presented below,our circuit applies an issue exhaustion doctrine to petitions for review from the bia.see,foster,at to preserve a claim,we require p etitioner to raise issues to the bia in order to preserve them for judicial review.internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted gill,at reading our past precedents as barring the consideration of bases for relief that were not raised below,and of general issues that were not raised below although we have never held that a petitioner is limited to the exact contours of his argument below.
in contrast to statutory exhaustion,however,judicial exhaustion permits courts,in their discretion,to waive administrative exhaustion under certain circumstances.bastek fed.crop ins,cir see also id.at setting forth criteria used by courts in deciding whether to waive the judicial administrative exhaustion requirement see also beharry ashcroft,cir discussing the distinction between statutory and exhaustion requirements.
in the present action,we deem the attorney general silence on the petitioner issue exhaustion problem to constitute a waiver and waiver by a party is,of course,among the reasons courts may excuse exhaustion requirements see johnson testman,cir the context of a mandatory,but exhaustion the failure to exhaust available administrative remedies is an affirmative defense that is waiveable see also granberry greer,d holding that a state may,even inadvertently,waive the federal habeas exhaustion requirement,cited in day mcdonough,d mathews eldridge,d t he secretary of health,education,and welfare may waive the exhaustion requirement if he satisfies himself,at any stage of the administrative process,that no further review is warranted either because the internal needs of the agency are fulfilled or because the relief that is sought is beyond his power to confer.weinberger salfi,d in the present case the secretary of health,education,and welfare does not raise any challenge to the sufficiency of the allegations of exhaustion in appellees complaint.we interpret this to be a determination by him that for the purposes of this litigation the reconsideration determination is final.the named appellees thus satisfy the statutory requirements for judicial review 
significantly,we have reached an analogous holding in the context of the exhaustion requirement of the prison litigation reform act of,tit.viii,d,stat,a,which provides that no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section of this title,or any other federal law,by a prisoner until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.a.exhaustion of remedies under the plra is a mandatory requirement,yet we have distinguished it from a jurisdictional predicate to our ability to hear the appeal.handberry thompson,cir see also richardson goord,cir per curiam holding that exhaustion under the plra is not jurisdictional,but is nevertheless mandatory.based on this distinction,we have found that the failure to exhaust available administrative remedies is an affirmative defense that is waivable.handberry,at internal quotation marks and alternations omitted.
we likewise hold here that even though d makes exhaustion of administrative remedies a predicate of our subject matter jurisdiction,the fact that the statute does not make exhaustion of issues a prerequisite for jurisdiction means that the failure to exhaust specific issues before the bia is no more than an affirmative defense subject to waiver.see generally abbey sullivan,cir stating that the social security act,g,has a,jurisdictional element as well as a waivable,prudential element.
in the instant case,we are confident that the purposes of our issue exhaustion requirements have been served.the ij,to whom all the matters before us were raised,was the source of the decision that we review,the full agency record is available to us,no additional factfinding is necessary,and the government is not concerned that the adversary proceedings below were incomplete.see salfi,at.exhaustion is generally required as a matter of preventing premature interference with agency processes,so that the agency may function efficiently and so that it may have an opportunity to correct its own errors,to afford the parties and the courts the benefit of its experience and expertise,and to compile a record which is adequate for judicial review.united states copeland,cir stating that purpose of the administrative exhaustion requirement is to ensure that the agency has an opportunity to correct its errors and develop a full evidentiary record.united states perez,cir noting that,although the defendant,who sought collaterally to challenge his order of deportation,had failed to raise expressly an ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the bia,the record reflected that the bia was fully aware of the petitioner contentions in that regard.
we conclude that neither a statutory mandate nor our prudential exhaustion doctrine requires that,where the government has waived issue exhaustion problems,we must exclude from our consideration those issues omitted from an appeal to the bia and,in light of the government silence on the matter of exhaustion,we invoke our discretion to excuse issue exhaustion in this case.moreover,as further developed below,issues not raised to the bia are essential to our view of the merits of lin appeal.while lin argued to the bia three important errors in the ij reasoning,his appellate brief to the agency left unchallenged a number of other bases for the ij adverse credibility determination.in such a case,where the ij,in his adverse credibility finding,relies on multiple grounds,some of which are weak or erroneous,we must review the totality of the ij decision,borovikova dep t of justice,cir,and determine whether the ij has articulated an alternative and sufficient basis for her factual finding that would render remand futile,li hua lin,wl at.in the present case,as again discussed below,lin petition for review to us successfully challenges several bases for the ij conclusions in addition to those lin raised before the bia.these challenges,which were not made to the bia,when added to the errors articulated in lin bia appeal,mean that we can not be confident that the agency would reach the same result upon a reconsideration cleansed of errors.id.
d.the merits of lin appeal 
having found jurisdiction to consider in full the petition for review before us,we evaluate all of the errors alleged.with respect to the ij adverse credibility finding,lin challenges a the ij treatment of inconsistencies between lin and testimony,and b the ij analysis of some of lin corroborative documentation.in particular,lin argues that the ij erred in his treatment of inconsistencies as to the hospital protest,in his assertion of inconsistencies regarding lin wife abortion and pregnancy dates,in his finding of inconsistencies in the description of lin wife period in hiding,in his handling of lin household registration booklets,and,most importantly,in his treatment of the question of whether lin wife abortions were voluntary.in addition to these errors pertaining to credibility,lin argues that the ij improperly assessed the future risk of sterilization by overestimating the legal impact of lin planned divorce and by determining that forced sterilization was not an act of torture encompassed by the cat 
we address each of these arguments in turn,and find merit in several of lin contentions.
inconsistencies regarding lin protest at the hospital 
as he argued to the bia,lin first contends that the ij exaggerated the difference between the and accounts of lin alleged protest at the hospital,and,as a result,erroneously relied upon those inconsistencies in doubting lin credibility concerning his wife abortions.although we are largely unpersuaded by lin efforts to minimize his shifting accounts of the hospital protest,we are nonetheless concerned by the ij holding that lin lack of credibility as to that event impugned lin account of his wife forced abortions.
as a factual matter,the record supports the ij determination that the and versions of lin conduct at the hospital during his wife second abortion were inconsistent as set forth above,lin particular the alleged participation of other individuals at the hospital and lin narrow escape from the from the account in which lin was a solitary actor,was briefly detained,but was allowed to leave at the conclusion of his wife surgery.
yet the identification of testimonial inconsistencies does not end our inquiry.as frequently has been held,while an ij application of the maxim falsus in uno,falsus in omnibus may at times be appropriate,an applicant testimonial,at times,even outright be weighed in light of their significance to the total context of his or her claim of persecution.see,at diallo ins,cir in re,bia see also yongo ins,cir obviously there are some lies that,because of their circumstances and limited relationship to the main issue,do relatively little to discredit other statements.testimonial inconsistencies are not sufficient as the sole basis for an adverse credibility finding where the inconsistencies do not concern the basis for the claim of asylum or withholding,but rather matters collateral or ancillary to the claim,at emphasis added see also borovikova dep t of justice,cir.
this principle inherently includes a dimension of proportionality,that the agency has properly assessed the scale of the inconsistency in the context of the balance of the alien testimony.in ins,cir,we used the example that one might easily and quickly characterize a person shopping for groceries as forgetful if,after being instructed to buy four specific grocery items,he or she failed to purchase one and got the wrong brand of another on the other hand,the evaluation of a person making the same errors after an instruction to purchase twenty specific items would almost certainly not be the same.id.at.in other words,the significance of an inconsistency can be overstated or understated if viewed in isolation,and overstatement is especially likely where the inconsistency bears little on the applicant claim.
the legal significance of lin inconsistency regarding the hospital protest,therefore,depends on the basis of lin claim for asylum.when the agency reopened lin claim in in view of the amended definition of refugee under the ina,lin wife forced abortions acquired new significance.as stated by the ij himself,the key issue for lin reopened application was whether lin was the spouse of a person who had been compelled to abort a pregnancy,within the meaning of in re,at,and the ij made his adverse credibility finding regarding the hospital protest in the context of that claim.forcible abortions of his wife pregnancies,then,were the heart of lin claim in,and the ij adverse credibility inferences regarding the incident at the hospital must be understood in that context.thus situated,we find that the change in testimony regarding the scale of lin objection to government policy to have been a relatively minor discrepancy at the periphery of lin claim for relief.see diallo,at,at.
significantly,as to the two alleged abortions and two threats of sterilization,lin testimony at both his and hearings was consistent except in the dating of the first abortion.applying our reasoning in,lin consistency with respect to myriad details at the heart his claim for persecution is an important setting for assessing his credibility.see at.and,as discussed below,the ij found that lin wife affidavit corroborated the occurrence of the forced abortions.the testimonial inconsistencies about the scope and details of lin behavior at the might fatally undermine lin claim to asylum if based on episodes of not sufficiently weighty to overcome the consistency of numerous core facts relating to lin claim for asylum based on his spouse forced abortions.as a result,while we can not deem erroneous the ij factual finding of testimonial embellishment with respect to lin expression of dissent at the hospital,we conclude that these testimonial differences can not on their own bear dispositive weight with respect to lin claims that his spouse had been forced to abort two pregnancies.
inconsistencies regarding the chronology of lin wife medical procedures 
the ij did,however,provide other grounds for his adverse credibility finding.the ij correctly noted that lin testimony in concerning his wife abortions and iud insertions had changed from in certain particulars.first,lin later testimony added several details,and in one instance corrected a date,regarding the insertion and removal of iuds between his wife pregnancies.second,lin gave a different date for his wife first abortion.lin acknowledged these variances,stating at the hearing that in he had been incorrect concerning the dates of certain events,and that in the interim,he had spoken to his wife,who had a better memory of the chronology,because they related to events that had affected her most directly.lin now argues,as he did to the bia,that the ij erred in assessing these omissions and inconsistencies.
the legal significance of the omissions in lin testimony must be gauged in the light of what he was claiming at that hearing as against his claims in.as discussed,at lin first hearing,the details concerning his wife medical procedures were significantly less relevant to lin asylum claim in,as lin was not then claiming asylum based on the persecution of his spouse.see,at see also mece gonzales,cir if presented discrepancies can not be viewed as attempts by the applicant to enhance his claim of persecution,they have no bearing on credibility.the addition of further detail,and even improved accuracy,regarding the specific chronology of lin wife abortions was a purpose of the reopened asylum hearing in,and thus lin can not be penalized for adding new testimonial evidence with respect to those events.
as for lin correction of the date of his wife first abortion and the date of the iud insertion in,his explanation is factually in light of lin wife corroborating affidavit,about which the ij decision expressed no doubts.this does not mean that the ij had to believe the explanation,but,crucially,the ij appears to have accepted it.the ij stated t he court can understand that the applicant wife would be able to more accurately recall the dates when the iuds were inserted removed and when the abortions took place.yet despite this acknowledgment,the ij found lin not credible with respect to his wife abortions.
we find that corrected dates as to one abortion and one iud implantation are relatively minor inconsistencies in the context of an chronology involving four pregnancies,two births,two abortions,three iuds,and two threats of sterilization.see,at.nevertheless,these discrepancies were not unimportant,in light of their proximity to the core of lin claim.see,at.if lin had rested his case at this point,as he did before the bia,he would have left unchallenged several other grounds for the ij adverse credibility testimony regarding his wife hiding,conflict between testimony and the household registries,and background evidence indicating that his wife abortions were voluntary.under those circumstances,we would have been confident that the agency would have reached the same holding in the absence of errors.see li hua lin,wl at.but given our holding above with respect to exhaustion,we must consider the implications of the additional arguments raised in lin petition for review to us,and evaluate the possible futility of a remand in the light of the full sum of ij errors.we therefore turn to the new arguments raised in lin petition for review.
lin account of his wife period of hiding 
the ij decision relied on the fact that lin had testified at his reopened hearing that his wife had hidden six kilometers away with her mother,and that this testimony was inconsistent with lin wife written statement that she had gone far away to hide with a friend.an examination of the transcript of the hearing,however,reveals that the ij description of lin testimony was inaccurate.lin actually stated that his wife had hidden both with friends and with her mother.when the ij subsequently asked lin to explain the apparent discrepancy between his wife characterization of her hiding place as far away and his statement that his lived six kilometers away,lin stated again,in conformity with his initial testimony,that his wife had hidden in multiple locations.on this record,we find the ij characterization of lin and his wife stories on this matter as inconsistent to be unsupported by the record.see chung sai zheng gonzales,cir.
the household registries 
the ij also erred,at least in part,in finding discrepancies between lin testimony and the household registries submitted as corroborating evidence.the ij observed that the registries appeared to show that lin second son,born in,whom lin stated was registered only after the payment of a yuan fine in december,had in fact been registered with the other members of the family on february.that this date is inconsistent with lin testimony that the fine was paid in december,and that his second son was not registered until after the payment,is clear.but the existence of both sons,and the violation of the policy that the second birth constituted,is corroborated by lin testimony in and by lin wife affidavit,which the ij appeared,in large measure,to credit.furthermore,there is no inconsistency as to the fine required to register that son,nor as to his registration some four years after his birth.as a result,this discrepancy appears to be the sort of collateral detail that the ij can consider,but that should not,in itself,undercut lin central claims concerning his wife abortions and his own threatened sterilization.see,at.
more troubling to the validity of the ij ultimate conclusions are the ij comments regarding a second household registry,which was not admitted into evidence and which,with the exception of dates written in arabic numerals,was written entirely in chinese.the ij stated in his decision that,although he could not read this second registry,he was able to determine from the dates that it was inconsistent with the translated document that was admitted into evidence.the first problem with this finding is the ij reliance on evidence,which the bia has prohibited.see in re,bia stating,in the context of a country report not included in the record,that any evidence relied upon by the immigration judge must be included in the record so that the board can meaningfully review any challenge to the immigration judge decision on appeal.but,even were we to ignore the failure to put the registry in the record,it is patently improper to draw conclusions from a document written in a foreign language in the absence of a certified translation.see augustin sava,cir any document containing foreign language submitted to the service shall be accompanied by a full english language translation which the translator has certified as complete and accurate,and by the translator certification that he or she is competent to translate from the foreign language into english.
such conclusions can not be treated as reliable.this lack of reliability is borne out by our own examination of the arabic numerals legible on the untranslated household registry.to us,this document reveals no apparent discrepancies that might warrant the ij findings.the ij conclusion concerning this second registry is,therefore,not supported by the evidence.moreover,we can not avoid the concern that the ij apparent problems with this untranslated registry might have affected,inappropriately,the weight he placed on the discrepancy regarding the registration of lin second son.
the voluntariness of lin wife abortions 
most important,because central to the viability of lin claims in,we conclude that the ij determination that lin wife abortions must have been voluntary,rather than forced,was not supported by substantial evidence.in drawing this inference,the ij relied on the contents of a state department country report indicating that the issuance of abortion certificates which lin testified he had received but had lost occurred only in cases of voluntary abortions.in so stating,the ij gave no indication of the year of the country report to which he was referring.accordingly,we must assume that he was referring to the state department report,which was the only one included in the administrative record.but we have found no discussion of abortion certificates in this report.
moreover,even if such evidence were in that report,we would think that where the claim is one of past persecution,it is unreasonable to draw inferences regarding the circumstances of abortions performed in and based upon a report prepared nearly a decade later.and this is so quite apart from our caution that state department reports can not be presumed to present the most accurate picture of human rights in the country at issue,and that such reports do not automatically discredit contrary evidence presented by an asylum applicant.chen ins,cir.
it follows that the ij did not have before him reliable evidence upon which to base his conclusion that lin wife abortions were voluntary,rather than forced as she attested in an affidavit which the ij found,on the whole,to be credible.
the future threat of sterilization 
finally,we turn to the two grounds stated by the ij for rejecting lin contention that he faced sterilization if removed to china that lin divorce removed the threat of any such procedure,and that,in connection with lin claim for cat relief,sterilization is not tantamount to torture.as to the first,we note that the transcript of the january,hearing indicates that the ij became aware of lin divorce proceedings only minutes before his oral decision was rendered,and that,upon receiving this information from lin attorney,the ij made no further inquiry into the matter.we think it evident that an inquiry would need to be conducted in order to assess reliably,at the least,a whether the divorce proceedings had,in fact,been concluded,and b whether china family planning officials sought to sterilize lin in order i to prevent further childbearing specifically from,perhaps,ii to preclude any future procreation by an individual who already had two sons,or,finally,iii to punish lin for his prior violations of the policy.on the current record,the ij assessment of the impact of lin divorce on his sterilization claim can not be said to be supported by substantial evidence 
regarding the ij determination that a threat of torture could not be made out by a proved claim of forced sterilization,our capacity to review this legal conclusion is compromised by the ij silence as to the analytical basis for it.see shi liang lin dep t of justice,cir.in any event,we need not decide the question of whether involuntary sterilization pursuant to china population control policy meets the definition of torture adopted by the cat.because the ij legal conclusion that threatened sterilization does not warrant cat relief was unsupported by any reasoning whatsoever,see,yu sheng zhang,at discussing the need for sufficient reasoning in a summarily affirmed ij opinion so as to permit judicial review,we must vacate the ij determination on this issue and remand it to the bia.it is for that agency to decide,in the first instance,whether and how the merits of the question should be considered 
thus,with respect to lin claims a for asylum and withholding of removal on the basis of his wife alleged forcible abortions and his asserted threatened sterilization,and b his cat claim based on his alleged threatened sterilization,we find any number of errors in the ij determination that lin was not credible and was not at risk of future sterilization.
there are,to be sure,valid grounds on the basis of which the executive office of immigration review the body encompassing the bia and the immigration courts might conclude that the purported forcible abortions and especially the threat of sterilization did not occur.for instance,one inconsistency in lin testimony regarding the chronology of his alleged past persecution in china is not explained by his wife superior memory of the dates of iud insertions and abortions.as described early in this opinion,and as noted by the ij,lin testified in that,following his wife first abortion and in order to avoid sterilization,he had fled into hiding for a period of three months.in,however,lin testified that he was in hiding for only approximately ten days.while this discrepancy has no obvious relationship to the issue of whether lin wife underwent forced abortions,it does bear directly on the credibility of lin alleged attempts to avoid sterilization.
but the ij did not make this or any other finding of dubiety with respect to lin sterilization claim.the ij entire discussion of the discrepancies between lin and testimony referred only to the issue of lin wife forced abortions.and,the ij made no mention of any additional credibility problems tied to lin claimed fear of future sterilization,at o ur review is confined to the reasoning of the ij,and we will not search the record independently for a basis to affirm the bia.as we said in jin shui qiu,at,r ules of law require the bia to elucidate the basis for its factual conclusions bia errors of law are not excused by the fact that a hypothetical adjudicator,applying the law correctly,might also have denied the petition for asylum,nor can factual findings supporting such a denial be assumed on the basis of record evidence not relied on by the bia.accordingly,we can not supplement the underlying agency decision with our own conclusions.
that said,the inconsistencies discussed in the ij decision did address lin general credibility in ways that can not be ignored.as such,they might also affect his claim that his wife was subjected to two forcible abortions,and this is so despite the high level of overall testimonial consistency regarding these events.and,were lin testimony the only basis for this claim,we might find that despite the ij errors,a remand to the bia on this claim would be futile.see li hua lin,wl at.but the forced abortions claim is also based in significant part on lin wife affidavit,the ij errors are be discounted.as a result,we do not have confidence that the agency would reach the same result upon a reconsideration cleansed of errors.id.nor is it the case that the ij offered an alternative and sufficient basis,separate from his errors,on which his conclusions as to the alleged forced abortions could rest.cao he lin,at.
viewing the case as a whole,we can not say that the ij made findings that are supported by sufficient evidence to rule out lin claim of fear of sterilization based on past threats of such sterilization.nor can we say that the claim that lin wife was subjected to forcible abortions has been rejected on the basis of record evidence.and we are not confident that a remand of these claims to the the standards stated in cao he lin,xiao ji chen,li hua lin,and li zu be futile.
we therefore must vacate the decision and remand to the bia for further proceedings.
iii.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,lin petition for review is granted.the decision of the bia is vacated,and lin abortion and claims for asylum,withholding,and cat relief are remanded to the bia for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.for the reasons stated in note,supra,the bia affirmance of the ij rejection of lin arguments arising from lin alleged illegal departure from china is affirmed.
i respectfully dissent.i would deny the petition for review because the only issues presented here that were exhausted through presentation to the board of immigration appeals bia or the board,as required by d,do not show a basis for overturning the decision of the bia.
the majority,in vacating the bia decision and ordering a remand,concedes that the issues raised in the petition for review that were presented to the bia do not warrant relief.see,majority opinion ante at several issues raised in lin petition were not included in lin brief on appeal to the bia,and they alter the proper disposition of lin petition for review.id.at the issues not raised to the bia are essential to our view of the merits of lin appeal.
but the majority holds that this court has jurisdiction to review issues that were not raised in a petitioner appeal to the bia.see,majority opinion ante at i n the context of d,the failure to exhaust individual issues before the bia does not deprive this court of subject matter jurisdiction to consider those issues.emphasis in original.with all due respect,i disagree.
section d,enacted as part of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,provides that a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right d emphasis added.statutory exhaustion requirements such as d are mandatory,and courts are not free to dispense with them.foster ins,cir quoting united states,cir.we have generally held that this provision means that we lack jurisdiction to review an issue that was not presented to the bia.see,foster,at to preserve a claim,we require p etitioner to raise issues to the bia in order to preserve them for judicial review.quoting ins,cir,cert.denied,d emphasis in foster.we have been nothing if not clear in requiring that a party may not seek federal judicial review of an adverse administrative determination until the party has first sought all possible relief within the agency itself.foster,at internal quotation marks omitted id.at a failure to exhaust as required by d constitutes a clear jurisdictional bar.internal quotation marks omitted.
i disagree with the majority apparent view that foster was somehow eroded by abimbola ashcroft,cir,a view reflected in the majority statement that in abimbola,decided shortly after foster and by the same panel,we expressly treated as an open question the jurisdictional effect of a lack of issue exhaustion in a situation in which the government had seemingly waived objection.majority opinion ante at emphasis added.this description by the majority assumes lack of exhaustion however,the uncertainty as to our jurisdiction in abimbola arose precisely because there was a question as to whether exhaustion was lacking.the petitioner in abimbola had in fact presented the pertinent issue to the bia.the problem was that he had not raised the issue before the immigration judge ij and that the bia had not addressed it.we noted that those circumstances present ed an open question as to whether we have jurisdiction over this claim since abimbola may not have properly exhausted his administrative remedies as required by d.abimbola,at emphasis added.accordingly,the doctrinal question identified in abimbola was not,as the majority would have it,whether lack of issue exhaustion is jurisdictional rather,it was whether a petitioner failure to raise an issue prior to raising it to the bia,together with the bia failure to address that issue,constitutes a lack of exhaustion.
nor do i read abimbola as stating that the government had waived or could waive the requirement.although noting that the government ha d not offered a jurisdictional objection based on an exhaustion argument for this claim,we clearly considered the possible absence of exhaustion to present a jurisdictional issue.at.we stated that it would be unwise to decide the particularly difficult and complex jurisdictional issue presented by the possibility that a petitioner raising an issue before the bia without having raised it to the ij,where the bia ruling does not address the issue,may not constitute the required exhaustion,without the benefit of argument from both sides.id.since the jurisdictional constraint is not constitutional but statutory,allowing the exercise of hypothetical jurisdiction,and since we found it clear that abimbola claim wa s meritless,we assume d jurisdiction to decide the issue but t ook no position as to whether abimbola met the exhaustion requirement in d.id.
in sum,i view the above passages of the abimbola opinion as clearly with the principles enunciated shortly theretofore by the same panel in if it were established that abimbola did not properly exhaust his administrative remedies on the pertinent issue as required by d,this court would not have jurisdiction to consider that issue.
most importantly,i disagree with the position taken by the majority that d requirement that the alien have exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right means simply that we have jurisdiction to consider any issue argued in the alien petition to this court for review,regardless of whether it was presented to the bia,so long as a decision has been rendered on his application by an ij and appealed to the two administrative remedies available to him as of right.majority opinion ante at emphasis in original.i believe this disregards the purposes and meaning of exhaustion.a t least one of the purposes served by the exhaustion requirement contained in d is to ensure that the ins,as the agency responsible for construing and applying the immigration laws and implementing regulations,has had a full opportunity to consider a petitioner claims before they are submitted for review by a federal court.theodoropoulos ins,cir,cert.denied,d.this purpose is not served if an issue raised in the petition for review has not been presented to the board.
nor does exhaustion of all available remedies mean simply obtaining a final order.in considering the prison litigation reform act requirement that a prisoner not bring a court action complaining of prison conditions until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted,a,the supreme court in booth churner,d,observed that one can not literally exhaust a remedy rather,one is required to exhaust the procedures that could lead to the requested relief 
while the modifier available requires the possibility of some relief for the action complained of,the word exhausted has a decidedly procedural emphasis.it makes sense only in referring to the procedural means,not the particular relief ordered.it would,for example,be very strange usage to say that a prisoner must exhaust an administrative order reassigning an abusive guard before a prisoner could go to court and ask for something else it makes no sense to demand that someone exhaust such administrative redress as is available one exhausts processes,not forms of relief 
id.at.brackets in original emphases added.thus,i view d similar provision that we may not review an order of removal unless the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right as meaning that the alien must have pursued all of the procedures available to him in the bia proceeding in connection with his requests for relief,presented to the bia all of the issues he wishes to press in his petition for review,not simply that he must have obtained a final administrative decision.
the view that d restricts the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals to issues that the alien has presented to the bia has been the prevailing interpretation by the federal courts of appeals that have discussed the question.see,foster,at ins,at despite exhaustion requirements requiring petitioner to raise issues to the bia in order to preserve them for judicial review,see d,petitioner failed to do so on this specific issue.accordingly,we may not consider it on appeal.zhang ins,cir a litigant is generally not entitled to judicial review of a contention not argued to the board,see d alyas gonzales,cir because petitioner failed to present his due process argument to the bia in the first instance,we lack jurisdiction to decide the claim.citing d zara ashcroft,cir a petitioner can not satisfy the exhaustion requirement by making a general challenge to the ij decision,but,rather,must specify which issues form the basis of the appeal.ramani ashcroft,cir only claims properly presented to the bia and considered on their merits can be reviewed by this court xie ashcroft,cir we are without jurisdiction to decide an issue as to which p etitioner brings an argument for the first time attorney general,cir petitioner failed to raise this issue before the bia and,as a result of that failure,we do not have jurisdiction to consider it here.see d sousa ins,cir obviously,the petitioner has gone through the administrative proceeding the problem is that he did not raise there the issue he now seeks to raise in this court.emphasis in original singh reno,cir generally,an alien who fails to raise an issue below has not fulfilled d exhaustion requirement.witter ins,cir we have no jurisdiction to consider issues that were not presented to or considered at the administrative level on appeal.
further,c,the predecessor to d,included a similar exhaustion requirement,stating that an order of deportation shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien has not exhausted the administrative remedies available to him as of right under the immigration laws and regulations.c.the prevailing interpretation of c was that it required the alien to present to the bia any issue as to which he would thereafter seek review in court.see,gonzales,cir at least seven circuits,including ours,read former c to require an alien to exhaust both remedies and issues before the agency emphasis in original sousa ins,cir m ost circuits,including this one,have described former c as a jurisdictional bar where an issue sought to be raised in court was not raised in the agency.chour ins,cir,cert.denied,d petitioner never previously presented his theory of eligibility for relief pursuant to a consent decree to the board,which precludes review of that claim here ins,cir c ourts of appeals have consistently applied c as a bar to review of issues not raised before the bia.asencio ins,cir under c,a court lacks jurisdiction to consider a claim which has not first been presented to the board ravindran ins,cir issues not raised before the board may not be raised for the first time upon judicial review of the board decisions this requirement is jurisdictional.ins,cir the failure to raise an issue on appeal to the board constitutes failure to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to that question and deprives the court of appeals of jurisdiction to hear the matter.vargas ins,cir failure to raise an issue in an appeal to the bia constitutes a failure to exhaust remedies with respect to that question and deprives this court of jurisdiction to hear the matter.ka fung chan ins,cir petitioner failed to raise his estoppel claims before the bia.under c,this failure to exhaust administrative remedies precludes review of his estoppel arguments in this court.
i have seen nothing in the legislative history to indicate that in enacting iirira,congress meant to expand the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals to entertain petitions for review of orders of removal,and i thus think it appropriate to infer that congress did not intend to alter the prevailing principle that the courts lacked jurisdiction to consider issues not raised in the proceedings before the bia.as the eighth circuit noted in gonzales,
it is appropriate to assume that our elected representatives,like other citizens,know the law,cannon of chicago,d,and to recognize that longstanding acceptance by the courts of a judicial interpretation,coupled with congress failure to reject that interpretation,argues significantly in favor of accept ing it.gustafson alloyd,d internal quotation omitted alteration in original see also sutherland statutory construction,at ed.t he legislature is presumed to know the prior construction of the original act,and if words or provisions in the act or section amended that had been previously construed are repeated in the amendment,it is held that the legislature adopted the prior construction of the word or provision.whatever the merits of the textual interpretation of c by the courts prior to the iirira,there is a strong inference that in reenacting the same exhaustion language,congress intended to continue a statutory requirement that an alien exhaust not only remedies,but also issues,before he may obtain judicial review.
at emphasis added.
finally,to the extent that the majority suggests that its the d exhaustion requirement does not apply to limited to those cases in which the bia decision was a summary affirmance entered in accordance with the board streamlining procedures,see majority opinion ante at,i do not see that those procedures alter the thrust of the statutory provision exhaustion requirement.the bia decision whether to apply the streamlining procedures in a given case depends on the issues presented for appeal,see d and e,and the issues for appeal must be stated by the appellant at the outset 
the party taking the appeal must identify the reasons for the appeal in the notice of appeal or in any attachments thereto,in order to avoid summary dismissal the statement must specifically identify the findings of fact,the conclusions of law,or both,that are being challenged.if a question of law is presented,supporting authority must be cited.if the dispute is over the findings of fact,the specific facts contested must be identified.
id.b emphases added.thus,the decision whether to streamline is affected by what issues the petitioner chooses to appeal to the bia.the failure to include issues may result in a decision to streamline which otherwise would not have been made.zara ashcroft,at.
in sum,the majority holds that the language of d does not make issue exhaustion a statutory jurisdictional requirement,because,the majority says,that section does not expressly proscribe judicial review of issues not raised in the course of exhausting all administrative remedies.majority opinion ante at emphasis added.given the present context,to wit,issues presented in a petition for review,i regard the phrase issues not raised in the course of exhausting all administrative remedies emphasis added as an oxymoron.in my view,the very fact that the issues have not been raised in the course of the administrative proceeding means that,as to those issues,the petitioner has not exhausted all administrative remedies.accordingly,i dissent.
our jurisdiction to hear lin petition for review arises under the transitional rules of the illegal immigration reform and immigration responsibility act of iirira c,div.c,stat,which preserved jurisdiction under a repealed,in cases such as this in which deportation proceedings were initiated prior to april,and in which the bia issued its final order of deportation after october.see medina gonzales,cir.
the iirira replaced deportation with removal as the term of art to refer to the denial or revocation of admittance to this country.see edwards ins,cir discussing the change.except when referring to specific statutory language,we will use the terms deportation and removal interchangeably in this opinion.
as recounted in the ij decision,there was some confusion concerning the ij initial understanding of the scope of lin motion to reopen.yet lin motion expressly sought to reopen lin asylum and withholding of removal claims,as well as to introduce a new claim for cat relief,and on that basis the ij ultimately considered all three claims in the reopened proceedings.respondent has raised no objection to that approach.therefore,we,like the ij,will consider lin claims to asylum and withholding of removal,as well as cat relief.
although the ij january,decision states that lin arrived in the united states at miami,florida,lin request for asylum,as well as his july,motion for change of venue,indicate that lin entered the united states through new orleans.the parties do not mention this discrepancy,and we have been unable to glean an explanation for it from the record on appeal.
on march,the ins ceased to exist as an agency within the united states department of justice,and its responsibility for enforcement of united states immigration laws was transferred to the department of homeland security bureau of immigration and customs enforcement.see,brown ashcroft,cir.for ease of reference,and because all administrative proceedings in relation to lin application were completed prior to march,this opinion will refer to the federal agency responsible for immigration enforcement as the ins.
we make reference to two portions of lin description of the timeline of events from his wife pregnancy to her second abortion,and his account of the events surrounding that second of the ij reliance,in his decision,on these statements.we do not repeat those aspects of lin testimony that were not discussed in the ij decision.yu sheng zhang dep t of justice,cir because we may not affirm the bia on grounds that it did not explicitly adopt,our review will necessarily be confined to the reasoning of the ij.internal quotation marks omitted.
the ij inquired of lin why these details,in particular those pertaining to the iud insertion and removal,had not been set forth in his.lin responded that he had not considered them to be important at the time that he prepared his application,because he had focused only on his own persecution.
the government attorney asked lin on why he had not recounted the hospital protest in his form.lin responded that he had stated in the form that he had accompanied his wife to the hospital,but that he had not included the other details because he had given only a general account of what happened.
the amended statutory text provides,in relevant part for purposes of determinations under this chapter,a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization,or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program,shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion,and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure,refusal,or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion a.
lin said that he received a government certificate for this abortion,as well as a certificate for the abortion,but that both documents had been lost.
the ij decision does not indicate the year of the country report on which he relied for his information.the only such report that appears to have been in the record of the hearing is dated april.
the last of these alleged errors is relevant only to lin cat claim.
because we conclude that,in the absence of a challenge by respondent on exhaustion grounds,we have jurisdiction to review the whole of lin petition,see infra,we need not,and hence do not,consider which,if any,parts of lin petition involve subsidiary arguments that are,in any event,reviewable by us,and which,instead,constitute new issues that,absent respondent waiver,needed to be raised below.see gill ins,cir finding that d bars the consideration of bases for relief that were not raised below,and of general issues that were not raised below,but not of specific,subsidiary legal arguments,or arguments by extension,that were not made below.we leave any resolution of what constitute subsidiary arguments and what are new issues to another day.
as noted above,some of the points raised by lin to us,and not to the bia,might be described as subsidiary arguments rather than new issues.in view of respondent failure to object to our consideration of any of lin arguments and our conclusion that respondent waiver is effective,we need not address the broader,and difficult question of what are new issues as against new subsidiary arguments.see supra note.and we accordingly assume,for purposes of this opinion,that all of lin new arguments constitute new issues.
our court has rejected the position that the filing of a motion to reopen proceedings,following the denial of a petitioner administrative appeal to the bia,is required in order for the petitioner to have exhausted administrative remedies available to him or her as of right.see ins,cir adopting the reasoning of the seventh circuit decision in ins,cir.
statutory administrative exhaustion schemes such as the one prescribed by d,in contrast to exhaustion requirements,generally admit of no exceptions.see booth churner,d stating,in the context of a failure to utilize all stages of a prison grievance system,which was subject to the exhaustion requirements of the prison litigation reform act of,that the court would not read futility or other exceptions into statutory exhaustion requirements where congress has provided otherwise ivanishvili,at statutory exhaustion requirements do not yield to common law exceptions to rules of exhaustion theodoropoulos,at as a general matter,d admits of no common law exceptions,in contrast to exhaustion requirements.but see marrero pichardo ashcroft,cir excusing a habeas petitioner failure to appeal his initial deportation order to the bia on the ground that doing so was required to prevent manifest injustice theodoropoulos,at suggesting that in some limited circumstances,such as proof of futility,exceptions may be made even to statutory exhaustion requirements.
our precedents distinguish issues from categories of relief in exhaustion doctrine,and we preserve that distinction here,confining our holding to arguments and issues.cf supra note see gill,at distinguishing our precedents along these lines see also beharry ashcroft,cir discussing the statutory bases and parameters of our exhaustion rule that petitioners must raise to the bia each type of relief sought on appeal.
adding further ambiguity to the origins of our issue exhaustion rule and its susceptibility to waiver,in abimbola ashcroft,cir,decided shortly after foster and by the same panel,we expressly treated as an open question the jurisdictional effect of a lack of issue exhaustion in a situation in which the government had seemingly waived objection.as in foster,the petitioner in abimbola had failed to argue the contested issue before an ij,though,unlike the foster petitioner,he had made the point before the bia.compare abimbola,at,with foster,at.in abimbola,we noted that the petitioner might not have exhausted all issues raised by his petition,but we observed that the attorney general had not raised any question as to our jurisdiction over the merits of that potentially unexhausted claim.concluding that the new argument was,in any case,meritless,we expressly declined to reach the problem of the jurisdictional issue in the case.abimbola,at.
the eighth circuit ultimately found,based on the government objection to the court jurisdiction,that d did require exhaustion of issues before the bia,though
