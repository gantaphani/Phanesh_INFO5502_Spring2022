petitioner werquely jeanini or petitioner seeks review of a decision by the board of immigration appeals bia dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge ij decision that denied both his motion to suppress evidence for an alleged fourth amendment violation and his motion to terminate the removal proceedings against him.for the reasons stated below,we conclude that the bia decision was not in error,and we therefore deny petition.
background 
late on the night of january,was approached by a uniformed border patrol agent just as he entered,by foot,the parking lot of a gas station adjacent to a restaurant along a highway in southern texas.the agent instructed petitioner to stop and requested identification from him.in response,petitioner showed the officer his brazilian passport,at which point he was arrested and taken into custody.at that time,who was then years old,gave a statement to the arresting officer,which became the basis of an form record of alien maintained by the immigration and naturalization service ins.that form recorded that petitioner was a citizen and national of brazil by birth,and was illegally in the united states.thereafter,petitioner was served with a warrant and notice to appear before an immigration judge ij in chicago,illinois.after being released into the custody of his cousin,who lived in new york,successfully moved for a change of venue from chicago to new york.
proceedings before an ij in new york began on march.at that time,petitioner filed a motion to suppress evidence and terminate the removal proceedings forthwith.the motion sought to exclude the statement taken from the petitioner and any and all other evidence procured in violation of the law used to commence these removal proceedings.in support of this motion,made two arguments.first,he contended that his arrest was an illegal seizure under the fourth amendment of the constitution.he also claimed that,because he was an unaccompanied minor when he spoke to the arresting agent in january,his statements were inadmissible under ins regulations.apart from the form derived from petitioner statement,the record before the ij included a copy of petitioner brazilian passport and an affidavit from mother stating that petitioner was a native and citizen of brazil.petitioner did not admit to deportability nor did he assert any claims.
on june,the ij denied petitioner suppression motion as well as his motion to terminate the proceedings.finding that removability had been established by clear and convincing evidence,the ij ordered petitioner deported.
on appeal to the bia,petitioner asserted substantially the same arguments he raised before the ij.on october,the bia denied petitioner appeal by per curiam opinion.the bia found that there was no evidence that petitioner was under arrest when the officer asked to see his identification,and therefore no fourth amendment violation.moreover,the bia maintained that an ordinary violation of the fourth amendment,even if established,would not justify suppression of evidence in a civil deportation hearing.concluding that there was nothing unreasonable or egregious about the officer encounter with,the bia affirmed the ij denial of petitioner motion to suppress.
the bia also found unavailing petitioner alternate argument that he was an unaccompanied minor when he spoke with the arresting agent.after considering in re,bia,the bia emphasized that petitioner was years old at the time of his arrest and that his mother had confirmed the relevant facts contained in the form.
subsequently filed a timely petition to review the bia decision.petitioner argues to us that,because the uniformed agent was wearing a firearm and because he commanded petitioner to stop,petitioner was seized without any cause whatsoever in clear violation of his constitutional rights.he also maintains that because he was an unaccompanied minor when he was arrested,his statement is inadmissible.
discussion 
it is that we review the factual findings of the bia for substantial evidence.see b b zhou yun zhang ins,cir.it is equally that,on appeal,issues of law are reviewed de novo.see ins,cir.
the government bears the burden of proving removability by clear and convincing evidence.woodby ins,d.but,the ins must show only identity and alienage the burden then shifts to the respondent to prove the time,place,and manner of his entry.ins,d.
the question presented by this appeal therefore is whether the government evidence establishing that is removable should have been excluded.
petitioner fourth amendment challenge 
in the supreme court held that a fourth amendment violation does not,by itself,justify suppression of evidence in the course of a civil deportation proceeding important as it is to protect the fourth amendment rights of all persons,there is no convincing indication that application of the exclusionary rule in civil deportation proceedings will contribute materially to that end,at.the court qualified this ruling in two significant ways.first,it stated that its conclusions concerning the exclusionary rule value might change,if there developed good reason to believe that fourth amendment violations by ins officers were widespread.id.at.and,second,it explained that its holding did not necessarily pertain to circumstances involving egregious violations of fourth amendment or other liberties that might transgress notions of fundamental fairness and undermine the probative value of the evidence obtained.id.at.
although we have referred to the supreme court decision in in several published decisions,see,united states lopez,cir johnson ashcroft,cir montero ins,cir,we have not,to date,had an occasion to apply explicitly.the issue squarely presents itself in this case,and we now apply it as the law of the circuit.
in so doing,we pause to emphasize significant to the case before clarify when an egregious violation would properly lead to the suppression of evidence in a civil proceeding.at the outset,it should be made clear that authorizes exclusion for violations that are egregious either because the violation transgress ed notions of fundamental fairness,or because the violation undermine d the probative value of the evidence obtained,at.the court,seemingly inadvertently,used the conjunctive and instead of the disjunctive or to link these two possible grounds for deeming a violation egregious.as a result,it could be read as saying that proof of both,evidence of fundamental unfairness and diminished probative needed to justify exclusion.see id.
this,however,is plainly not what the court intended.for,as the ninth circuit observed in ins,cir,the court justified its exception for egregious constitutional violations with examples in which evidence was suppressed solely on the basis of unfairness,that is,where the reliability of the evidence was in no way tarnished by the putative violation.see,at a fundamentally unfair fourth amendment violation is considered egregious regardless of the probative value of the evidence obtained under.for example,in rochin california,the evidence at forcibly removed from a defendant stomach that were later used to establish indisputably reliable.the pills were nonetheless suppressed because of the objectionable method used by the police to obtain them.see id.at.indeed,rochin stated in no uncertain terms that reliability can not be the sole touchstone of the fourth amendment.see id.at.noting that coerced confessions are inadmissible in criminal trials even though statements contained in them may be independently established as true principally because they offend the community sense of fair play and decency.similarly,the bia decisions cited by the court in did not focus on the reliability of the evidence.they concentrated,instead,on whether the admission of the contested evidence would be fundamentally fair.and,on that basis alone,the issue of suppression was decided.see,in re garcia,bia excluding statements obtained after agents repeatedly ignored detainee request for counsel in re toro,bia admitting evidence on the ground that the suspicionless stop was made in good faith because its legality was unclear at the time it was made.
thus,exclusion
