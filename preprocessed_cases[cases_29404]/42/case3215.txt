sylvester otieno owino,a native and citizen of kenya,petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals.he argues that the agency adverse credibility finding and denial of relief under the convention against torture are not supported by substantial evidence.he also contends that the agency improperly declined to admit untimely filed evidence,violated his right to confidentiality,and deprived him of due process by admitting evidence of a government authenticity investigation.
we have jurisdiction under.we grant the petition and remand to the bia for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
owino was admitted to the united states on a student visa in.in,he was convicted in california of robbery in the second degree.the following year,the department of homeland security dhs initiated removal proceedings.see a g,a a iii.owino conceded removability,but applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.
owino initial testimony 
an immigration judge first held a merits hearing on owino application on march.at the hearing,owino testified to the following 
in the,owino owned a bicycle repair shop in jera,kenya,at which political issues were often discussed.during that time,owino openly criticized the government,advocated for women rights,and distributed leaflets on behalf of a women rights group.in july,he was arrested by the kenyan police in jera,detained for ten days,and beaten.
in december,following police interference with his business,he left jera for nairobi,where he enrolled in college and joined the track and field team,competing internationally.owino success attracted media attention,and,in an interview with the newspaper the nation,he openly criticized the kenyan police.in october,owino was arrested again and held for three weeks,during which time he was beaten and told to cease criticizing the government and associating with journalists.the police killed a detainee in his presence and warned that they would kill him,too,if he reported what he had seen they also planted his fingerprints on a gun,threatening to use it as evidence against him if he said anything.
after being released,owino was followed by kamau,one of the police officers who had beaten him.the police also asked owino training partner about owino.after this incident,owino never left campus and applied to transfer to san juan united states international university in san diego,california.
on december,after receiving a student visa,owino entered the united states.he continued communicating with kenyan journalists and criticizing the kenyan police.in,he learned from his former training partner that officer kamau,who had since advanced in rank,had warned that owino should stay in the united states.
b.the ij decision and subsequent appeals 
the ij issued a decision on april.because of owino robbery conviction,the ij found him ineligible for asylum,withholding of removal under the immigration and nationality act ina,and withholding of removal under cat.the ij further held that owino was not credible and had failed to demonstrate entitlement to deferral of removal under cat.
owino appealed and also filed a motion seeking remand for the ij to consider additional evidence of his torture claim.the bia dismissed owino appeal after concluding that,although the ij adverse credibility finding was not supported by the record,owino had not satisfied his burden under cat of showing that he likely would be tortured if returned to kenya the new evidence should have been presented at the original hearing and owino failed to show that he could not have presented this evidence initially.
owino petitioned for review and we granted the petition.owino holder,cir per curiam.we noted that the real id act governed owino case,but the agency had not applied it.id.at.thus,we remand ed to the ij on an open record to determine the merits of owino application under the real id act standards.id.at.
proceedings on remand 
on remand,owino,represented by new counsel,modified his account of his arrests,now claiming that he had been arrested three times,not twice.owino testified that the tenday detention in jera which he previously described as having occurred in july in fact had taken place in july.owino claimed that he had been arrested in july in jera,but that this detention had only lasted for a few days he claimed that he had not provided details of this short detention during the initial proceedings upon the advice of his attorney.he also stated that he had been arrested in nairobi in october.
owino also submitted new documentary evidence in support of his july arrest.first,he provided medical evidence notes from oketch,who treated him in jera in july,and a letter from the doctor to eunice akinyi,owino cousin.second,owino submitted three letters that akinyi had obtained from the kenyan police a september,letter from the bar ober police post,stating that owino had been in their custody for days in july,an october,letter from the kilimani police station in nairobi,stating that an arrest warrant for owino was issued in may,and an august,letter from the bar ober police post,stating that owino was required to report to the post.the government,however,submitted a report from a police officer at the kilimani station denying the authenticity of the letter purportedly from that police station,and email correspondence from an investigator denying the authenticity of the bar ober police post letters.
several other documents were admitted.owino submitted a letter from one of his contacts in kenya,michael nasubo,who stated that people in kenya had read a daily journal article in which owino discussed his case and that it would be dangerous for him to return to kenya.the ij also received in evidence the daily journal article and reports on conditions in kenya.
several witnesses testified.owino,eric,testified that people in kenya were aware of the daily journal article and that the police were still looking for owino.two state department foreign service national investigators testified via phone julius norberts,regarding his investigation of the kilimani police station letter,and phineas machiro,regarding his investigation of the bar ober letters.
the ij was scheduled to issue her decision on september.on september,owino moved to admit a may warrant for his arrest,from the narok police station,and supporting declarations.the ij denied owino motion.she also again denied owino relief under cat,finding that he was not credible and had failed to show that he likely would be tortured in kenya.
the bia dismissed owino appeal on april.it affirmed the ij denial of owino motion to admit additional evidence,reasoning that owino had failed to explain the delay in submitting the evidence and that the evidence was not properly authenticated.it also affirmed the adverse credibility finding and the denial of cat relief.owino again petitioned for review.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
when the bia conducts its own review of the evidence and the law,this court review is limited to the bia decision,except to the extent the ij opinion is expressly adopted.hosseini gonzales,cir quoting cordon garcia ins,cir.denial of cat relief is reviewed for substantial evidence,sinha holder,cir,as are adverse credibility findings,singh holder,cir,and all purely factual determinations,cordoba holder,cir.questions of law are reviewed de novo.cordoba,at.the denial of a continuance is reviewed for abuse of discretion.cruz rendon holder,cir.
motion for a continuance to admit additional evidence 
owino first challenges the agency refusal to consider the arrest documents that he moved to submit on september.under the regulations implementing cat,an ij must consider all evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture.c.at the same time,the regulations vest the ij with discretion to manage the presentation of evidence,including setting deadlines for the admission of evidence.see id.c.if evidence in support of a cat claim is proffered beyond deadlines prescribed pursuant to section c,an ij has discretion in deciding whether to consider it.see umezurike holder,cir tang united states att,cir dedji mukasey,cir singh gonzales,cir hassan gonzales,cir 
in determining whether to exercise discretion to grant or deny a continuance,the ij and,on appeal,the bia should consider factors including the nature of the evidence excluded as a result of the denial of the continuance,the reasonableness of the immigrant conduct,the inconvenience to the court,and the number of continuances previously granted.an na peng holder,cir quoting ahmed holder,cir.the bia abuses its discretion when it fails to show proper consideration of all factors when weighing equities and denying relief.id.quoting ahmed,at.the agency also abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.cerezo mukasey,cir.
in denying owino motion to admit additional evidence,the ij did not address each of the an na peng factors.she simply stated that owino had failed to explain why he had not provided the documents earlier,and that the warrant did not appear to be properly authenticated.the bia affirmed on the same grounds.after carefully reviewing the record,we conclude that this denial constitutes an abuse of discretion,as the agency reasoning is based on legal error and is inconsistent with the an na peng factors.
as to the nature of the evidence excluded,the bia erred as a legal matter in concluding that the arrest warrant was not properly authenticated.in so concluding,the agency relied on b,which provides that an official record of a foreign country may be admitted if it is evidenced by an official publication thereof,or by a copy attested by an officer so authorized,and is then certified by an officer in the foreign service of the united states,stationed in the foreign country where the record is kept.b.
we have held,however,that documents submitted in immigration proceedings may be authenticated through any recognized procedure,such as those required by immigration and naturalization service ins regulations or by the federal rules of civil procedure.khan ins,cir per curiam quoting espinoza ins,cir.the procedure specified in provides one,but not the exclusive,method.id.quoting iran ins,cir.here,the copy of the arrest warrant had been properly authenticated by an investigator with the federal defenders of san diego pursuant to rule of the federal rules of evidence.
we also find that the agency statement that owino failed to explain why he waited to submit this evidence is inconsistent with the record.owino counsel informed the ij that she provided this information in response to the government contention made in proceedings between november and may that the previously submitted warrant was not authentic.although the agency possibly might have found owino explanation wanting,or,in the language of an na peng,that his conduct was not reasonable,its finding that no explanation was given is not supported by the record.
we also note that other an na peng factors weigh in favor of admission.the warrant evidence is critical to owino claim as the board itself recognized,evidence of an arrest warrant is central to the respondent claim that he will be tortured upon return by the kenyan police.we also note that although the ij had initially set the deadline for submission of evidence for july,she granted several continuances to the government to present opposing evidence between july and may.by contrast,it appears that owino neither sought nor received any continuance during the remand proceedings until he made his request in september.
we remand to the bia for reconsideration in light of the factors outlined in an na peng and as discussed above.we do not reach owino argument that the denial of a continuance also denied him due process.
owino right to confidentiality 
we next address owino claim that the agency violated his right to confidentiality.
the ina does not prohibit the disclosure of information contained in applicants asylum applications.mindful,however,that the public disclosure of such information could subject an applicant to retaliatory measures in his country of origin and endanger his relatives still residing abroad,the attorney general has issued regulations providing that federal officials must,with limited exceptions,maintain in confidence information relating to applicants asylum applications.see citizenship and immigration,fact sheet federal regulations protecting the confidentiality of asylum applicants june,fact sheet,available at files last visited july.under 
information contained in or pertaining to any asylum application shall not be disclosed without the written consent of the applicant,except as permitted by this section or at the discretion of the attorney general.
when state department investigators at the embassy in nairobi investigated the arrest documents submitted by owino,they showed these documents to current officers at the bar ober and kilimani police stations.owino did not consent to this disclosure none of the exceptions in the regulation applies,see id.c and the government does not argue that the letters were disclosed at the discretion of the attorney general.under the plain text of the regulation,owino argues,his right to confidentiality under was violated.
the government disagrees,asserting that an alien right to confidentiality is violated only when the government discloses information in violation of,and the information disclosed by the government was sufficient to give rise to a reasonable inference that the alien had applied for asylum.see lin united states dep of justice,cir.according to the government,because the kenyan police would not have inferred that owino had applied for asylum,the disclosure did not violate owino right to confidentiality.the bia agreed.we address the government construction of the regulation before turning to the bia findings.
we defer to the agency interpretation of its own regulation if the meaning of the words used is in doubt.daubert sullivan,cir quoting udall tallman.the ins first issued guidance on this regulation in a memorandum addressed to agency personnel.see memorandum from bo cooper,ins general counsel,to jeffrey weiss,ins director of int l affairs,confidentiality of asylum applications and overseas verification of documents and application information june,cooper memorandum see also lin,at noting that the cooper memorandum has been treated as the general standard for confidentiality fact sheet reiterating standards set forth in the cooper memorandum 
the cooper memorandum specifies that a disclosure will violate the regulation in the following circumstances 
c onfidentiality of an asylum application is breached when information contained therein or pertaining thereto is disclosed to a third party,and the disclosure is of a nature that allows the third party to link the identity of the applicant to the fact that the applicant has applied for asylum specific facts or allegations pertaining to the individual asylum claim contained in an asylum application or facts or allegations that are sufficient to give rise to a reasonable inference that the applicant has applied for asylum.
cooper memorandum at emphasis added see also lin,at fact sheet at.under this standard,confidentiality may be breached even if a disclosure does not give rise to a reasonable inference that the applicant has sought asylum,so long as the unauthorized disclosure is of a nature that allows the third party to link the identity of the applicant to specific facts or allegations pertaining to the individual asylum claim contained in an asylum application.fact sheet at.
in discussing this standard,the ins general counsel noted that overseas investigations of applicants documents may present unique difficulties.cooper memorandum at.by way of example,he considered a scenario in which the government wishes to authenticate information contained in an applicant birth certificate.in this hypothetical,the birth certificate could be verified in a number of ways,some of which would breach the confidentiality of the application,while others would not.id.specifically,if investigators provide the birth certificate directly to foreign government officials for verification of its contents,this would be a breach because the birth cer
