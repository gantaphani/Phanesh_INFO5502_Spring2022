petitioner reinaldo otoniel,a citizen of el salvador and lawful permanent resident of the united states,pled guilty in to violating section of the california vehicle code,which prohibits owning or operating a chop shop.the government thereafter initiated removal proceedings.the immigration judge ij held that conviction under categorically qualified as an aggravated felony theft offense under a g and ordered him removed.the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed.
we hold under the categorical approach of taylor united states,d,that a conviction under cal.is not an aggravated felony theft offense under a g.we further hold that the record is not sufficient to establish that conviction is an aggravated felony theft offense under the modified categorical approach.we grant the petition for review and remand to the bia for further proceedings.
background 
a citizen of el salvador,was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident in june.in august,he pled guilty to receiving stolen property in violation of cal.a and was sentenced to one year in prison.years later,in march,he pled guilty to operating a chop shop in violation of cal.and was sentenced to two years in prison.
in september,the government charged with removability under a a i for being convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years after admission,and under a a ii for being convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude any time after admission.the ij ordered him removed.
on appeal,the bia held that was eligible for waiver of his conviction under immigration and naturalization act section c,c repealed.if that conviction were waived,he would no longer be removable because only his conviction would remain.that crime was committed more than five years after admission.the bia remanded to the ij for further proceedings.
on remand,the government brought a new charge against based on his conviction under cal.the government charged that this conviction rendered him removable under a a iii because it was a conviction for an aggravated felony under a g.
the ij held that violation of cal.qualified categorically as a theft offense under a g and ordered him removed.the ij did not rule on request for a section c waiver of his conviction.the bia affirmed,and petitioned for review in this court.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo whether an offense constitutes an aggravated felony for which an alien is removable.ashcroft,cir.
iii.discussion 
categorical approach 
we first analyze conviction under cal.under the categorical approach of taylor to determine whether it is a theft offense under a g.
any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.a a iii.a theft offense including receipt of stolen property for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year constitutes an aggravated felony.id.a g.we have defined theft offense under a g as a taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent with the criminal intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits of ownership,even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent.united states,cir en banc quoting ins,cir bracketed numbers added,superceded on other grounds by cmt.if a violation of satisfies these three elements,it constitutes a theft offense under a g.
cal.provides 
any person who knowingly and intentionally owns or operates a chop shop is guilty of a public offense and,upon conviction,shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for two,three,or four years,or by a fine of not more than fifty thousand dollars,or by both the fine and imprisonment,or by up to one year in the county jail,or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars,or by both the fine and imprisonment.
cal.defines chop shop as 
any building,lot,or other premises where any person has been engaged in altering,destroying,disassembling,dismantling,reassembling,or storing any motor vehicle or motor vehicle part known to be illegally obtained by theft,fraud,or conspiracy to defraud 
a violation of clearly satisfies the first and third elements of theft offense under a g.
the first element is exercise of control over property.that element is satisfied because owning a chop shop where motor vehicles are alter ed,destroy ed,disassembl ed,dismantl ed,reassembl ed,or stor ed necessarily implies possession of those vehicles,which,in turn,necessarily implies exercising control over them.p ossession is of course equivalent to an exercise of control.randhawa ashcroft,cir.similarly,operating a chop shop necessarily implies active involvement in the activities listed above and,therefore,exercising control over the vehicles.people ramirez,th,d.
the third element is having the criminal intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits of ownership.section criminalizes knowingly and intentionally owning or operating a premises where property known to be illegally obtained is altered so that it will be misidentified,become unidentifiable,or be sold or otherwise disposed.a conviction under requires criminal intent.see people rodriguez,wl at,the own or operate element of is construed broadly to include any person who actively participates in the conduct of altering or disassembling vehicles with the requisite criminal intent.citing ramirez,d at emphasis added.
the second element of theft offense under a g is taking or exercising control over property without consent.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that this element is not necessarily satisfied by a conviction under.
under cal,the motor vehicle or motor vehicle part must be obtained by theft,fraud,or conspiracy to defraud.if,under california law,one can obtain property through theft,fraud,or conspiracy to defraud,and do so with the valid consent of the owner,then a violation of does not satisfy the second element of a a g theft offense.we consider these possibilities in turn.
obtaining property by theft 
section of the california vehicle code,defining a chop shop,proscribes altering,destroying,any motor vehicle or motor vehicle part known to be illegally obtained by theft.neither nor defines theft,so we take the definition from california general theft statute,which provides in relevant part 
every person who shall feloniously steal,take,carry,lead,or drive away the personal property of another,or who shall fraudulently appropriate property which has been entrusted to him or her,or who shall knowingly and designedly,by any false or fraudulent representation or pretense,defraud any other person of money,labor or real or personal property,or who causes or procures others to report falsely of his or her wealth or mercantile character and by thus imposing upon any person,obtains credit and thereby fraudulently gets or obtains possession of money,or property or obtains the labor or service of another,is guilty of theft.
in,we held that a violation of a does not categorically constitute a theft offense under a g.we so held because a sweeps more broadly than generic theft under a g.among other things,a criminalizes aiding and abetting,which includes promotion and instigation of theft.further,a criminalizes theft of labor and false credit reporting,neither of which is a theft of property.at.but does not resolve our case.even though looks to a for its definition of theft,it is much narrower than a.section has no aiding and abetting provision.moreover,the theft under is limited to theft of property,indeed to a subcategory of property any motor vehicle or motor vehicle part.
theft of property under code a includes larceny,embezzlement,larceny by trick,and theft by false pretenses.people shannon,th,d.larceny,larceny by trick,and embezzlement involve taking another personal property from the owner possession,without the owner consent id.therefore,a conviction for any of these kinds of theft satisfies the nonconsent element in a g.
however,theft by false pretenses may be accomplished with the owner consent.theft by false pretenses has three elements a false pretense or representation,the intent to defraud the owner of his or her property,and the false pretense or representation materially influenced the owner to part
