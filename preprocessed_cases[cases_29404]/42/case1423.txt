opinion of the court 
appellant alket voci,a native of albania,appeals a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia,in which the bia affirmed the immigration judge ij denial of voci application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the united nations convention against torture cat the bia rejected the ij determination that voci lacked credibility,but agreed nonetheless that voci had failed to demonstrate eligibility for asylum or for other relief.because voci testimony has been accepted by the bia as credible,we hold that the bia erred in determining that the incidents of police mistreatment described by voci did not rise to the level of persecution under the immigration and nationality act ina.while we take no position concerning whether voci will ultimately be entitled to the relief he seeks,the absence of analysis in the bia decision requires remand to the bia,in order to permit the bia explicitly to address the issues implicated by voci application for asylum.in addition,if upon remand voci is able to establish that he suffered past persecution,it may be appropriate for the agency to address whether the government has shown that conditions in albania have changed,such that voci no longer has a reasonable fear of facing persecution if he were to return.
factual background and procedural history 
voci testimony 
voci testified extensively concerning his background and family history in albania.while voci discussed various forms of mistreatment that his grandfather experienced under the communist regime,these issues have little bearing on voci eligibility for asylum.with respect to his own persecution,voci testified that in he became involved in the democracy movement that was taking hold in albania.voci indicated that he and other students at his high school,along with four professors,began holding meetings to discuss ways in which they could seek democratic reform.voci indicated that the movement grew over time,and on february,a large protest rally was held in korca,albania.at this rally,protesters pulled down a large statue of enver hoxha,a former communist prime minister of albania.voci testified that he was beaten by police officers at this protest,and he suffered cuts which required stitches,ultimately resulting in a lengthy hospital stay when his wounds became infected.
voci testified that during the early,as the democratic party gained power and influence,he and other activists received a number of anonymous threatening letters warning them to cease their political activities.voci also indicated that from through,the police repeatedly came to his home searching for him,and they threatened his mother with harm if voci did not cease his political activities.voci explained that the police had videotaped the february,protest rally in korca,and by reviewing these videotapes they identified voci as one of the leaders of the rally.along with the visits to his home,voci also indicated that on several occasions during this same period the police came to his school looking for him,and that on these occasions voci managed to get out of the school building without being caught.
the democratic party won elections in,but according to voci this did not end his persecution by the police.voci indicated that in the years leading up to,when the socialist party regained power,he was beaten up on many occasions by the police.voci testified that seven of these beatings were severe,resulting in bleeding and scars.three of these beatings occurred in connection with demonstrations in which voci participated,and four occurred on occasions when the police accosted voci on a street or alleyway as he walked through town.on one occasion,the police beat voci with the blunt end of a gun,breaking his knee and causing voci to spend several weeks in the hospital.
voci testified that the socialist party regained power in,and that its leadership was comprised of former communist party officials operating under a new name.voci stated that he continued to face persecution after the socialists regained power in,culminating in a incident in which the police came to his parents house,destroyed a number of the family belongings,and beat voci,his mother,and his sister.voci also explained that during the mid to he faced police harassment in connection with a restaurant that he operated with a friend and fellow democratic party activist.police would come to the restaurant,harass and threaten patrons,break glasses and windows,and generally disrupt the business.voci indicated that although the men who beat him and attacked his restaurant were often dressed in plain clothes,he recognized them as local police officers.voci indicated that as a result of the persecution he faced,he attempted to relocate to a different part of albania to stay with his uncle.this arrangement was only temporary,however,and he eventually fled albania and came to the united states,arriving on march,
b.the ij opinion 
at the conclusion of voci june,hearing,the ij stated that he would deny voci petition for relief.the ij memorialized his findings and rationale in a separate oral decision and order.the ij indicated that he did not view voci testimony as credible,and concluded as well that nothing the respondent has testified to amounts to persecution in the considered opinion of the court.the ij noted that the communists have been gone from albania since and there is absolutely no evidence that the socialists have persecuted the respondent prior to his coming to the united states and absolutely no proof that he is going to be persecuted again if he returns to his country.the ij also stated that voci had failed to prove his various allegations to this court satisfaction insofar as he has not submitted any supporting documentation.
the ij went on to discuss country conditions in albania,noting that the state department reports contained in the record reflected favorably on the political climate in albania.based upon these materials,the ij stated 
assuming arguendo that the respondent had indeed proven to the court that he had been persecuted before the fall of communism and after the socialists had taken power in albania,the court would nonetheless deny his instant application under insofar as based on the state department reports the court finds that there has been a fundamental change in the circumstances in albania such to the effect that the respondent would no longer have a fear of persecution in his country if he were indeed returned to albania.
c.the bia opinion 
voci appealed the ij denial of his petition to the bia,and on february,the bia issued a opinion dismissing voci appeal.the bia opinion states 
the immigration judge decision dated june,accurately sets forth the facts asserted by the respondent in support of his claim for relief from removal.while we do not agree with the immigration judge adverse credibility finding,we agree that the respondent has not demonstrated eligibility for asylum and also affirm the immigration judge determination that the respondent has failed to establish grounds for granting the other forms of relief requested.in sum,the respondent has not demonstrated that he has suffered past persecution in albania.nor has he demonstrated a fear of persecution based on a protected ground under the act were he to return to albania.likewise,the respondent has not established that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted or tortured upon return to albania.we note that the respondent contends on appeal that the manner in which the immigration judge conducted the hearing,as well as the immigration judge attitude toward him,deprived him of his right to a fair hearing.a review of the hearing transcript does not reveal,however,that the respondent suffered any prejudice.inasmuch as we are in agreement with the immigration judge decision,we affirm his decision based upon and for the reasons set forth herein.accordingly,the respondent appeal is dismissed.

ii.jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction over an appeal from a final order of the bia affirming a decision of the ij to deny an alien asylum application.a see berishaj ashcroft,cir.in this case,although the bia agreed with the ij decision to deny relief,it did not adopt or defer to the findings of the ij.instead,it expressed disagreement with the ij adverse credibility finding,but stated in a conclusory fashion that voci had failed to show that he suffered past persecution in albania.in such cases the final order we review is the decision of the bia,not the decision of the ij.see miah ashcroft,cir the final order we normally review is the decision of the bia,unless the bia defers to the ij findings abdulai ashcroft,cir congress has granted us power to review only final orders of removal.because an alien facing removal may appeal to the bia as of right,and because the bia has the power to conduct a de novo review of ij decisions,there is no final order until the bia acts.accordingly,we now expressly hold that the final order we review is that of the bia.citations omitted.
we recognize that in some instances,we review both the decisions of the ij and the bia.however,because our jurisdiction is restricted to reviewing final orders of removal,this approach is meant to be the exception rather than the rule.see abdulai,at we begin by clarifying that,absent special circumstances not present here,we review only decisions by the bia and not those by immigration judges emphasis added.when first addressing this issue in abdulai,we characterized situations in which the ij decision would be reviewed as those in which the bia expressly adopted a portion of the ij opinion or announced that it was deferring to the ij findings.see id.at.our subsequent cases have followed this approach.see,korytnyuk ashcroft,cir analyzing bia use of passive voice to conclude that bia had adopted specific factual finding made by ij chen ashcroft,cir where bia opinion listed flaws in applicant testimony,and stated that for those reasons and others cited in the immigration judge decision,the immigration judge correctly denied the respondent application,court would review both decisions emphasis added xie ashcroft,cir reviewing both decisions where bia stated that it was giving significant weight to ij adverse credibility finding,and disclaiming reliance on ij demeanor analysis where applicant demeanor was not referenced in bia opinion miah,at explaining need to review both decisions where bia rejected ij adverse credibility finding,and explicitly adopted ij corroboration analysis,noting that issues were intertwined because ij credibility findings influenced ij views concerning necessity of corroboration.
in sum,the cases in which we have reviewed both decisions have all involved situations in which the language of the bia opinion directly states that the bia is deferring to the ij,or invokes specific aspects of the ij analysis and factfinding in support of the bia conclusions.here,in contrast,the bia expressed disagreement with the ij adverse credibility finding,and did not specifically reference or adopt other portions of the ij analysis.in agreeing with the decision reached by the ij,the bia stated that it was doing so based upon and for the reasons set forth herein.emphasis added.in this situation,we must restrict our review to the question of whether the underlying record provides substantial evidence for the bia conclusions.as discussed below,we can not rescue the bia from its paucity of analysis by injecting issues that were raised by the ij,but were neither addressed nor relied upon in the bia opinion 
iii.analysis 
an asylum applicant must demonstrate either past persecution or a fear of future persecution.see gao ashcroft,cir.in order to establish eligibility on the basis of past persecution,an applicant must show an incident,or incidents,that rise to the level of persecution that is on account of a statutorily protected ground and is committed by the government or forces the government is either unable or unwilling to control.see gao,at.an applicant has a fear of future persecution if he shows that he has a subjectively genuine fear,and that a reasonable person in his circumstances would fear persecution if returned to his native country.see id.
whether an asylum applicant has demonstrated past persecution or a fear of future persecution is a factual determination reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.see id.citing abdille ashcroft,cir.
t he question whether an agency determination is supported by substantial evidence is the same as the question whether a reasonable fact finder could make such a determination based upon the administrative record.if a reasonable fact finder could make a particular finding on the administrative record,then the finding is supported by substantial evidence.conversely,if no reasonable fact finder could make that finding on the administrative record,the finding is not supported by substantial evidence.
dia ashcroft,cir en banc.
the bia accepted voci testimony as credible,and yet determined that voci had not shown that he experienced past persecution in albania.the bia opinion does not explain how the bia reached this result.it appears there are two paths the bia may have taken,neither of which is satisfactory on the current record.first,the bia could have determined that even accepting voci testimony as true,the beatings and other mistreatment he experienced simply did not rise to the level of persecution under the ina.alternatively,the bia could have determined that even if voci testimony was credible,and even if the events described in the testimony would be sufficiently severe to constitute persecution,voci failure to provide corroborative documentary evidence meant that voci had not carried his burden of proof with respect to demonstrating past persecution.
a.the severity theory 
the first theory,that the alleged mistreatment suffered by voci at the hands of the police was not sufficiently severe to constitute persecution,appears to be inconsistent with existing bia and federal appellate decisions.while the ina does not define the term persecution,we have indicated that persecution denotes extreme conduct,and that the concept of persecution does not encompass all treatment that our society regards as unfair,unjust or even unlawful or unconstitutional.see fatin ins,cir.voci alleged that he suffered multiple beatings,seven of which he characterized as severe,and at least one of which resulted in a broken knee and an extended hospital stay he also alleges that he was threatened on multiple occasions,and that police attempted to intimidate his family members and threatened their safety if voci refused to abandon his political activities.
taken together,we believe the mistreatment alleged by voci rises to the level of persecution.if voci indeed faced multiple beatings from police,including beatings that caused injury and that in one instance broke his knee and resulted in extended hospitalization,all as a result of his political beliefs,it can fairly be said that the police were engaged in a program or campaign to drive away or subjugate voci because of his beliefs.see fatin,at discussing definition of persecution.prior bia precedent supports this view.for example,in a case where an asylum applicant suffered physical attacks on three occasions,where his son suffered a physical attack that resulted in an injury to the son knee requiring hospitalization,where the applicant apartment was broken into and his possessions stolen or destroyed,and where the applicant and his son were verbally harassed and threatened on multiple occasions,the bia held that these incidents constitute more than mere discrimination and harassment.in the aggregate,they rise to the level of persecution as contemplated by the act.see in re,wl,bia lexis,april.
while this court has not yet drawn a precise line concerning where a simple beating ends and persecution begins,our cases suggest that isolated incidents that do not result in serious injury do not rise to the level of persecution.see,chen ashcroft,cir holding that bia reasonably found that respondent alleged beating at the hands of government officials did not constitute persecution,and stating chen scuffle with the local officials does not appear to have been serious.for
