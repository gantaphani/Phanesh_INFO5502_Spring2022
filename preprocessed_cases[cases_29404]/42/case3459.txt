alberto ayala nicanor ayala appeals his month sentence of incarceration for illegal reentry after a prior deportation,in violation of a and b.
the district court increased ayala base offense level by sixteen points because it concluded that ayala conviction for willful infliction of corporal injury on a spouse,california penal code,is a categorical crime of violence under sentencing guidelines.in so doing,the court relied on our decision in united states laurico yeno,cir,which held that is a categorical crime of violence warranting a increase under the sentencing guidelines.ayala urges us to conclude that we are not bound by laurico yeno because the supreme court subsequent decision in johnson united states,is irreconcilable intervening authority in that it redefines the meaning of the term crime of violence.
ayala also asserts procedural error,contending that the district court never responded to ayala policy challenge to the illegal reentry guideline requiring a sentencing enhancement for certain prior convictions.because we conclude that laurico yeno remains good law and that the district court provided a reasoned explanation for increasing ayala offense level by sixteen,we affirm.
we have jurisdiction over ayala timely appeal under.we review the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines,including whether a crime qualifies as a crime of violence under,de novo.united states bolanos hernandez,cir.we generally review the district court application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts of a case for abuse of discretion.united states grissom,cir.however,since ayala did not object below to the sufficiency of the court explanation for its sentencing determination,we review only for plain error.united states valencia barragan,cir.
on july,ayala pleaded guilty to being found in the united states after a prior deportation,in violation of a and b.
in the presentence report psr,the probation officer recommended the increase to ayala offense level based on his prior convictions for categorical crimes of violence.the psr indicated that in june,before his deportation,ayala had been convicted of two felonies arising out of a domestic assault upon his wife corporal injury to a spouse,in violation of california penal code a and assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury,in violation of california penal code a.ayala was sentenced to one year in state prison on his conviction,and three years in state prison on the a conviction,with the sentences running concurrently.
ayala objected to the psr on the ground that california penal code,corporal injury to a spouse,is not a categorical crime of violence because it is broad enough to include a least touching.ayala also argued that the sentencing enhancement is without empirical or moral justification,results in unwarranted sentencing disparities,and imposes a disproportionate penalty.ayala sought a variance of eight levels under a to account for these policy concerns,requesting that the court impose a month sentence of incarceration,instead of a sentence within the advisory guidelines range of months.the government sentencing memorandum urged the district court to apply the enhancement,and recommended a sentence of months of incarceration.
after the parties filed their sentencing memoranda,but before ayala sentencing hearing,we definitively rejected the argument that a violation of is not a categorical crime of violence warranting a increase under.laurico yeno,at.at sentencing,ayala counsel conceded that laurico yeno foreclosed her argument that is not categorically a crime of violence.the district court then applied the enhancement to find a total offense level of,found that ayala criminal history category was vi,and calculated an advisory guidelines range of months of incarceration.the district court reasoned that,in light of ayala extensive criminal history,the month sentence advocated by defense counsel would neither protect the public from future crimes by ayala nor serve as adequate deterrence for ayala.the court explicitly noted that it had considered ayala policy attack on the increase,and it reiterated the advisory nature of the sentencing guidelines.after considering the a sentencing factors and articulating a parsimony provision as the basis for the sentence it intended to impose,the court imposed a sentence of months of incarceration,to be followed by a term of supervised release.ayala timely appealed.
in evaluating whether a prior conviction is for a categorical crime of violence warranting the illegal reentry sentencing enhancement,we apply the categorical approach set forth in taylor united states.under the categorical approach,the court looks not to the particular facts underlying the defendant prior conviction,but only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.united states aguila montes de oca,slip op.at cir,en banc alterations in original quoting taylor,at.the sentencing enhancement applies only if the full range of conduct covered by the state statute fall s within the scope of the federal statutory provision.united states pallares galem,cir.to escape the enhancement,a defendant must show either that the statutory definition of the crime covers a broader range of conduct than the relevant federal generic definition,or that he can point to cases in which the state courts in fact did apply the statute to conduct outside the federal definition.gonzales duenas alvarez.
the illegal reentry sentencing guideline provision advises a sentencing enhancement of sixteen levels if a defendant has previously been deported after a felony conviction for a crime of violence.b a ii.the applicable guidelines commentary defines crime of violence to include any offense under federal,state,or local law that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,cmt.b iii.
california penal code a punishes any person who willfully inflicts upon a person who is his or her spouse,former spouse,cohabitant,former cohabitant,or the mother or father of his or her child,corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition.the statute defines a traumatic condition as a condition of the body,such as a wound or external or internal injury,whether of a minor or serious nature,caused by a physical force.c.the relevant question is whether a conviction under requires the use,the attempted use,or the threatened use of physical force against the person of another.in laurico yeno,a decision filed in january,we answered this question in the affirmative,holding that is categorically a crime of violence within the meaning of b a ii.the supreme court issued its decision in johnson,in march of.ayala argues we are not bound by laurico yeno,citing miller gammie,cir en banc,in which we held that a panel need not follow a prior panel decision if its reasoning is irreconcilable with an intervening decision by a higher court.because we conclude that nothing in johnson undermines the reasoning of laurico yeno,we reject ayala argument.
in laurico yeno,we held that is a categorical crime of violence under the illegal reentry guidelines because requires the intentional use of physical force against the person of another.at.we recognized that our prior case law restricted the meaning of crime of violence to only those crimes that require the intentional use of force,id.at citing fernandez ruiz gonzales,cir and to qualify as a crime of violence,the crime must,under supreme court precedent,fall in the category of violent,active crimes.id.quoting leocal ashcroft.reasoning that the plain terms of the statute require a person willfully to inflict upon another person a traumatic condition,thus satisfying both the elements of intent and active violence,we concluded that fits squarely within the federal definition of a crime of violence by requiring the deliberate use of force that injures another,id.at.
we rejected laurico argument that a least touching could result in a conviction under because laurico failed to identify a single case resulting from a use of force.id.at.laurico merely presented the panel with a theoretical possibility th
