charangeet a native and citizen of india,petitions this court to review an order of the board of immigration appeals bia that singh be deported from the united states to india.this appeal requires us to determine whether providing food and setting up shelter for people engaged in terrorist activities constitutes affording material support within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act ina a b iv vi,a b iv vi supp.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that it does,and we will deny the petition for review.
the bia had jurisdiction to review the decision of the immigration judge ij pursuant to b renumbered b.because singh was placed in deportation proceedings before april,and his final order of deportation was issued by the bia after october,we have jurisdiction under a,as amended by the transitional rules for judicial review in section c of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,stat,iirira.see also sandoval reno,cir applying iirira transitional rules of jurisdiction.
singh entered the united states without inspection on september.the immigration and naturalization service ins initiated deportation proceedings.singh submitted an application for asylum,asserting that if he returned to india he would be arrested and persecuted.he claimed membership in the babbar khalsa group,whose purpose,he said,was to protect and promote the sikh faith,and the sant jarnail sing bhindrawala militant group,whose purpose was to fight for and protect the religious and political cause of sikh community.singh stated that he had participated in demonstrations and other activities of these two groups.he further claimed to be on the military and police wanted list because of known and suspected activities against the government of india.
in an affidavit supporting his asylum application,singh stated that after the indian military attacked a sikh holy site called the golden temple in,he together with many other young men in our village formally took the vows to join and follow the militant section of sant jarnail,known as babbar khalsa.he said that he participated in planning meetings and became involved in assisting the freedom fighters in the movement of weapons through my village and other villages,as well as giving shelter to militants who were involved in the transportation of weapons.subsumed in all of this is a statement of military activity against the government of india.
singh submitted additional materials supporting his application for asylum,including evidence of active membership in the international sikh youth federation and a statement by the khalistan commando force that singh had taken an oath to participate with the force.
a previous immigration judge in this case referred singh application for asylum to the department of state for its review and comments.see.in a letter dated january,the state department bureau of human rights and humanitarian affairs concluded that the indian government did not persecute sikhs such as singh merely for their faith or membership in certain organizations.rather,sikhs targeted for arrest were those who had involvement in specific violent acts.
the state department further commented 
the applicant,however,admits to membership in the international sikh youth federation,a radical offshoot of the aissf,as well as the khalistan commando force,a notorious terrorist group responsible for a grisly april random killing in a punjab village,and the equally notorious babbar khalsa,an even more fundamentalist terrorist group with a reputation for its use of explosives.many of the bombings resulting in the murder of innocent persons in recent years are attributed to the latter group.
following the entry of the state department letter,the administrative record reflects an unexplained gap of nearly four years in the proceedings.on october,the ins moved to recalendar the case for completion of deportation proceedings.subsequently,singh informed an immigration judge that he was the beneficiary of an approved skilled worker visa petition enabling him to proceed on an application for adjustment of status he stated that the adjustment of status request would be his principal application.
singh then submitted an affidavit purporting to clarify statements in his asylum application.he asserted that he had never been involved in or supported violent activities against indian government officials.he stated that the indian police and military merely presumed that he,as a sikh,opposed the government.he said that he had undergone an induction ceremony known as amrit chakna,in which he committed to remain faithful to his religion,to wear a turban and to keep his hair and beard long.he stated that he was enrolled as a member of babbar khalsa at the time of this ceremony.
he further stated that,having participated in amrit chakna,he was expected to make charitable contributions to the community,including provision of food and assistance to the poor.while acknowledging that some members of babbar khalsa had been involved in violence in the,he stated that he had been in the united states since and did not support militant activities.he did state,however,that while he was in india there were several killings of indian police by muslims in sikh clothing.
at a hearing on january,singh told the ij that he assisted with meetings of sant jarnail singh followers 
used to help by putting that tent and organize the mondo sic or the tent i never kept any weapons.those sikhs who were baptized,they used to come and they knew that i am also baptized and i just help them with them food.
on february,the ij concluded that singh was eligible for adjustment of status and granted his application.the ij determined that even though singh had entered the united states without inspection,his presence gave him sufficient equity to overcome that adverse immigration conduct.the ins appealed,and on february,the bia vacated the ij order and ordered singh removed from the united states.the bia determined that singh was ineligible for adjustment of status pursuant to a and a b 
we note that the respondent testified that he was a member of the babbar khalsa and the sant jarnail singh bhindra wala.see tr.at.he further testified that he had helped members of these groups,who were fighting the indian government,by giving them food and helping to set up tents for them.see tr.at.a person engages in terrorist activities by providing any type of material support to any individual the actor knows,or reasonably should know,has committed or plans to commit a terrorist activity.see section a b iii of the act emphasis added.we find that the described actions,of offering food and helping to arrange shelter for persons,constitute material support,as contemplated by section a b iii of the act.the respondent further admitted that he had offered the described support to militants who were engaged in terrorist activities.see tr.at.as these militants were members of groups which were designated as terrorist organizations,by the united states department of state,and on account of the respondent admission that he was aware of their terrorist activities,we find that the respondent did in fact offer persons,who had committed and were planning to commit terrorist activities,material support.
at footnote omitted.
singh timely petitioned for review.
we review the bia factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence.von pervieux ins,cir ins,cir.we will uphold the bia interpretation of the ina unless the interpretation is arbitrary,capricious or manifestly contrary to the statute.ahmed ashcroft,cir citations omitted.
under the ina,the attorney general has authority to grant adjustments of status to aliens who meet certain requirements.see ina a a.the question here is whether singh was admissible to the united states for permanent residence.see ina a a.he was inadmissible if he has engaged in a terrorist activity.ina a b i i a b i i supp.the ina definition of engaging in a terrorist activity includes the provision of material support 
as used in this chapter,the term engage in terrorist activity means,in an individual capacity or as a member of an organization 
vi to commit an act that the actor knows,or reasonably should know,affords material support,including a safe house,transportation,communications,funds,transfer of funds or other material financial benefit,false documentation or identification,weapons including chemical,biological,or radiological weapons,explosives of training 
aa for the commission of a terrorist activity 
bb to any individual who the actor knows,or reasonably should know,has committed or plans to commit a terrorist activity 
ina a b iv,a b iv supp.emphasis added.
the bia stated that the department of state had designated babbar khalsa as a terrorist organization.none of the organizations to which singh belonged,including babbar khalsa,are among the foreign terrorist organizations fto designated by the united states department of state in accordance with ina.see ch.v,app.babbar khalsa and the international sikh youth federation,however,were named by the department of the treasury on june,as specially designated global terrorist sdgt organizations in accordance with an program authorized in by presidential executive order.see ch.v,app.a see also audrey kurth cronin,the fto list and congress sanctioning designated foreign terrorist organizations,crs report for congress.
we need not,however,determine whether the bia erred in retroactively applying the sdgt designations to the organizations with which singh interacted in india prior to.nor do we need to consider whether babbar khalsa,sant jarnail singh,the international sikh youth federation or any other group was a terrorist organization within the meaning of ina a b iv vi cc or dd,a b iv vi cc or dd.rather,our task tracks the narrow compass of determining whether singh conduct in providing food and setting up tents constituted material support either for the commission of terrorist activity or to any individual who the actor knows,or reasonably should know,has committed or plans to commit a terrorist activity.ina a b iv vi aa and bb a b iv vi aa and bb.this is so because inadmissibility results from provision of material support either to those who have committed or plan to commit terrorist activity or to terrorist organizations.see ina a b iv vi,a b iv vi.the bia based its decision on the former.
we must first determine whether the type of activity in which singh engaged comes within the statutory definition of material support as a matter of law.if we conclude that it does,we must then decide whether singh conduct constituted material support as a matter of fact.
we turn now to the statute.we start with the language employed by congress,and we assume that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used.ins phinpathya,d internal quotations and citations omitted.the word material means h aving some logical connection with the consequential facts.black law dictionary ed.it also means significant or essential.id.support is defined as s ustenance or maintenance,articles such as food and clothing that allow one to live in the degree of comfort to which one is accustomed.id.at.
in illustrating the concept of material support to those engaged in terrorist activities,ina section a b iv vi provides various examples that broadly cover the areas of lodging,communications,transportation,financing,weapons and provision of other means to accomplish terrorist activities.the list presented in ina section a b iv vi,supra,is not exhaustive.no language in the statute limits material support to the enumerated examples.use of the term including suggests that congress intended to illustrate a broad concept rather than narrowly circumscribe a term with exclusive categories.see in re sgl carbon,cir stating that a statute in which the word including was followed by a list of factors strongly suggests those factors are not exhaustive.
that the federal statute criminalizing the provision of material support or resources to terrorists,section includes a longer list of examples does not lead to the conclusion that ina section a b iv vi must be read as an exhaustive list.we are familiar with the canon of statutory construction urged on us by singh where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.ins,d internal quotation and citation omitted.
this canon,however,is not applicable in this case.first,the two statutes were not enacted by the same congress.the ina provision was adopted in and revised in,and the criminal provision was adopted in.see immigration act of,a,stat,uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism usa patriot act of,a,stat,violent crime control and law enforcement act of,a,stat.thus,we can not say that the differences in the two statutes are significantly highlighted by the fact that the same congress simultaneously drafted them,at.second,it would be incongruous to conclude that a person who provides food and sets up tents for terrorists could be jailed for up to life under section,but the same conduct could not prohibit admission to the united states under ina section.see united states hodge,cir stating avoidance of unintended or absurd results is a deeply rooted rule of statutory construction internal quotations and citation omitted.
for the reasons described above,the bia conclusion that congress intended ina section a b iv vi to include provision of food and setting up tents within the definition of material support was not arbitrary,capricious or manifestly contrary to the statute.ahmed,at see also mcmullen ins,cir rejecting as too narrow the petitioner argument that the nonpolitical crimes exception to withholding of deportation in the former ina section h,section h,applied only to those who actually pulled the trigger and holding instead that it encompassed those who provide the physical and logistical support that enable,modern terrorist groups to operate.
we must now apply the foregoing precepts to the facts in this case.
in response to questioning from the ij at a hearing on january,singh described his role in meetings of sant jarnail singh followers 
well,but in this statement,sir,that i just read to you,you say there were known activities that you took against the indian government.what were those activities 
sant jarnail singh organized meetings in different villages to propagate religion.
so,in other words you telling me that you attended these meetings,correct 
yes.we used to have those people to arrange our tents and put sort preparation of the food and also arrange to bring people to these gatherings and then take them back to their places.
later in the same hearing,singh responded to questions from the ins attorney 
so,in other words,you were helping the militants who were involved in terrorist activities is that true 
a.when we came from far away to this indiscernible congregation,then we may have some contact.we never help in any other way than giving them food.yes.
taking singh statement of minimal participation,it is beyond cavil that singh furnished food and shelter to sant jarnail singh followers participating in meetings.the sole remaining issue is whether the individuals to whom singh provided food and shelter come within the rubric of ina section a b iv.
we must now decide whether substantial evidence supports the bia determination that singh provided food and shelter to individuals who he knew or reasonably should have known had committed or planned to commit terrorist activity.
we begin with the statutory definition of terrorist activity as any activity which is unlawful under the laws of the place where it is committed and involving,among other things,t he use of any explosive,firearm or other weapon or dangerous device other than for mere personal monetary gain,with intent to endanger,directly or indirectly,the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.ina a b iii,a b iii.the evidence is clear that at the time of singh participation with them,the members of the various militant sikh organizations opposed to the indian government had committed or planned to commit terrorist activity.
although singh stated that the purpose of the meetings at which he provided food and shelter was to propagate the teachings of sant jarnail singh,he did not elaborate at the january,hearing on the content of those teachings.in his first affidavit,however,singh stated sant jarnail singh bhindrawala was never inclined to be militant.however,after his death his group became militant because of the violence perpetrated upon him and his and his sic followers by the indian military.
a amnesty international report submitted by singh as part of his asylum application related a june,battle,where heavy fighting ensued between the army and the followers of sant jarnail singh bhindranwale,the sikh fundamentalist leader who had taken refuge in the temple and who the government blamed for directing much of the violence in the punjab in recent years.
although babbar khalsa and the international sikh youth federation,groups to which singh belonged,were not named specially designated global terrorist organizations until,it does not follow that members of those groups were not involved in terrorist activities prior to.in commenting on singh asylum application in,the state department concluded that the international sikh youth federation was a radical of another group that the khalistan commando force,to which singh had taken an oath,was a notorious terrorist group responsible for a grisly april random killing in a punjab village and that babbar khalsa was equally notorious,was an even more fundamentalist terrorist group with a reputation for its use of explosives and was responsible for bombings that killed innocent people.
the activities described by the state department come within the meaning of the ina definition of terrorist activities because they involved assassinations and use of explosives with intent to endanger,directly or indirectly,the safety of one or more individuals.ina a b iii iv and v a b iii iv and v supp.the amnesty international report and singh own statements provide evidence that the followers of sant jarnail singh also engaged in terrorist activities within the meaning of the ina.
even in light of the recantations made in his second affidavit,singh activities in conjunction with his membership in various militant sikh organizations consisted of providing food to militant sikhs who had committed or planned to commit terrorist activity and setting up tents for meetings of militants who had committed or planned to commit terrorist activity 
although singh himself denied participating directly in any violence,substantial evidence supports the bia determination that he knew or should have known the militant sikhs to whom he provided food and shelter had committed or planned to commit terrorist activities within the meaning of the statute.that is sufficient to render singh inadmissible under ina a b iv vi bb.because he was inadmissible,singh did not meet the requirements for adjustment of status.ina a,a.
the petition for review will be denied.
finding that helped members of sikh militant groups by giving them food and helping to set up tents,the board of immigration appeals bia held that engaged in terrorist activities.however,testified that the meetings were for religious purposes,and the bia did not find testimony to lack credibility.the issue here is therefore straightforward whether providing food and tents for such meetings,without more,constitutes engag ing in terrorist activity through provision of material support.the acts here are not of the degree and kind contemplated by the material support provision material acts in support of terrorism.because the majority holding ignores the plain language of the statute by reading material out of material support,i respectfully dissent.
before addressing the statute,it is necessary to clarify the scope and standard of our review.the majority does not at first restrict its discussion to the bia findings,and recites in detail material from asylum application.see op.at.although those facts cast in an unfavorable light,the majority ultimately concedes in a footnote that asylum application was not relevant to the bia decision,which rested solely on food and tents.see op.at indeed,the bia,in reversing the order of the immigration judge ij,did not recite or rely upon the asylum application at all.and although we do not review the findings of the ij,he accepted testimony disclaiming the asylum application in finding eligible for adjustment of status.thus,our scope of review is limited to the bia stated basis of offering food and helping to arrange shelter for these meetings.see also ernesto navas ins,cir we can not affirm the bia on a ground upon which it did not rely 
it must be further noted that testified that the food and tents were set up for religious meetings.neither the ij nor the bia made an adverse credibility finding.because the bia did not adopt or defer to the ij finding on credibility,we must proceed as if petitioner testimony were credible and determine whether the bia decision is supported by substantial evidence in the face of his assumed but not determined credibility.kayembe ashcroft,cir see also lim ins,cir where neither ij nor bia make express credibility findings,court must accept testimony as true.therefore,we must assume testimony before the ij to be true.
in addition,it must be noted as the majority implicitly concedes that the bia erred in finding that the babbar khalsa and sant jarnail singh bhindra wala hereinafter,sant jarnail groups had been designated terrorist organizations by the department of state see op.at.thus,as the majority appears to agree,the bia holding can not be upheld on the basis that provided material support to a terrorist organization.rather,the bia holding rests solely on the narrow ground that the provision of food and tents prior to to unnamed members of the babbar khalsa and sant jarnail organizations was the provision of material support to any individual the actor knows,or reasonably should know,has committed or plans to commit a terrorist activity.however,the record does not contain any evidence as to what terrorist acts,if any,these unnamed individuals committed or planned to commit.
regarding our standard of review,the bia interpretation of the statute can not be upheld under any standard.the majority appears to apply chevron deference,see op.at,but as the statute is unambiguous and its meaning is plain,unbridled agency deference is unwarranted.as the supreme court held in ins cyr,d,we only defer to agency interpretations of statutes that,applying the normal tools of statutory construction,are ambiguous.id.at.quoting chevron natural resources defense council,d see also steele blackman,cir where the language of a statute is clear,however,the text of the statute is the end of the matter.
examining the statute plain language and employing the normal tools of statutory construction,i conclude that congress did not intend material support to embrace acts that are not of importance or relevance to terrorism.to hold otherwise reads material out of material support and treats half of the statutory term as surplusage.such a result is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute and with the normal tools of statutory construction.
section of the immigration and nationality act ina provides that an alien may be eligible for adjustment of status,if,among other things,he is admissible to the united states for permanent residence.ina a,a.section,in turn,provides that any alien who has engaged in a terrorist activity is inadmissible.ina a b i i,a b i i.thus,we must determine whether the bia properly found that had engaged in a terrorist activity.under ina,engage in terrorist activity means,among other things 
vi to commit an act that the actor knows,or reasonably should know,affords material support,including a safe house,transportation,communications,funds,transfer of funds or other material financial benefit,false documentation or identification,weapons including chemical,biological,or radiological weapons,explosives,or training 
aa for the commission of a terrorist activity 
bb to any individual who the actor knows,or reasonably should know,has committed or plans to commit a terrorist activity 
cc to a terrorist organization described in clause vi i or vi ii or 
dd to a terrorist organization described in clause vi iii,unless the actor can demonstrate that he did not know,and should not reasonably have known,that the act would further the organization terrorist activity.
ina a b iv vi,a b iv vi.
i agree with the majority threshold canon that we assume that the legislative purpose is expressed by the ordinary meaning of the words used.op.at quoting ins phinpathya,d internal quotations and citations omitted.employing that canon,i have no doubt that the term support,in isolation,could embrace food and tents.as noted by the majority,support is defined as sustenance or maintenance,articles such as food and clothing that allow one to live in the degree of comfort to which one is accustomed.id.quoting black law dictionary ed.had the statute referred to mere support,i might concur with my colleagues,as substantial evidence shows that support was afforded.
but the analysis does not end there because material qualifies support.the majority correctly notes two meanings for material in this context h aving some logical connection with the consequential facts,and significant or essential.id.quoting black,supra,at.similarly,webster defines material in part as being of real importance or great consequence.webster third new int l dict.
even a cursory examination of the material support provision makes it clear that both meanings of material relevance and importance are embraced by the statute.regarding relevance,the statute express language requires an act that affords material support that is either for the commission of a terrorist activity,to any individual who the actor knows,or reasonably should know,has committed or plans to commit a terrorist activity,or to a terrorist organization.thus,the support must be relevant to the specified terrorist goal,terrorist persons,or terrorist organizations,which in sum means that the support must be relevant to terrorism.regarding importance,the statute recites a laundry list of types of material support that are relevant to terrorism safe house,transportation,communications,funds,transfer of funds or other material financial benefit,false documentation or identification,weapons including chemical,biological,or radiological weapons,explosives,or training.all are plainly important to terrorism,terrorists,or terrorist organizations.thus,the support must be important to terrorism.
therefore,even under the broadest possible reading,material in this context must mean both important and relevant to terrorism.material support,by its plain language,means that the act affording support must be of a kind and degree that has relevance and importance to terrorist activity,terrorists,or terrorist organizations.put another way,an act affording material support must move the ball down the field for terrorism.this is not to say that under certain circumstances,food and shelter could not be material support.but as these are normal types of support,the facts must show that they are more than mere,they must be of relevance and importance to terrorism.
the conclusion that material means both importance and relevance is underscored by further examination of the statute.first,mere support can not be material support.as noted,support means sustenance or maintenance.there is no doubt that sustenance,such as food and water,or maintenance,such as shelter,are necessary for life,but they are not per se necessary for terrorism.to hold differently cases like this one,involving food and transmute mere support into material support.this would eviscerate the statute.had congress intended the mere provision of food and shelter,without more,to be engag ing in terrorist activity,there would have been no need to include the term material in the statute.an indisputable axiom of statutory construction is that whenever possible each word in a statutory provision is to be given meaning and not to be treated as surplusage.acceptance ins.sloan,cir quotation marks omitted see also ki se lee ashcroft,cir we should adopt a construction which recognizes each element of the statute here,material has an obvious meaning and is not surplusage.
second,the examples of material support provided in the statute all regard acts of importance and relevance to terrorism,terrorists,and terrorist houses,transportation,communications,funds,transfer of funds or other material financial benefit,false documentation or identification,weapons including chemical,biological,or radiological weapons,explosives,or training.this reinforces the conclusion that material support means exactly that,support that is material 
that fact that the listing of types of material support is not exhaustive does not transform any type of support into material support.i do not disagree with the majority that the use of including before the laundry list means that the enumerated listing is not exhaustive.see in re sgl carbon,cir use of including followed by a listing of factors strongly suggests those factors are not exhaustive.however,it does not follow that any kind of support is material support.indeed,the majority ignores the canon that a nother commonplace rule of statutory construction is that the specific governs the general.ki see lee,at quoting doe bd.of medical examiners,cir alteration in original.here,the enumerated examples,consistent with the plain language of the term material support,are all acts that can be of importance and relevance to terrorism.any unenumerated act that is alleged to constitute material support must therefore be measured by the plain language of the term material support and the nature of the enumerated examples.even the enumerated act that is arguably the closest to the facts at hand of a safe house is plainly of a degree and kind that is important and relevant to terrorism and far different from the mere provision of food and tents 
third,my conclusion is further confirmed by the statute surrounding provisions.in determining congress intent,we look to the statute language,structure,subject matter,context,and that typically help courts determine a statute objectives and thereby illuminate its text.united states,d beecham united states,d the plain meaning that we seek to discern is the plain meaning of the whole statute,not of isolated sentences.here,afford ing material support is but one of six examples of engaging in terrorist activity.ina a b iv,a b iv.these other examples of engaging in terrorist activity are all grievous forms of conduct whose relevance and importance to terrorism are indisputable committing or inciting terrorist activity preparing or planning terrorist activity gathering information on potential targets for terrorist activity soliciting funds or other things of value for a terrorist activity or organization and soliciting any individual to engage in terrorist activity or to join a terrorist organization.ina a b iv i v,a b iv i v.
as the majority rightly suggests in a different context,avoiding unintended or absurd results is a deeply rooted rule of statutory construction.united states hodge,cir.it would be absurd for five of the definitions of engage in terrorist activity to be of import and gravity,but for the sixth definition to be otherwise.statutory construction is a holistic endeavor and,at a minimum,must account for a statute full text,language as well as punctuation,structure,and subject matter.tineo ashcroft,cir parenthetically quoting united states bank of or.indep.ins.agents of america,d alteration in original.as each disjunctive example of engage in terrorist activity is a significant form of conduct that materially furthers the goals of terrorism,so does material support.see beecham,at.that several items in a list share an attribute counsels in favor of interpreting the other items as possessing that attribute as well.
as a final matter,i turn briefly to the criminal material support statute.both and the majority argue that the statute supports their respective positions.the statute,entitled providing material support to terrorists,prohibits the provision of material support or resources for preparing or carrying out any of a list of enumerated terrorist and other significant crimes unlike ina,the definition of material support or resources in includes both safe houses and lodging.
i disagree with,who argues that under the maxim of expressio unius est exclusio alterius,the presence of lodging in,and its absence in ina,means that congress did not intend lodging to be material support for purposes of.as noted above,the listing in ina is not exhaustive.thus,the real question,as discussed above,is not whether conduct can be material support,but whether supportive acts rise to the requisite level of materiality.
i also part with the majority,which concludes that the existence of requires that we construe ina so broadly that we read material out of the statute.the majority suggests that it would be incongruous to conclude that a person who provides food and sets up tents for terrorists could be jailed for up to life under,but the same conduct could not prohibit admission to the united states under ina.op.at.
the majority suggestion of incongruity is easily dismissed.section requires that the material support or resources be provided by a person,knowing or intending that they are to be used in preparation for,or in carrying out a long list of specific and extremely serious crimes of terror under that statute,the mere provision of food and tents,even to a terrorist,would not be a criminal act unless the material support or resources were knowingly or intentionally supplied to be used in preparation for,or in carrying out one of specified and grievous terrorist crimes.
thus,one could not be jailed under,let alone jailed for life for providing a terrorist with a glass of water,unless,for example,the water was heavy water that the defendant knows or intends be used to develop a nuclear weapon.the majority does not explain how the mere provision of food and tents,without more,might constitute knowing or intentional provision of material support or resources that are to be used in preparation for,or in carrying out terrorist acts such as hijacking or unleashing weapons of mass destruction.in sum,there is no incongruity and does not support the majority attempt treat ina recitation of material as surplusage.
material support,by its plain language,means that the act affording support must be of a kind and degree that has relevance and importance for terrorist activity,terrorists,or terrorist organizations,and can not be mere support.in the next section,i apply this plain reading to the facts of the case and conclude that mere support does not rise to the requisite level of materiality.
applying the facts to the law,substantial evidence does not support the bia finding that provided material support.nothing in the record shows how the food and tents were important and relevant to terrorism,and indeed,testified that they were provided for religious meetings.the majority therefore relies on speculation by concluding that mere support to unnamed persons who may or may not have engaged in unknown terrorist activities constitutes material support.this conclusion substitutes conjecture for proof and reads material out of material support.
here,the majority concludes that t he evidence is clear that at the time of singh participation with them,the members of the various militant sikh organizations opposed to the indian government had committed or planned to commit terrorist activity.op.at.the majority bases its holding on five premises supplied food and tents prior to to unnamed members of the babbar khalsa sant jarnail organizations who engaged in unnamed terrorist acts or planned to engage in such unnamed acts,and knew or should have known that these unnamed individuals engaged in unnamed terrorist acts or planned to engage in such unnamed acts.
at best,only the first three premises are supported by the record.there is no dispute that supplied food and tents prior to to unnamed members of at least one of these organizations.but the administrative record contains nothing about whether the individuals at issue had engaged in terrorist acts or planned to do so.indeed,the record is to the testified that the meetings were for religious purposes.the ij did not find testimony to lack credibility and the bia did not find otherwise we therefore must proceed as if petitioner testimony were credible and determine whether the bia decision is supported by substantial evidence in the face of his assumed but not determined credibility.kayembe,at see also lim,at where neither the ij nor the bia expressly made credibility findings,court must accept testimony as true.nor did the bia base its finding on other evidence of record,such as the disclaimed asylum affidavit.
accordingly,we are limited to the bia finding that supplied food and tents,and we must assume that his testimony before the ij was true.in this regard,it is helpful to review the testimony 
ij sir,i want to read to you something that you wrote in an asylum application that you gave to the immigration service.you say i am on the military and police wanted list because of known and suspected activities against the government and when i left i had failed to meet their reporting requirements.now,my first question to you,sir,is this.were you on a military and police wanted list in india,sir 
a yes,on police.
a because i baptized.after the killing of jarnail singh by indian authorities,they made a list of all those people who got baptized and then they started catching all those people.
q so,it was only because you were baptized as a sikh,sir.is that what you mean 
a yes,because i was baptized.that why.
q well,but in this statement,sir,that i just read to you,you say there were known activities that you took against the indian government.what were those activities 
a sant jarnail singh organized meetings in different villages to propagate religion.
q so,in other words you telling me that you attended these meetings,correct 
a yes.we used to have those people to arrange our tents and put sort preparation of the food and also arrange to bring people to these gatherings and then take them back to their places.
q did you do anything else 
q sir,when you say here there were known activities against the indian government,that is what you referring to,sir 
a we were not against government,but we were propagating the teachings of our sant.
q were you ever involved in any violent activities against the indian until i finish,please,support of an independent sikh state 
a yes.we want khalistan,but we do want by the means of violence.
q well,i want you to answer the question i asked you,sir.you have not answered it.were you ever involved in any violent activity in india 
a review of this testimony makes it clear that disclaimed any connection to violence.it also shows that the meetings at question were to propagate religion.it further shows that the tents and food were supplied to members of sant jarnail.nothing in the testimony reflects that the purpose or subject of the meetings was to facilitate terrorism.
shortly thereafter,the government lawyer questioned 
q sir,according to your application for asylum,you joined the babbar khalsa group in.is that so 
a i got baptized and then my name was written that he belongs to babbar khalsa.
q and,according to your application for asylum you joined the sant jarnail singh bhindra wala militant group in.is that correct 
a i was baptized by sant jarnail singh bhindra wala.
q and,you joined his group,militant group,in.is that correct 
a this is not a militant group.
q according to your application for asylum,it called the sant jarnail singh bhindra wala militant group.
a that may be a mistake by my lawyer,but he was saying that by getting baptized you will have your own army,you will have your own garment,you will have your own police.
q and,sir,the purpose of this group,according to your application,is to fight for and protect the religious and political cause of the sikh community.is that true 
a this group propagates the religion and whatever the teachings of our ten gurus,that group also propagates those teachings.
q and,according to your affidavit,which is attached to your application for asylum,you assisted the freedom fighters in your village in the movement of weapons through your village.is that correct 
a no.used to help by putting that tent and organize the mondo phonetic sp.or the tent.
q and,it also states that you gave shelter to these militants who were involved in the transport transportation of weapons.is that true 
a no,i never kept any weapons.those sikhs who were baptized,they used to come and they knew that i am also baptized and i just help them with them food.
again,disclaimed engaging in militant activities or moving weapons,and he reaffirmed the religious nature of the matter.it is in this context that we must analyze whether the support he provided was material,more than mere support,and support of importance and relevance to terrorism.
as a threshold matter and as acknowledged by the majority,the bia erred in determining that babbar khalsa and sant jarnail were designated by the state department as terrorist organizations pursuant to ina.see op.at see also note,supra.in addition,the testimony above makes it clear that the food and tents were supplied to members of sant jarnail.the sant jarnail organization has not been designated as a foreign terrorist organization or as a specially designated global terrorist organization,either by the department of state or the department of treasury.accordingly,the bia holding that the state department has designated sant jarnail as a terrorist organization is incorrect and is by itself reversible error 
recognizing this error,the majority does not hold that supplied material support to a terrorist organization,but instead,to an individual who the actor knows,or reasonably should know,has committed or plans to commit a terrorist activity.but the record is devoid of any evidence of who these individuals were,what terrorist activities they had done,or what terrorist acts they planned to commit.there is also no evidence of what knew or should have known regarding these unknown activities.the only evidence that the bia and majority appear to latch upon in this regard is the following exchange at the end of the government questioning of 
q so,in other words,you were helping the militants who were involved in the terrorist activities.is that true 
a when we came from far away to this indiscernible congregation,then we may have some contact.we never help in any other way than giving them food.yes.
the bia and majority rely on this passage to conclude that admitted to having offered support to militants who were involved in terrorist activities.therefore,the majority upholds the bia finding that offered material support to any individual who the actor knows,or reasonably should know,has committed or plans to commit a terrorist activity.
the majority reliance on this passage is questionable at best.although admissions may certainly be based on leading questions,it is difficult to know whether or not was agreeing to the words put into his mouth by the government lawyer and transmitted through the translator,or what he meant by the response relayed back through the translator.indeed,moments before,had adamantly denied that the persons he helped were militants.further,in the context of this appeal,the term terrorist activity has a specified legal definition,whereas we have no idea what understood the term to mean.at the very least the passage is ambiguous,and at the worst,reliance on the passage fails the substantial evidence test because it requires us to speculate as to what was saying yes to.
despite these concerns,the case need not turn on this issue,because even if we were to assume that admitted that the unnamed militants had engaged in unspecified terrorist activity,the bia still has not established that the food or the tents were material in any way.nothing in the record shows the type of terrorist activities committed or planned by these unnamed individuals,and nothing shows how the food and tents were relevant and important to these unnamed persons engaging in unknown terrorist activities.under such circumstances,finding mere support to be material support reads material out of the statute.though the bia might have looked to other bases for its decision,it did not do so,and we can not raise new bases in the context of a petition for review 
thus,it is apparent that even though the majority concedes that it can not affirm the bia on the basis of material support to a terrorist organization,it nevertheless uses the affiliation of the unnamed individuals to sant jarnail to bootstrap a finding that they engaged in terrorist activities,however unknown those activities may be.but bootstrapping and conjecture are not even close to substantial evidence that the food and tents were material,relevant and important to terrorism.where the conclusion is not based on a specific,cogent reason,but,instead,is based on speculation,conjecture,or an otherwise unsupported personal opinion,we will not uphold it because it will not have been supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind would find adequate.dia ashcroft,cir en banc see also gao ashcroft,cir findings based on speculation or conjecture,rather than on evidence in the record,are reversible.in otherwords,the finding will not have been supported by substantial evidence.dia,at 
that the bia finding can not be upheld is underscored through the government suggestion at oral argument that the provision of a cup of water to a terrorist could constitute material support.i have no doubt that under the right facts,the provision of a single glass of water to a terrorist could be material support.if bin laden were dying of thirst and asked for a cup of water to permit him to walk another half mile and detonate a weapon of mass destruction,such support would be material to terrorism.but those facts are not before us,and permitting a mere cup of water,without more,to be material support reads material out of the statute.
in reaching this conclusion,i remain cognizant of the fact that the executive branch is to handle the circumstances of the war against terror.but courts may not rewrite clear statutes or decide immigration petitions on speculation.because material support does not mean immaterial support,i would grant the petition for review,vacate the order of the bia,and remand for further proceedings 
at oral argument,the petitioner attorney informed us that the petitioner proper surname is singh,and we will refer to the petitioner by that name.
