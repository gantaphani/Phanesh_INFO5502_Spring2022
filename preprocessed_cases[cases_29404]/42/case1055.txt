this case comes to us on a petition for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia or board dismissing petitioner song jin wu wu or petitioner appeal from an immigration judge ij decision denying wu motion to reopen an in abstentia order of deportation.the bia refused to reopen wu case without mentioning his contention that the law had changed rendering him eligible for asylum.that was an abuse of the board discretion,and we therefore grant wu petition and remand to allow him an opportunity to present his claims.
background 
petitioner is a male from fujian province in the people republic of china.according to wu,he and his wife married in.wu contends that after the birth of the couple second child,the chinese government forced his wife to have an intrauterine device implanted,which his wife later had removed with the assistance of a private doctor.wu wife gave birth to a third child in.petitioner asserts that upon learning of the birth of the couple third child,chinese officials became very angry,required his wife to undergo forced sterilization,and fined the family yuan.petitioner maintains that he spoke out against china family planning policies at a village meeting in early and left china soon after,purportedly because he was afraid chinese officials would punish him for his conduct.
wu entry into the united states and immigration court proceedings 
wu entered the united states illegally through puerto rico on january.on his original record,he indicated his address was avenue,brooklyn,new york.petitioner applied for asylum on february,and his attorney filed a bond reduction request that listed wu address as avenue,brooklyn,new york.an ij granted the request and petitioner was released from custody in march.wu attorney listed the address on a subsequent motion for a change of venue to new york city,which an ij granted on march.
on august,the immigration court in new york city sent notice by certified mail to wu attorney of record,renrong pan,that a master calendar hearing in wu case was scheduled for october.a person in pan office acknowledged receipt of the certified mailing on august.the court also sent notice by certified mail to wu at avenue,brooklyn,new york,but that mailing was returned as unclaimed,apparently because wu actual address was avenue.petitioner asserts his attorney did not notify him of the pending hearing.on october,wu failed to appear at his asylum hearing and the ij,judge videla,ordered wu deported in absentia.
petitioner asserts that at the time he did not know of these developments.rather,he contends,after hearing nothing from his attorneys regarding his asylum application,he obtained new counsel and submitted a second asylum application to the ins on april.an ins hearing officer referred wu case to the immigration court on october,and a hearing on the merits was scheduled for august,before immigration judge lamb.on that date,judge lamb learned that wu was subject to the outstanding order of deportation issued by judge videla and terminated this second proceeding.
wu filed a motion to reopen on june,stating he was not aware he had been ordered deported by judge videla.he indicated his asylum claim was based upon persecution by family planning officials in china and urged that the deportation order be rescinded.this motion,though addressed to judge lamb,was redirected by court administrators to judge videla docket.
on september,judge videla denied wu motion on the basis of immigration and nationality act ina c,c repealed,effective,and recodified,as amended,without material change,at b c.this section of the ina states that in absentia orders of deportation may only be rescinded if the alien files a motion to reopen within days of the order of deportation and exceptional circumstances explain his failure to appear,or if the alien did not receive proper notice of the deportation hearing.judge videla concluded that wu received proper notice because notice was sent to wu attorney of record by certified mail.he also found that wu did not file the motion within days of the in absentia order of deportation,and was therefore barred from asserting exceptional circumstances justifying his failure to appear.wu appealed judge videla order to the bia.
board of immigration appeals decisions 
on appeal to the bia,petitioner argued that the board should overturn judge videla denial of his motion to reopen because petitioner did not receive notice of the final deportation order.wu also maintained that he and his family suffered past persecution in china due to that country restrictive family planning policies and,more specifically,that a n alien whose spouse was forced to undergo an abortion or sterilization procedure can establish past persecution on account of political opinion and qualifies as a refugee within the definition of section a of the immigration and nationality act,a,as amended by section a of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira.the bia initially dismissed wu appeal as untimely,but subsequently reinstated the appeal by granting a motion,based on petitioner attorney inability to timely obtain the records of wu prior immigration proceedings,to reopen and reconsider.in connection with that motion wu argued that his case was founded upon the change in law relating to past persecution of the spouse of a respondent who violated birth control policies in the people republic of china.
on august,the bia dismissed wu appeal.it agreed with judge videla that petitioner was properly served with notice of the october,hearing and that wu motion to reopen was untimely.the board did not mention,let alone address,wu argument.
on september,petitioner counsel filed with the bia a motion to reconsider.petitioner argued his case should be reopened because of the above described change in law,the fact that he would be tortured if returned to china,and the purported ineffectiveness of his prior attorney.the bia denied wu motion on march,finding wu failed to present additional arguments,a change in law,or an aspect of the case that was overlooked.the bia also noted that,under the circumstances,wu motion to reconsider could be deemed a successive motion to reopen that was under a regulation that prohibits filing more than one motion to reopen with the board of immigration appeals,c now codified at c,the board also refused to consider wu convention against torture cat claim because the motion was not filed by the administrative deadline of june,see b,and because petitioner failed to make a prima facie showing of entitlement for relief under the cat,see c.
according to petitioner notice of appeal,he seeks review only of the board august,decision,not its later march,decision.although petitioner had made his argument in the earlier appeal to the bia,the board did not at that time address this argument.the board did not,however,deem the argument waived for it considered the argument in its march,decision.
discussion 
i petitioner asylum claima.standard of review 
we review the decision of the bia to deny a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.see guan bd.of immigration appeals,cir.an abuse will be found only in those limited circumstances where the bia decision provides no rational explanation,inexplicably departs from established policies,is devoid of any reasoning,or contains only summary or conclusory statements.zhao dep t of justice,cir.
government objection to our review 
the government,citing c repealed,effective,asserts petitioner did not properly raise his argument before the ij and bia,and therefore did not exhaust his administrative remedies and preserve the issue for our review.to the contrary,we note that wu raised his argument before both the bia and ij.in his brief in support of his appeal to the bia of the denial of his motion to reopen,wu expressly stated that after the ij decision ordering him deported in absentia,the law had been amended to allow an alien whose spouse was forcibly sterilized or compelled to have an abortion to establish persecution on that basis and therefore qualify for asylum.petitioner repeated this argument in his motion to reopen and reconsider th
