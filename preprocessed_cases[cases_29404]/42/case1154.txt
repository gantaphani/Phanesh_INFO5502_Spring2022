petitioner alawi kuhali appeals from a judgment entered on july,in the united states district court for the western district of new york arcara,denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to against defendant janet reno now john ashcroft,attorney general of the united states and respondents john ingham now frances holmes,district director,immigration and naturalization service ins and doris meissner now james ziglar,commissioner,ins collectively,the government.in resolving the issues raised on this appeal we are thrust into an infinitely complex area of immigration law,requiring us to approach the subject carefully,one step at a time.
kuhali,a permanent resident alien,is currently being detained by the government pending removal from the united states on the basis of a federal criminal conviction for conspiracy to export firearms and ammunition without a license.in his petition,kuhali challenges the decision of the board of immigration appeals board that his crime constitutes both a firearms offense and an aggravated felony,thereby warranting his removal under recent amendments to federal immigration statutes.he further contends that retroactive application of the newly revised statutes violates due process.the government responds that removal is appropriate and that kuhali petition should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.for reasons set forth below,we conclude that jurisdiction over kuhali habeas petition is proper,and the district court denial of the petition on the merits should be affirmed.
background 
petitioner kuhali was born in radda,yemen on march,and was admitted to the united states as a legal permanent resident on december.on august,he was convicted following a plea of guilty in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan to conspiracy to export firearms and ammunition without a license,in violation of and supp.v.his sentence included a prison term of one year,of which all but days was suspended,followed by two years of probation.
nearly years later,on january,the ins served kuhali with notice of charges that he was subject to removal on the two grounds that his crime of conviction constituted an aggravated felony and a firearms offense pursuant to a a iii and a c of the immigration and naturalization act ina,a a iii a c supp.v,as amended by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,div.c,a,stat,at to.the ins took kuhali into custody pending a determination of his removal status.
following an administrative hearing,an immigration judge on march,concluded that kuhali crime of conviction qualified as a firearms offense,but not as an aggravated felony.the immigration judge accordingly granted petitioner request for a voluntary departure and entered an alternative removal order,since only conviction for an aggravated felony would have precluded discretionary relief.see ina a b c,a b c supp.v voluntary departure provisions united states pacheco,cir,cert.denied,d.petitioner appealed the immigration judge firearms offense ruling to the board,and the ins the aggravated felony determination.during the course of the administrative appeal,kuhali was released on bond.on july,the board found him removable on both grounds,vacated the grant of a voluntary departure,and ordered that petitioner be deported.
on september,kuhali filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in the united states district court for the western district of new york.the petition challenged the board ruling that his conviction qualified as a firearms offense and as an aggravated felony,and also raised the he had presented to the the retroactive application of iirira to his conviction violated his right to due process.respondents opposed the petition on the merits,and also filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.on july,judge arcara entered an order accompanied by a written opinion denying respondents motion and denying kuhali petition on the merits.kuhali filed this appeal,and we granted his motion for a stay of removal pending its disposition.
discussion 
i standard of review 
on appeal from the denial of a habeas petition brought pursuant to,we review the merits of the petition and any other legal questions pertaining to subject matter jurisdiction de novo.cyr ins,cir jurisdiction,aff,d maldonado scully,cir merits.
ii subject matter jurisdiction 
because removal proceedings against petitioner began after april,the permanent provisions of iirira govern this case.see iirira a,stat.at henderson ins,cir.as amended by those permanent provisions,ina a and b generally require that challenges to final removal orders be asserted on petition for review to the courts of appeals.see a b supp.v as amended by iirira a,stat.at to.at the same time,ina a c creates an exception to this general rule by eliminating our jurisdiction to hear petitions for review when brought by certain criminal aliens notwithstanding any other provision of law,no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section a or a a iii,b,c,or d of this title a c.
this jurisdictional bar,as the supreme court has recently stated,does not explicitly mention a repeal of habeas jurisdiction and therefore does not deprive a federal court of its habeas jurisdiction under with respect to criminal aliens challenging final orders of removal.cyr.at see also id.remaining habeas jurisdiction extends at least to important question s of law ins,cir remaining habeas jurisdiction extends to all purely legal claims,aff,d.thus,it would appear at first blush that habeas jurisdiction under is proper with respect to kuhali following the board decision.
the government notes,however,that the jurisdictional bar of ina a c is predicated on the facts of alienage and removability under an enumerated offense,and that we can determine whether these threshold jurisdictional facts have been properly established on a petition for direct review.sui ins,cir bell reno,cir,cert.denied,d.hence,the government the extent kuhali contests whether his offense renders him was required to challenge that jurisdictional fact on petition for direct review in this court,since no habeas jurisdiction exists to do so.the government emphasizes the general rule in ina a favoring petitions for direct review,and highlights that no unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpus occurs when congress divests the district courts of habeas jurisdiction and substitutes a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person detention.swain pressley,d.
the government argument is not without some force.see santos reno,cir reno,cir per curiam see also akinwale reno,cir noting but declining to address similar argument in transitional rules case.we do not doubt congress power to mandate adequate and effective substitutes for habeas review.see cyr.at,at.but,the reason the government argument fails is that congress has provided no such substitute remedy in this context.the legislature has provided only one remedy in ina for aliens subject to a final removal,a petition for direct review in the courts of has at the same time enacted a jurisdictional bar against criminal aliens attempting to pursue that remedy.see,at without habeas jurisdiction to review final orders,there is currently no judicial review at all of a removal order issued against a who is ordered removable because he or she committed a certain crime.absent the provision of a substitute remedy,the government argument that our habeas jurisdiction has been supplanted necessarily fails.
hence,although we do retain jurisdiction to determine whether the jurisdictional bar of ina a c applies,the fact that a court may entertain such jurisdictional issues does not mean that congress has provided a substitute forum for the resolution of those issues on the merits.our authority to address such jurisdictional facts stems not from congress creation of a particular remedy,but rather from the inherent jurisdiction of article iii federal courts to determine their jurisdiction.see steel citizens for a better env t,d every federal appellate court has a special obligation to satisfy itself of its own jurisdiction.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed.jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction refers to the power of a court to determine whether it has jurisdiction over the parties to and the subject matter of a suit.thus,to say that a court possesses the authority to ascertain its jurisdiction over a matter is not tantamount to saying that the legislature has designated the court as a forum for resolution on the merits of those issues that happen to underlie the jurisdictional inquiry.steel,at.cautioning against importing issues from the merits of an action into the jurisdictional inquiry.
at the same time,we need not address whether the doctrine of procedural default might warrant requiring that an alien raise any challenges to jurisdictional facts on petition for direct review in the court of appeals,rather than on habeas petition.it is that the doctrine of procedural default is prudential rather than jurisdictional in nature,spence superintendent,great meadow corr.facility,cir the doctrine of procedural default is based on considerations of comity and finality,and not on a jurisdictional limitation on the power of a federal court to look beyond a state procedural default and consider the merits of a defaulted claim see james moore et,moore federal practice,at ed see also id,at exhaustion of remedies.yet the government has consistently framed its motion to dismiss exclusively in jurisdictional terms,without mentioning the doctrine of procedural default.we have no doubt that the government knows how to raise such a point in litigation when it wishes to do so,reno,d,alwaday beebe,d.
having failed to raise the issue of procedural default before the district court or us,the government has forfeited or waived the argument.see rosario united states,cir.although we have discretion to raise the issue ourselves,we have emphasized that appellate courts should not lightly raise the issue of procedural default sua sponte.id.at.unlike rosario,where the procedural default was manifest from the record,id.at,here it is not clear to what extent kuhali failure to seek direct review resulted from a strategic choice by his counsel or,alternatively,from the government apparent delay in mailing him a copy of the board decision.more fundamentally,whether the doctrine of procedural default should apply here depends on a careful weighing of prudential considerations,see carmona bureau of prisons,cir,a difficult legal subject which neither of the parties has adequately briefed.finally,because we conclude in the discussion that follows that kuhali conviction falls under ina a c,his habeas petition would still be proper with respect to his constitutional claims even if his other claims were defaulted,and we see no institutional advantage to be gained from raising the question of default sua sponte.
accordingly,we conclude that the district court properly had jurisdiction of kuhali petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the first instance,and jurisdiction also properly lies in this court on appeal.in so ruling,we express no view on whether the doctrine of procedural default should require that a criminal alien raise any challenge to jurisdictional facts on petition for direct review in the court of appeals rather than on a habeas petition in district court.
iii removal as an alien convicted of a firearms offense 
on the merits of his appeal,kuhali challenges the board determination that his conviction for conspiracy to export firearms and ammunition,as defined by and,qualifies as a firearms offense rendering him removable under ina a c,a c.he avers,first,that the board and the district court erred in reasoning that the crime of illegally exporting firearms necessarily entails the possession of firearms as an element and second,that the ins failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that his offense conduct actually involved firearms,and not simply ammunition.we consider these arguments in turn.
possession of firearms 
general principles 
on review of a removal decision,we owe no deference to the board in its interpretation of criminal statutes that it does not administer,sutherland reno,cir,but grant chevron deference to the board construction of the ina,which it does administer,ins,d citing chevron natural resources def.council,d bell,at.under the chevron standard,we adhere to congress purpose where the ina clearly speaks to the point in question,but if the ina is silent or ambiguous,then we must defer to any reasonable interpretation of the statute adopted by the board as the entity charged by congress with the statute enforcement,at.
accordingly,where the board has construed the terms of a ground for removal identified in the ina,we defer under chevron to that construction.but where the board has further determined that an offense,as defined by a particular criminal statute,falls within those terms,we review that determination de novo.dalton ashcroft,cir sui,at sutherland,at michel ins,cir.
the removal statute ina a c 
ina a c provides for deportation based on conviction for certain firearms offenses 
any alien who at any time after admission is convicted under any law of purchasing,selling,offering for sale,exchanging,using,owning,possessing,or carrying,or of attempting or conspiring to purchase,sell,offer for sale,exchange,use,own,possess,or carry,any weapon,part,or accessory which is a firearm or destructive device as defined in section a of title in violation of any law is deportable.
the board had construed predecessor statutes as providing for the deportability of any alien who,at any time after entry,has been convicted under any law of a crime of which the possession or carrying of a firearm or destructive device is an essential element.in re kuhali,no,slip op.at bia july,unpublished decision citing,inter alia,in re,bia june,aff,ins,cir.the board applied this same reasoning to the version of the statute.although ina a c explicitly encompasses a conviction for possessing or carrying firearms or for conspiracy to do so,the provision is silent as to other convictions that involve possessing or carrying firearms only as an element of the substantive crime.because the ina is silent,under chevron,we must ask whether the board construction is a reasonable one,and readily conclude that it is.
in particular,the board reading of ina a c to encompass possessing and carrying firearms not simply as crimes in their own right,but also as elements of other crimes,is reasonable in light of the statute expansive text and history.see sui,at board need not adhere to formal label given to offense.conviction for illegally possessing or carrying certain weapons has been a statutory ground for deportation for several decades,even before congress expanded the statute to include firearms in the covered class of weapons,zinnanti ins,cir.unit a july per curiam ins,cir per curiam see also abuse act of,tit.vii,subtitle j,stat,cato ins,cir.
subsequent amendments have expanded the statute to encompass the sale,use,and ownership of firearms,as well as attempts and conspiracies to commit any of the listed acts.see immigration and nationality technical corrections act of,tit.ii,b,stat,immigration act of,tit.vi,a,stat,hall,cir.as the fourth circuit has commented,the present statute is exceedingly broad and evinces an expansive render deportable those aliens that commit firearms offenses of any type.hall,at.we agree and think it would be incongruous to read the statute to encompass the possession or carrying of firearms when committed as crimes in their own right,but not when committed as necessary elements of other crimes.
moreover,in determining whether possessing or carrying firearms is an element of these other crimes,the plain language of ina a c supports the adoption of a categorical approach that looks to the elements of the offense as defined by statute,rather than to the particular facts of the alien criminal activity.ina a c refers to a ny alien who is convicted any alien who has firearms offenses,thereby suggesting that a court look at the conviction itself as opposed to the underlying conduct.see taylor united states,d sentence enhancement provision united states palmer,cir same.such an approach also enjoys the virtues of practicality and evenhanded application,since examining the transcript of the plea colloquy or the trial to determine the actual facts of the crime could prove burdensome and produce arbitrary results.see taylor,at.palmer,at see also dalton,at applying categorical approach to crime of violence under b.see generally sui,at nn.discussing taylor and collecting decisions.
as a consequence,we conclude that the board interpretation of ina a c to encompass convictions of crimes for which possessing or carrying firearms is an element,is a reasonable one.see also ins,cir approving the board reading,cert.denied,d hall,at vue ins,cir,at.
the criminal statute 
turning to the nature of kuhali offense,the crime of conspiracy to export firearms and ammunition without a license is defined by two statutes,which generally prohibits the unlicensed export of certain defense articles,and,which prohibits conspiracy to commit a federal offense.because ina a c explicitly encompasses conspiracies to commit listed offenses,and because possession by one member of a conspiracy is imputed to all other members,see,united states smith,cir,our inquiry is limited to determining whether possession of firearms is an element of the substantive crime defined by.
congress enacted into law as part of the arms export control act,tit.ii,a,stat.as we have explained,the arms export control act 
establishes the basic requirements for the sale and export of military equipment and ammunition to foreign purchasers.before a private exporter may sell any article contained on the munitions list he must apply for an export license from the state department office of munitions control.the exporter must include in the application a description of the arms,their ultimate destination,and their intended use.the munitions control office then decides whether to grant the license based upon the information contained in the application.if an export license is granted,the exporter must present it to the customs service at the time of export.
united states schwartz,cir.
within this framework,provides n o defense articles or defense services designated by the president under subsection a of this section may be exported or imported without a license for such export or import,issued in accordance with this chapter and regulations issued under this chapter b id.c criminalizing willful violations of any provision of this section see also munitions list id.b firearm definition id.export license provisions.conviction under b thus entails proof of four elements the willful export or attempted export of articles listed on the united states munitions list without a license.united states covarrubias,cir united states murphy,cir united states beck,cir.
citing the fourth element,kuhali contends that violation of is essentially a licensing offense,not a firearms offense,since the act of exporting firearms is prohibited only if the defendant did so without first obtaining a license.but under the board reading of ina a c,discussed above,the only relevant issue is whether possessing or carrying firearms is an element of the offense as defined by statute.to determine that issue,we need look no further than the second element,the act of export or attempted export.
the regulations implementing define the term export broadly to include s ending or taking a defense article out of the united states in any manner.a.this definition fits comfortably within other legal definitions of export,black law dictionary ed t o send or carry abroad,as well as with the common usage of the term,webster new collegiate dictionary to carry or send as a commodity to some other place as another country.the key question is whether this definition necessarily entails some degree of possession.we think it does.
in the legal sense of the word,possession comes in two varieties actual and constructive,united states samaria,cir.actual possession corresponds to the everyday sense of tangible,physical dominion or control over an object.see united states payton,cir.constructive possession exists when a person has the power and intention to exercise dominion and control over an object without actually possessing it.id.see generally black law dictionary defining actual and constructive possession and discussing distinction.when applying federal criminal statutes for which the possession of a weapon is an element,we have recognized both notions of possession as valid bases for convicting.see,united states toner,cir.
taking possession in the latter sense of the power to exercise dominion and control,we agree with the board and the district court that some element of possession is present whenever a defendant exports a defense article.in other words,the power to send or take a commodity out of the country necessarily of the exercise of dominion or least constructive possession of the commodity.
this reading of finds strong support in the construction the supreme court has given to similar criminal statutes.in united states bass,d,for example,the supreme court affirmed the vacatur of a conviction under then a,which imposed criminal penalties on any person in certain classes including illegal aliens who receives,possesses,or transports in commerce or affecting commerce any firearm.id.at.the pivotal point raised before the supreme court was whether a conviction for mere possession,as opposed to transportation,of firearms required proof that the firearms had been in commerce or affecting commerce.id.at.
the court answered that question in the affirmative on the rationale,in part,that the statute would make no sense if the phrase in commerce or affecting commerce were construed to apply only to the offense of transporting firearms.id.at.it reasoned that s ince virtually all transportations,whether interstate or intrastate,involve an accompanying possession or receipt,it is odd indeed to argue that on the one hand the statute reaches all possessions and receipts,and on the other hand outlaws only interstate transportations.id.although the government had asserted that transports includes the act of causing a firearm to be transported,and therefore would connote an offense separate in some cases from receives or possesses,the court rejected this assertion and stated that such a distinction found no support in any arguable purpose of the statute.id.at.
just as the bass court reasoned that the term transport implied some element of possession or receipt,we too think the term export as used in implies some element of possession.even if export could be limited to the sense of causing a commodity to be exported,by analogy to the government argument in bass,we think that the very act of causing the commodity to be exported requires sufficient power over the commodity to give rise to constructive possession.moreover,although the bass decision dates back nearly years,we have no reason to believe that the supreme court would decide the issue differently were it presented today.see muscarello united states,d carry implies personal agency and some degree of possession,whereas transport does not have such a limited connotation and,in addition,implies the movement of goods in bulk over great distances.bailey united states,d use of a firearm entails more than possession and rises to the level of active employment.see also united states richards,cir t he ordinary meaning of the term transport involv es an element of possession and an element of movement.
thus,construing de novo,we agree with the board and the district court that a conviction for the unlicensed export of listed defense articles necessarily entails an element of possession.we hold therefore that conspiracy to export firearms in violation of and constitutes a removable firearms offense under ina a c.
firearms versus ammunition 
as noted earlier,kuhali also declares that the government failed to meet its burden of proving at the removal hearing that his offense actually involved firearms,and not simply ammunition.in particular,he notes that the ins proffered only copies of the indictment and the judgment of conviction,and he urges that the ins should have been required to submit a transcript of the plea colloquy as well,so that the board and the district court could review the factual basis for his plea.
the ins unquestionably bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent is deportable as charged.a.a defendant may also clearly be convicted under for exporting either firearms or ammunition,since the munitions list includes both under separate categories.see categories i,iii.hence,the only issue is whether the immigration judge and the board were justified in relying on kuhali judgment of conviction,which is signed by a federal district judge and states that kuhali was convicted of the offense s of conspiracy to export firearms ammunition without a license in violation of section,title united states code.
absent any reasonable challenge to its validity,we think the clear language of the judgment of conviction should control the determination of what offense an alien actually committed.a judgment of conviction is competent evidence.in the immigration context,a number of circuits including our own have held that when a criminal statute is divisible into multiple categories of offense but not all of which constitute removable court may refer to the record of conviction,particularly the judgment of conviction,to determine whether the alien criminal conviction falls within a category that would justify removal.sui,at cir.ye ins,cir vue,at cir.accord in re,wl,bia lexis,at bia,see also united states danielson,cir per curiam where statute encompasses both violent and conduct,sentencing court may rely on record of conviction to decide whether prior conviction was crime of violence for purposes of determining base offense level united states hill,collecting circuit decisions same.
here,because encompasses the export not only of firearms but also of ammunition,and because only the former crime constitutes a removable offense,it was entirely proper for the immigration judge and the board to rely on the judgment of conviction to ascertain whether kuhali had in fact conspired to export firearms.the judgment of conviction in this case states plainly and unambiguously that kuhali conspired to export firearms ammunition.it is not in the least does not state,for instance,that kuhali conspired to export firearms ammunition or.thus,the ins was not required to present additional evidence.the judgment of conviction,in and of itself,provided clear and convincing evidence that kuhali conspired to export firearms.
although kuhali now argues that a plea under for conspiracy to export only ammunition,and not firearms,in theory would have been sufficient to support his conviction,he does not has he ever he conspired only to export ammunition.he also fails to provide any evidence to rebut the ins prima facie case,such as a transcript of his plea colloquy.kuhali argument is based therefore solely on conjecture.a hypothetical argument,of course,will not create an ambiguity that does not otherwise exist.consequently,kuhali is removable as an alien convicted of a firearms offense under ina a c.
iv removal as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony 
as noted,petitioner also challenges the conclusion of the board and the district court that he is removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony under ina a a iii.because his eligibility for a voluntary departure hinges on this point,see b c,the question is not mooted by the above determination that he is removable as an alien convicted of a firearms offense.kuhali asserts that the board erred in reasoning that conspiracy to export firearms constitutes a firearms trafficking offense under ina a c supp.v,thereby qualifying his crime as an aggravated felony under ina a a iii.
a.the removal statute ina a a iii ina a 
ina a a iii declares that a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.a a iii.in turn,ina a defines aggravated felony to include illicit trafficking in firearms or destructive devices as defined in section of title or in explosive materials as defined in section c of that title,a c,as well as an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense described in this paragraph,id.a u.
in its decision,the board construed the term trafficking as used here in light of its decision in in re davis,wl bia may,which in the context of narcotics borrowed the definition of trafficking set forth in black law dictionary ed.trading or dealing in certain goods in re kuhali,no,slip op.at.hence,the board in defining trafficking said the essential sense of the term was its business or merchant nature,trading,selling or dealing in goods.id.to characterize an activity as trafficking or a participant as a trafficker,according to the board,requires only a minimal degree of involvement.id.
because the ina does not define the term trafficking in a c,and the board construed the term to hinge on the business or merchant nature of the alien firearms conviction,as exemplified by his acts of trading or dealing,we must ask under chevron whether the board construction is a reasonable one.we think it is.as with the ina firearms offense provision,discussed above,the statutory focus in a a iii on a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony suggests that the crime of conviction should be analyzed categorically,and the board specific reading of the term trafficking comports well with the legal and everyday usages of that term.see also webster new collegiate dictionary defining traffic as a noun to include the business of bartering or buying and selling and import and export trade,and as a verb to include trade,barter.
b.the criminal statute 
kuhali raises two arguments as to why the unlicensed export of firearms under should not be considered illegal trafficking in firearms under ina a c.first,he repeats the assertion that defines what is essentially a licensing offense,and not a trafficking offense,since the act of exporting firearms is prohibited only in the absence of a valid license.again,that consideration is immaterial under the board reading of ina a c.all that must be decided is whether the offense has a business or merchant nature,and to answer that question we again focus simply on the element of export.
second,petitioner contends that the act of export does not exhibit a business or merchant nature,since the term export as defined in the applicable regulations as well as in ordinary usage requires only transportation across international borders,with or without an accompanying commercial transaction.see a s ending or taking a defense article out of the united states in any manner black law dictionary t o send or carry abroad webster new collegiate dictionary to carry or send as a commodity to some other place as another country.in petitioner view,an alien could be convicted under simply for carrying firearms out of the country for personal use,regardless of whether the person later sells or trades the firearms.
but,as the board and the district court reasoned,this argument founders when seen in the context of the arms export control act in general,as well as in particular.as originally enacted and presently codified,the arms export control act sets forth a broad national policy with respect to the international trade in defense articles 
it shall be the policy of the united states to exert leadership in the world community to bring about arrangements for reducing the international trade in implements of war and to lessen the danger of outbreak of regional conflict and the burdens of armaments.united states programs for or procedures governing the export,sale,and grant of defense articles and defense services to foreign countries and international organizations shall be administered in a manner which will carry out this policy.
tit.ii,a,stat.at codified as amended at supp.v.the arms export control act thus originally contained,and continues to contain,numerous provisions governing the distribution and sale of d
