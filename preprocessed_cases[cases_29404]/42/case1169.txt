maximo appeals his sentence of twelve months plus one day imprisonment for illegally reentering the united states,in violation of a and b.although pled guilty to the offense,he now appeals the sentence,arguing that the sentencing court violated his due process clause rights by impermissibly considering,among other things,arrests that did not result in convictions.the presentence investigation report psr that disclosed those arrests did not contain any of the underlying conduct.for the reasons set forth below,we agree and we will therefore vacate the sentence that was imposed and remand for resentencing.
factual procedural background 
a citizen of the dominican republic,was initially deported from the united states in december after being convicted of unlawfully obtaining a passport and serving a sentence for that offense.shortly after he was deported,his common law wife,milagros rasuk,a citizen with whom had been residing for fifteen years prior to his deportation,was diagnosed with terminal colon cancer.rasuk had two adult children from a prior marriage,both of whom had become drug addicts,and one of whom,miguel,resided with and rasuk.rasuk oldest son,risdael,who suffers from mental health issues,had his own child,angel.no doubt because of risdael drug addiction,he abandoned angel for all practical purposes,and angel was raised by and rasuk.
when received word that rasuk had been diagnosed with terminal cancer,he returned to the united states to care for her during her final months of life.she died in february angel was no older than eleven when his grandmother,rasuk,died.continued to care for angel and became his sole caretaker following rasuk death 
according to,miguel continued presence in the household became increasingly disruptive and problematic following rasuk death because of miguel involvement with drugs and alcohol.claims that when he attempted to intercede and confront miguel about his behavior,miguel reported to the immigration authorities,informed them of his illegal reentry,and kicked out of the home.
miguel strategy apparently worked because was subsequently arrested and charged with illegal reentry.he thereafter pled guilty to one count of reentry after removal in violation of a and b.
psr calculated his offense level at ten,and his criminal history category was ii.this resulted in a recommended sentence of eight to fourteen months imprisonment.the psr noted that had two previous convictions,one for driving under the influence in,and one for fraudulently applying for a united states passport in.was arrested under a different alias each time.the psr also noted that had numerous arrests that did not lead to conviction aside from the arrests leading to his two convictions,had been arrested six other times.however,each of the charges involved in his arrests had been withdrawn or dismissed,except for one which lacked a recorded disposition.as we noted earlier,the psr did not describe any of the underlying conduct purportedly leading to those arrests.
argued for a downward departure from the suggested eight to guideline range.the government also moved for a downward departure pursuant to and e.the district court did depart downward one level.the court adjusted guidelines range downward to six to twelve months imprisonment based on an offense level of nine and a criminal history category of ii.at the sentencing hearing,both the prosecutor and the defense argued for a sentence of time served,which would have been equivalent to roughly six months,or the lower end of the guidelines range.in spite of this,the district court sentenced to twelve months plus one day,followed by two years of supervised release 
in calculating sentence,the district court relied on the relevant factors in a and information contained in the psr.significantly,the district court also relied in part on record of arrests that did not lead to conviction.the court explained 
i also can not overlook the defendant rather extensive and i think we all have our own barometer of what is extensive versus what is not extensive interaction with the criminal justice system.but there were as i counted,i believe seven arrests,two convictions in three states since.so,the defendant who was in this country initially illegally since at least the has engaged in conduct which to the court view belied and made ring hollow a little bit his desire to merely come to america to seek a better life 
ii.standard of review 
as a threshold matter,the parties disagree on the applicable standard of review.the government argues that,because objection to the district court statement regarding the defendant prior arrest record was not preserved at sentencing,it is reviewed for plain error under that standard,would bear the burden of establishing the district court committed plain error this,the government urges,has failed to do because,even if he could show plain error,he can not show that it affected the outcome of the proceedings.
counters that he did indeed preserve the issue,and review should therefore be plenary mateo medina points out that counsel objected to the inclusion of the arrest record in the psr and at the sentencing hearing.he claims that the district court understood the objection as an attempt to exclude the arrests as a sentencing consideration,and overruled it based on the court erroneous view that arrests are appropriate for the court to consider under the statutory sentencing factors.thus,in response to a defense objection,the district court expressly ruled on the exact issue raises on appeal.argues that this amounts to preservation,not forfeiture.we need not address whether preserved his objection at sentencing because our precedent clearly demonstrates that a district court consideration,even in part,of a bare arrest record is plain error 
iii.discussion 
our review of a criminal sentence proceeds in two stages.first,we review for procedural error,such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence including an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.under the plain error standard,a defendant must show error,that is plain or obvious,and that affects a defendant substantial rights if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.if we find procedural error our preferred course is to remand the case for resentencing,without going any further.in the absence of procedural error,we will then determine whether the sentence imposed was substantively reasonable.when reviewing for substantive reasonableness,we will affirm the sentence unless no reasonable sentencing court would have imposed the same sentence on that particular defendant for the reasons the district court provided.
relies on our opinion in united states berry to argue that the district court plainly erred in considering his bare record of arrests not leading to conviction when imposing his sentence.there,the sentencing judge considered the relevant factors under a but also speculated about the reasons why the defendants robbery charges had been nol prossed.in the process,the prosecutor misread the psr regarding berry bald arrest record 
the sentencing judge also inflated the defendant propensity for crime by speculating that it was rather obvious that the reason he does have any actual adult convictions is because of the breakdowns in the court in the state court system and not because of innocence.the court also considered appropriate factors under section a such as the seriousness of the crimes of conviction.however,in imposing the sentence on berry and his codefendant,the court explained 
taking all those factors in to account,given the fact that their criminal points i do think reflect quite adequately,the seriousness of their criminal exposure in the past.the fact that they were charged with crimes and then,the prosecution
