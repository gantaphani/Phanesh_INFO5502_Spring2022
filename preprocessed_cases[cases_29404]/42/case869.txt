the captioned petitions,which another panel of this court ordered to be heard in tandem,present a common question for our review whether the board of immigration appeals bia errs or abuses its discretion when it denies a motion to reopen removal proceedings,filed by an asylum applicant seeking an adjustment of status before the citizenship and immigration services uscis,on the ground that the bia lacks jurisdiction over the adjustment application.we have jurisdiction over these petitions pursuant to.because the bia did not set forth a rational explanation for its decision to deny petitioners motions,we hold that their denial constitutes an error of law and remand these cases to the bia for reconsideration of the motions to reopen.
