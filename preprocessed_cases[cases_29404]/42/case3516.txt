petitioner appellant francisco garfias rodriguez garfias appeals a final removal order issued by the board of immigration appeals bia that determined that he was ineligible for adjustment of status under i.he challenges the order on two grounds.first,he contends that our interpretation of a c i i and i in acosta gonzales,cir,takes precedence over the bia subsequent and contrary reading in matter of briones,bia.second,he argues that even if briones is controlling,the bia impermissibly applied it to him retroactively.additionally,garfias argues that the attorney general exceeded his authority by promulgating i,which terminates a grant of voluntary departure upon the filing of a petition for review of a final removal order.we reject all three of garfias arguments and deny his petition for review.
garfias is a native and citizen of mexico.he unlawfully entered the united states in and departed the country,once in and once in to visit his ailing mother and to attend her funeral,respectively,each time reentering without inspection.on april,garfias married his current wife,nancy,a united states citizen.he subsequently applied to adjust his status to that of a lawful permanent resident and paid an additional fee with this application because he had entered without inspection.on march,the united states immigration and customs enforcement ice instituted removal proceedings against garfias on the grounds that he entered the united states without inspection.
at a hearing before an immigration judge ij,ice reiterated its allegations that garfias departed the united states in and reentered in without being paroled or admitted.garfias admitted these facts and conceded that he was removable,but argued that he could still adjust his status under i.he requested relief in the form of adjustment and,in the alternative,voluntary departure.
the ij denied garfias application for status adjustment but granted him voluntary departure.the ij held that garfias was inadmissible under a c i i and was ineligible for any waiver of inadmissibility.accordingly,he was ineligible for status adjustment under i,which requires an applicant to be admissible to the united states.
garfias appealed to the bia.in a per curiam decision,the bia sustained his appeal and remanded the case to the ij for reconsideration in light of our previous decisions in perez gonzalez ashcroft,cir,and acosta.
on remand,the ij acknowledged perez gonzalez and acosta,but denied garfias application on other grounds.the judge denied the request for status adjustment but once again granted voluntary departure.
garfias again appealed to the bia.instead of relying on the ij stated reasoning,however,the bia cited its intervening opinion in briones,in which it found that persons inadmissible under.a c i i could not seek adjustment of status under i.it dismissed garfias appeal,granted him sixty days to voluntarily depart,ordered removal in the event that he failed to depart,and informed him that filing a petition for review would immediately terminate the grant of voluntary departure.
garfias subsequently filed a petition for review with this court as well as a motion to stay his removal.
we must first determine whether aliens who are inadmissible under a c i i may nonetheless apply for adjustment of status under i.deferring to the bia decision in briones,we hold that they may not 
the opening clause of a specifies that e xcept as otherwise provided in this chapter,aliens who are inadmissible under the following paragraphs are ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the united states.a emphasis added.this provision is a savings clause that authorizes admission of otherwise inadmissible aliens where the statute so provides.renteria ledesma holder,cir citing mora mukasey,cir.subsection a c i i provides that a ny alien who has been unlawfully present in the united states for an aggregate period of more than year and who enters or attempts to reenter the united states without being admitted is inadmissible.section a c ii provides an exception for those aliens who are seeking admission more than years after the date of the alien last departure from the united states if the secretary of homeland security has consented to the alien reapplying for admission.
section i sets out the conditions under which an alien who is physically present in the united states and who entered the united states without inspection may apply to the attorney general for the adjustment of his or her status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.i a,c.section i a specifies that the attorney general may adjust an alien status if the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the united states for permanent residence.i a emphasis added.
neither a c nor i makes reference to the other.
we first briefly summarize the relevant legal framework preceding this case.in perez gonzalez ashcroft,cir,we held,contrary to an ins guidance memorandum,that the inadmissibility provision of a c i ii did not preclude status adjustment under i we observed,first,that the ins interpretation of the two provisions was contained in the informal format of a guidance memorandum,and was therefore not entitled to the rigorous deference owed formal agency interpretations under chevron.id.at.applying this less deferential form of review,we found that it was impossible to reconcile the interpretation of the statute in,which indicates that illegal reentrants can seek adjustment of status,with the interpretation in the agency informal guidance memorandum,which states that they are categorically barred from receiving adjustment of status.id.at accordingly,we concluded that i n the absence of a more complete agency elaboration of how its interpretation of a can be reconciled with its own regulations,we must defer to the regulations rather than to the informal guidance memorandum.id.at.we held that aliens who are inadmissible under a c i ii could nonetheless seek adjustment of status.id.at.
next,in acosta gonzales,cir,we extended the reasoning of perez gonzalez and held that aliens who were inadmissible under a c i i the provision at issue in this case remained eligible for adjustment under i.we emphasized that perez gonzalez appears to control the issue before us and that any attempt to distinguish the present case from perez gonzalez based on the different grounds of inadmissibility involved would be unpersuasive.id.at.
the bia subsequently issued two opinions that are relevant to this case.in matter of torres garcia,bia,the bia accepted our invitation to provide a more complete agency elaboration of how its interpretation of a can be reconciled with its own regulations.perez gonzalez,at.the bia concluded that the ninth circuit analysis regarding the availability of a retroactive waiver of the ground of inadmissibility set forth at a c i contradicts the language and purpose of the act and appears to have proceeded from an understandable,but ultimately incorrect,assumption regarding the applicability of.torres garcia,at.the bia noted that the regulation that we had held was in conflict with the agency guidance memoranda was not promulgated to implement section a,but implement ed statutory provisions that were repealed by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira.id.at.it further noted that our decision in perez gonzalez effectively allowed i to function as means to circumvent the statutory year limitation on a c ii waivers by allowing aliens to simply reenter unlawfully before requesting the waiver.id.at.
in matter of briones,bia,the bia revisited the question we answered in acosta and again rejected our reasoning.it explained that a c i i applies to recidivists,that is,those who have departed the united states after accruing an aggregate period of unlawful presence of more than year and who thereafter entered or attempted to reenter the united states unlawfully.id.at.the board observed that a c i i could therefore trump i without rendering the latter provision superfluous.id.at.it noted that in every other case where congress has extended eligibility for adjustment of status to inadmissible aliens it has done so unambiguously,either by negating certain grounds of inadmissibility outright or by providing for discretionary waivers of inadmissibility,or both.id.at.accordingly,the bia decided that despite our decision in acosta,it found little merit in the argument that it would be incompatible with the remedial purpose of section i to make adjustment of status unavailable to aliens inadmissible under section a c i i.id.at.the board held that aliens who are inadmissible under a c i i can not qualify for i adjustment,absent a waiver of inadmissibility.id.at.
we addressed the effect of the bia torres garcia opinion in duran gonzales department of homeland security,cir.in duran gonzales,we held that under the framework established by chevron and national cable and telecommunications association brand x internet services,u,the bia torres garcia opinion effectively superseded our interpretation in perez gonzalez.see duran gonzalez,at.first,we found that in perez gonzalez we had interpreted the interplay of a c i i and i only after we determined that the statute was ambiguous and that the bia had not issued a controlling decision that resolved this ambiguity.see id.at.second,relying on brand x,we held that perez gonzalez did not foreclose subsequent agency interpretations of the statute,and that torres garcia constituted such an interpretation.see id.at.we concluded that the bia interpretation of a c i ii in torres garcia was clearly reasonable and is therefore entitled to chevron deference under brand id.at.following torres garcia,we held that aliens ineligible to receive waivers are not eligible to adjust their status under i.see id.at.
with that background,we now turn to the case before us.
we begin by asking whether congress has spoken to the precise question at issue.see chevron,at.here,garfias urges us to hold that we settled the question of whether a trumps i in acosta,when we interpreted the same statutes in the absence of an authoritative interpretation by the bia.however,we see no basis for distinguishing a c i i from a c i ii or for departing from the reasoning of duran gonzalez.in brand x,the supreme court held that a court prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.at see duran gonzalez,at.because we believe that acosta was not such a decision,we hold that briones is entitled to deference under chevron and brand 
we wrote in acosta that t he statutes involved do not clearly indicate whether the inadmissibility provision or the adjustment of status provision should take precedence,and reached our conclusion there by relying heavily on our earlier perez gonzalez decision.acosta,at.other circuits have also noted that the tension between a c i i and i creates a statutory ambiguity and can not be resolved conclusively by resort to the text.see,renteria ledesma holder,cir ramirez holder,cir mora mukasey,cir ramirez canales mukasey,cir see also lemus losa holder,cir noting,in dicta,that i f the question before us were the relation between a c i i and i we would agree that there is sufficient ambiguity in these provisions to require chevron deference,and we would find that the bia has drawn a rational line herrera castillo holder,cir we need not wrestle much with whether i and a are ambiguous for chevron purposes a pplying the statutes plain language would render i a nullity.unable to rely on the statutes plain language,therefore,we can not ascertain whether congress had an intention on the precise question at issue.internal citations and alterations omitted.
we previously refused to give deference to the bia interpretation only because it came in the form of a guidance memorandum,which we held was not entitled to the same rigorous deference due agency regulations.acosta,at.in deciding briones,however,the bia has provided a thoroughly developed opinion that disagrees with our interpretation in acosta.additionally,our decision in acosta relied heavily on our reasoning in perez gonzalez,which has itself been effectively abrogated by the bia decision in torres garcia.see duran gonzalez,at.because acosta did not unambiguously foreclose the bia authority to interpret the interplay between a c i i and i,the bia remains the authoritative interpreter within the limits of reason of the immigration laws.brand x,at.thus,we hold that the bia decision in briones addressed a statutory ambiguity and is entitled to chevron deference.
we now turn to whether the bia interpretation of the statutory framework is reasonable.see chevron,at.every circuit that has addressed the issue has concluded that briones is a reasonable interpretation of a c i i and i.see renteria ledesma,at ramirez,at mora,at ramirez canales,at.we agree with our sister circuits and hold that the bia conclusion is reasonable.
as we noted in acosta,a c i i and i contain two competing mandates.the former provision seems to categorically exclude certain classes from admissibility altogether,while the latter provision allows an otherwise inadmissible alien to seek a status adjustment in exchange for a penalty fee.see acosta,at.thus,a refers generally to aliens who are inadmissible,a emphasis added including all aliens who are physically present in the united states and who entered without inspection while i refers to alien s physically present in the united states who entered the united states without inspection,but who may nonetheless be deemed eligible to receive an immigrant visa and admissible to the united states,i a emphasis added.the bia also acknowledged this ambiguity,noting that the plain language of the statute seems to make entry without inspection both a qualifying and a disqualifying condition for adjustment of status.briones,at.
the bia found that the current adjustment provision was enacted as part of the iirira.the bia observed that congress has generally limited adjustment of status to those aliens who have been inspected and admitted into the united states.id.at.although congress intended to discourage aliens from moving to the united states before becoming eligible for permanent residence,congress found that the inspected and admitted policy forced relatives of permanent residents to leave the country just so they could apply for an immigrant visa at a embassy or consulate.id.section i authorized a limited departure from the general inspection and admission requirement.id.at.the bia noted that the current ambiguity between the a c i i and i was a consequence of a switch from use of the term deportable to inadmissible to describe aliens who entered without inspection.see id.at.it resolved this ambiguity by concluding that i applies to some aliens who are physically present in the united states and entered without inspection,but not to those aliens who entered the country without inspection,stayed for at least a year,departed the country,and then enter ed or attempt ed to reenter the united states without being admitted.a c i ii.the latter class of aliens which the bia refers to as recidivists are not eligible for adjustment of status under i because otherwise i would be making adjustment available to a whole new class of aliens who had never been eligible for it.briones,at.finally,the bia deemed it of crucial importance to its interpretation that in every other case where congress has extended eligibility for adjustment of status to inadmissible aliens it has done so unambiguously,either by negating certain grounds of inadmissibility outright or by providing for discretionary waivers of inadmissibility,or both.id.at.
in light of the bia reasoned opinion,we hold that the bia decision in briones is entitled to deference.applying briones to this case,we conclude that garfias is inadmissible under a c i i and not subject to the exception in a c ii.he is,therefore,not eligible for adjustment of status under i.
garfias contends that even if briones controls the interpretive question in this case,the bia should not have retroactively app
