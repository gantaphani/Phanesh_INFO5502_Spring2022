petitioner faustino seeks review of the denial of his application for cancellation of removal and adjustment of status under b of the immigration and nationality act ina,b the immigration judge ij found that could prove three out of the four statutory requirements for cancellation of removal,but that he failed to establish that he had been physically present in the united states for a continuous period.the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed without opinion.seeks review of the decision on two grounds that his continuous physical presence in the country had already been established in the removal hearing and should therefore have been given preclusive effect in the subsequent cancellation hearing and that the ij failed to give proper weight to the back tax returns he filed for the years,which he claims corroborate his testimony that he was present in the country during that time.neither of these two arguments is persuasive,and therefore we deny the petition for review.
background 
is a year old mexican national who entered the united states at an unknown location on an unknown date,without being admitted or paroled.joint appendix at ij decision order.at his removal hearing,he testified that he had entered the country illegally several times,including in,and.at removal hr g tr.during his time in the united states,has resided in several states,including arizona,california,and arkansas.on march,in little rock,arkansas,married catalina carranza duarte,who is also unlawfully present within the country.and his wife have three children,all of whom were born in the united states and are currently five,six,and twelve years old.the family resides in little rock,arkansas,where worked in construction.
on october,the former immigration and naturalization service ins served with a notice to appear nta,charging him with violating a a i of the ina,a a i,which prohibits an alien from being present in the united states without being admitted or paroled.based on testimony at his removal hearing,the ij found each of the allegations in the nta had been proven that he was not a united states citizen or national that he was in fact a mexican citizen that he last entered the united states in in arizona and that he entered without being admitted or paroled.at removal hr g tr.
following the ij ruling,applied for cancellation of removal and an adjustment of status pursuant to b of the ina,b.section b permits an immigration judge to cancel removal and to modify the status of an otherwise removable alien to a permanent resident if the alien 
a has been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than years immediately preceding the date of such application 
b has been a person of good moral character during such period 
c has not been convicted of a specified offense and 
d establishes that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien spouse,parent,or child,who is a citizen of the united states or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
b.the ij found that could satisfy three of the four statutory requirements.
the ij found that did not have a criminal violation that would fall within the statute prohibitions and that removal to mexico would cause exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to kathy stephanie santana,his oldest child and a united states citizen.with regards to the good moral character requirement of the law,the ij discovered that had not paid any income taxes since his arrival in the united states.during the approximately recess before his next hearing on his cancellation application,filed federal and arkansas tax returns for the years through,and submitted them into evidence.the tax returns were based on estimates of living expenses because documentary evidence of earnings was not available.see,at tax returns.while the failure to pay taxes could be sufficient to find bad character,the ij instead commended on his efforts to make amends and pay his back taxes.in addition,the ij found that good moral character was proven through his involvement in community service projects,including helping with repairs at his daughter school.
the final requirement that needed to satisfy for cancellation of removal was that he submit evidence proving he had been physically present in the united states continuously for ten years,beginning on october,at his removal hearing,testified that he had last entered the country in.at removal hr g tr.the first documentary evidence that was actually in the united states,however,was pay stubs from an employer in dateland,arizona for the period of march.the next document chronologically was the result of a california driving test dated december.the state of california issued him a certificate of title for a car on april,and two identification cards in june and march.also submitted rent receipts from january to november and again from january to december.thus,there existed several large gaps within the period during which could not prove through documentary evidence that he was in the united states from october,to december,from december,to june from june to april,from april,to january and from november to january.to prove his presence during these gaps,submitted several affidavits from acquaintances attesting to the fact that he was in the united states.none of the affidavits,however,accounted for any time prior to april,and therefore,gaps still remained in the required continuous period.
based on those gaps and the absence of any other corroborating evidence,the ij concluded that offers only his testimony to prove that he has been physically present in the united states for the required ten years.at ij decision order.therefore,the ij ruled that failed to prove a prima facie case for cancellation of removal and denied application.on march,the bia affirmed the ij decision without an opinion.petitioned this court for review.
ii.analysis 
before proceeding to the merits of claims,we must first address our jurisdiction to entertain his petition for review.the ina specifically divests jurisdiction of a court to review judgments regarding the granting of discretionary relief,including the cancellation of removal.a b.the denial of relief based on the ground that the alien has failed to demonstrate a continuous physical presence,however,is a factual determination and properly subject to appellate review.elnemr ins,wl,at cir,najjar ashcroft,cir ins,cir ins,cir kalaw ins,cir.but ins,cir concluding that the ij determination of the issue is discretionary and thus,not subject to judicial review.therefore,we have jurisdiction pursuant to a,which provides generally for judicial review of all final orders of removal.when the board adopts the decision of the ij in lieu of issuing its own opinion,we review the ij decision as the final agency decision.denko ins,cir.
collateral estoppel 
the first issue which raises in his petition is that his continuous physical presence in the country had been established in the removal hearing,and therefore,the ij erred by failing to give this finding preclusive effect in his subsequent cancellation hearing.we have held that t he availability of collateral estoppel is a mixed question of law and fact which this court reviews de novo.hammer ins,cir,cert.denied,d.applying this standard,we conclude that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is inapplicable in this case.
the united states supreme court has defined the doctrine of collateral estoppel as providing that once an issue is actually and necessarily determined by a court of competent jurisdiction,that determination is conclusive in subsequent suits based on a different cause of action involving a party to the prior litigation.montana united states,d.the court has applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel in the context of an administrative agency acting in a judicial capacity as well.united states utah constr.mining,d.accordingly,circuit courts have given preclusive effect to determinations made by immigration judges in immigration hearings.see medina ins,cir concluding that a prior determination that petitioner was a citizen precluded subsequent deportation proceedings,even whe
