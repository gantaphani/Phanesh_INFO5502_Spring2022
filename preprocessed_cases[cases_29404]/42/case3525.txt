in this case,we revisit the severe mistreatment that have suffered in their adopted country.gafoor ins,cir,superseded by statute,real id act of,as recognized in parussimova mukasey,cir 
in,the fijian alliance party,which had governed fiji since independence,lost the general election to the national federation coalition.the new government had strong support from the community.later that year,the royal fiji military forces staged a military coup with the purpose of restor ing the political dominance of ethnic fijians in their home islands.after the new government assumed control,the military staged a second coup in because it had been excluded from governmental negotiations.power was then once again handed over from the military to civilians in december.
there were reportedly no deaths associated with either coup,but the police and military dealt harshly with during the coups and their aftermath.many were arrested and abused while in custody.military and police aside,also suffered widespread discrimination,abuse,and harassment at the hands of ethnic fijians 
the department of state received numerous reports of physical abuse of detainees by the military,some of whom were forced to run barefoot on blacktop roads in the hot sun for several kilometers or were dumped in pit latrines or in the sewage treatment holding plants.the most horrible reported attacks on include women raped in front of their children,political opponents brutally beaten,detainees forced to walk naked in the streets while holding human excrement,people forced to swim in sewage ponds,and children stripped and beaten for sunday curfew violations and forced to rub their noses against a concrete floor until their noses bled.ethnic fijian youth gangs raided,stoned,and fire bombed homes.in,five hindu temples were burned.in october,an indian school was burned.freedom of speech was severely constrained,and political meetings and demonstrations banned.fearing for their safety,roughly fled the country.

ali was one of those who suffered persecution in the aftermath of the coups.he was harassed by fijian soldiers while he and other muslims were at a prayer meeting in a mosque.he was beaten with the butt of a gun by a fijian soldier.his house was vandalized and dynamited by military forces.ethnic fijians routinely threw rocks at his family,car,and house.his wife was threatened with rape.ethnic fijians threatened to burn his house if he did not move.ethnic fijians stole from his family.
ali and his family entered the united states on march,on a visitor visa.two more coups took place after ali in and one in.the coup was remarkably similar to the coups,resulting in further abuse of and effectively destroying any improvements that had been made since.id.at.after the coup,though,fijians began to enjoy free and fair elections.however,in december,the military once again overthrew the government,accusing it of unfairly favoring ethnic fijian interests.according to the state department country report for fiji,the human rights situation deteriorated greatly following the coup.
ali filed an application for asylum on october.he was not interviewed by the government for that application until nearly years later.not long after the interview,the government initiated removal proceedings against ali,alleging that he was subject to removal because he remained in the united states longer than permitted.
ali appeared before the immigration judge ij on april.he conceded removability and renewed his applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.the ij determined that ali offered credible testimony and that he established past persecution.see b.because ali had established past persecution,he was entitled to the presumption of a fear of persecution if he were to return to fiji,and the ij so found.see b.
but the ij concluded the government had rebutted that presumption in light of improved country conditions,which were detailed in the state department asylum profile and country report.the ij then denied ali request for relief.
on administrative appeal,the board of immigration appeals bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision under matter of burbano,bia noting that adoption or affirmance of a decision of an ij,in whole or in part,is simply a statement that the board conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which the immigration judge articulated in his or her decision.the bia held that t he immigration judge correctly found that although the respondent had established past persecution,his fear of future persecution had been rebutted by changed country conditions.the bia held that,in the absence of that presumption,ali had not met his burden of establishing the elements of his claims for relief.ali timely petitioned us to review that decision.
while his petition was pending on appeal,ali moved the bia to reopen his proceedings on may,in light of new evidence detailing the coup in fiji.the bia denied his motion on august,concluding that the evidence was new,but not material.ali timely petitioned us to review that decision,too.we have jurisdiction to review ali petitions under.
where,as here,the bia cites burbano and also provides its own review of the evidence and law,we review both the ij and the bia decisions.joseph holder,cir.we review de novo the bia and ij determinations of purely legal questions.hamazaspyan holder,cir.we review factual findings,on the other hand,for substantial evidence.halim holder,cir.under the standard,a dministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.id.we will uphold the agency determination if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence in the record.id.quoting zehatye gonzales,cir.we review the bia denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.garcia holder,cir.we can not affirm the bia or ij on a ground upon which it did not rely.najmabadi holder,cir.in other words,we must decide whether to grant or deny the petition for review based on the board or ij reasoning rather than our own independent analysis of the record.azanor ashcroft,cir.
the bia and ij correctly afforded ali the presumption of a fear of persecution.but their finding that the government had rebutted that presumption is not supported by substantial evidence because they failed to make an individualized determination of how the changed country conditions in fiji impacted ali specific harms and circumstances.in addition,the bia abused its discretion when it denied ali motion to reopen because it failed to analyze the effect of the coup on ali presumption of a fear of persecution.
the petitioner bears the burden of establishing his eligibility for asylum.a.to satisfy this burden,an alien must show he is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,his country of nationality because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a.
an alien who has suffered past persecution is presumed to have a fear of persecution.b.the government may rebut that presumption if it establishes,by a preponderance of the evidence,that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a fear of future persecution or t he applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant country of nationality see also hanna keisler,cir citing tawadrus ashcroft,cir.this presumption only applies to fear based on the original claim and not to fear of persecution from a new source.see b.
when the government comes forward with evidence of changed country conditions tending to rebut the presumption of a fear of persecution,the ij must make an
