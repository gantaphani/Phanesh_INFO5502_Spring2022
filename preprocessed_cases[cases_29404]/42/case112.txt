prior proceedings 
xiu lin came to the united states on or about june,arriving at chicago international airport without a visa or other valid entry document.xiu lin was detained,and the immigration and naturalization service issued her a notice to appear on june,charging her as removable for having entered the united states through fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact,a c i,and without a valid entry document,id.a a i i.on july,xiu lin was released from custody to go live with her husband aunt in new york,new york.
on september,xiu lin applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat,saying that she opposed china population control policy and would be forced to undergo involuntary sterilization if she were returned to china.specifically,she said she was fined for getting married at nineteen,when she was younger than the legal marriage age in china,in december.she also said she was forced to undergo insertion of an intrauterine device iud three months after her son was born in china on october.the iud,however,dropped out on its own and,unbeknownst to her,she became pregnant a second time in.when she went to a doctor appointment,she was forced to undergo an abortion in march.xiu lin application also said that chinese officials had damaged her home.
an immigration judge ij conducted a hearing on xiu lin application in new york on september,at which both xiu lin and her husband,xin ren chen ren chen testified.xiu lin testified that five or six local chinese authorities had used hammers to smash several windows and doors on the first floor of her house some time in july because she had not paid the government a fine for getting married and having a child too early.she said that her husband was not home when the officials came,although her husband later testified that he was there when the local authorities damaged their house.her husband also testified that the damage occurred in january,not july,of.both xiu lin and ren chen agreed,however,that they paid the fine on july.
xiu lin also said she had photos,which ren chen had taken a few days after the damage occurred as proof.the ij noted that the photos were in color,not black and white,and that they showed damage to the second floor although xiu lin had said it was only to the first floor.xiu lin also testified that her house in china was across the street from buildings,whereas her husband had said they lived across from a vacant lot.
as to the forced abortion,xiu lin said that on march,a doctor discovered she was pregnant at a routine exam to check her iud.she was then taken to changle county city hospital,where she received an injection at her waist right before a new iud was placed in her.when asked about the abortion procedure,she said only that she delivered the fetus in the bathroom a few hours later.when asked about how she was able to deliver the fetus when a new iud device had already been inserted,xiu lin changed her testimony and said the iud device was inserted several days after the abortion.she believes she was two months pregnant at the time.
xiu lin also testified that she had called her husband the day of the abortion to tell him what had happened.she said he was waiting for her with their son at her mother house when she returned that afternoon.ren chen,in contrast,said that xiu lin did not call him until the night of the abortion to tell him what had happened.he said he did not see her until the day after the abortion and that they met at their own home,not xiu lin mother house.
xiu lin said that she gave birth to a daughter on august,in boston,massachusetts,where her parents live as lawful permanent residents.
on september,the ij found that xiu lin was not credible.in an oral opinion,the ij first noted that xiu lin testimony was very general and meager and lacked detail on important aspects of her asylum claim.the ij doubted that the forced abortion actually occurred,as xiu lin was not able to describe the procedure and knew very few specifics about the actual operation.the ij also went through the numerous inconsistencies between xiu lin and ren chen testimony regarding both the damage to their home and the details about what happened the day of xiu lin forced abortion.when given the opportunity to explain the major contradictions,xiu lin had said only that she had a tough night and had given the wrong answer.
the ij also doubted the authenticity of the documents from china in xiu lin application.in particular,he did not believe that the photos of a damaged house depicted xiu lin home in china.he also questioned the authenticity of an abortion certificate,which xiu lin said was proof of the forced abortion.the ij explained that state department reports said chinese hospitals issued certificates to patients that requested them in order to get sick leave after voluntary abortions but that the certificates were not typically issued after forced abortions.
after considering the record evidence and finding xiu lin not credible,the ij denied xiu lin request for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief and ordered her removed to china 
on february,xiu lin requested that the bia order another merits hearing because part of the hearing was not transcribed.on august,the bia noted that one of the tape recordings of the hearing was blank and remanded the case to the immigration court with instructions that it take necessary and appropriate steps to prepare a complete transcript of the proceedings,including a new hearing if necessary.on september,the ij changed the venue of the proceedings to boston,massachusetts because xiu lin had moved from new york city to malden,massachusetts in july.
on september,the parties convened before a new ij in boston.they stipulated that the facts stated in the original oral decision accurately reflected what was said during the merits hearing,so there was no concern that the oral decision was inconsistent with the contents of the blank tape.as a result,the ij determined that another merits hearing was not necessary and the original decision denying xiu lin application for relief from removal.xiu lin appealed to the bia,and on february,the bia affirmed the ij decision,including the adverse credibility finding,and dismissed the appeal.this court denied xiu lin petition for review on november,stating that the ij findings that xiu lin was not credible and had presented suspect documentary evidence were amply supported by the record.yuan gonzales,app x cir.
on march,xiu lin filed her first motion to reopen the removal proceedings,stating that her father had become a citizen and had filed an immigrant visa petition on her behalf.on may,the bia denied xiu lin motion as untimely because it was not filed within ninety days of the bia february,decision dismissing her appeal.see c.that decision is not before us.
second motion to reopen 
on may,more than seven years after her first untimely motion,xiu lin moved the bia to reopen a second time.she argued there was new material evidence not available during her removal proceedings showing that china currently enforces its policy using force and extreme coercion tantamount to force.she said this,coercive enforcement made it probable that she would be subjected to sterilization in china because she has three children in violation of the policy a son born in china in,and two daughters born in boston in and.as a result,she asked the bia either to exercise its discretion to sua sponte reopen proceedings,a,or to find her excused from complying with the number and time limits on motions
