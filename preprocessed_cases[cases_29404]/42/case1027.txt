background 
vargas manslaughter conviction 
vargas,a citizen of peru,entered the united states on or about july,as a visitor and,on february,acquired lawful permanent resident status.a few months earlier,in october,vargas was arrested by new york state authorities and indicted for murder in connection with the stabbing death of his girlfriend,miriam molina.see penal law.in may,a kings county jury found vargas guilty of the offense of manslaughter without returning a verdict on the murder charge.see id.sellan kuhlman,cir noting that,under new york law,manslaughter is a offense of murder.on june,vargas was sentenced to an indeterminate term of to years in prison.
in appealing his conviction,vargas argued,inter alia,that the trial judge erred in failing to charge the offenses of manslaughter,see penal law,and criminally negligent homicide,id,crimes that require proof,respectively,of a reckless or negligent mental state,in contrast to manslaughter,which under and requires proof of a specific intent to cause,respectively,serious physical injury or death.the appellate division,second department,rejected these arguments and affirmed vargas conviction,ruling that no reasonable view of the evidence would support a finding that the defendant acted recklessly or negligently.people vargas,dep t.the court observed that the record showed that vargas had approached molina with an open knife in his hand,and stabbed her four times,once in the back.see also people suarez,observing that a shooting or knifing or similar killing can almost never qualify as depraved indifference murder under penal law because the defendant in such killings almost always acts intentionally quoting people payne.
vargas remained incarcerated by new york state until august,when he was released on parole.
b.the removal proceedings 
in november,the immigration and naturalization service ins instituted removal proceedings against vargas on the ground that his new york state conviction for manslaughter rendered him an aggravated felon.appearing before an ij on february,vargas,who was represented by counsel,admitted his manslaughter conviction but challenged removability,arguing,inter alia,that manslaughter in the first degree does not constitute a crime of violence within the statutory definition of aggravated felony,see a f,and that,in any event,the aggravated felony ground for removal should not apply retroactively to his conviction in may,the ij rejected these challenges as without merit and ordered vargas removed to peru 
vargas appealed to the bia,which,on april,summarily affirmed the ij removal order.in may,vargas timely petitioned this court for review.while that petition was pending,this court ruled in jobson ashcroft,cir,that manslaughter in violation of penal law,was not a crime of violence under b and,thus,not an aggravated felony for purposes of removal.pursuant to a stipulation by the parties,filed july,this court vacated the bia challenged april order and remanded the case to the agency for reconsideration in light of jobson.
on january,the bia issued an unpublished decision explaining why,despite jobson,it upheld the order of removal in vargas case.on february,the bia published its decision with editorial changes consistent with our designation of the case as precedent.in re,wl bia.it is to this published decision that we cite in this opinion.the bia observed that,because the first and second subsections of new york manslaughter statute require proof of intent to cause either serious physical injury or death,vargas crime of conviction differs significantly from the manslaughter charge in jobson,which requires proof only of reckless conduct.id.at.the bia noted that reckless conduct necessarily encompasse s many situations involving omissions or passive conduct that do no t involve any risk that the defendant will apply force to the victim.id.quoting jobson ashcroft,at.by contrast,where the defendant has purposefully sought to kill or seriously injure another person and has succeeded in causing a death,there is a high likelihood of affirmative conduct.id.at.more to the point,the inherent nature of a crime that intends to cause death or serious physical injury necessarily contemplates a substantial risk that the defendant may intentionally use force in committing the crime.id.emphasis added.accordingly,the bia ruled that the offenses prohibited by subsections and of are crimes of violence within the meaning of b,making vargas removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.id.
on january,vargas petitioned this court for review of this bia decision.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
as a rule,federal courts lack jurisdiction to review final agency orders of removal based on an alien conviction for certain crimes,including aggravated felonies.see a c.the real id act of recently clarified that courts,nevertheless,retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review,a a iii,stat,codified at a d see gonzales,cir.this includes questions of law raised in petitions for review of removal orders based on aggravated felony convictions.see,aguiar gonzales,cir holding that real id act extends court jurisdiction to questions of law raised upon petitions for review,including petitions for review of removal orders based on aggravated felony convictions gonzales,cir same tran gonzales,cir same.no different conclusion is warranted by the fact that vargas raises a legal challenge to a removal order that became final before the may,enactment of the real id act because congress expressly gave that law retroactive effect.see real id act b providing that act applies to cases in which the final administrative order of removal,deportation,or exclusion was issued before,on,or after,the date of enactment see also gittens menifee,cir per curiam noting that real id act,by its terms,is retroactive.thus,this court has jurisdiction to review vargas legal claim that his manslaughter conviction does not constitute an aggravated felony under the relevant law 
standard of review 
when the bia construes the immigration and nationality act ina,codified at et,a statute that it is charged with administering,federal courts must give substantial deference to the agency interpretation,abimbola ashcroft,cir quoting evangelista ashcroft,cir,unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute,chevron,natural res.def.council,d see dickson ashcroft,cir.by contrast,we owe no deference to the bia interpretations of state or federal criminal laws,because the agency is not charged with the administration of such laws.sutherland reno,cir quoting michel ins,cir opinion of sotomayor.we review the bia interpretation of state or federal criminal laws de novo.see jobson ashcroft,at.
because the issue before manslaughter in the first degree under new york law is a crime of depends on the interpretation of federal and state criminal statutes,specifically,and penal law,our review of this petition is de novo.see dickson ashcroft,at jobson ashcroft,at.
relevant federal and state statutes 
a brief review of the statutes relevant to this appeal is useful to our discussion of the merits of vargas legal challenge.
aggravated felony 
ina a a iii states that a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.a a iii.ina a includes a variety of crimes within its statutory definition of aggravated felony,including,but by no means limited to,murder,rape,drug trafficking,firearms trafficking,and money laundering.see a.also included within the definition of aggravated felony is any crime of violence as defined in section of title,but not including a purely political offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.id.a f.
crime of violence 
section of title offers two definitions of crime of violence 
a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,or 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
because the bia ruled that vargas manslaughter conviction qualified as a crime of violence under b,we focus on that subsection in this opinion.
manslaughter 
new york penal law identifies four distinct circumstances in which a person commits manslaughter in the first degree when 
with intent to cause serious physical injury to another person,he causes the death of such person or of a third person or 
with intent to cause the death of another person,he causes the death of such person or of a third person under circumstances which do not constitute murder because he acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance,as defined in paragraph a of subdivision one of section.the fact that homicide was committed under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance constitutes a mitigating circumstance reducing murder to manslaughter in the first degree and need not be proved in any prosecution initiated under this subdivision or 
he commits upon a female pregnant for more than weeks an abortional act which causes her death,unless such abortional act is justifiable pursuant to subdivision three of section or 
being eighteen years old or more and with intent to cause physical injury to a person less than eleven years old,the defendant recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of serious physical injury to such person and thereby causes the death of such person.
serious physical injury,as referenced in subsection of,is defined by new york law as physical injury which creates a substantial risk of death,or which causes death or serious and protracted disfigurement,protracted impairment of health or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily organ.penal law.
extreme emotional disturbance,as referenced in subsection of,is a partial affirmative defense to murder that is available where t he defendant acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse.id.a see people white,describing components of extreme emotional disturbance defense as objective element requiring proof that there was reasonable explanation or excuse and subjective element requiring proof that conduct was influenced by extreme emotional disturbance at time crime was committed.if a defendant charged with murder proves extreme emotional disturbance by a preponderance of the evidence,he is not acquitted rather,the charge of conviction is reduced from murder to manslaughter in the first degree.see deluca lord,cir citing people casassa.
d.the categorical approach to identifying crimes of violence under 
categorical analysis 
in the context of removal proceedings,this court has ruled that a categorical approach must be used to determine whether an offense is a crime of violence within the meaning of b.dalton ashcroft,cir.under this categorical approach,a reviewing court must focus on the intrinsic nature of the offense,rather than on the singular circumstances of an individual petitioner crimes,and only the minimum criminal conduct necessary to sustain a conviction under a given statute is relevant.id.quoting michel ins,at calabresi,dissenting see also ming lam sui ins,cir noting that reviewing court can not go behind the offense as it was charged to reach its own determination as to whether the underlying facts amount to one of the enumerated crimes.we have described the categorical approach as not only consistent with both precedent and sound policy but,also,as necessary in view of the language of the applicable statutes.jobson ashcroft,at internal quotation marks omitted.thus,it is the language of b,which defines a crime of violence by its nature,that compels a reviewing court to focus on the intrinsic nature of the offense rather than on the factual circumstances surrounding any particular violation.id.quoting dalton ashcroft,at.
divisible penal statutes 
identifying divisible penal statutes 
despite this general prohibition against inquiry into the factual circumstances of the crime underlying a removal order,a limited review of the record may be warranted where the statute of conviction is divisible.a criminal statute is divisible if it encompasses multiple categories of offense conduct,some,but not all,of which would categorically constitute aggravated felonies under the ina.see abimbola ashcroft,at dickson ashcroft,at kuhali reno,cir.in reviewing a removal petition based on a conviction under a divisible statute,a court applying the categorical approach may look beyond the language of the statute to the record of conviction for the limited purpose of determining whether the alien conviction was under the branch of the statute that permits removal.dickson ashcroft,at.the record of conviction includes the charging document,plea agreement,a verdict or judgment of conviction,and a record of the sentence or plea transcript.abimbola ashcroft,at citing c b.
new york penal law is a divisible statute 
applying these principles to this case,we conclude that new york manslaughter statute,penal law,is divisible.the first two subsections of that statute require the defendant conduct to have been committed with the specific intent to cause serious physical injury or death to some person.see penal law and.two other subsections identify manslaughter in circumstances causing death without regard to any specific intent to kill or cause serious physical injury when certain abortional acts cause,however unintentionally,the death of the mother,see id.or when a person over the age of eighteen intent on causing some physical injury to a child under the age of eleven engages in reckless conduct resulting in the child death,see id.
vargas judgment of conviction does not specify the subsection of under which he was convicted.in light of the very different conduct and intent specified in the statutory subsections,however,it is certainly conceivable that a categorical determination whether vargas committed an aggravated felony could vary depending upon the subsection of conviction.see ming lam sui ins,at concluding that b ecause it was conceivable that determination of whether petitioner committed aggravated felony under ina would vary depending on whether he or she had been convicted alternatively of making,possessing,or uttering,counterfeit securities,court could look to charging documents to determine proscribed activity at issue see generally in re,at observing that manslaughter as defined in subsection of penal law does not involve inherent substantial risk of force and,therefore,may not be a crime of violence in these circumstances,we treat penal law as a divisible statute for purposes of b analysis.
vargas manslaughter conviction was pursuant to penal law or 
the parties do not dispute the divisibility of.indeed,they appear to concur that vargas manslaughter conviction is pursuant to either subsection or of and that those sections should be the focus of our b analysis.we agree.
the murder indictment against vargas charged that on or about october,in the county of kings,with intent to cause the death of miriam molina,vargas caused the death of miriam molina by stabbing her with a sharp instrument and thing,thereby inflicting divers wounds and injuries from which she died.indictment.this pleading makes plain that vargas conviction for the crime of manslaughter was necessarily pursuant to either a subsection of because,although vargas caused molina death,his specific intent was only to cause her serious physical injury or b subsection because,although vargas caused molina death with the specific intent to do so,he satisfactorily demonstrated that he acted under an extreme emotional disturbance.nothing in the record would support a conclusion that vargas manslaughter conviction involved the abortional acts specified in subsection or a child victim as specified in subsection.indeed,subsection was not even added to until,almost six years after the jury returned its verdict against vargas.see laws ch,creating penal law.
having thus identified the relevant statutory sections of conviction,we turn to the critical issue raised by vargas petition whether manslaughter as defined in penal law or categorically qualifies as a crime of violence within the meaning of b.
manslaughter in violation of penal law or is,by its nature,a crime of violence under b 
the plain language of b requires that a felony offense present a substantial risk of the intentional use of physical force,not the invariable use of such force,to constitute a crime of violence under b 
in determining whether a felony offense constitutes a crime of violence within the meaning of b,we necessarily begin with the plain language of that statute.see leocal ashcroft,d citing bailey united states,d.as we previously observed,b defines crime of violence as any felony that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.b.preliminarily,we note that this provision sweeps more broadly than a,leocal ashcroft,at,which defines as well as felony offenses as crimes of violence only if they have as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,a emphasis added see chrzanoski ashcroft,cir holding that misdemeanor crimes can not be violent felonies under unless they have as an element the use of force.no such element requirement is specified in b.see chrzanoski ashcroft,at noting this distinction between a and b.rather,the plain language of b instructs courts to focus on the nature of the felony at issue to determine if it inherently presents a substantial risk that the perpetrator may use physical force in the commission of the crime.see dickson ashcroft,at holding that,even if none of the elements of unlawful imprisonment under penal law expressly require the use of physical force,the offense still satisfies b because,by its nature,the felony involves a substantial risk that force may be used emphasis in original.
we have broadly defined physical force for purposes of as power,violence,or pressure directed against a person or thing.dickson ashcroft,at quoting chrzanoski ashcroft,at,and rejecting argument that force referenced in b must be violent force applied directly to the person of the victim emphasis in original.for a particular felony,by its nature,to present a substantial risk of the use of such physical force,a court need not conclude that commission of the crime requires the invariable application of such force.as the supreme court stated in leocal ashcroft,the language of b defines as a crime of violence those felony offenses that naturally involve a person acting in disregard of the risk that physical force might be used against another in committing an offense.at.emphasis added.thus,the court observed that physical force need not actually be applied in the commission of the charged felony for it to qualify as a crime of violence under b.id.at.jobson ashcroft,at noting that an offense need not require an actual use of force to come within section b reach.the critical categorical inquiry is whether,inherent in any commission of the felony is a substantial risk that the perpetrator may use such force.leocal ashcroft,at.accord dickson ashcroft,at noting that b inquiry is necessarily broad and flexible,asking not whether it is conceivable that the felony could be committed without the use of force but whether the crime is one that by its nature involves a substantial risk that force may be used emphasis in original.
section b references a substantial risk of the intentional use of force 
in construing b to require a substantial risk of the use of physical force,rather than the invariable application of such force,this court has ruled that the contemplated risk refers to intentional,rather than merely negligent or accidental,use of force.as explained in dalton ashcroft,this is because b contemplates only intentional conduct and refers only to those offenses in which there is a substantial likelihood that the perpetrator will intentionally employ physical force,not to an accidental,unintended event.at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted accord jobson ashcroft,at see also ins,cir holding that physical force that may be used pursuant to b must be accompanied by intent to use that force united states,cir noting that language of b suggests a willingness to risk having to commit a crime of specific intent internal quotation marks omitted.this construction finds some support in leocal ashcroft,wherein the supreme court observed that,because the ordinary meaning of the word use requires active employment,b reference to a risk of the use of physical force in the commission of the charged felony most naturally suggests a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct.at.
identifying crimes that categorically present a significant risk of the intentional use of physical force 
applying these principles to various felony offenses,courts have concluded that,among the crimes categorically presenting a serious risk of the intentional use of physical force are burglary,see id.at.observing that burglary is a classic crime of violence not because the offense can be committed in a generally reckless way or because someone may be injured,but because burglary,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a victim in completing the crime emphasis in original the solicitation of murder for hire,ng attorney general,cir holding that solicitation of a murder naturally presents a substantial risk that physical force will be used against another,regardless of whether the risk develops or harm actually occurs unlawful imprisonment of a competent adult,see dickson ashcroft,at observing that,even where competent adult is restrained by deception,the offense will either involve the use of force to effectuate the restraint,or by its nature involve a substantial risk that force may be used and statutory rape,see chery ashcroft,cir observing that statutory rape cases can be imagined where a defendant conduct does not create a genuine probability that force will be used,but the risk of force remains inherent in an offense to which the victim can not consent emphasis in original.see also united states jackson,cir holding that escape qualifies as a violent felony under c because escape invites pursuit and the pursuit,confrontation,and recapture of the escapee entail serious risks of physical injury to law enforcement officers and the public united states gay,cir collecting cases concluding that even a,escape constitutes a crime of violence under because of risk inherent in nature of escape that the escapee,intent on securing freedom,may use force to avoid recapture united states danielson,cir per curiam holding that weapons possession in violation of penal law is violent felony within the meaning of e b where jury was required to find that defendant conscious aim or objective was to use a loaded firearm against another united states kaplansky,cir holding that attempted kidnapping is violent felony for purposes of enhanced sentence under e b ii because,even if deception is used to effect crime,that does not erase possibility that victim may discover plan and resist,requiring perpetrator to use force to achieve objective.although it is possible to hypothesize circumstances under which each of these crimes could be committed without the actual use of physical force,these courts have found that,under the relevant statutes,their inherent nature always presents the requisite substantial risk of the intentional use of force.
by contrast,courts have declined to recognize as a crime of violence within the meaning of b a felony offense for driving under the influence of alcohol.in so holding with respect to florida felony dwi statute,the supreme court explained that a person who unintentionally causes injury while driving under the influence of alcohol can not reasonably be said to have use d physical force against another.leocal ashcroft,at.in earlier reaching the same conclusion with respect to a comparable new york statute,this court observed that a person may be convicted of driving while intoxicated in new york even when asleep at the wheel of a car that has never moved and whose engine is not running,in short,under circumstances presenting no risk that force may be used.dalton ashcroft,at indeed,dalton foreshadowed leocal in concluding that,even when drunk driving involves the operation of a vehicle on the roadways resulting in injuries to persons,one can not say that the driver intentionally use d force in an accident.id.at emphasis in original.this is because use implies intentional availment,and n o availment of force in order to achieve an end is present in a drunk driving accident.id.quoting united states rutherford,cir.
in jobson ashcroft,this court concluded that these principles compelled a conclusion that recklessly caus ing the death of another person,manslaughter under penal law,did not qualify as a crime of violence under b.at.jobson summarized the two essential requirements of b that the felony offense inherently pose a substantial risk that a defendant will use physical force,and that the risk contemplate an intentional use of force.id.at emphasis in original.jobson concluded that manslaughter could not satisfy either of these requirements because,under new york law,the crime could be committed by passive conduct or omissions.id.at see,people stubbs,dep t holding that failure to feed child satisfied.jobson explained that,as a consequence,manslaughter encompasses many situations in which the defendant applies no physical force to the victim,and more importantly,situations that do not involve any risk that the defendant will apply force to the victim.jobson ashcroft,at emphasis added.the court ruled that a felony could not be identified as a crime of violence under section b unless its commission invariably present s a substantial risk of the intentional use of force.id.at rejecting argument that an offense satisfies section b as long as many but not all convictions involve a substantial risk of the use of force emphasis in original see also chery ashcroft,at.to present such an invariable risk,jobson concluded that the predicate offense itself had to involve intentional conduct.it explained that o n this view,a defendant must,in pursuing his intended criminal activity,risk having to intentionally use force to commit the offense.by contrast,a defendant who is convicted of manslaughter,like other offenses of pure recklessness,may lack any intent,desire or willingness to use force or cause harm at all.jobson ashcroft,at emphasis in original quoting united states parson,cir.
inherent in the specific intent requirements of penal law or is a substantial risk that a person committing manslaughter may intentionally use physical force 
applying jobson reasoning,as well as the principles derived from leocal and our other b precedents to this case,we conclude that manslaughter in violation of penal law or is categorically a crime of violence because inherent in the nature of that offense is a substantial risk that the perpetrator may intentionally use physical force in committing the crime.manslaughter,as defined in and,is readily distinguishable from manslaughter in that the former is a specific intent crime.to be found guilty under or,the accused must cause a human death while acting with the specific intent to do so or,at least,with the specific intent to cause serious physical injury.in short,manslaughter can not be committed through mere reckless passivity or omission,circumstances identified in jobson as presenting no risk of the intentional use of force.see jobson ashcroft,at.rather,as the government correctly observes,to carry out the specific intent detailed in or,an accused will generally intentionally use the most egregious forms of physical force shooting,see,people paredes,dep t people valverde,dep t stabbing,see,people gill,dep t people cobbs,dep t beating,see,people peralta,dep t or some combination of the above,see,people bell,dep t.whatever other means a person might conceive to commit manslaughter,when his intent is to take a life,or at least to inflict serious physical likely to meet vigorous resistance from a can confidently conclude that inherent in the nature of the crime is a substantial risk that the perpetrator may intentionally use physical force to achieve his criminal objective.the fact that a perpetrator might accomplish his homicidal or seriously injurious objective before a victim could mount any resistance warrants no different conclusion.the nature of the objective and the possibility of discovery and resistance are enough to establish the requisite inherent risk that the perpetrator might intentionally use physical force.chery ashcroft,at recognizing that where consent is can not to rape,the crime inherently involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used in its commission emphasis in original jobson ashcroft,at observing that burglary is a crime of violence even though no force is used in a particular instance,because a burglar of a dwelling risks having to use force if the occupants are home and hear the burglar internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted united states kaplansky,at observing that possibility that unwitting kidnapping victim will discover plot and resist makes perpetrator use of force an risk in the commission of the crime united states gosling,cir concluding that escape is properly deemed a violent crime because it can be analogized to a powder keg,which may or may not explode into violence,but which always has the serious potential to do so emphasis in original.
accordingly,we conclude that manslaughter in violation of penal law or qualifies as a crime of violence within the plain language of b 
vargas hypotheticals warrant no different conclusion 
vargas nevertheless insists that manslaughter should not be deemed a crime of violence under b because he can hypothesize two circumstances in which the crime could be committed without any risk of the intentional use of physical force.first,he posits that a woman might intentionally kill her husband by poisoning food that she expects him to eat in her absence.second,vargas suggests that a wife,intent on causing her husband serious physical injury,might wear down the brake pads on a car to be driven by her spouse,resulting in his death in an automobile accident.vargas submits that,in both these circumstances,the perpetrator uses no physical force against the victim.further,he insists that in neither circumstance is there any risk that the perpetrator will use such force because she is not even on the scene at the time of death.vargas argument is flawed in at least two respects.
first,vargas appears to misapprehend the essence of the categorical inquiry under b.whether a crime,by its nature,presents a substantial risk that the perpetrator may intentionally use physical force is not answered in the negative simply because cases can be imagined where a defendant conduct does not create a genuine probability that force will be used.chery ashcroft,at holding statutory rape a crime of violence even though defendant may be convicted where no actual force is used.where a person specific intent is to kill another human being or,at least,to cause him serious physical injury,there is necessarily a significant risk inherent in the nature of
