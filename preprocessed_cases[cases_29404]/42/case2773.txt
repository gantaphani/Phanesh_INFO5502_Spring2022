irene petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the immigration judge ij denial of her application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under article of the convention against torture cat.for the reasons discussed below,we deny petition.
background 
entered the united states from el salvador on june,as a visitor with authorization to remain until december.she filed an asylum application on january.in the application,claimed that el salvadoran police persecuted her because of her religious beliefs and political opinions.she explained that she worked as a counselor for the ministerio liberacion,a group whose mission was to teach convicted criminals,gang members,and similar groups about the bible.according to application,in may,police officers stopped her and others,pointed guns at the group,ordered them to put up their hands,and searched them.after told the police that she was a counselor with the ministerio liberacion,the police pulled her aside,interrogated her and threatened to put her in jail if they saw her again.also stated in the application that she was afraid of being tortured and raped if she ever returned to el salvador.the application contained no mention of any other incidents of persecution suffered by.
on november,an asylum officer interviewed.during the interview,described an incident that occurred in april.she claimed that she was praying in her home when police officers burst in and arrested everyone present.the police verbally insulted her but did not physically harm her.shortly after this incident,visited the united states for four months.when she returned to el salvador,she moved to a city fifty miles away from her previous home.stated that the situation was better in her new city,but on one evening in may,some men,whom she believed were police officers in plain clothes,grabbed her bible and hit her with it.explained that she knew the men were police officers,despite the fact that they were not wearing uniforms,because police officers do not wear uniforms when they hurt someone.the asylum officer found ineligible for asylum because she was not credible due to internal inconsistencies,inconsistencies with her asylum application,and vague testimony lacking an appropriate level of detail.
after meeting with the asylum officer but prior to her hearing before the ij,retained counsel.with her counsel assistance,filed an affidavit in support of her asylum application.in this affidavit,detailed two additional incidents.the first occurred in or.after a church meeting in her house,three men carrying guns,whom she believed were police officers in plain clothes,warned her and her daughter to stop talking to people about the bible.the second incident occurred in,when three uniformed police officers covered her mouth and eyes,threatened her,and told her to stop doing spiritual work.the affidavit did not mention the april incident that had discussed in her asylum interview.
the affidavit did,however,discuss the may incident.claimed that she and four others from her church group were praying with gang members in the middle of a soccer field when uniformed police officers arrived.the others ran away,but could not run.the policemen pointed guns at her and interrogated her.explained to them that she was part of the ministerio liberacion,which she believes led the police to assume that she was a revolutionary.she stated that the policemen then raped her repeatedly.the affidavit also recounted that did not report the incident to anyone and that it is extremely difficult for her to discuss the events of that night.
at hearing,the ij questioned her about why she had not previously presented allegations about the rape and the other instances of persecution.explained that she was ashamed but that she felt safer now.the ij concluded that was not credible.he found that there were very significant discrepancies in claims,including the fact that she referenced an additional incident of persecution at each successive step of the asylum process.moreover,the ij noted that did not mention the sexual assault until her affidavit was filed and that she was inconsistent in describing other details about the event.because the ij found that explanation for these inconsistencies was not credible,he concluded that corroboration was needed.provided no corroboration,so the ij denied her claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.
appealed the ij decision to the bia,which found that the ij credibility determination was supported by the record.the bia noted the inconsistencies between application,her interview and her testimony,as well as her failure to provide corroborating evidence of her claims that she was involved with the ministerio liberacion and that she was mistreated by the police.the bia found that the inconsistencies were central to claim and that she failed to provide a convincing explanation for the discrepancies.accordingly,the bia dismissed the appeal and granted sixty days to voluntarily depart from the united states.after petitioned for review,we granted her motion for a stay of removal pending our decision on her petition.
ii.discussion 
when the bia adopts and affirms the ij decision,but also adds reasoning of its own,we will review both decisions together.chen mukasey,cir.we affirm the decisions if they are supported by substantial evidence,and we will not disturb the ij findings of fact unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.singh gonzales,cir internal citation omitted quoting b b.
a person seeking asylum must show that she is unable or unwilling to return to her home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a see also b.a person seeking withholding of removal must demonstrate a clear probability that his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.ezeagwu mukasey,cir quoting b.an applicant seeking relief under the cat must establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.c.
the testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.a.a credibility determination is a finding of fact,and we should accept adverse credibility findings unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.redd mukasey,cir quoting b b.moreover,w hile minor inconsistencies and omissions will not support an adverse credibility determination,inconsistencies or omissions that relate to the basis of persecution are not minor but are at the heart of the asylum claim.onsongo gonzales,cir when the applicant testimony is inconsistent,an ij is entitled to require corroborating evidence.esaka ashcroft,cir.the combination of an adverse credibility finding and a lack of corroborating evidence for the claim of persecution means that the applicant claim fails,regardless of the reason for the alleged persecution.redd,at.
because an applicant seeking withholding of removal faces a higher burden than an applicant seeking asylum,the failure to establish eligibility for asylum also means the applicant fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal.ibrahim gonzales,cir.if the applicant cat claim relies on the same evidence as her asylum and withholding of removal claims,the court adverse decision on asylum and withholding of removal will also be determinative of the cat claim.id.at.
argues that the ij and bia credibility determination improperly relied upon her failure to disclose the rape in her asylum application and interview and focused on minor inconsistencies.she contends that the ij and bia,therefore,improperly required corroborating evidence of her claims without sufficiently evaluating her explanation that she was too ashamed to discuss the sexual assault until she filed her affidavit and testified before the ij.we disagree.the ij and bia adv
