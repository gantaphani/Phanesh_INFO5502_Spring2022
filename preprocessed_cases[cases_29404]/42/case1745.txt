the petition for panel rehearing is granted.the prior opinion is withdrawn,and the following opinion replaces it.
the aftermath of hurricane katrina required new orleans hotelier decatur hotels,decatur to look to foreign sources of labor.a group of these employees collectively,the guest workers,who held visas while working for decatur,contend that decatur violated the fair labor standards act flsa by paying them less than minimum wage,free and clear,when decatur refused to reimburse them for recruitment,transportation,and visa expenses that they incurred before relocating to the united states to work for decatur.
decatur filed a motion to dismiss for summary judgment,and the guest workers filed a for summary judgment.the district court denied decatur motion,granted the guest workers motion in part,and certified its order for interlocutory appeal.a motions panel of this court authorized decatur to file an interlocutory appeal.in this interlocutory appeal under b,decatur raises three issues of first impression for this court whether,under the flsa,an employer must reimburse guest workers for recruitment expenses,transportation expenses,or visa expenses,which the guest workers incurred before relocating to the employer location.we conclude that the flsa does not require an employer to reimburse any of these expenses.we therefore reverse the district court order,and we render judgment in favor of decatur.
decatur operates luxury hotels in the new orleans area.before hurricane katrina struck new orleans,decatur employed between and workers.after hurricane katrina struck new orleans,the size of decatur staff dropped to between and workers.decatur attempted to recruit local residents to join its staff,but its efforts were largely unsuccessful.decatur urgently needed to hire maintenance,housekeeping,and employees.
virginia pickering,a baton rouge businesswoman,read a news article that mentioned decatur staff shortage.pickering owned and operated accent personnel services,a company that guided employers through the process of becoming visa sponsors as visa sponsors,the employers legally could hire foreign workers to fill temporary job positions.
pickering advertised accent personnel services to decatur chief executive officer,patrick quinn iii.pickering offered to guide decatur through the application process,to oversee the recruitment of workers,and to coordinate the workers arrival times in the united states.if decatur were to use pickering services,it would need only to supply pickering with information that she would need to complete decatur sponsorship application,to pay fees,and to meet its new employees when they arrived in new orleans.pickering would do everything else necessary to secure the temporary workers for decatur.for these services,pickering would charge decatur per job position filled.
quinn agreed that decatur would use pickering services to hire housekeepers,maintenance workers,and clerks and pickering went to work.she identified the wage rate at which decatur would need to pay the housekeepers,maintenance workers,and clerks to comply with department of labor regulations.she ensured that decatur recruited citizens to fill its open job positions before offering the same positions to foreign workers.she prepared decatur application to sponsor visas.she also prepared,and a decatur manager signed,a blank job offer for each open job position.
unbeknownst to decatur,pickering also owned and operated a second company vp consultants,llc.through vp consultants,pickering offered a service that connected with her services at accent personnel after identifying employers such as decatur that were sponsoring visas,she provided this information,for a fee,to recruitment companies that represented foreign workers seeking temporary employment.in exchange for per decatur job position,or referral,vp consultants informed global services,of positions eurousa,of housekeeping positions and international jobs studies of maintenance positions.
although vp consultants generated revenue by informing recruitment companies of decatur job positions,pickering testified that she also had been willing to share information about decatur job positions with foreign workers who contacted vp consultants directly.however,there is no indication in the record that such contacts occurred or that,given the foreign workers circumstances,such contacts were possible.it also is unclear what fee,if any,vp consultants would have charged the workers to receive information about decatur job positions.
in theory,the guest workers also could have contacted decatur directly to learn about decatur job positions decatur would have referred such inquiries to pickering.no guest worker contacted decatur directly,and it is unclear whether such contact would have been feasible.
nevertheless,each worker hired a recruitment company to locate job opportunities on his or her behalf,to guide him or her through the visa application process,and to arrange transportation to the united states.each recruitment company charged between and for its services in addition to this fee,each recruitment company required workers to pay their own fees as well as all transportation expenses necessary to relocate to the united states altogether,each guest worker paid between approximately and approximately in recruitment,transportation,and visa expenses before relocating to the united states.
when the guest workers arrived in new orleans,decatur conducted a orientation session,for which it paid the workers and the guest workers began to work.decatur paid the guest workers whom it hired through global services,per hour,the guest workers whom it hired through eurousa,per hour,and the guest workers whom it hired through international jobs studies per hour.as we have said,decatur did not reimburse the guest workers for their recruitment,transportation,or visa expenses,all of which they incurred before relocating to the united states.
the guest workers,proceeding under the flsa,filed a complaint in federal district court seeking to recover these expenses,as well as liquidated damages,costs,and attorney fees.decatur defended on grounds that the flsa does not obligate it to reimburse the guest workers for their recruitment,transportation,or visa expenses.to this end,decatur filed a motion to dismiss for summary judgment and the guest workers filed a for summary judgment.in a single order,the district court denied decatur motion and granted the guest workers motion in part,insofar as it allowed them to proceed with their flsa claim.
decatur asked the district court to certify its order for interlocutory appeal.the district court granted decatur motion.it identified,as a controlling issue of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion,the question whether guestworkers are entitled to the protections of the flsa.a motions panel of this court then permitted decatur to file this interlocutory appeal under b.the district court proceedings have not been stayed.
we first must consider our jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal.the guest workers contend that we lack,in the alternative,that our jurisdiction is limited to answering the single question identified by the district court as a controlling issue of law.
a motions panel decision to allow an interlocutory appeal is not binding upon the panel that subsequently considers the appeal merits the merits panel may conclude that the initial decision to hear the appeal was,or was later rendered,improvident.if the merits panel reaches that conclusion,it must vacate the earlier order granting leave to appeal and must remand the case to the district court.united states bear marine,cir.we therefore will review the motions panel decision for improvidence.
we initially examine whether our jurisdiction over this appeal,if accepted,is limited to the single question identified by the district court as controlling.the supreme court has held quite clearly that it is not b grants jurisdiction over any question that is included within the order that contains the controlling question of law identified by the district court.yamaha motor calhoun,d.here,the order for which the district court certified interlocutory appeal contains three questions in addition to the question that the district court identified as controlling whether the flsa requires an employer to reimburse guest workers for their recruitment expenses,their transportation expenses,or their visa expenses.decatur hotels,at.july,order denying motion to alter or amend judgment,granting motion to certify interlocutory appeal,and denying motion to stay pending interlocutory appeal.in the light of yamaha,we may consider these questions as well as the threshold question whether guest workers are entitled to the flsa protections.
whether the flsa entitles guest workers to reimbursement for their recruitment,transportation,or visa expenses are,as we have noted,questions of first impression for this court.we conclude that these questions are controlling questions of law in this case,as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion.the motions panel decision to grant interlocutory review was not improvident.we now will consider the questions before us.
in response to the question identified by the district court,we hold that guest workers are entitled to flsa protection.see in re reyes,cir t he protections of the fair labor standards act are applicable to citizens and aliens alike and whether the alien is documented or undocumented is irrelevant.whether the flsa entitles guest workers to reimbursement of recruitment,transportation,or visa expenses merits lengthier discussion.
the guest workers contend that they are entitled to reimbursement because,under m,the expenses they incurred are de facto deductions from cash wages received for their first week of work,leaving a balance owed them by decatur.in other words,they liken these expenses in an inverse way to facilities,such as room and board,which the employer may deduct from an employee wages only here,the guest workers contend that decatur must reimburse them for expenses that they incurred before their first workweek began.
section m defines wages as cash or the reasonable cost to the employer of furnishing the employee with board,lodging,or other facilities,if such board,lodging,or other facilities are customarily furnished by such employer to his employees.emphasis added.the provision plain language thus permits employers flexibility in the method of paying employees.this section of the flsa,contrary to the guest workers suggestion,does not impose liability upon employers for expenses that employees incur.see donovan miller,cir per curiam s ection m of the fair labor standards act,m,allows an employer to credit toward its obligation to pay the minimum wage the reasonable cost of furnishing an employee with board,lodging,or other facilities emphasis added.section m provides no ground for decatur to have violated the flsa by refusing to reimburse the guest workers for recruitment,transportation,and visa expenses that they incurred.
we thus turn to the argument that decatur failure to pay these expenses encumbered the guest workers wages,so that decatur did not pay the wages finally and unconditionally or free and clear 
whether in cash or in facilities,wages can not be considered to have been paid by the employer and received by the employee unless they are paid finally and unconditionally or free and clear.the wage requirements of the act will not be met where the employee directly or indirectly to the employer or to another person for the employer benefit the whole or part of the wage delivered to the employee.this is true whether the is made in cash or in other than cash.for example,if it is a requirement of the employer that the employee must provide tools of the trade which will be used in or are specifically required for the performance of the employer particular work,there would be a violation of the act in any workweek when the cost of such tools purchased by the employee cuts into the minimum or overtime wages required to be paid him under the act.
the regulation does not define when an expense constitutes a.our precedents,however,clarify that an condition of employment is a if it tend s to shift part of the employer business expense to the employees.mayhue super liquor stores,hodgson,cir.
we now consider whether,under,the guest workers are entitled to reimbursement of their recruitment,transportation,or visa expenses.
we begin with the visa expenses.although does not specifically address employers obligation to reimburse guest workers for these expenses,other regulations clarify that expenses to obtain visas more properly belong to the guest worker than to the employer.see l requiring nonimmigrant visa applicants,such as the guest workers here,to submit processing fees when they apply for visas.the expense of applying to become a sponsoring employer of employees,by contrast,more properly belongs to the employer.see a,b,h i a requiring,collectively,that a employer submit certain forms and filing fees to become an visa sponsor.these regulations,which assign visa processing fees to visa applicants and fees to employers,show that requiring the guest workers to bear the visa expenses at issue did not tend to shift part of decatur business expense to the guest workers.we hold that decatur has no flsa responsibility to reimburse the guest workers for the visa expenses that the employees incurred.
we next consider the transportation expenses.for many years,the department of labor interpreted the flsa and its implementing regulations as requiring employers to bear guest workers inbound transportation expenses.see wage hour div.op,dolwh lexis,at june,under the flsa,it has always been the position of the department of labor that no deduction,that cuts into the minimum wage,may be made for transportation of workers from the point of hire and return to that point s uch transportation costs are primarily for the benefit of the employer.the agency,however,has called this interpretation into question.see labor certification process and enforcement for temporary employment in occupations other than agriculture or registered nursing in the united states workers,and other technical changes,t he cost of relocation to the site of the job opportunity generally is not an incident of an worker employment within the meaning of cfr,and is not primarily for the benefit of the employer.withdrawal of interpretation of the fair labor standards act concerning relocation expenses incurred by and workers,dol believes that this issue warrants further review.consequently dol withdraws the december,flsa interpretation for further consideration and the interpretation may not be relied upon as a statement of agency policy footnote omitted see also de grower ass n,d,t he issue of an employer liability for transportation expenses has been under review by the dol dol policy regarding de facto deductions of transportation expenses is anything but clear.rivera brickman group,wl,dist.lexis,at,the court refused to rely on the opinion letters because it believed the department of labor position to be too unclear.i agree,and in so doing,i note that the department of labor position is not merely unclear,but untenable.given the apparent and now more than incoherence at the department of labor with regard to this issue,i am not persuaded that i should accord the older opinion letters any significant weight under auer robbins,d,or skidmore swift.
we agree with the rivera court that auer deference to the dol older interpretation seems inappropriate.furthermore,inasmuch as the dol never fully explained why it adopted that interpretation in the first place,we agree with the eleventh circuit that skidmore deference seems inappropriate.see arriaga.pac.farms,cir because of this lack of explanation,it is impossible to weigh the validity of its reasoning or the thoroughness in its consideration.quoting skidmore,at.alteration in original.relying on case law that defers to the interpretation similarly seems inappropriate,and thus we can accord no weight to the guest workers cited authorities such as marshall glassboro service ass n,dist.lexis,at,and torreblanca naas foods,dist.lexis,at.
as is the case with visa expenses,
