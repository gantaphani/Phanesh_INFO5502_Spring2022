we consider whether an alien whose legal status as the spouse of a citizen is later terminated because the marriage was fraudulent is eligible for discretionary relief from removal.we conclude that she is.we grant the petition and remand to the board of immigration appeals to determine whether petitioner renerose vasquez application for a fraud waiver should be denied in the exercise of discretion.
background 
renerose vasquez is a native and citizen of the philippines.she married wilfredo vasquez,a citizen,in the philippines in january.on february,vasquez was admitted to the united states as a conditional permanent resident as the wife of a citizen.
statutory background 
we refer to vasquez as a conditional permanent resident because an alien admitted to the united states for permanent residence as a spouse of a citizen obtains that status only conditionally,pursuant to section of the immigration and nationality act ina,to remove the condition,the alien and her spouse must submit a joint petition to the attorney within the period before the second anniversary of the alien admission as a permanent resident,stating,among other things,that the marriage was not entered into for immigration purposes.c,d,d.the alien and her spouse must then appear together for an interview.if the attorney general determines that the facts in the petition are true,including the representation that the marriage was bona fide,the condition is removed and the alien spouse remains a legal resident.c,d.
there are three circumstances in which the attorney general must terminate an alien conditional permanent resident status first,if the attorney general determines,before the second anniversary of admission,that the qualifying marriage is invalid as a basis for permanent resident status because it was entered into for immigration purposes,or has been judicially terminated,or a fee was paid for the filing of the petition for immediate relative status,then the attorney general shall terminate the permanent resident status of the alien involved as of the date of the determination.b.second,if the alien and her spouse do not file a timely joint petition to remove the conditions on residence or do not appear for the required interview,then the attorney general shall terminate the permanent resident status of the alien as of the second anniversary of the alien lawful admission for permanent residence.c.third,if the alien and her spouse file a petition at the proper time and appear for an interview but the attorney general determines that the qualifying marriage was not entered into in accordance with the laws of the place where the marriage took place,has been judicially terminated,or was entered into for the purpose of procuring an alien admission as an immigrant,or a fee was paid for the filing of a petition for immediate relative status,d a,then the attorney general shall terminate the permanent resident status of an alien spouse as of the date of the determination.c c.
section c allows the attorney general to remove the conditions on residence for an alien who fails to meet the joint petition requirement.the alien must demonstrate that she meets one of three criteria,one of which is that extreme hardship would result if she were removed.c a 
factual background 
as required,vasquez and wilfredo vasquez filed a joint petition to remove the conditions on residence and appeared for an interview on may,with the ins.thenceforward,the case unwound in byzantine fashion it took seven years to reach a final agency conclusion,required the filing of several ins forms,triggered four hearings before immigration judges ijs reflecting seemingly contradictory arguments by each party,and resulted in seemingly contradictory rulings,by two different ijs.
first,at the ins interview on the joint petition,wilfredo vasquez signed an affidavit stating that vasquez grandmother promised him half of which he accepted,half of which he refused to marry vasquez for immigration purposes.vasquez signed an affidavit stating that she knew she did wrong and that her grandmother pa id wilfredo vasquez b ecause she trying to help us because that the one way.the ins issued a written notice terminating vasquez conditional resident status.the notice recounted wilfredo vasquez admission that the marriage was entered into for the sole purpose of obtaining immigration benefits,and cited matter of mckee,bia,for the proposition that a marriage that is entered into for the primary purpose of circumventing the immigration laws,referred to as a fraudulent or sham marriage,has not been recognized as enabling an alien spouse to obtain immigration benefits.it concluded based on the foregoing facts and since the petition is a joint petition and no longer represents the signature of the united states citizen spouse,the petition may not be approved and therefore must be denied.
the ins then served vasquez with a notice to appear,charging her with removability under ina a a,a a,as an alien inadmissible at the time of admission because she sought to procure admission by fraud.while removal proceedings were pending,vasquez filed a second petition to remove the conditions on residence,this time seeking an extreme hardship waiver under c a.after vasquez appeared before an ij and denied she had committed marriage fraud,the removal proceedings were continued to await the ins adjudication of vasquez pending application for a waiver.
vasquez divorced wilfredo vasquez on june,and married frederick villanueva,a citizen,on december.vasquez and villanueva had a son,eren villanueva,on september.eren has mild persistent asthma,which has required his hospitalization at least twice.villanueva filed an immediate relative petition on vasquez behalf.to facilitate that petition,vasquez filed a second request for waiver of the joint petition requirement,this time on the basis that her marriage to wilfredo had been terminated but was entered into in good faith.finally,in vasquez supplemented her application for an extreme hardship waiver with documentation of hardship to her citizen husband and child.
immigration proceedings 
hearing of august,
on december,the ins issued a written notice denying vasquez application for an extreme hardship waiver.the notice stated,inter alia,that vasquez was not statutorily eligible to apply for the waiver because she had met the joint petition requirement.her petition had been denied on its merits,the ins ruled,for marriage fraud.
the removal proceedings were then renewed,and vasquez appeared before a visiting immigration judge,ij smith,on august.vasquez testified that her marriage to wilfredo vasquez was in good faith but she did not move in with him because she was afraid that his be jealous.ij smith held that the government had justified its decision to terminate vasquez status by a preponderance of the evidence,because it had shown that the marriage to wilfredo vasquez was entered into for the purpose of immigrating to the united states and no other basis.ruling that no extreme hardship waiver was available because the joint petition had been filed but denied,ij smith continued the proceedings so that vasquez could seek a waiver under a h the fraud waiver.the fraud waiver provision allows the attorney general to waive removal for an alien who sought to procure admission by fraud and is the spouse or parent of a citizen.
hearing of january,
the dhs responded to this suggestion by filing an additional charge of removability against vasquez on october,it now charged that she was removable not only for fraudulent admission but also,pursuant to a d i,as an alien who was lawfully admitted for conditional permanent resident status but whose status was later terminated.
vasquez appeared before ij yam on january.ij yam held that the fraud waiver did not apply to the additional charge filed against vasquez.she therefore pretermitted vasquez application for a fraud waiver and,in the alternative,denied the waiver in the exercise of discretion.finding vasquez ineligible for relief,the ij ordered her removed to the philippines.
bia appeal 
vasquez timely appealed the ijs orders to the board of immigration appeals bia.the bia addressed both ij rulings in a single decision,affirming ij smith ruling that vasquez was ineligible to apply for an extreme hardship waiver,ij yam ruling that the fraud waiver would not cover both grounds of removal,and,in the alternative,ij yam discretionary waiver denial premised on these rulings,the bia dismissed vasquez appeal from the removal order.
because the bia conducted a de novo review and issued its own decision,our review is limited to the bia decision except to the extent that the bia expressly adopted the opinions of the ijs.see hosseini gonzales,cir.we review questions of law de novo,see aguilar gonzales mukasey,cir,and factual findings for substantial evidence,see zhao mukasey,cir.
extreme hardship waiver 
we begin our journey through this maze of a case by considering whether,as the bia determined,vasquez is ineligible to seek an extreme hardship waiver.we conclude that the bia determination on this issue was correct.
the opportunity to apply for an extreme hardship waiver is available only to those who fail to meet the joint petition requirements to remove the conditions on residence.c.vasquez and her citizen spouse,wilfredo vasquez,timely filed a joint petition and appeared together for an interview.the bia held that wilfredo vasquez admission during the interview that the marriage was for immigration purposes did not result in a withdrawal of the petition.compare matter of mendes,bia holding that where the petitioning spouse signed a written statement expressly withdrawing his signature from the petition,the petition was withdrawn and treated as though it had not been filed.given the record,we conclude that substantial evidence supports the bia determination that the joint petition was denied on the merits under c c,rather than withdrawn.
although the ins ruling is somewhat confusing,there is no indication in the record that wilfredo vasquez withdrew his signature from the petition,as opposed to making statements at the interview indicating that the marriage was fraudulent.the termination notice focused almost exclusively on marriage fraud the ins denial of the extreme hardship waiver interpreted the termination as premised on marriage fraud and the initial notice to appear charged vasquez with removability under a a,for procuring admission into the united states by fraud.moreover,at the august,hearing before ij smith,everyone involved in the,the government,and the the termination of status as resulting from an adjudication on the merits of the joint petition.after a lengthy hearing,ij smith held that the government had carried its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that vasquez had committed marriage fraud,thus justifying termination of her conditional legal status.had the petition been withdrawn,the burden of proof would have been on vasquez to demonstrate that she warranted a waiver under c.see mendes,at.
vasquez argued for the first time in her opening brief before this court that rather than failing to establish the substantive requirements for a successful petition,she had failed to file the joint petition necessary to remove the conditions on residence.but vasquez and her husband did file a joint petition and appeared for an interview,and,as noted,there is no indication that wilfredo vasquez at that interview expressly withdrew his signature from the petition.we therefore can not disagree with the bia that vasquez was terminated for engaging in marriage fraud,not for failing to file a joint petition,and so is ineligible to apply for an extreme hardship waiver under c.
fraud waiver 
eligibility 
the next question we encounter as we proceed through this labyrinthine case is whether vasquez is eligible for an entirely different form of immigration relief under a h,available to aliens inadmissible on grounds of fraud the bia held that she is not,because the fraud waiver would not eliminate the additional charge the dhs lodged against vasquez midway in her removal she is removable as an alien lawfully admitted for conditional permanent resident status but whose status was later terminated.a d i.in support of its holding,the bia cited matter of gawaran,bia,aff sub nom.gawaran ins,cir.for the following reasons,we hold that our decision in gawaran,although it remains a binding precedent,does not apply to an alien whose conditional permanent resident status was terminated not for failure to file a joint petition but upon a determination of marriage fraud.
we begin with a brief discussion of the ina provisions that most directly concern us here,provisions that,unlike the ones discussed previously,apply beyond the marriage context.first,of the ina,describes classes of aliens ineligible for admission into the united states.in particular,a c i the fraud provision makes inadmissible a ny alien who,by fraud or willfully misrepresenting a material fact,seeks to procure a visa,other documentation,or admission into the united states or other benefit provided under this chapter.
section of the ina describes classes of deportable aliens.two of these categories are relevant here first,a a makes deportable a ny alien who at the time of entry or adjustment of status was within one or more of the classes of aliens inadmissible by the law existing at such time.second,a d provides in relevant part that a ny alien with permanent resident status on a conditional basis who has had such status terminated is deportable.
finally,a h the fraud waiver allows the attorney general to waive t he provisions of this paragraph relating to the removal of aliens within the united states on the ground that they were inadmissible at the time of admission as aliens described in the fraud provision for any alien who is the spouse,parent,or child of a citizen or permanent resident and who was otherwise admissible at the time of admission o therwise admissible means not excludable on some ground other than the entry fraud.holder,cir citing ins yang,d.the effect of the fraud waiver is to transform an individual who enters the united states with an invalid immigrant visa to the status of one who entered as a nonpreference immigrant,despite the fact that a valid immigrant visa would never have been available to the individual at the time of entry.braun ins,cir.enacted as a humanitarian gesture to preserve families comprised in part of united states citizens or lawful permanent residents,id.citing ins errico,d,the fraud waiver statute does not provide any statutory criteria governing the grant or denial of the waiver.
the question that concerns us here,then,is whether the fraud waiver applies to removal based on the termination of conditional permanent residence,where the reason the alien status was terminated was that the attorney general found the qualifying marriage was entered into for the purpose of procuring an alien admission as an immigrant.d a.
we note at the outset that the fraud waiver provision does not limit its coverage to the ground of removal contained in subparagraph a a making deportable aliens who were inadmissible at the time of admission.we so conclude for two reasons 
first,a h provides that t he provisions of this paragraph relating to the removal of aliens within the united states on the ground that they were inadmissible at the time of admission as aliens described in the fraud provision may be waived emphasis added.t his paragraph refers to a,which sets out six grounds of removal under the heading inadmissible at time of entry or of adjustment of status or violates status.if relief under the fraud waiver were limited to subparagraph a a the only provision that explicitly makes deportable aliens inadmissible at the time of admission,then congress would not have used the plural form,provisions,and it likely would have specified the single subparagraph to which it was referring.
second,in addition to referring to provisions in the plural,congress used the words relating to provisions relating to the removal of aliens on the ground that they were inadmissible at the time of admission on fraud grounds.a h emphasis added.the phrase relating to,as defined by the supreme court,means to stand in some relation to to have bearing or concern to pertain refer to bring into association with or connection with.united states sinerius,cir quoting morales trans world airlines,d.consistently with this definition,we have construed relating to language broadly,including in the ina.see id.construing the phrase relating to sexual abuse in b ins,cir interpreting the phrase relating to a controlled substance in ina a b i.by its terms,then,the waiver covers not only subparagraph a a,which provides for the removal of aliens on the ground that they were inadmissible at the time of admission,including aliens who sought to procure admission by fraud,but also any other provisions of paragraph a bearing on or connected to the removal of aliens on that ground.
with that background,the issue we must address becomes more focused whether removal for termination of an alien status upon a finding of marriage fraud under subparagraph a d relates to,or bears on,the removal of aliens on the ground that they were inadmissible at the time of admission as aliens described in the fraud provision,as provided by a h.
the bia did not frame the pivotal question in this manner.instead,in holding that the fraud waiver was not available to vasquez,the bia relied on matter of gawaran for the broad proposition that a section a h waiver for inadmissibility due to fraud or misrepresentation is unavailable to waive a separate charge of removability based on the termination of the alien conditional resident status.the bia read gawaran too broadly,as that case,properly understood,does not apply to the circumstances of this case,for reasons we now explain 
we begin by looking closely at gawaran.the petitioner in gawaran,josefina gawaran,was married to a citizen of the philippines.she later married a citizen but had never divorced her first husband.on the basis of the second,invalid marriage,she entered this country as a conditional permanent resident and soon gave birth to a child.a year after her arrival,her citizen husband filed to annul their marriage.the ins discovered gawaran bigamous marriage and charged her as deportable because excludable by the law existing at the time of entry,as an individual who entered without a valid immigrant visa or a valid labor certification.at.
as it turned out,gawaran also failed to file a joint petition to remove the conditions of residence before the second anniversary of her admission as a result,the ins terminated her status and lodged an additional charge of deportability against her,stating that she was deportable as an alien whose conditional permanent resident status was terminated because gawaran did not file a petition to remove the conditional nature of her permanent resident status before the second anniversary of her admission for permanent residence.id.at.
at the time of gawaran case,the fraud waiver,then f,allowed the attorney general to waive t he provisions of this section relating to the deportation of aliens within the united states on the ground that they were excludable at the time of entry as aliens who have sought to procure or have procured visas or other documentation by fraud or misrepresentation,where the alien was the spouse,parent,or child of a citizen or permanent resident and was otherwise admissible at the time of entry.ina f,f in a precedential opinion,the bia considered whether the fraud waiver,if granted,would waive both charges of deportability against is,not only the charge that she was excludable at the time of entry because she entered with invalid documents but also the charge that she was deportable because her conditional permanent resident status had been terminated.concluding that it would not,the bia noted that the service did not allege any fraud or misrepresentation in connection with the termination of status charge,nor was proof of fraud or misrepresentation required in order to sustain the charge of deportability.gawaran,at.
on a petition for review,we agreed with the bia.we observed that the fraud waiver at that time applied to aliens who were excludable upon entry.at.as the second charge of deportability against gawaran was based on her failure to file a joint petition before the second anniversary of her admission,we reasoned that the failure to file the petition could not have made gawaran excludable upon entry two years earlier.id.at.we therefore considered termination of status upon failure to file a petition a separate and independent ground for deportability to which the fraud waiver did not apply.id.our holding was grounded in part on reid ins,d,in which the supreme court held entry without inspection an independent ground of deportability not reached by the fraud waiver,because the question whether an alien presented himself for inspection was quite independent of whether the alien was excludable at the time of his arrival.at.
although the language of the pertinent statutory provisions has changed slightly since we decided gawaran,none of those changes are material to the issue there decided,so the holding of gawaran remains binding precedent.but this case presents altogether different circumstances from those we confronted in very circumstances,indeed,expressly excepted by the bia in its gawaran opinion.at.vasquez conditional permanent resident status was terminated not because she failed to file a joint petition but because the attorney general determined that her marriage to wilfredo occurred before vasquez left the entered into for immigration purposes.thus,unlike in gawaran,the service did allege fraud or misrepresentation in connection with its termination of vasquez status,and proof of fraud or misrepresentation was required in order to sustain the charge of deportability.id.also,unlike the attorney general determination that gawaran had failed to file a petition at the proper time,the determination that vasquez had committed marriage fraud did go directly to the question whether she was admissible at the time of admission it meant that she was not,by operation of the fraud provision a c i.
we conclude that in vasquez case,and in any other case in which the attorney general admits an alien into the united states as a conditional permanent resident based on her marriage to a citizen but later terminates that status upon a finding of marriage fraud,the termination of status ground of removal does relat e to the removal of aliens on the ground that they were inadmissible at the time of admission as aliens who sought to procure admission by fraud.both the termination of status and the finding of inadmissibility result from a single determination by the attorney general that the qualifying marriage was entered into for the purpose of obtaining admission as an immigrant.a h.thus,whenever the department finds that a conditional permanent resident has committed marriage fraud and charges her with removability on the ground that she was inadmissible at the time of admission as an alien who sought to procure admission by fraud,it will also be able to charge her as removable because her status has been terminated,as it did here.the two grounds are thus essentially coterminous and certainly relate to one another.
that vasquez status was terminated two years after her admission as a conditional permanent resident does not detract from this conclusion.the reason permanent residence based on marriage is conditional is that the passage of two years provides the ins with additional evidence useful in ascertaining whether the original admission was premised on a bona fide marriage.the central question in determining whether an alien entered into her marriage in good faith,and not for the purpose of procuring an immigration benefit,remains whether she and her spouse intended to establish a life together at the time they were married.damon ashcroft,cir emphasis added see bu roe,cir a marriage is a sham if the bride and groom did not intend to establish a life together at the time they were married.see also mendes,at discussing the system of conditional permanent residence established by the immigration marriage fraud amendments of imfa,stat.see generally vonnell tingle,immigration marriage fraud amendments of locking in
