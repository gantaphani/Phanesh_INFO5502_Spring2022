petitioner jose luis bedolla avila bedolla,a native and citizen of mexico,petitions for review of a final administrative removal order faro issued on march,by an assistant field office director with immigration and customs enforcement ice,united states department of homeland security dhs,in allenwood,pennsylvania.for the reasons that follow,we will deny the petition for review.
bedolla illegally entered the united states in,although he traveled to mexico and the united states at least once since then.in february,he was arrested in chester county,pennsylvania,on a bench warrant for failure to appear at trial on a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol.he was referred to an immigration enforcement agent and,on february,was placed in removal proceedings pursuant to section of the immigration and nationality act ina,on the grounds that he is an alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled under ina a a i,a a i an alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled,or who arrives in the united states at any time or place other than as designated by the attorney general,is inadmissible.an immigration enforcement agent personally served him with a notice to appear on february.
bedolla obtained counsel.he conceded removability and requested cancellation of removal and adjustment of status.in february,dhs filed a motion to pretermit the application for adjustment of status on the grounds that bedolla had departed the united states and reentered without inspection after accruing more than one year of unlawful presence in the united states.see ina a c i i,a c i i.bedolla did not respond to the motion.the immigration judge pretermitted the application for adjustment of status on april,and set a hearing on the issue of cancellation of removal for august.
on may,before the scheduled hearing date,bedolla was arrested on drug charges.his attorney obtained a continuance of his removal hearing due to his arrest and incarceration.on february,bedolla pleaded guilty to a charge of possession with intent to manufacture or deliver cocaine in violation of a.the same day,the court of common pleas of chester county,pennsylvania,sentenced bedolla to a term of imprisonment of days to months pursuant to the plea agreement.
the day after bedolla entered the guilty plea,february,dhs issued a notice of intent to issue a final administrative removal order noi,placing bedolla in expedited administrative removal proceedings pursuant to ina b,b,and charging him as removable under ina a a iii,a a iii,due to his conviction of an aggravated felony as defined in ina a b,a b.the noi advised that bedolla must respond to the charges in writing within calendar days of service or days if service was by mail,and that the response may,among other things,rebut the charges or request withholding of removal.the unsigned certificate of service accompanying the noi does not indicate the date or manner of attempted service.a indicates,however,that bedolla refused to acknowledge receipt of the noi.
on march,an ice detention officer wrote a memorandum to the assistant field office director advising that the period for responding to the noi had elapsed,bedolla had not filed a response,and a faro should be signed.that same day,the assistant field office director signed the faro.although the certificate of service accompanying the faro does not accurately reflect the date or manner of service,bedolla avers that he received the faro shortly after march,bedolla timely filed this petition for review on april,within thirty days of the date of the faro.
meanwhile,on march,at dhs request,the immigration judge terminated the ina removal proceeding that had been initiated in february.dhs then the faro on april,and served it the following week upon bedolla in person in york,pennsylvania on april.bedolla did not petition for review of the april,faro 
bedolla expressed a fear of returning to mexico.an asylum officer therefore conducted a reasonable fear interview on may,and,on june,denied bedolla reasonable fear claim.bedolla requested a hearing before an immigration judge,which was held on june.the immigration judge found that bedolla did not establish a reasonable possibility that he would be persecuted or tortured in mexico,and therefore returned the case to dhs for bedolla removal.bedolla later moved to the proceeding and submit further evidence.the immigration judge denied reopening and bedolla did not seek review of that decision.
we have jurisdiction over questions of law and constitutional claims presented in this petition for review.see ina a d,a d.on june,bedolla moved to have this court stay removal.the government did not oppose that motion.on august,a panel of this court granted a stay of removal pending further order of the court.
bedolla argues that dhs erred by placing him in expedited administrative removal proceedings because his crime is not an aggravated felony for purposes of removal under ina a a iii,a a iii any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.whether a criminal conviction constitutes an aggravated felony for purposes of removal is a question of law subject to plenary review.thomas attorney general,cir.
ina a b,a b,defines the term aggravated felony as,inter alia,illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as defined in section of title,including a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title.to determine whether bedolla crime qualifies as an aggravated felony,we first attempt to employ the formal categorical approach.see singh ashcroft,cir.citing taylor united states.this involves review of the statute of conviction without consulting other factual evidence.there are,however,situations in which a statute of conviction is divisible,it sets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative.descamps united states.where the statute of conviction is divisible,a departure from the formal categorical approach is necessary and a modified categorical approach instead must be employed.see evanson attorney general,cir.
the statute under which bedolla was convicted.cons.stat.a,is divisible with regard to both the conduct and the controlled substances to which it applies.united states abbott,cir.because the statute can be violated by the possession of and intent to distribute many different drugs,the types of which can increase the prescribed range of penalties,the statute includes several alternative elements and is therefore divisible.catwell attorney general,cir.concluding the statute is divisible with regard to conduct because it describes distinct offenses of manufacture,delivery,and possession with intent to deliver or manufacture see also garcia attorney general,cir.accordingly,we may consult a limited class of documents to determine which alternative elements formed the basis of the conviction.descamps,at.
we therefore will consider the charging document,plea agreement,and trial court judgment to determine the exact crime to which bedolla pleaded guilty.see shepard united states,abbott,at.it is undisputed that,in bedolla case,the controlled substance in question was cocaine.bedolla argues,however,that his conviction was for conduct that does not qualify as an aggravated felony because he pleaded guilty to the mere possession of cocaine only.this argument is unavailing.
the statute of conviction.cons.a,encompasses the following conduct manufacture,delivery,or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver a controlled substance.with regard to possession,an intent to manufacture or deliver is an element of the offense.gerbier holmes,cir.the relevant documents unequivocally establish that bedolla pleaded guilty to possession with intent to deliver cocaine.for instance,the first charge of the criminal complaint accuses bedolla of possession with intent to deliver cocaine in violation of.stat.ann.a.the plea colloquy similarly describes the crime to which bedolla pleaded guilty as possession w intent to deliver cocaine,a felony with a maximum sentence.in support of the plea,bedolla admitted,from to defendant did give illegible cocaine to another when not licensed
