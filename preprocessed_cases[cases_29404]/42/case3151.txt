linares gonzalez lynch,
linares is a native and citizen of guatemala who arrived in the united states without inspection in.the department of homeland security initiated removal proceedings in september,and linares eventually filed an application for special rule cancellation of removal under the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act nacara as a derivative beneficiary on his father application see,stat.
in october,while these proceedings were ongoing,linares pled guilty to three counts of identity theft under cpc d,a felony.he received a sentence of days in jail and months probation and was ordered to pay restitution linares testified to the immigration judge that he obtained credit card numbers from about six customers at the restaurant where he worked,and he gave the numbers to a friend who paid him for each number.he also testified that he did not know what his friend did with the numbers,but he thought that the friend used the numbers to get money.linares served days of his day sentence.
the ij denied linares application for cancellation of removal in june.the ij held,among other things,that linares was not eligible for cancellation of removal because his identity theft conviction was a categorical cimt because it involved an element of fraud and he did not have years of continuous presence in the united states following the conviction and linares failed to show good moral character during the required period of physical presence because he had four convictions,including three theft convictions,in the last eight years.
the bia dismissed linares appeal in august.the bia held that linares was ineligible for the petty offense exception under immigration and nationality act ina a a ii because he was convicted of three counts of identity theft linares conviction in for three counts of identity theft was categorically a crime involving moral turpitude,because selling,transferring or conveying the personal identifying information of another knowing that it will be used for an unlawful purpose involves conduct that is inherently base,vile,or depraved and contrary to accepted rules of morality and duties owed between persons or to society in general and cpc d contains the requisite scienter required to constitute a cimt.accordingly,the bia held that linares had not shown a realistic probability that cpc d may be applied to conduct.
the bia held that because linares had committed a cimt,he was subject to the heightened year continuous presence requirement for special rule cancellation of removal.the bia determined that linares had not met the year requirement,measured from the time of his identity theft conviction and rejected linares claim that the years were measured from the date of his arrival in the united states.the bia further held that linares could not show good moral character under the provision of ina f,f because of his convictions in,and 
preciado lynch,
preciado is a native and citizen of mexico who entered the united states without inspection in.preciado pled guilty to and was convicted for felony identity theft under cpc a in september.under the terms of the plea agreement,preciado admitted the allegations of the complaint and agreed that the statutory maximum prison term was three years preciado received a suspended sentence of days in jail and probation for months and was ordered to pay restitution.
in january,the department of homeland security began removal proceedings against preciado,and she filed an application for cancellation of removal.the ij denied the application in november,finding that her identity theft conviction was a categorical crime involving moral turpitude that barred relief.in doing so,the ij noted that in her plea agreement and conviction,preciado admitted that she willfully obtained personal identifying information of the victim without authorization and used or attempted to use the information to obtain credit,goods and services,or medical information in the name of the victim without consent.the ij also held that she did not qualify for the petty offense exception and had not demonstrated good moral character for the necessary time period.
after the ij denied relief,and while preciado appeal to the bia was pending,her identity theft conviction was reduced to a misdemeanor by the california superior court in february,pursuant to her motion for expungement.before the bia,preciado argued that her identity theft conviction was subject to the petty offense exception listed at a a ii.preciado contended that the petty offense exception applies where the maximum possible sentence for the applicable offense does not exceed imprisonment for one year and the alien is not sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of six months.in her view,because the maximum punishment for cpc a is imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year,and her actual sentence was days in jail,the petty offense exception applied,even if cpc a was a cimt.preciado also argued that her case should be remanded in light of the reduction of her felony conviction to a misdemeanor,which she claimed was additional support for her contention that she was eligible for the petty offense exception.
the bia dismissed preciado appeal in september.the bia acknowledged that cpc a did not require an intent to defraud.however,the bia held that cpc a was still a categorical cimt because there was no realistic possibility that the applicable statute would be applied to conduct.the bia reasoned that there were no cases where cpc a had been applied to conduct,and identity theft was described by the statute as an indisputable evil.
the bia also held that the petty offense exception did not apply,even though her conviction had been reduced to a misdemeanor,because even if a crime would otherwise qualify for the petty offense exception,if it is a cimt it may still disqualify an applicant from cancellation of removal and the later reduction of preciado conviction to a misdemeanor,or even its expungement,did not alter the fact that she had originally been convicted for a cimt for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed.thus,the bia held that preciado identity theft conviction rendered her ineligible for cancellation of removal.
to show his eligibility for cancellation of removal under b,a nonpermanent resident alien must show that he 
a has been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than years immediately preceding the date of such application 
b has been a person of good moral character during such period 
c has not been convicted of an offense under section a,a,or a of this title,subject to paragraph and 
d establishes that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien spouse,parent,or child,who is a citizen of the united states or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
offenses listed under a,which render an alien ineligible for cancellation of removal under b,include crimes of moral turpitude.a a i i alien who commits a crime of moral turpitude is inadmissible.nacara imposes similar requirements for cancellation of removal.see.
the bia dismissed linares and preciado appeals based in part on its determination that both had committed cimts,due to their identity theft convictions under cpc.both linares and preciado argue that their violations of cpc were not categorical cimts 
in determining whether the conduct proscribed by the statute involves moral turpitude,we apply the categorical approach of taylor united states,comparing the elements of the state offense to those of the generic cimt to determine if there is a categorical match.see descamps united states.to show that a state offense is broader than the applicable generic crime as defined by federal law,the defendant or alien must show that there is a realistic probability that the statute would be applied to acts not covered by the generic federal statute.gonzales duenas alvarez.to do so,the defendant or alien must at least point to his own case or other cases in which the state courts in fact did apply the statute in the special nongeneric manner for which he argues.id.
t he federal generic definition of a cimt is a crime involving fraud or conduct that is vile,base,or depraved and violates accepted moral standards.saavedra figueroa holder,cir citation omitted see also robles urrea holder,cir cimts are generally defined as crimes that are inherently base,vile,or depraved,and contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general.citations omitted.f raud crimes are categorically crimes involving moral turpitude,simply by virtue of their fraudulent nature.planes holder,cir.cimts almost always involve an intent to harm someone,saavedra figueroa,at quoting nunez holder,cir,or intent to injure,actual injury,or a protected class of victim,turijan holder,cir citation omitted.in determining whether an offense is a cimt,the bia has examined whether the act is accompanied by a vicious motive or a corrupt mind because evil or malicious intent is the essence of moral turpitude.latter singh holder,cir citations omitted.we have approved this approach.id.
linares and preciado were convicted under separate but similar subsections of cpc.the version of cpc a stated 
every person who willfully obtains personal identifying information of another person,and uses that information for any unlawful purpose,including to obtain,or attempt to obtain,credit,goods,services,real property,or medical information without the consent of that person,is guilty of a public offense,and upon conviction therefor,shall be punished by a fine,by imprisonment in a county jail not to exceed one year,or by both a fine and imprisonment,or by imprisonment in the state prison.
the version of cpc d stated 
every person who,with actual knowledge that the personal identifying information of a specific person will be used to commit a violation of subdivision a,sells,transfers,or conveys that same personal identifying information is guilty of a public offense,and upon conviction therefor,shall be punished by a fine,by imprisonment in the state prison,or by both a fine and imprisonment.
in essence,a prohibits someone knowingly obtaining personal identifying information and using that information for any unlawful purpose,while d prohibits someone transferring that information to someone else,knowing that the transferee will use it for an unlawful purpose.
cpc a and d are not categorical fraud crimes 
the government argues that violations of cpc a are inherently fraudulent because false statements that were made with the intent of inducing reliance is a form of fraud.in its view,the statute requires the perpetrator to willfully and unlawfully obtain another person identity through false representations in order to obtain a benefit or something of value.thus,the government argues,violations of cpc a are necessarily acts of fraud,even though there is no explicit fraud element.see tijani holder,cir discussing cpc,which prohibits making a false statement with the intent that it be relied on to obtain delivery of personal property,the payment of cash,the making of a loan or credit,but which does not expressly require intent to defraud blanco mukasey,cir i ntent to defraud is implicit in the nature of the crime when the individual makes false statements in order to procure something of value,either monetary or.
the government contention that violations of cpc a are inherently fraudulent is not persuasive.california appellate courts have specifically stated that cpc a does not require intent to defraud.in people hagedorn,the california court of appeal explained that subdivision a clearly and unambiguously does not require intent to defraud.the hagedorn court noted that another subsection of the identity fraud statute,which criminalized the acquisition or possession of personal identifying information but did not require its use,specifically required intent to defraud the court indicated that if the legislature meant for subdivision a to require an intent to defraud,it knew how to so provide,but it viewed the use of personal identifying information as the more serious offense and worthy of a more expansive scope than mere acquisition or possession.id.at see also people johnson.discussing hagedorn and explaining that the purpose of the california identity theft statute is to criminalize the willful use of another personal identifying information,regardless of whether the user intends to defraud or whether any actual harm or loss is caused.the same reasoning applies with equal force to cpc d.
our prior case law also supports a determination that cpc a and d are not fraud crimes.in blanco,at,we held that falsely identifying oneself to an officer under cpc a is not a categorical cimt.we determined the statute only required that a forbidden act was done deliberately and with knowledge,but not with evil intent.we further explained that f raud does not equate with mere dishonesty,because fraud requires an attempt to induce another to act to his or her detriment.one can act dishonestly without seeking to induce reliance.our cases have therefore recognized fraudulent intent only when the individual employs false statements to obtain something tangible.id.at citations omitted.thus,we held that a violation of the false identification statute was not a cimt,because w hen the only benefit the individual obtains is to impede the enforcement of the law,the crime does not involve moral turpitude.see also tijani,at t o be inherently fraudulent,a crime must involve knowingly false representation to gain something of value.quoting navarro lopez gonzales,cir en banc.
just as the statute in blanco did not require that the perpetrator obtain a tangible benefit,cpc a and d do not require that the perpetrator obtain anything of value.rather,they require only that the perpetrator use the victim identifying information for an unlawful purpose,or transfer the information with the knowledge that it will be used for an unlawful purpose.indeed,in in re rolando,the defendant was convicted under cpc a after using the victim identifying information to post obscene messages using the victim facebook account.although the defendant in rolando may have enjoyed some personal satisfaction from doing so,he obtained no tangible benefit from his identity theft.accordingly,the rolando defendant did not commit fraud,showing that cpc a has been applied to conduct.
given the express holdings of hagedorn and johnson that no fraudulent intent is required and the fact that a person may violate cpc a and d without obtaining any tangible benefit,we reject the government argument that violations of these subsections are categorical cimts 
cpc a and d do not necessarily involve vile,base,or depraved conduct 
even though violations of cpc a and d are not categorical fraud crimes,they may still be categorical cimts if they involve conduct that is vile,base,or depraved and contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general.see robles urrea,at.preciado relies on rolando,to argue that cpc a has been applied to conduct that was not vile,base,or depraved,and thus her conviction was not categorically a cimt.according to preciado,she established the required realistic probability that the statute was applied to conduct because rolando applied cpc a to conduct that was merely harassing or annoying.although preciado goes too far in describing the conduct at issue in rolando as merely annoying or harassing,in light of existing ninth circuit case law,the bia erred in determining that violations of cpc a and d are categorically vile,base,and depraved.
in rolando,the california court of appeal affirmed the defendant
