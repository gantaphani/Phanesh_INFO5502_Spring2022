factual and procedural background 
zhiqiang hu is a year old native and citizen of china.he testified at his hearing before the immigration judge ij that he had been a machinery mechanic for a mid size nationally owned factory and that he had worked at this factory since december.in the affidavit hu submitted in support of his asylum application,he stated that the factory was very successful,h owever,good profit and sufficient funds encouraged corruption of the factory leadership.hu further stated that factory officials often enjoyed themselves with eating,drinking and giving gifts to their business connections at public expense.hu explained that the factory leadership spent public funds on traveling,sightseeing and took factory property as their own property.hu believed that the factory was heavily in debt because of these corrupt activities.
on march,hu and approximately other workers were laid off from their jobs at the factory and the factory was shut down.the workers were told that the factory was deeply in debt and could not pay their salaries.the workers were promised supplemental pay of and an additional monthly salary depending on each employee work history.
hu testified that these promise s were not kept.hu and two other factory leaders,acting as representatives of the factory workers,wrote two complaint letters to the government agency in charge of the factory to request proper arrangement for the workers.initially,they did not receive a response from the agency,but after further inquiry,were told to wait.
faced with life pressure s,and believing they had no other options,hu and the other two worker representatives organized a group of more than laid off workers to protest in front of the city government building.hu testified that the protestors did not obtain a permit for the demonstration because he believed the government will not issue it.hu testified that on september,he arrived at the government building with the other organizers and workers at about,but the front door was closed tightly.the workers wanted to go into the city government to explain their situation,but the guard would not allow them to enter.the government employees in the building did not come out to see the protestors and they did not allow the protestors to go in side.thus,the group sat quietly in front of the front gate.
hu testified that he believed a guard called the police,telling them that the protestors are here to cause trouble.at about,four police vehicles arrived at the city building and,with police batons in their hands,the police rushed through the crowd of workers and beat the crowd.hu and the other two worker representatives tried to reason with the police,but the police would not talk to them.instead,the police handcuffed them,pushed them into police cars,and took them to the police station,where they were held separately and not given any food or water.
the morning after his arrest,hu was taken in for an interrogation.the police accuse d hu of gathering a crowd to cause trouble and disturb the order of the society.acting against the government and against the communist party.the police tried to get hu to confess to these accusations,but he refused.hu told the police that he was not against the government and did not disturb the order of society.he was just in favor of the legal rights of those laid off workers.a police officer grabbed hu,punched and kicked him,and slapped him in the face.another police officer beat hu with a baton.
hu was placed in a cell with six other people.he testified that the room was locked,had no light,and had only a small window about one square foot in size.hu was detained there for an additional ten days.he was given porridge and pickles to eat,and was only allowed to leave the cell in the morning for personal hygiene.
hu was released after his family and friends paid a guarantee money of rmb as a condition of his release,hu was required to report every tuesday to the police station,and was placed under the supervision of the neighborhood committees.hu stated in his affidavit that if he violated these rules,he would be arrested again.
hu diligently reported weekly to the police.he stated in his affidavit that he was living in terror everyday because he was afraid that he may be arrested again one day.a friend suggested hu flee the country.hu decided to go to the united states and his friend friend handled all matters related to the visa,including filling out hu visa application.on hu visa application,this friend friend stated that the reason for hu travel to the united states was and that he would be traveling with a colleague.at hu consular interview,hu told officials that he was traveling to the united states for business purposes.hu testified before the ij that the information in the visa application regarding his education,employment history,and current employment was false,and that he did not indicate on the visa form that he had been arrested because he believed the chinese government would not allow him to leave the country if he did so.
on april,hu arrived in the united states on a visa that was valid until july.hu wife remained in china with their son,who at the time was very ill with a blood vessel tumor.hu wife informed him that the police visited their house every ten to fourteen days looking for hu.his wife also told hu,no matter what,you can not come back,they have already told us that your charges have been changed.now you are being charged for betraying your country.if you come back,you will surely die.hu testified that he is afraid that he would be persecuted if he is forced to return to china b ecause he was trying to seek the legal benefit of all the laid off workers and their laid off salary pay.hu explained that he is afraid that he would be arrested again and give n even more harsh punishment.
b.the ij and bia decisions 
without citing a single case,the ij denied hu applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.the ij concluded that hu was not credible because his visa application states that he worked as a manager for a company,but hu testified that he had been laid off from his employment.the ij also concluded that hu had failed to establish that he had suffered persecution on account of any of the protected grounds.the entirety of the ij reasoning is as follows 
assuming that the circuit standard for credibility holds that his statements in his declaration are consistent,the respondent was involved in a protest outside a government office for which he did not have authorization.the respondent protested being laid off.however,there is no right to employment or he has not shown that the fact that the factory was closed and that employees were laid off was in any way on account of any of the protected grounds.it was an economic,at best,decision but there is no evidence that this was,in any way,related to a protected ground.therefore,the respondent has failed to establish a nexus between the laying off.as to whether or not the respondent protest is protected,the court finds that it was not and that there is no evidence that hu was participating in any conduct which is protected by the asylum laws.his protest seems to have been an illegal gathering for which he was arrested for disturbing the peace.therefore,he has not established a nexus with that conduct either.having failed to establish a nexus for asylum,he has also failed to establish a nexus for withholding.
finally,the ij concluded that hu had not established a clear probability that he would be tortured and thus also denied hu protection under the cat.
the bia did not explicitly affirm the ij adverse credibility finding,but agree d with the ij determination that the respondent had not established a nexus to a protected ground.the bia explained that e ven if credible,it appears that respondent mistreatment arose solely because of a private dispute which does not qualify him for relief.the bia also rejected hu claim that he was expressing a political opinion because he was a.
according to the bia,hu was not expressing a political opinion during his protest because he was seeking redress for a private employment matter.since hu failed to establish his eligibility for asylum,the bia reasoned that he had failed to satisfy the higher standard required for withholding of removal.finally,the bia concluded that hu had failed to establish that he would likely be tortured by or with the acquiescence of a government official,and therefore denied hu protection under the cat.
ii.standard and scope of review 
we review for substantial evidence the bia decision that an applicant has not established eligibility for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection.see ahmed keisler,cir see also ins elias zacarias,d.we must uphold the bia factual findings if they are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.elias zacarias,at internal quotation marks omitted.legal questions are reviewed de novo.see castillo perez ins,cir.
our r eview is limited to the bia decision,except to the extent the ij opinion is expressly adopted.hosseini gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.t his court can not affirm the bia on a ground upon which it did not rely.doissaint mukasey,cir citing ernesto navas ins,cir.
the bia decision is silent on the issue of credibility,despite the ij explicit adverse credibility finding,so we may assume that the bia found hu to be credible.krotova gonzales,cir we therefore rely on hu testimony and review the determination that hu has not demonstrated a nexus to a protected ground for substantial evidence.
iii.discussion 
to be eligible for a discretionary grant of asylum,hu must prove that he is a refugee namely,that he is an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself of the protection of,his country of nationality because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.
to establish eligibility for asylum based on past persecution,hu must show 
an incident,or incidents,that rise to the level of persecution that is on account of one of the grounds and is committed by the government or forces the government is either unable or unwilling to control.
mengstu holder,cir quoting ernesto navas,at.
the only element at issue in this case is whether hu was harmed on account of a protected ground.to demonstrate a nexus between the harm hu suffered and his political opinion,hu must show that he held,or his persecutors believed that he held,a political opinion and that he was harmed because of that political opinion.baghdasaryan holder,cir citing ernesto navas,at.a political opinion encompasses more than just participation in electoral politics or holding a formal political ideology.see ahmed,at.a political opinion can be an actual opinion held by the applicant,or an opinion imputed to him or her by the persecutor.id.under the real id act of,div.b,stat,hu must show that his actual political opinion or a political opinion his persecutors imputed to him was at least one central reason for his mistreatment b b i see also parussimova mukasey,cir.a motive is a central reason if the persecutor would not have harmed the applicant if such motive did not exist.parussimova,at.there may be more than one central reason,and an asylum applicant is not required to prove which reason is dominant.see id.
hu can establish the motivation of his alleged persecutors by direct or circumstantial evidence.see elias zacarias,at.hu has offered evidence that chinese police officials mistreated him after they accused him of gathering a crowd to cause trouble and disturb the order of the society and a cting against the government and against the communist party.and notably the abuse persisted after he told them that he was not against the government but was merely in favor of the legal rights of those laid off workers.it is not entirely clear if the police were motivated by the political opinion they imputed to hu,or by hu position.either motivation,however,satisfies the nexus requirement because,under these facts,hu position constituted a protected political opinion.
chinese officials imputed an political opinion to hu 
an imputed political opinion is a valid basis for relief.canas segovia ins,cir.w e have repeatedly held that an applicant can establish imputed political opinion based upon the persecutor erroneous belief as to the applicant political affiliation or opinion.kumar gonzales,cir.when an asylum applicant argues he was persecuted because of an imputed political opinion,the focus shifts from the views of the victim to the views of the persecutor.sangha ins,cir.
regardless of whether hu actually held an opinion,the record compels the conclusion that the police imputed an political opinion to hu.they said as much to him hu credibly testified repeatedly that the police accused him of acting against the government and against the communist party.see zhu mukasey,cir concluding that petitioner suffered harm on account of an imputed political opinion,where the chinese police arrested petitioner and accused her of being against the government after she sent a letter to the local town condemning the appointment of her rapist to a position of local political power baghdasaryan,at political opinion was imputed to petitioner where top law enforcement official indicated that petitioner was detained and beaten because he was defaming and raising his head against government corruption.the political opinion chinese officials imputed to hu is a protected ground under our asylum laws.see id.
hu activities constitute a political opinion 
hu was also engaged in protected activity because he held and expressed a political opinion.we have repeatedly recognized that labor speech in many instances can be political.see,zavala bonilla ins,cir acknowledging the political nature of a textile worker participation in her union activities,including a nationwide strike prasad ins,cir concluding that petitioner was persecuted because of his advocacy for the workplace rights of fijians of indian descent and his role as a delegate in the ousted labour party agbuya ins,cir holding company executive was kidnaped based on imputed political opinion stemming from a labor dispute vera valera ins,cir concluding that marxist guerillas imputed a political opinion to labor leader support of a construction project that would benefit the workers at the guerillas expense.
although there is no easy test to determine when a worker or employer action is political as opposed to or in addition to economic our case law makes clear that labor agitation advancing economic interests can nevertheless express a political opinion.
hu engagement in labor speech is especially political because his employer was the government.moreover,his dispute arose not from the normal course of business,but rather from official corruption and deception.hu wrote letters to the government on behalf of the workers,led a protest against the government in front of a government building,and told chinese officials that he was just in favor of the legal rights of those laid off workers because the government refused to pay promised severance benefits to hu and his coworkers after failing to prevent the corruption that left them unemployed.see also mamouzian ashcroft,cir recognizing that petitioner was persecuted on account of her political opinion when she was arrested,detained,and beaten after expressing her opposition to the economic policies of the ruling party as implemented in the factory where she worked.accordingly,there is nothing in the record to support the bia conclusion that hu mistreatment arose solely beca
