mpoyi mitondo,a citizen of the democratic republic of the congo known as zaire between and,arrived in the united states from scotland bearing a french passport.citizens of france do not need visas to enter the united states,and mitondo did not have one.
only cursory checks are made of persons who carry the passports of nations participating in the program.but one of the checks is for the passport legitimacy,and mitondo was detained because a blank bearing the number of the passport he presented had been stolen.he soon confessed that the passport was not his,and that he is not french.his request to stay in the united states has been processed under the approach applicable to those who claim entitlement to enter without visas.before arriving,mitondo had waived any ground other than asylum for remaining in the united states beyond days.see b a.
mitondo contends that he has been persecuted on account of his politics.he supports the union for democracy and social progress union pour la démocratie et le progrès social,or udps,which is on the outs with the ruling people party for reconstruction and democracy.udps is a recognized party with representatives in the legislature,and its leader étienne tshisekedi wa mulumba served three stints as prime minister.but supporters of the udps sometimes receive rough handling from the police during political demonstrations.mitondo testified that he endured ghastly treatment during may,after joseph kabila,congo president,postponed scheduled elections.the udps called a general strike,and mitondo says that during a demonstration in he was arrested,thrown into a filthy cell where his hands were tied behind his back and a hood kept over his head,beaten four times,and then sent to the fields for forced which he escaped after two weeks.mitondo met roman catholic priests who helped him to escape to zambia,where a second group of priests provided him with tickets and false documentation that enabled him to reach glasgow,receive the stolen passport,and enter the united states equipped with a voucher for prepaid stay at a youth hostel in chicago.
the immigration judge accepted mitondo claim to membership in the udps a claim backed up by the party records and affidavits from its officials but was skeptical about the story of his detention and beatings in may.the voucher had been issued in glasgow to a mitondo,the same name on the passport,before mitondo had escaped from his captors and thus before he could have met the whom he has supplied no details.asked to explain how this could be so,mitondo replied i do know how they arranged these travel documents or how they arranged any,any of this.
after a continuation so that both sides could gather additional evidence,mitondo memory improved.now he testified that the person in glasgow who gave him the documents told him that a vital mitondo had planned to travel to the united states but had backed out.mpoyi photograph then replaced vital on the passport,and mpoyi claimed to be vital in order to use the voucher.the ij was skeptical of this story and continued the hearing to allow forensic examination of the passport.an expert concluded that the document was free from any conclusive physical evidence indicating data entry alteration,page substitution,or.in other words,mpoyi photo was the first to have been placed on the stolen blank.mitondo had no explanation for this,which demolished his revised story.
the ij then denied mitondo application for asylum,finding that he was willing to lie to enter the united concedes as much in light of the bogus claim of french had lied about the events of may in particular.alsagladi gonzales,cir fraud in obtaining entry to the united states is a good reason to reject a request for asylum.the ij relied on three particular discrepancies first,the hostel voucher was issued before mitondo claims to have met the priests second,mitondo testimony that he took over travel documents from someone else is inconsistent with his earlier sworn statement that he had no idea how the documentation was arranged third,the forensic evidence undercut mitondo second story about how his surname and picture came to be on the stolen passport.the board of immigration appeals affirmed.
jurisdiction is the first question.because mitondo was placed in proceedings following his failed effort to enter the united states,no formal order of removal has been entered.a court of appeals reviews final orders of removal,a,but,for reasons given in jiménez viracacha mukasey,cir,an order that is proper only if the alien is removable implies an order of removal.at least three other courts of appeals have reached the same conclusion and have held that there is jurisdiction to review the final disposition of an proceeding.see shehu attorney general,cir kanacevic ins,cir nreka attorney general,cir.
mitondo principal argument is that the agency decision is not supported by substantial evidence,because the problems that the ij identified do not go to the heart of his claim for asylum.many decisions,in this and other circuits,state that inconsistencies on minor details do not justify disbelief of an alien claim to have suffered persecution.see,giday gonzales,cir.mitondo observes that none of the ij reasons concerns the events that he maintains occurred in in may.some other evidence in the record suggests that a crackdown on udps members began in june,and the documents that mitondo presented to establish his membership in the udps do not show his presence in during may though they do establish his activities on behalf of the party in earlier months.but the ij did not mention these problems and so,mitondo maintains,the judiciary ca rely on them either.see sec chenery.sec chenery.
dissatisfied with judicial reluctance to accept immigration judges credibility decisions,congress enacted this provision in as part of the real id act 
considering the totality of the circumstances,and all relevant factors,a trier of fact may base a credibility determination on the demeanor,candor,or responsiveness of the applicant or witness,the inherent plausibility of the applicant or witness account,the consistency between the applicant or witness written and oral statements whenever made and whether or not under oath,and considering the circumstances under which the statements were made,the internal consistency of each such statement,the consistency of such statements with other evidence of record including the reports of the department of state on country conditions,and any inaccuracies or falsehoods in such statements,without regard to whether an inconsistency,inaccuracy,or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant claim,or any other relevant factor.there is no presumption of credibility,however,if no adverse credibility determination is explicitly made,the applicant or witness shall have a rebuttable presumption of credibility on appeal.
b b iii.this subsection applies only to claims for asylum made after may,see stat,and mitondo application is the first time this circuit has been required to apply the new law.
this statute abrogates decisions that focus on whether an inconsistency,inaccuracy,or falsehood goes to the heart of the applicant claim.it also specifies that t here is no presumption of credibility.beyond that,the statute requires courts to use in immigration proceedings the same deferential approach traditionally applied to credibility findings in labor cases and other administrative controversies.see,universal camera nlrb.elliott cftc,cir.
asylum cases pose thorny challenges in evaluating testimony.applicants regularly tell horrific stories that,if true,show past persecution and a risk of worse to come.but these stories rarely are susceptible to documentary proof,because persecutors do publish records of their misdeeds.though they sometimes keep such records,they remain secret until the regime has fallen.countries that oppress their citizens may be disordered in other that,for example,medical records are unreliable,and victims can not use them to demonstrate injuries received at the hands of police,or may record events in ways that complicate interpretation for example,whether an abortion w
