in both this appeal as well as in rodriguez sanchez holder,which we dispose of in a separate memorandum disposition filed simultaneously with this opinion,the petitioners seek,inter alia,to reopen their immigration proceedings by raising challenges to,or seeking an exception to,the april,deadline to seek relief under former section c of the immigration and nationality act ina established by special motion to seek section c relief for aliens who pleaded guilty or nolo contendere to certain crimes before april.we hold that deadline to file special motions to reopen is a procedural rule and that absent some exceptional circumstances,not present here,petitioners that miss the deadline are not entitled to relief from that deadline.
because the petitioner contentions turn,in part,on the evolution of the availability of c relief,we first briefly review that history.the immigration act of act excluded from admission into the united states several classes of aliens,including those who had committed crimes involving moral turpitude.ins cyr,quoting stat.the attorney general,however,was given discretion to admit an otherwise excludable alien where the alien was returning after a temporary absence to an unrelinquished domicile of seven years.id.
the immigration and nationality act of ina replaced the act,but retained the act moral turpitude exclusion and also retained,in ina c,the secretary of labor discretionary authority to admit an otherwise excludable alien where the alien was returning after a temporary absence to an unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years.id.at.congress subsequently transferred this authority to the department of justice,and thus,the attorney general.id.at.specifically,from its enactment in through,c of the ina gave the attorney general broad discretion to admit an otherwise excludable alien if the alien temporarily departed the united states voluntarily and sought to return to lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years.id.at quoting c.
from to,congress limited the attorney general discretion and narrowed the availability of c relief by denying waivers of exclusion of admissibility to felons who had served a term of imprisonment of at least five years.see immigration act of,stat,when the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa was enacted on april,congress further restricted the scope of c relief by denying it to any alien who had been convicted of an aggravated felony or crimes of moral turpitude.see aedpa,d,stat.
furthermore,when the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira was enacted,c relief was replaced by the narrower form of relief,cancellation of removal.see iirira,stat.cancellation of removal,as established by of iirira,permits the attorney general to cancel removal of an alien who has been a lawful permanent resident for not less than five years,has resided continuously in the united states for seven years after having been admitted,and has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.becker gonzales,cir quoting iirira a,a.
however,in,the supreme court held that c relief remained available to aliens who pleaded guilty to waivable criminal offenses before iirira effective date in reliance on the availability of c relief.cyr,at holding that c relief remains available for petitioners whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who,notwithstanding those convictions,would have been eligible for c relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.on september,the department of justice executive office for immigration review eoir issued a final rule regarding procedures and deadlines for filing motions to reopen to apply for c relief based on the supreme court decision in cyr.see,wl.the final rule became effective on october,and set a deadline of april,to file a special motion to reopen for c relief.see h.
against this background,we turn to the facts and allegations at issue in this petition.
juan carlos tapia luna tapia is a native and citizen of mexico who was admitted to the united states on or about may,as an immigrant.in september of,tapia was convicted in a california state court after pleading guilty to receiving stolen property in violation of section a of the california penal code.he was sentenced to one year and four months in prison.because of this conviction,on december,the former immigration and naturalization service ins commenced removal proceedings against him.tapia was charged with removability pursuant to a a i,for having committed a crime of moral turpitude within five years of admission,and for having been convicted of an aggravated felony offense.
on december,the immigration judge ij found tapia removable as charged.tapia did not apply for relief from removal,waived his right to appeal,and was ordered removed to mexico.although tapia claims that he never actually left the united states,his departure was witnessed by a deportation officer in december.
on an unknown date after being removed,tapia appears to have illegally reentered the united states.in february of,tapia,through the law firm that represents him in this petition paid the filing fee for a motion to reopen his immigration proceedings and filed an i form,application for advance permission to return to unrelinquished domicile,in which he asserted he had maintained residences in california from through the date the i form was filed tapia thereafter filed the motion to reopen in august of.
in his august motion,tapia argued that in the december removal proceeding the ij violated his due process rights by not advising him of his right to seek c relief tapia recognized that he had missed the april,deadline for filing a special motion to reopen to request c relief,but sought equitable tolling of the deadline and an order estopping the government from removing him.
regarding his eligibility for c relief,tapia alleged that he was eligible in because by then he had over seven years of domicile in the united states and he had not been charged with an aggravated felony.he argued that the ij erred in failing to advise him of his eligibility for c relief,and therefore,equitable tolling of the deadline for filing a motion to reopen was proper.he also asserted that his failure to file a special motion to reopen by the april,deadline should be equitably tolled because he was not informed of his right to seek c relief by his counsel until approximately july,and he then filed the motion to reopen within days of that date.
the ij denied tapia motion to reopen on october.although the motion was styled as a motion to reopen to the bia,because the thrust of tapia argument was that he was entitled to c relief,the ij treated tapia motion as a special motion to reopen.the ij first found that tapia claim that he had not been charged as an aggravated felon was clearly in error,and that tapia was removable based on both his aggravated felony conviction and the fact that receiving stolen property is a crime of moral turpitude.in addition,the ij determined that there was no affirmative misconduct by the ij in,noting that tapia was not eligible for c relief at that time because he was not given permanent legal resident status until may,and thus had not accrued the requisite seven years of domicile in when he entered his plea.
the ij also concluded that tapia was not eligible for c relief at the time of his removal hearing in because c had been repealed.further,the ij concluded that he could not have informed tapia of the motion to reopen filing deadline in because the regulation establishing that time limit had not yet been promulgated.also,the ij noted that denial was warranted because,although tapia denied it,if what tapia indicated in his i form was true,he illegally reentered the united states shortly after he was removed in.
finally,the ij denied tapia motion to reopen on the basis that it was untimely.tapia missed the april,deadline for filing a special motion to reopen because he did not file a motion until august of.the ij rejected tapia assertion that he filed his motion to reopen within days of learning of his right to seek relief from his counsel.the ij,noting numerous e
