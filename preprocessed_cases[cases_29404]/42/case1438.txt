opinion of the court 
this is a petition by garegin ambartsoumian garegin,his wife nadia ambartsoumian nadia,and their two children,for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia denying them asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture.it is,in a way,a tale of two ukraine and georgia.garegin is a georgian citizen of armenian and ossetian parentage.nadia is a ukrainian citizen and a baptist.the ambartsoumians married in the ukraine in,and spent much of the next three years shuttling back and forth between their two native countries.they arrived in the united states in,after a sojourn in canada,and applied for asylum,claiming that they had faced persecution in both ukraine and georgia and would be persecuted in either country if obliged to return.
the case for persecution in the ukraine is extremely weak.it is largely predicated on events that took place,and on policies and attitudes that existed,before the breakup of the soviet union and the establishment of an independent ukraine.except for an alleged beating in and a putative attempt to kidnap the ambartsoumians children in,the record includes nothing more than sporadic veiled threats and a lack of economic opportunity in the ukraine.the ambartsoumians did adduce evidence that the climate in the ukraine is inhospitable to armenians.however,the record,including state department reports on country conditions,reflects a total change in the governmental policies of the ukraine since,and nothing in the record suggests that the ambartsoumians would now be persecuted in the ukraine for either their ethnicity or their religious beliefs.
the case for persecution in georgia seems more complicated in light of the fluid political situation in the north caucasus and the continuing tensions in abkhazia and south ossetia the record contains evidence that in the ambartsoumians received death threats from georgian nationalists that in both nadia and garegin were badly beaten and that in,upon his return from ukraine,an attempt was made to conscript garegin into the georgian army.however,the ambartsoumians principal contention before us,supported by an expert professor specializing in the history and politics of the that ethnic hostility toward armenians and religious hostility toward christians would now render the ambartsoumians subject to persecution in georgia.
the latest state department country report in the record,for,counters the expert opinion.we therefore asked the parties to comment on the adequacy of the administrative record,given the current situation in georgia,in light of our opinions in berishaj ashcroft,cir,and gambashidze ashcroft,cir.in these cases,we expressed our concerns about being forced to use stale administrative records to decide petitions seeking to avoid deportation to countries of origin where asylum applicants might be persecuted.
in response to our request for comment,the attorney general reported that the department of justice has responded to berishaj by implementing a new procedure pursuant to which the office of immigration litigation oil,in consultation with its client agencies,now screens out and seeks to remand cases where records are out of date and not appropriate for judicial review.all oil attorneys have been instructed to consider whether the record in each case assigned to them is so out of date as to justify a remand.if the record is stale,the oil attorney is to bring the case to the attention of the director of oil,who may seek a remand as a matter of discretion.the factors that oil will use in assessing old records include whether there have been pertinent,intervening events in the country of removal and whether the issues on review are time sensitive in that changes in conditions over time may affect the resolution of the issues.the full text of the procedures are set forth in the appendix to this opinion.we commend the attorney general and oil on this reform.
notwithstanding the new procedures,the oil concluded that the record in this case does not warrant a remand to the bia.concomitantly,the ambartsoumians counsel,at oral argument,agreed that the record before the agency was sufficient for this court to consider,although he argued that it compelled us to reject the ij findings.since both parties seem to agree that the staleness of the record does not present any difficulties here,we reach the merits of the persecution claims.
the government submits that the record does not compel the conclusion that there was past persecution,or that the ambartsoumians will face persecution if returned to georgia.for the reasons that follow,we agree.as will appear,important to this conclusion are the facts that the ambartsoumians expert,ronald suny,was too general and to overcome the country report account of greatly improved conditions for armenians in georgia suny acknowledged that the situation in georgia had significantly improved and that the government was not a likely persecutor and the real problem was only that georgia was a weak state where armenians are not popular.
for these reasons,the petition for review will be denied.
i.the legal framework 
the attorney general may,in his discretion,grant asylum to any alien if he determines that the alien is a refugee.b.to demonstrate that he or she is a refugee,an asylum applicant must establish that he or she is unable or unwilling to return to his or her native country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.a showing of past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of a fear of future persecution.b.the burden of proving persecution is on the asylum applicant.a.
the ambartsoumians application for withholding of removal is based upon b a,which forbids removal if the alien life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.to qualify for withholding of removal,the applicant must show that it is more likely than not that he will face persecution if he is deported.li wu lin ins,cir citing ins,d.this standard is stricter than the fear standard for asylum.because we find that the ambartsoumians are not eligible for asylum,we need not consider their eligibility for withholding of removal under this stricter standard.see shardar ashcroft,cir.
the standard for cat protection is different from that for asylum or withholding of removal it requires proof that the applicant is more likely than not to be tortured,c,but does not require any showing that the torture is on account of any protected ground.see lukwago ashcroft,cir.
the immigration judge denied the ambartsoumians requests for relief,but granted them voluntary departure.the board of immigration appeals affirmed without opinion,pursuant to e therefore,we review only the decision of the immigration judge.gao ashcroft,cir.our review is limited by the substantial evidence standard,which states that the administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.the determination that an asylum applicant faced past persecution,or has a fear of future persecution,is a factual conclusion subject to this deferential review.gao,at.we therefore must uphold the ij findings if they are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d.
the immigration judge ij heard testimony from garegin and nadia ambartsoumian,and from their expert witness,suny.he also reviewed the department of state country reports for georgia and ukraine for,and the state department asylum profiles for those countries.he relied heavily on the objective evidence of these reports.this reliance was justifiable,as we have held that state department reports may constitute substantial evidence for the purposes of reviewing immigration decisions.kayembe ashcroft,cir lal ins,cir describing state department country reports as the most appropriate and perhaps best resource on country conditions.
based on the record,the ij determined that the ambartsoumians had failed to establish a fear of persecution in either georgia or the ukraine.we examine his decision as to each of these countries in turn.
ii.the ukraine 
nadia ambartsoumian claims that she was persecuted in the ukraine because of her baptist faith.her father,nikolai boyko,was a baptist preacher who was imprisoned and exiled to siberia during the soviet era.nadia suffered for her father beliefs as a child,she was interrogated by the kgb and abused by her classmates,and she lived with her father in siberia for three years.nikolai boyko was in siberia until.
garegin and nadia met in in odessa,ukraine,nadia birthplace,while garegin was on a work assignment.they married in,and returned to garegin homeland,but soon moved back to ukraine to escape ethnic tensions in georgia.garegin at first found work in odessa,but alleges that he was harassed and eventually fired because of his nationality.he claims that the ukrainian courts refused to help him and that he was unable to find any other permanent employment.ukraine,too,was suffused with ethnic nationalism,and garegin claims that the family was repeatedly threatened and insulted.in,garegin was beaten by ukrainian nationalists,and decided to return to georgia so as not to put his family at risk.
he returned to the ukraine later that year.he claims that he stayed in hiding in his wife house for two months,apparently because he was in the ukraine illegally.eventually,the police raided his house,arrested him,beat him,and told him that this treatment would continue unless he left the ukraine.he also claims that someone attempted to kidnap the couple two children,and that nadia was beaten and threatened because of her husband.he once again returned to georgia in,but quickly came back to the ukraine to avoid serving in the georgian army.on garegin return,neighbors again attacked and threatened the ambartsoumians,and nadia suffered a miscarriage after one such attack.
the ambartsoumians left the ukraine for canada in.while in canada,they applied for refugee status.they left canada for the united states in,before canadian officials had taken final action on their asylum application.they surrendered to immigration authorities in champlain,ny,and requested asylum.
the above facts and allegations suggest two possible bases for the claim of persecution in the ukraine,each of which the ij rejected.
first,nadia claims that she suffered persecution because of her religious background.the ij agreed that nadia family was persecuted during the soviet era.but he found that nadia herself did not suffer the same degree of persecution as her father,and that the ukraine was much more hospitable to baptists.
there is substantial evidence in the record to support this conclusion.the state department asylum profile states that the communists repressed evangelical christians,but that w ith the overthrow of the communist regime in,evangelicals are no longer denied religious freedom and they worship without interference.ukraine asylum profile.the country report notes some instances of discrimination against evangelicals,but nothing that would rise to the level of persecution.ukraine country report.and nadia ambartsoumian admitted during the asylum hearing that her parents and four of her siblings still live in the ukraine and practice the baptist faith,and presented no evidence that they are currently persecuted for their beliefs.in fact,though she said that her father had not received permission to buy a house of prayer,she admitted that he currently has a church in odessa.reading the record as a whole,we find no compelling reason to reverse the ij finding that nadia ambartsoumian does not have a fear of persecution in the ukraine 
second,garegin claims that he and his family suffered persecution because he was not a native ukrainian.the only evidence for this was the ambartsoumians own testimony.the ij again relied on the state department reports,which indicate that the ukraine nationality policy meet s international standards required for the protection of minority groups,ukraine asylum profile,although they also describe f requent harassment of racial minorities,especially asian and african minorities.ukraine country report.while this state department evidence may be equivocal,the ij was entitled to draw from it the conclusion that armenians do not face persecution in the ukraine,see kayembe,at,and there is no significant evidence in the record to the contrary.
moreover,the ij found that garegin troubles in the ukraine stemmed not from his ethnicity but from his lack of official permission to live and work in that country.this finding,too,is well supported.both garegin and nadia own testimony could be read as indicating that garegin was unable to work,and was harassed by the police,mainly because he had failed to obtain proper legal documents and permissions.garegin testified that he was fired from his job b ecause i not a permanent resident of the ukraine.and plus,i am armenian.he later testified that he lived in hiding in his wife house because people had told him that he was in the ukraine illegally.nadia gave several reasons for her husband inability to get a job,including that he speaks no ukrainian and that he lacked a propiska,or residency permit.from this testimony the ij could reasonably have concluded that garegin was not persecuted for his nationality,but rather that he had legal difficulties due to his own failure to obtain the proper permissions.there is no evidence in the record to suggest that garegin ever sought legal status in the ukraine,as explained in the margin,or that he would have been prevented from doing so because of his nationality garegin difficulties with his employers and with the police certainly do not amount to ethnic persecution if they were due only to his own failure to follow ukrainian residency and labor laws.see janusiak ins,cir.thus the evidence as a whole does not compel the conclusion that garegin suffered persecution in the ukraine.
iii.georgia 
to prove that they were persecuted in georgia,the ambartsoumians presented their own testimony and that of an expert witness.their testimony indicates that they faced serious difficulties during the generally short periods that they spent in georgia.
garegin was born in tbilisi,georgia,and is a georgian citizen.he is ethnically armenian and ossetian,and is an armenian christian,but he has visited armenia only once,as a child.he claims that,because of his armenian heritage,he was harassed and beaten while growing up in georgia,and while serving as a conscript in the soviet army.after meeting nadia in the ukraine,garegin returned with her to tbilisi in.with ethnic tensions on the rise in georgia,the couple claims that they received death threats,and that nadia was beaten by neighbors because they were not ethnic georgians.as discussed above,they left for the ukraine,but garegin returned to georgia in because of difficulties he encountered during his short time in the ukraine.
when he returned to georgia,garegin found a nation divided by the civil war in the region of south ossetia.as his mother was ossetian by nationality,his family was in hiding,apparently afraid of feeling among georgians.fearful for his own safety,garegin returned to the ukraine.again,his stay in the ukraine did not last long,and garegin once again returned to georgia early in.this time,when he arrived at the tbilisi airport,he was conscripted into the georgian army to fight in the civil war in the abkhazia region.he immediately was put on a bus to the front,but managed to escape that night,and fled back to the ukraine.
the ambartsoumians also presented the report and testimony of ronald suny,a professor at the university of chicago and an expert on modern georgian and armenian history and politics.suny testified that president zviad gamsakhurdia policy of georgia for the georgians had led to serious problems for armenians in the early he also noted that armenians became unpopular during georgia civil conflict in abkhazia,because they were perceived as having sided with the abkhazians.but suny acknowledged that conditions in g
