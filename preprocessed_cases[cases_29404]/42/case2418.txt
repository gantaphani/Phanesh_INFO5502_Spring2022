on february,an immigration judge ij denied ahmad tarraf applications for asylum,withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture cat and ordered him removed from the united states.tarraf appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia or board,which adopted and affirmed the decision of the ij on june.tarraf filed a petition for review in this court on july.for the reasons stated in this opinion,we deny the petition for review.
backgrounda.facts and immigration court proceedings 
tarraf is a native and citizen of lebanon.since entering the united states unlawfully through mexico in,tarraf has married a united states citizen they have two daughters,also united states citizens after a traffic stop in october,tarraf was brought to the attention of immigration authorities,was arrested and placed in removal proceedings.before the ij,he conceded removability on the basis of his unlawful presence,but requested asylum,withholding of removal and cat relief.
according to his testimony at the removal hearing,tarraf fears persecution by hezbollah,a group the state department reports describe as an muslim faction that undermine s the central government of lebanon at.he claims that hezbollah both has accused him of being an israeli collaborator or spy and has recruited him aggressively to join its cause.tarraf contends that,because neither he nor his family has acquiesced to these demands,they have been repeated targets of threats and violence committed by hezbollah.
prior to his merits hearing,tarraf submitted an asylum application with the assistance of counsel.he attached limited supporting documents,including a brief statement that provided certain details regarding his claim as well as a letter from his older brother that purported to corroborate tarraf history with hezbollah.
at his removal hearing,tarraf testified,in support of his requests for relief,about three main incidents.first,he stated that his brother,mohsen tarraf,was killed by hezbollah in.the record included a copy of mohsen death certificate written in arabic,but the translation included in the record only states his name,village and date of death,without any information about the cause.tarraf testimony itself provided few other details.he said only that his brother drove a taxi and that hezbollah tried to send stuff with him he testified both that hezbollah did not pay mohsen and that mohsen declined to take stuff from them and then they killed him.at.according to tarraf,because of his brother death,he left lebanon in fear of hezbollah.see id.at.he began living and working primarily in c么te,but returned to lebanon for periods of one to two months almost every year thereafter until 
according to tarraf,the second incident occurred on his return home to lebanon in.he testified that he went to visit his ill mother in her home in maaroub,an hour and a half outside of beirut.he stated that he traveled to the house at night,and,while he was there,hezbollah came looking for him.they came to the door and spoke to his father,asking whether ahmad was home and whether they could speak with him.tarraf father apparently sent them away,and tarraf waited in the home for two hours before attempting to leave.as he headed for his car,they called to him,and he tried to run away.he stated that they threw a grenade at him and that they shot him in the leg and in the back.afterwards,he was taken to a hezbollah clinic where he stayed for three days.when he was asked why hezbollah had targeted him,he told the court,they want me to work for them and i used to travel a lot and they used say i a spy for israel.id.at.tarraf stated that he told them that he agreed to work for them and was allowed to leave the hospital,but that he immediately headed for beirut where he left again for africa.
tarraf also stated that,after this incident,he continued to travel back and forth between c么te and lebanon.although he was not sure whether he had returned to lebanon in,he did return in to become engaged and again in around the time of his marriage.he told the court that,on this trip,hezbollah knew that he was there and,therefore,he ran away again to c么te.id.at.tarraf claimed that hezbollah was looking for him because they wanted him to work for them and that people in his neighborhood would inform hezbollah on each of his returns to lebanon.id.at.on these return trips,he stayed with his wife family or with friends in order to avoid hezbollah.
tarraf stayed in c么te until turmoil within that country forced his return to lebanon in for a period of five months thereafter,he went briefly to france,and returned again to lebanon.in november,tarraf traveled to syria and then to mexico,where he attempted to enter the united states.he claims that mexican officials would not allow his travel to the united states from mexico city,and so again he returned to lebanon and remained there for a year and a half.
finally,tarraf testified about an incident that occurred just before his actual arrival in the united states.he claimed that,in april of,hezbollah again came looking for him.he stated that he moved from house to house while in lebanon,but that hezbollah members found him and arrested him at a friend house.he stated that they held him for one month until he agreed to work with them upon prodding from the ij about what occurred during this period of detention,he testified that hezbollah beat him up so bad everywhere.id.at.he escaped and traveled to mexico from there he entered the united states.tarraf stated that,since he had arrived in the united states,his apartment in lebanon had been confiscated by hezbollah and his nephew had been killed by them.id.at.he testified that hezbollah continued to look for him,asking even his seven daughter if she knew where he was.he stated that,if he was returned,he feared that hezbollah was j ust going to torture him and torture him.id.at.
the ij attempted to clarify with tarraf why he believed that hezbollah had targeted him for the intense recruiting he had described.in response,tarraf stated,t hey wanted me to execute some operation for them,could be in israel or anywhere outside lebanon and they said they pay me any amount of money but i declined.id.at.the ij pressed tarraf on why hezbollah wanted him in particular,and he stated,i did have any training of any kind or anything i used to travel a lot.it was easier for me to get visas wherever i want to go.id.at.the ij asked why hezbollah would assault him as part of an attempt to recruit him,and tarraf responded,they just keep beating me up until i agree.id.at.
when tarraf had finished his substantive testimony,the ij confronted him with inconsistencies between his live testimony and the statements in his asylum application that had been prepared with the assistance of the same attorney who represented him at the hearing.see id.at.specifically,the ij noted that tarraf written statement said that he had been captured by hezbollah in while at his parents house,although at his hearing he repeatedly had testified that he was at his friend house.the ij also noted that the written statement indicated that he had been held for three days,not one month,as tarraf had maintained in court.finally,the ij questioned him regarding the varying descriptions of his detention in his written statement,tarraf indicated that hezbollah had questioned and pressured him during this time,but he made no mention of any physical abuse,although at his hearing tarraf testified several times that he was repeatedly beaten and tortured.tarraf stated that perhaps translation difficulties troubled the earlier statement,but that he stood behind his testimony relating to his detention in.see id.at.the ij noted that his attorney speaks arabic and seemed to question whether that explanation was plausible.
b.the decision of the ij 
the ij denied tarraf requests for asylum,withholding of removal and cat relief.
first,with respect to his asylum claim,he noted that tarraf had filed his application more than one year after entering the country and had not demonstrated changed or exceptional circumstances to overcome the statutory bar in a b.
turning to his claim for withholding of removal,the ij reviewed tarraf testimony.he noted the claims of his brother murder in and of the incident in which tarraf was shot,but continued,despite his refusal to support the hezbollah,he continued to return to lebanon every year without great difficulty,including one stretch of more than a year shortly before leaving for the united states in.at.the ij noted that his final departure followed,according to tarraf,an arrest and detention of a month,during which time he was beaten and pressured to join hezbollah he also noted that tarraf believed that he would be harmed or killed for his continued refusal to cooperate with hezbollah.
after reviewing the government objections to relief,the ij determined that tarraf applications should be denied.he concluded that tarraf testimony was not credible and that he had failed to explain the discrepancies or provide corroborative evidence or detailed facts affect ing his credibility and also prevent ing him from meeting his standard of proof.id.at.
on the credibility issue,the ij noted that a petitioner testimony alone can establish the basis for asylum,but must be detailed,credible and persuasive,all of which he found lacking in this case.the ij stated that,if tarraf had feared persecution since when his brother was killed,his repeated trips to lebanon undercut his claimed fear.the ij next considered the incident in which tarraf testified that he had been shot by hezbollah while leaving his parents home.the ij noted that tarraf had been taken by the shooters to receive medical treatment and was permitted to leave the clinic without incident.the ij further observed that tarraf had provided virtually no details in his description of this event.again,the ij noted that he returned home on numerous occasions following the incident.under these circumstances,the ij concluded that this incident did not support a finding that hezbollah sought to harm tarraf.
more significant to the credibility issue,according to the ij,were the drastic discrepancies between the written application and the testimony,specifically in regard to the final claimed incident in.id.at.given that tarraf had left lebanon permanently in response to this final incident,the ij concluded that the discrepancies went to the heart of tarraf credibility and his claim.id.the ij did not believe that it made sense that the most serious allegations of persecution were not presented or were grossly understated in tarraf written application submitted before trial.therefore,the ij concluded that tarraf in c ourt contention that he was held for one month and tortured by hezbollah was simply not credible in light of this inconsistency.id.at.
the ij went on to state that,even if tarraf was shot in and detained in for the shorter period of three days that he had described in his written application,those incidents did not rise to the level of past persecution.the ij ruled that,if tarraf had been shot in,the circumstances surrounding the injury as described remain unclear.id.at.the detention and questioning without any evidence that he was seriously injured,that he needed medical attention or hospitalization following his detention did not support a finding of past persecution.id.
having found no past persecution,and finding that the fear of future persecution rested on the testimony regarding past events that he had ruled was exaggerated and false,the ij stated that tarraf had not shown that it was more likely than not that he would be persecuted if returned.id.because he already had determined that the testimony was not credible,the ij further stated that the absence of corroborative evidence was fatal to tarraf claim.the ij denied the claim for cat relief on the same basis.
c.the decision of the bia 
the board adopted and affirmed the decision of the ij.in its of analysis,the board stated only that it concurred that no exception to the deadline for asylum applications applied it did not find the ij adverse credibility finding clearly erroneous on the record presented to it and it agreed with the ij that the specific inconsistency between the statement and the testimony was material,as it related to the length of his alleged detention and the severity of his treatment,which suggests that he is attempting to embellish the basis for his asylum claim.id.at.the board agree d with the ij that this inconsistency goes to the heart of tarraf claim and undermines his credibility.id.accordingly,the board dismissed the appeal.
tarraf timely petitioned for review in this court,pursuing only his claims for withholding of removal and cat relief 
discussion 
because the bia adopted and affirmed the opinion of the ij,we review the ij decision as supplemented by any discussion in the bia opinion.mema gonzales,cir.tarraf raises three challenges to the decision of the ij and bia first,he claims that the ij applied an incorrect standard in making his adverse credibility determination.next,he claims that the ij conclusion that he did not suffer past persecution was error.finally,he claims that the ij erred in denying summarily his claim for cat relief.
we review a decision denying withholding of removal and cat relief under the deferential substantial evidence standard.boci gonzales,cir pavlyk gonzales,cir.under this standard,we shall grant the petition only when the record compels the conclusion that the alien was entitled to the relief sought.boci,at.an alien seeking withholding of removal bears the burden of demonstrating a clear probability that he will face persecution if removed.shmyhelskyy gonzales,cir citing ins stevic,d.the question under the clear probability standard is whether it is more likely than not that the alien would be subject to persecution.ins stevic,d.the standard for establishing entitlement to cat relief is similarly stringent.gomes gonzales,cir noting that,to obtain cat relief,an alien must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if removed.with these general constraints on our review in mind,we now examine each of tarraf claims.
credibility determination 
tarraf claims that the ij focused on only two discrepancies and therefore failed to consider the totality of circumstances in making an adverse credibility determination.appellant br.at.
credibility determinations are factual findings that we review deferentially.shmyhelskyy,at.we shall uphold an adverse credibility determination if the record,considered as a whole,does not compel a conclusion to the contrary.feto gonzales,cir citing kenyeres ashcroft,d lin ashcroft,cir.we will not overturn adverse credibility determinations simply because the evidence might support an alternate finding.kllokoqi gonzales,cir see also giday gonzales,cir noting that an adverse credibility determination can not be reversed simply because this court would conclude that a positive credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence.nevertheless,this court also has stated that it will not hesitate to overturn an adverse credibility determination when the ij fails to give specific,cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.ayi gonzales,cir.we thus have reversed when the discrepancies were minor,adekpe gonzales,cir,when they concerned irrelevant details in light of the alien broader claim of persecution,see kllokoqi,at reversing the credibility determination where the number of traumatic and tragic events that have happened to the alien made his lack of memory on the name of a high school he attended a decade earlier insufficient to support the finding,or when the ij failed to consider the alien reasonable explanations offered for a discrepancy,see shtaro gonzales,cir faulting an ij for failing to attempt to ascertain whether the discrepancies could be accounted for.
we further have noted that the failure to mention,in an asylum application,certain details that later appear in live testimony does not render an alien testimony per se incredible.capric ashcroft,cir citing ins,cir.we repeatedly have stated,however,that when an ij adverse credibility determination is based on inconsistencies between an alien earlier statements and his testimony at his hearing that go to the heart of his claim,that are substantive and that are not easily explained or superficial,we shall uphold the adverse determination 
the discrepancies in this case concern the most serious allegations of persecution,and,indeed,relate to one of only two events tarraf described in which he personally was targeted.tarraf testimony was that he was taken from his friend home,detained,severely beaten,tortured and interrogated for a period of thirty days before he finally relented to his captors demands that he join hezbollah.his asylum application,by contrast,had stated that he was taken from his parents home and detained and questioned for three days he had made no mention of any physical violence or torture in his asylum application.
the bia found that the changed accounts constituted an attempt by tarraf to embellish his claim.at.the record,considered in whole,does not compel a contrary conclusion.the changed account substantially alters the length and severity of the critical incident that tarraf says precipitated his final journey to the united states.in addition,although not mentioned by the ij in his decision,a letter submitted along with the asylum application from tarraf brother states,they found you and put you in the prison dey sic until you agreed to work with them.at last you escaped to america at.to the extent that the letter corroborates any part of tarraf claim,it supports the version of events the ij ultimately credited and considered,a detention under less severe conditions than those alleged in tarraf testimony.the ij additional determination that tarraf description of events lacked sufficient detail further supports the ij credibility finding.see balogun ashcroft,cir noting that,among relevant considerations in determining credibility are internal consistency and level of detail.tarraf description of the major events involved in his claim was perfunctory even when pressed for details,tarraf said only that he was tortured very badly or so beaten up,at.
finally,tarraf suggests that the ij erred in declining to credit his explanation that perhaps language difficulties contributed to errors in the original statement.the ij did not fail to inquire into the reasons for the discrepancy,see uwase ashcroft,cir,and tarraf gives no explanation of why the ij should have been required to credit his explanation,especially where,as here,the ij noted that tarraf was represented by the same attorney both at the time of his application and his hearing.see at see also feto,at the ij was not,however,compelled to accept the alien explanation for the plain inconsistencies in his story.chen gonzales,cir noting that,although s ignificant discrepancies among different versions of an alien statement are generally a permissible basis for an adverse credibility decision,initial asylum applications should not always be considered completely reliable,particularly when filled out without the assistance of counsel emphasis added.tarraf apparent language difficulties may have contributed,in some measure,to the discrepancies between the different versions of his story this possibility,however,does not mean that it was impermissible for the ij to conclude that the character of the particular discrepancies in issue should weigh against the petitioner.
the ij credibility analysis also mentions tarraf repeated trips back into lebanon following his brother alleged murder and the shooting incident in.the ij opinion states that this travel undercut tarraf credibility concerning his fear.at.a proposition that any voluntary return to one home country renders any claim regarding past and future persecution incredible would be far too broad a proposition to serve as a working rule for assessing an alien testimony.although we have recognized that return travel might be an appropriate factor weighing against an alien credible fear each case must be considered in light of its own specific facts.there well may be circumstances when a person who legitimately fears persecution nevertheless might elect to return temporarily to his home country.health conditions made worse abroad,health conditions of family members and other major life events might drive a person to choose to take certain risks and return home,while doing his best to mitigate them.here,tarraf contended that his trips could be justified in these terms.while we may have reached a different conclusion,we can not say that,under the circumstances here,the ij erred in characterizing the trips as he did.
in any event,even without this factor weighing against his credibility,we believe that the other legitimate considerations that influenced the ij adverse credibility determination are sufficient to sustain that ruling.we therefore uphold that determination as supported by substantial evidence.
past persecution 
the ij ruled that,even crediting tarraf testimony to the extent of the unembellished story of a detention in and the shooting in,those incidents did not support a finding of past persecution we review the conclusion that the harm the petitioner may have suffered did not rise to the level of persecution under the substantial evidence standard.diallo ashcroft,cir.the ij did not believe that tarraf had demonstrated that his final detention resulted in serious injuries requiring medical attention or hospitalization.that the ij declined to credit the full extent of tarraf claimed harms does not,in and of itself,require his subsequent conclusion that tarraf did not suffer past persecution.physical abuse causing serious injuries is not the sine qua non of persecution.dandan ashcroft,cir.persecution can include confiscation of property,surveillance and behavior that threatens future harm.gomes,at citing capric,at.conduct can rise to the level of persecution without being,including even such acts as severe economic deprivation.capric,at.frequency and severity of the harms suffered by a petitioner,however,remain relevant factors in an inquiry into whether those particular harms compel a court to conclude that the alien suffered persecution.see dandan,at.we further have recognized 
that actions such as detention,arrest,interrogation,prosecution,imprisonment,illegal searches,confiscation of property,surveillance,beatings,or torture might cross the line from harassment to persecution.however,recognizing that these sorts of activities might rise to the level of persecution is not the equivalent of saying that they always do.persecution claims can not simply be evaluated against a generic checklist.review of an applicant past experience must be carried out on the most specific is the details that reveal the severity of the particular situation.
liu ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted emphasis in original 
as liu acknowledges,many of the claims tarraf makes in his testimony as a whole could support a finding of past persecution,and indeed,on another record,this court might conclude that they compel such a finding the extremely scant details in tarraf testimony,however,prevent this court from reaching that conclusion in this case.we do not hold that a petitioner must provide a,account of his experiences in his home country in order to establish past persecution we note only that something more than the general allegations of detention and torture provided to the ij in this case will compel a finding of past persecution.on the record before us,the ij conclusion that tarraf did not carry his burden to establish past persecution is supported by substantial evidence.
cat relief 
tarraf final claim in his petition is that the ij denied him due process of law by summarily rejecting his request for cat relief without applying the proper standards.
this court lacks jurisdiction to review this claim,however,because it was not presented to the bia d see also pjetri gonzales,cir where a due process argument is based on procedural failings that the bia is capable of addressing,the petitioner must exhaust his or her remedies at the bia before bringing the claim in this court.
conclusion 
the agency conclusions that tarraf testimony was not credible and that,to the extent it could be credited
