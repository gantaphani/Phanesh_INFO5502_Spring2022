in this appeal,manuel challenges a sentence imposed by the district court in consequence of his guilty plea to a charge of illegal reentry into the united states following an earlier deportation.see a.the appellant asseverates that the sentencing court erred in i boosting his base offense level by sixteen on account of a prior felony conviction ii adding three points to his criminal history score on account of the same conviction and iii increasing his criminal history score by two more points because he illegally reentered the country while on parole.these asseverations require us to deal with questions of first impression in this circuit as to the meaning and operation of certain provisions of the federal sentencing guidelines.despite the ingenious nature of the appellant challenges,we discern no error.consequently,we affirm the sentence.
background 
because this appeal follows a guilty plea,we derive the facts from the colloquy,the uncontested portions of the presentence investigation report psi report,and the transcript of the disposition hearing.united states brewster,cir united states dietz,cir.
the origins of this appeal can be traced to the appellant felony drug conviction in a new york state court,for which he received an indeterminate prison sentence of one to three years on march.the appellant,a dominican national,served less than a year of that sentence before being paroled into the custody of the immigration and naturalization service ins to await deportation.see a b i.the ins deported him to the dominican republic on april,notwithstanding that his parole term was to last until january.
we to july.on that date,a coast guard search of a merchant vessel docked in san juan uncovered twelve stowaways including the appellant.after records revealed the previous deportation order,a federal grand jury indicted the appellant on a charge of violating a,a statute that makes it unlawful for a previously deported alien to reenter the united states without the express permission of the attorney general.
the appellant eventually pleaded guilty to the charge.the offense of conviction carried a base offense level of eight.see ussg a the psi report recommended a enhancement because the appellant had previously been deported following a conviction for which the sentence imposed exceeded thirteen months.see b ussg b a i.this brought the appellant adjusted offense level to.after a discount for acceptance of responsibility,ussg a,the psi report settled upon a total offense level of.
moving to the other furculum of the sentencing grid,the psi report recommended the assignment of three criminal history points on account of the appellant prior conviction,id.a,and two additional points for illegal reentry while on parole,id.d.these recommendations produced a criminal history category chc of iii.consequently,the psi report suggested that the district court employ a guideline sentencing range gsr of months.see id.ch,sentencing table.
the district court convened the disposition hearing on march.the appellant argued that he was entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,see id.b,instead of the reduction recommended in the psi report.the appellant also sought a downward departure,see id,based on a claim that he had committed the offense of conviction out of impoverished desperation.
the sentencing court agreed with the appellant that he had timely accepted responsibility and that,therefore,a reduction was in order.this reduction in the offense level yielded a gsr of months,based on a total offense level of and a chc of iii.see id.ch,sentencing table.the court refused to depart downward and sentenced the appellant to a month incarcerative term.this appeal ensued.
discussion 
we review a district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error.united states mateo,cir united states cyr,cir.here,however,the appellant advances on appeal an asseverational array composed wholly of objections that he neglected to raise before the district court.because of this procedural default,our review is restricted to plain error.united states,cir united states rodriguez,cir.that raises the bar appreciably.to achieve a finding of plain error,a defendant must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.
against this backdrop,we turn to the appellant three assignments of error.
offense level enhancement 
the sentencing guidelines set a base offense level of for the crime of unlawfully entering or remaining in the united states.ussg a.the trial court is,however,directed to impose a enhancement i f the defendant previously was deported after a conviction for a felony that is a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded months.id.b a i.a felony conviction carrying a lesser sentence triggers only a enhancement.id.b b.
in the case at hand,there is no dispute that the appellant prior new york conviction was a felony within the meaning of the applicable guidelines.the appellant argues,however,that the district court erred in treating it as a predicate for a enhancement.his first,and most loudly bruited,claim is that because the appellant served less than thirteen months on the prior conviction,he should have received only a enhancement.
this claim relies heavily on application note of the interpretive commentary to the sentencing guidelines.that note provides that i f all or any part of a sentence of imprisonment was probated,suspended,deferred,or stayed,sentence imposed refers only to the portion that was not probated,suspended,deferred,or stayed.ussg,cmt.a iv.the appellant reasons that when new york paroled him into the custody of the ins less than one year into his incarcerative term,it simultaneously delivered him into this comment welcoming embrace.he thus reads the phrase sentence imposed as referring only to the time actually spent in immurement.this reading does not withstand scrutiny.
our quarrel is not with the text of application note.the sentencing commission commentary,including the application notes,is binding on the courts as long as it does not conflict either with the sentencing guidelines themselves or with some statutory provision.see stinson united states,d united states piper,cir see also ussg.the commentary to the sentencing guidelines must,however,be read in a straightforward,commonsense manner.the appellant reading of application note does not pass this screen.it distorts the plain meaning of the phrase sentence imposed and,in the bargain,runs counter to a growing consensus of case law.we explain briefly.
the phrase sentence imposed traditionally has meant exactly what the words imply the punishment meted out by the sentencing court.an offender early release can not change the contours of the original sentence imposed after the fact.see rodrigues ins,cir collecting cases.
application note is perfectly consistent with this reasoning.the enumerated caveats contained in the,suspension,deferral,and all judicial options available at the moment of sentencing.see generally.parole is a different animal entirely,heavily influenced by events and administered by the executive rather than the judicial branch.see united states frias,cir.judges are not free to rewrite the sentencing guidelines and,in all events,the inclusion of parole by judicial fiat among the sentencing alternatives delineated in application note would be anomalous.in our view,the absence of any mention of parole in the text of the note is a strong indication that the sentencing commission intended section enhancements to reflect the original sentence pronounced,not the time actually served.see united states,cir noting that the plain language of application note does not include parole united states,cir holding that in this guideline,as in federal criminal law generally,the term sentence imposed means the sentence reflected in the criminal judgment main.dep t of envtl,cir presuming that congress acts deliberately when it excludes
