defendant jermi francisco lopez appeals from an august,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york johnson,convicting him,upon his conditional plea of guilty,of illegally reentering the united states in violation of a and b.we hold that erroneous statements by the immigration judge ij and the board of immigration appeals bia informing lopez that he was categorically ineligible for relief under former c of the immigration and nationality act ina,c,deprived lopez of judicial review within the meaning of d.we vacate lopez conviction and remand to the district court for determination of whether the erroneous information given by the government to lopez on the availability of c relief rendered lopez deportation order fundamentally unfair within the meaning of d.
background 
lopez,a citizen of the dominican republic,first entered the united states in january at the age of nine as a lawful permanent resident.on october,lopez was convicted in new york state supreme court of attempted robbery in the second degree.upon entering a plea of guilty,he was sentenced to a term of two to six years imprisonment.on november,the immigration and naturalization service ins issued lopez an order to show cause,charging him with deportability under ina a a iii,a a iii.
much of the subsequent history of this case hinges on significant revisions to the immigration laws that occurred during this time period.prior to,former c of the ina vested the attorney general with broad discretion to cancel deportation orders for aliens who met certain residence requirements and had not served five years in prison for an aggravated felony.united states copeland,cir citing c repealed.the enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat,and the illegal immigration reform and immigration responsibility act iirira,stat,extinguished the prospect of such relief for many categories of aliens.section d of aedpa eliminated c waivers of deportation for those aliens deportable for having committed,inter alia,an aggravated felony or a controlled substance offense.subsequently,of iirira repealed c and replaced it with a narrower provision called cancellation of removal.see united states johnson,cir.under the cancellation of removal provision,codified at ina a,the attorney general lacks discretion to cancel the removal of a lawful permanent resident who has,inter alia,been convicted of an aggravated felony.a.
on february,lopez appeared at a deportation hearing before an ij.lopez requested and received an adjournment until march,to obtain an attorney.on this date,he appeared before the ij and requested and received a second adjournment to obtain an attorney,but was told that this adjournment would be the last one granted to him.on april,lopez appeared pro se,admitted the allegations in the order to show cause,and conceded deportability.the ij informed lopez that he was ineligible for any relief from deportation,including discretionary relief under c of the ina,and ordered lopez deported to the dominican republic.the ij also told lopez of his right to appeal the ruling to the bia.
lopez appealed the ij decision,arguing that d of aedpa could not be applied retroactively to him and that he should have been afforded c relief.on october,the bia dismissed lopez appeal,applying d of aedpa to hold that lopez criminal conviction made him statutorily ineligible for c relief.the bia relied on matter of soriano,wl,which held that aedpa amendments to c applied to proceedings pending when aedpa became law and to those that commenced subsequent to aedpa passage because lopez deportation proceedings began prior to april and became administratively final after october,iirira transitional provisions governed lopez appeal.see henderson ins,cir.the relevant transitional provisions,codified in iirira,stated that t here shall be no appeal permitted of deportation orders based on the alien commission of an aggravated felony.at.while lopez was awaiting deportation,this circuit held that habeas review under remained available under transitional provisions.see reno,cir.thus,once lopez received a final order of removal,he could have sought judicial review of his deportation order through a habeas petition even though he could not have filed a petition for review.on june,the government deported lopez to the dominican republic.on june,the supreme court decided in ins cyr,d,that the provisions of iirira and aedpa repealing c could not be applied retroactively to preclude c relief for an alien who pled guilty to an aggravated felony prior to that section repeal id.at.accordingly,the analysis that led the ij and the bia to find lopez statutorily ineligible for c relief was legally incorrect because it erroneously applied iirira and aedpa retroactively to lopez case.
on may,officers of the new york city police department arrested lopez in queens,new york for,among other things,criminal possession of marijuana.on june,the ins obtained a warrant to arrest lopez.the complaint and affidavit in support of the arrest warrant alleged that lopez had illegally reentered the united states after being deported on account of an aggravated felony conviction.on july,an indictment was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,charging lopez with illegal reentry in violation of a and b.
on october,lopez moved to dismiss the indictment by challenging his deportation order under d.the district court denied lopez motion on december.the court found that lopez had exhausted his administrative remedies pursuant to d because he had appealed his order of deportation to the bia.pursuant to united states,cir,however,the district court held that lopez could not demonstrate,under d,that the erroneous retroactive application of the amendments to the ina to his case improperly denied him the opportunity for judicial review of his deportation order because he had failed to take advantage of the existing opportunity for habeas review.the district court declined to decide whether lopez had satisfied the third prong of d,which requires lopez to show that his deportation proceeding was fundamentally unfair,but noted that it found persuasive the fifth circuit decision in united states,cir,that no due process violation existed from the denial of c relief because such relief was discretionary.id.at.
on march,lopez entered a conditional plea of guilty,which permitted him to appeal the district court denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment.lopez counsel submitted a sentencing letter on july,that included a request that the district court reconsider its ruling on the motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the ij and the bia violated lopez right to due process by not informing lopez of his right to file a habeas corpus petition to challenge his removal order.lopez counsel made the same argument at lopez sentencing on august.the district court rejected counsel request and sentenced lopez principally to a month term of imprisonment.this appeal followed.
discussion 
section d of title permits an alien charged with illegal reentry under a to challenge the underlying deportation order on which the illegal reentry charge is based.see united states calderon,cir.this provision effectively codified the supreme court decision in united states,d.see copeland,at.in,the supreme court held that an alien charged with illegal reentry must have the opportunity to challenge his or her deportation order if those proceedings violated the alien rights.at.we review de novo the district court denial of lopez motion to dismiss the indictment on the basis of a collateral attack on his deportation order under d.united states scott,cir.
in order to successfully challenge a deportation order under d,an alien must demonstrate that 
the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order 
the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and 
the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.
d.the district court found,and the government does not challenge,that lopez exhausted his administrative remedies because he filed an appeal with the bia,which was dismissed.lopez argues that he was improperly deprived of the opportunity for judicial review because neither the ij nor the bia informed him of his right to seek habeas review.lopez further argues that his removal order was fundamentally unfair because the bia decision that he was statutorily ineligible for discretionary c relief rested upon the erroneous retroactive application of aedpa and iirira,and that this error prejudiced him.
the primary issue in this appeal is the second prong of d whether lopez was denied the opportunity for judicial review of his deportation order.for the reasons that follow,we hold that lopez was deprived of the opportunity for judicial review within the meaning of d,albeit not for the reason advanced by appellant.on the basis of our holding in copeland,at,we vacate lopez conviction and remand to the district court to determine whether lopez suffered prejudice from the erroneous information given to him by the ij and bia so as to render his deportation order fundamentally unfair within the meaning of d.
lopez asserts that he was deprived of judicial review because the ij and the bia failed to inform him of the right to file a petition for habeas corpus under and that this failure violated his right to due process under the fifth amendment of the constitution.we disagree.
as a general matter,due process does not require appellate review,even in criminal cases,as long as due process is provided in the initial forum.see,d t he federal constitution guarantees no right to appellate review ohio ex rel.bryant akron metro.park dist.for summit county.as to the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,it is sufficient to say that,as frequently determined by this court,the right of appeal is not essential to due process,provided that due process has already been accorded in the tribunal of first instance.the right to some meaningful review of an alien underlying deportation order in a criminal prosecution for illegal reentry,however,arises because that order was issued on the basis of an administrative proceeding,at.emphasis in original.as the supreme court has explained,the use of an administrative determination reached in the absence of important constitutional safeguards as an element of a crime is troubling,and the opportunity for judicial review in the first instance legitimate s such a practice.id.at.this principle means at the very least that where defects in an administrative proceeding foreclose judicial review of that proceeding,an alternative means of obtaining judicial review must be made available before the administrative order may be used to establish conclusively an element of a criminal offense.id.at.
nothing in,however,indicates that this principle requires a right to notice about the availability of judicial review.the right to petition for habeas relief from an order of deportation is provided by statute.cyr,at.because deportation is a drastic measure and at times the equivalent of banishment or exile,fong haw tan phelan,the receipt of a final order of deportation ordinarily would put an alien on notice to look for remedies for that order.city of west covina perkins,d finding no right to notice of remedies under law where they are established by published,generally available state statutes and case law atkins parker,d same.lopez nonetheless contends that because the ij informed him of his right to bia review of his decision,the failure to inform him of habeas review created the misleading impression that no such review was available.it is true that the administrative nature of the removal proceedings may not lead an alien to look outside the administrative arena for relief,but this does not alter the fact that where judicial remedies are readily available in case law and statutes,due process is not offended where no notice of those remedies is provided.georcely ashcroft,cir to charge petitioner with knowledge of his legal obligations may be apparently does not read such knowledge is expected of all.
thus,in,we held that aliens are deemed to have constructive notice of the availability of habeas review even after the passage of iirira left the scope of that availability in some dispute prior to the supreme court decision in cyr,at,in.we explained that although neither this court nor the supreme court had yet held that such habeas petitions were proper after the passage of iirira,it did not mean that the remedy was unavailable,at.consequently,we reject lopez argument that his right to due process was violated merely because the ij and the bia failed to inform him about the availability of habeas review.
that there is no right to notice of the availability of judicial review,however,does not end the analysis.we turn to the question of whether judicial review was realistically available to is,whether defects in the administrative proceeding otherwise foreclosed judicial review.see d.we have addressed this question in a number of recent opinions.in united states copeland,cir,we held that an alien was deprived of the opportunity for judicial review within the meaning of d when no realistic opportunity for judicial review by way of habeas review existed.at.there,copeland was ordered deported on november,id.at,after the ij told him that he had no right to relief under ina c.id.at.although copeland did not appeal this order of deportation,he filed a motion over two year later on september,to reopen his deportation proceedings and for a stay of deportation on the basis that the ij had erroneously failed to inform him of his eligibility for c relief.id.at.after the ij denied copeland motion to reopen,copeland appealed the ij decision to the bia on october,arguing that he was eligible for c relief.id.at.on november,however,he was deported before the bia considered his appeal.id.
in determining whether habeas review had been available to copeland,we first concluded that t he availability of habeas review is sometimes deemed to constitute an opportunity for judicial review.id.at.looking to the supreme court decision in,however,we found that the technical existence of such review is not always sufficient.id.as we explained,i n,the court held that the petitioners were deprived of judicial review where direct review was available but their waivers of appeal were not considered or intelligent.id.analyzing and our decision in together,we held that where habeas review is technically available,judicial review will be deemed to have been denied if resort to a habeas proceeding was not realistically possible.id.although we did not define what constitutes a realistic possibility for habeas review,we concluded that,in those two cases,the consequences of the availability of habeas review turned on the temporal interval between the order and physical deportation during which the alien could have filed a habeas petition.id.
relying on copeland in united states sosa,cir,we held that an alien who was deported within a month of his final deportation order and was not told of the availability of c relief was denied the opportunity for judicial review within the meaning of d.id.at.we found that sosa did not have a realistic possibility of seeking judicial review through a habeas petition because in the less than one month period after entry of his final deportation order and his deportation,sosa was uncounseled and had little practical chance of finding a lawyer.id.moreover,it was not realistic to expect him to have learned about the availability of section c a complex to have filed a pro se habeas petition during the period before he was actually deported.id.
copeland and sosa formed the basis for this court holding in united states calderon,cir.calderon was ordered removed on may,at which time the ij erroneously informed him that he was ineligible for a c waiver of deportation.id.at.calderon then waived his right to appeal his deportation order to the bia on june,and was removed from the country on july.id.at.we held,inter alia,that 
calderon did not have a realistic opportunity for judicial review by way of a habeas petition.in copeland,there was legal uncertainty as to the availability of such review,and in sosa,the defendant was never informed of the availability of such review here,calderon was specifically told that no such review was available to him.in copeland and sosa,the speed of the deportation process rendered judicial review impracticable the same is true here.accordingly,we hold that calderon satisfies the second prong of section d.
here,as in copeland and sosa,lopez appeared pro se and was told by the ij,and later the bia,that c relief was no longer legally available to him although the instant case partially resembles sosa and calderon,the interval between lopez final deportation order and his ultimate deportation to the dominican republic was more substantial than the intervals in those cases.moreover,while the interval was shorter than in copeland,lopez did not have any procedural hurdle to overcome prior to seeking habeas review.relying on,the government argues that the length of lopez detention gave lopez ample opportunity to discover the availability of habeas review,such that lopez was not denied the opportunity for judicial review under d.we disagree and hold,for the reasons that follow,that this argument is foreclosed in these circumstances by our decision in copeland.
in,the petitioner was deportable because of an aggravated felony conviction but was nevertheless eligible for adjustment of status under ina a.at.the petitioner failed to produce the paperwork needed for the grant of discretionary relief despite receiving three adjournments of his immigration hearing to do so.id.at.the ij refused to grant him a fourth adjournment but told him of the opportunity for appeal to the bia and supplied him with a bia appeals package.id.at.the ij also explained how to appeal,telling that,a ll you have to do is,tell the bia what the judge did wrong.id.at alterations in original.although appealed his deportation order to the bia on the ground that he was eligible for citizenship,he did not present a due process argument to the bia.id.at.on this record,we refused to excuse his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his due process argument,finding that he had forfeited it by failing to raise it before the bia.id.at.
alternatively,we observed that even had been able to satisfy the administrative exhaustion requirement under d,the availability of habeas review meant that he had not been improperly denied judicial review within the meaning of d.id.at.we found that nothing in the text of iirira established a limitation on or repeal of habeas review.id.at.we noted further that during the period between the bia decision and deportation,deportable criminal aliens successfully litigated habeas petitions in the second circuit.id.we thus concluded that could not establish that he was denied the opportunity for judicial review.id.
the facts of differ materially from those in the instant case.it is true that lopez had constructive notice of the availability of habeas review.see id.at see also henderson ins,cir.unlike the defendant in,however,lopez received erroneous information from the ij and the bia about the availability of relief from deportation.had the ij and subsequently the bia not provided erroneous information to lopez about the legal availability of c relief,it might have occurred to lopez to look for other remedies at law.the fact that an administrative body told him that no such relief existed is a powerful deterrent from seeking judicial relief.in copeland,we noted that copeland decision to pursue administrative remedies almost two years after he had waived appeal of his deportation order,rather than file a habeas petition,was not unreasonable because the ij failure to give copeland accurate information left copeland in a dilemma.at.implicit in our ruling was the determination than an alien who waited approximately two years after receiving erroneous information from an ij about the availability of relief from deportation before seeking administrative or judicial review of his deportation order,and who was deported without having had judicial review of that order,satisfied the requirement of d.
to be sure,we noted in copeland that the ten months between final order of deportation and his removal distinguished that case from,a case in which the petitioners were ordered deported on october,and deported on november.at.while a interval between the final order of deportation and the deportation itself may be significant in cases like,where an alien is not misled by an ij about the availability of relief from deportation,it is not significant here.in,the eighth circuit held that the aliens had been denied due process in the deportation proceeding because the ij did not adequately explain the right to apply for waivers of deportation and then accepted waivers of appeal that were not knowing or intelligent.at.because the government did not challenge these findings in the supreme court,the court assumed that these failures by the ij violated the aliens due process rights and concluded that the violation amounted to a complete denial of judicial review.id.thus,the supreme court did not rest its decision on the short period of time in which the aliens had to seek direct review of their deportation orders,but instead relied upon the unchallenged finding below in concluding that defects in the deportation proceeding had denied the aliens access to judicial review.id.at.
moreover,the mere fact that we found that could not prove that he was denied judicial review because ten months passed between his final order of deportation and his removal from the country,at,does not undermine lopez claim here.while the interval of time in which it is realistically possible for an alien seek judicial review may be quite short where the alien has not received misinformation,the analysis differs where the government affirmatively misleads an alien about the availability of relief.holmberg armbrecht.explaining that equity will toll a statute of limitations because of fraud or concealment.we did not find copeland delay in seeking to exhaust his administrative remedies unreasonable where he had been misinformed by the ij.this reasoning is equally applicable to lopez failure to seek judicial review in the eighteen months between his final order of deportation and his deportation 
deportation,now removal,is a civil proceeding with its own administrative procedures.see,ins,d holding that the exclusionary rule does not apply to civil deportation proceedings and noting the rule incompatibility with the streamlined administrative nature of such proceedings.because it is an administrative process,deportation does not carry all of the protections of a criminal proceeding.consequently,we have held that ijs have special responsibilities towards aliens in removal proceedings.copeland,at see also yang mcelroy,cir noting that,as administrative law judges,ijs have special responsibilities to develop the record.moreover,although,as noted,deportation is a drastic act that should put an alien on notice to search the law for remedies,its administrative nature makes it less likely that an alien would immediately look outside the administrative process for relief.in these circumstances,the ij and bia affirmative misstatements to lopez that he was not eligible for any relief from deportation functioned as a deterrent to seeking relief given the misinformation supplied to lopez by both the ij and the bia,there is no reasonable basis on which to distinguish this case from our holding in copeland and,accordingly,we find that lopez was denied a realistic opportunity for judicial review within the meaning of d.
finally,d requires that lopez demonstrate that his deportation proceeding was fundamentally unfair.this statutory prong requires a showing of both a fundamental procedural error and prejudice resulting from the error.perez,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the district court did not decide whether lopez had satisfied this prong but noted that it found persuasive the fifth circuit decision in,which held that the denial of the right to apply for c relief was not a due process violation because such relief was discretionary.at.we have since rejected the analysis of,holding in copeland that a failure to advise a potential deportee of a right to seek section c relief can,if prejudicial,be fundamentally unfair within the meaning of section d.at.
p rejudice is shown where there is a reasonable probability that,but for the ij unprofessional errors,the alien would have been granted section c relief.id.at.we noted in scott that a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.at quoting strickland washington,d alteration omitted.in strickland,the supreme court stated that t he governing legal standard plays a critical role in defining the question to be asked in assessing prejudice.at.here,the standard against which prejudice is to be measured is the ij broad discretion to grant c relief.in analyzing whether an alien suffered prejudice under d resulting from an ij failure to consider his or her application for c relief,district courts must balance the adverse factors evidencing an alien undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented in his behalf to determine whether the granting of section c relief appears in the best interests of this country.sosa,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.as we stated in copeland,a district court evaluating prejudice should tak e into account actual cases in which similarly situated aliens have been granted or denied discretionary relief.at.consideration should also be given to the bia guidance in marin that,i n some cases,the minimum equities inherent in eligibility for section c relief may be sufficient in and of themselves to warrant favorable discretionary action and that,a s the negative factors grow more serious,it becomes incumbent upon the applicant to introduce additional offsetting favorable evidence,which in some cases may have to involve unusual or outstanding equities,bia.
because of its disposition of this case,the district court did not decide whether lopez suffered prejudice within the meaning of d.we therefore remand for a determination of whether it is reasonably probable that lopez would have been granted c relief had he been given a genuine opportunity to apply for it.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate lopez conviction and remand the case for a determination of whether the government erroneous information about the availability of c relief rendered lopez deportation order fundamentally unfair.
jermi francisco lopez appeals his conviction for illegal reentry after deportation,see a and b,on the ground that the district court erroneously denied him the opportunity to challenge the underlying deportation order.the law expressly prohibits such challenges in the context of criminal reentry prosecutions unless the alien defendant satisfies three statutory conditions.he must demonstrate that 
the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order 
the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and 
the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.
lopez submits that the district court erred in concluding that he failed to satisfy the second of these mandates.he asserts that he carried this burden by showing that the ij and the bia each failed to inform him of the availability of judicial review through a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under.i join my colleagues in the majority in concluding that the lack of specific notice to lopez as to the availability of habeas review did not constitute a defect in his administrative proceedings that deprived him of judicial review.see ante at.i can not,however,join in their conclusion that such a deprivation of judicial review was practically effected by ij and bia errors in telling lopez that he was ineligible for discretionary relief from deportation under former ina c,see c.see ante at.to the extent the majority reads united states copeland,cir,to compel this conclusion,i must respectfully dissent.
in copeland,this court reiterated that t he availability of habeas review is sometimes deemed to constitute an opportunity for judicial review.united states copeland,at citing united states,cir holding alien not denied judicial review because habeas was available.at the same time,however,the court instructed that the technical availability of habeas review does not necessarily foreclose a defendant from satisfying d.id.at.it explained that,even where habeas review is technically available,judicial review will be deemed to have been denied if resort to a habeas proceeding was not realistically possible.id.copeland identified two circumstances that could demonstrate the realistic impossibility necessary to satisfy d lack of adequate time to pursue habeas review,and legal uncertainties as to the availability of such review.id.in my view,this case presents neither circumstance 
with respect to the first,copeland observed that deportation proceedings effectively deprived an alien of judicial review where the interval between entry of the final deportation order and the physical deportation is too brief to afford a realistic possibility of filing a habeas petition.id.in making this point,copeland distinguished the interval between the deportation order and physical deportation in united states,d,from the interval between the final agency action and deportation in united states,at.see united states copeland at.following this precedent,this court has held intervals between the entry of a final deportation order and deportation too brief a period to afford a realistic possibility of filing a habeas petition.see united states calderon,cir united states sosa,cir.defendants in such circumstances have been found to satisfy d.
clearly,the chronology of this case is not analogous to,calderon,and sosa.after the october,dismissal of his bia appeal,lopez remained in the united states for twenty months before being deported on june.the majority nevertheless concludes that lopez was denied the opportunity for judicial review throughout this period because of misinformation communicated by the ij and bia regarding lopez eligibility for c relief.see ante at.while the interval of time in which it is realistically possible for an alien to seek judicial review may be quite short where the alien has not received misinformation,the analysis differs where the government affirmatively misleads an alien about the availability of relief.it concludes that such misinformation functions as a sufficiently powerful deterrent to an alien seeking judicial relief for us to equate it to the denial of such review for purposes of d.ante at.the majority further observes that,in copeland,this court did not find copeland delay in seeking to exhaust his administrative remedies unreasonable where he had been misinformed by the ij as to the availability of c relief.ante at.it holds that t his reasoning is equally applicable to lopez failure to seek judicial review.ante at.i disagree.
copeland presented an unusual fact situation that prompted the court to recognize legal uncertainties as to the availability of habeas review before deportation as a circumstance that,like lack of adequate time,could render a habeas petition realistically impossible.united states copeland,at.in copeland,an alien who was misinformed as to his ineligibility for c relief then waived his right to administrative appeal of his deportation order.see id.at.as a result of this waiver,copeland was caught between a procedural rock and a hard place in pursuing judicial review via habeas.on the one hand,if copeland filed a habeas petition asserting his right to c consideration,he faced a likely administrative exhaustion challenge.see id.at see also theodoropoulos ins,cir.on the other hand,if he tried to cure his exhaustion failure by filing a motion to reopen his administrative proceedings,he could and did find himself deported before he could avail himself of habeas review.see united states copeland,at see also swaby ashcroft,cir recognizing th
