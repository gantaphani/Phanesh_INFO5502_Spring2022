we consider a eligibility for a waiver of inadmissibility under h of the immigration and nationality act ina,h,where he has been convicted of an aggravated felony after his admission for permanent residence.section h,also referred to as the h waiver or h relief,expressly bars from relief a who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence and later is convicted of an aggravated felony.id.yin hing sum,a native of hong kong and citizen of china,was denied a h waiver because he was convicted of a qualifying offense after his admission as a lawful permanent resident lpr.
sum advances a curious position on appeal namely,that because he was never legally admitted for permanent residence in the first place,but rather procured his admission by fraud or misrepresentation,the bar on h relief does not apply.in other words,he argues that his initial fraud should save him now.we are not persuaded by this approach and deny the petition for review.having enjoyed the benefits of lpr status,sum can not now shed his skin for the purposes of seeking beneficial relief.
the term admitted carries special significance within the regime of immigration statutes.contrary to sum position,the previous admission to lpr status in h does not refer to an admission in substantive compliance with the immigration laws,but rather an admission that is procedurally regular in nature.in this regard we interpret the term admitted as used in h,as distinct from the term lawfully admitted as that phrase is defined by the statute.because sum was admitted as an lpr in the sense of being inspected and authorized at the port of entry,but later convicted,he is barred from h relief.it may seem,at first blush,an oxymoron to be admitted to the united states and yet inadmissible at the same time.but such is the text of the ina and the often opaque world of the immigration statutes.
background 
sum was admitted to the united states as an lpr in.before obtaining residency,in december,sum was arrested,and allegedly convicted,for criminal coercion in the second degree,in violation of new york penal law.in june,some ten years after his admission,sum was convicted of conspiracy to produce,use,or traffic in counterfeit access devices,in violation of,and sentenced to months imprisonment.
following sum federal conviction,the government initiated removal proceedings in december,charging sum with removability for having been convicted of an aggravated felony,for an offense relating to counterfeiting for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.see a a iii detailing grounds for removability,a r defining aggravated felony.sum conceded removability in immigration court but argued that he was eligible for adjustment of status,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.in conjunction with his adjustment application,sum sought a h waiver,arguing that he was not subject to the bar on h relief because he was actually inadmissible at the time he obtained lpr status either because of his conviction or because of his failure to disclose that conviction when he entered as an lpr in 
on august,the immigration judge ij denied all of sum applications for relief.with respect to sum application for a h waiver,the ij held there was no basis on which to conclude that sum admission for permanent residence was somehow in violation of law.the ij found sum ineligible for the waiver and pretermitted his adjustment application.the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the ij decision without opinion.because the bia affirmed without opinion,we review the ij decision as the final agency determination.lanza ashcroft,cir see also e ii.
i.the h waivera.background of the waiver 
section h authorizes the attorney general to waive certain criminal grounds of inadmissibility,including a crime involving moral turpitude,a single conviction of simple possession of thirty grams or less of marijuana,multiple criminal convictions,prostitution,and offenses by diplomats asserting immunity from prosecution for serious criminal activities.h see also id.a f authorizing waiver.crucially for sum,h provides one of the few forms of relief available to who have been convicted of aggravated felonies.although h does not itself waive an aggravated felony,it potentially provides discretionary relief to who otherwise would be eligible for adjustment of status,but for certain grounds of inadmissibility such as crimes of moral turpitude.
however,lprs and are not eligible for the h waiver on equal terms.as part of the immigration reform,congress amended the statute to make it more difficult for lprs to obtain h relief.illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,div.c,stat.amending h.the statute provides that n o waiver shall be granted under this subsection in the case of an alien who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if since the date of such admission the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony.h.accordingly,h waivers are available to convicted of aggravated felonies,or who were convicted of an aggravated felony prior to their admission as lprs,but they are unavailable to who were convicted of an aggravated felony after their admission as lprs.in re michel,i n,bia en banc see also united states arrieta,cir.we have upheld this distinction against an equal protection challenge as supported by a rational basis namely,the judgment that lprs,who enjoy substantial rights and privileges not shared by other aliens should be held to a higher standard and level of responsibility than and that aggravated felon lprs are less deserving of a second chance than nonlprs.taniguchi schultz,cir alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
statutory text 
the crux of this appeal is whether,despite the arrest sum concealed at the time of his admission for permanent residence,sum is now ineligible to seek h relief.the ij found that sum was previously admitted for permanent residence within the meaning of h,had been convicted for an aggravated felony after his admission,and was therefore barred from seeking h relief.sum argues,however,that because he acquired permanent residence through fraud or misrepresentation,he was never lawfully admitted for the purpose of the bar.
we review the proper construction of h de novo,kankamalage ins,cir,employing all traditional tools of statutory construction to determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.if congress has done so,our inquiry is at an end we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.fda brown williamson tobacco,d quoting chevron,at.
our analysis begins with the text.the statutory text bears repeating here n o waiver shall be granted under this subsection in the case of an alien who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence if since the date of such admission the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony.h.despite its apparently redundant phrasing,the text is divisible into two distinct phrases namely,an alien who has previously been admitted to the united states and as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.see martinez mukasey,cir parsing the statute in this manner.the first phrase is controlling in this case.in other words,the application of the bar turns on what it means to have previously been admitted to the united states as an lpr.
this structure is put in sharper relief when h is read against the definitions provision of the ina,which sets forth separate definitions for admitted,as used in the phrases previously been admitted to the united states and lawfully admitted for permanent residence.see a defining terms a s used in this chapter.the statute defines admission in general as the lawful entry of the alien into the united states after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.id.a a see also setting forth inspection procedures.the statute defines lawfully admitted for permanent residence as the status of having been l
