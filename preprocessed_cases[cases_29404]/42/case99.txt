petitioner juan carlos shul navarro,a native and citizen of el salvador,seeks review of a board of immigration appeals decision that dismissed his appeal from an immigration judge order that would remove him from the united states the key issue concerns whether shul showed that he qualifies for a special status that due to a determination the attorney general made about unsafe conditions in his home country would afford him protection from being sent back to el salvador.because neither the board nor the immigration judge provided a sufficient explanation for finding that shul failed to make that necessary showing,we vacate and remand for further proceedings.
shul entered the united states without inspection at an unconfirmed time,and on may,he submitted an application for what is known as temporary protected status.that status affords aliens protection from removal from the united states upon a determination by the attorney general that conditions in the alien home country prevent the alien safe return.the attorney general made the triggering designation about shul home country,el salvador,after two large earthquakes struck that country.designation of el salvador under temporary protected status program.
as a result of that designation,shul may qualify for temporary protected status by showing,among other things,that he has ties to the united states that started to run from certain dates that had been set by the attorney general.more specifically,shul must show that he has been continuously physically present in the united states since the effective date of the attorney general designation of el salvador as a country whose nationals may qualify for temporary protected status,and that he has continuously resided in the united states as of a separate date that the attorney general also designated.c a designation of el salvador under temporary protected status program.by virtue of the attorney general designations regarding el salvador,shul must prove continuous presence in this country as of march,and continuous residence as of february.
before deciding whether to grant shul temporary protected status,the department of homeland security requested that he provide additional supporting documentation.shul did so,but the department denied shul application on november.shul was then not served with a notice to appear for removal proceedings until.at that point,shul filed a renewed application for temporary protected status with the immigration court.although shul provided new evidence at that time,the immigration judge,like the department,found his showing insufficient shul thus appealed to the board of immigration appeals,which reached the same result.
neither the immigration judge nor the board set forth as precisely as we might wish the exact basis for their judgment that shul does not qualify for temporary protected status.the ambiguity,such as it is,concerns the scope of that judgment.we first must decide,therefore,what the agency decided so we can determine what we must review.specifically,we must resolve whether the immigration judge and the board determined only that shul failed to show he was in the united states early enough to qualify for temporary protected status or whether they also determined that,even if he was in the united states in time,he failed to show that he maintained a sufficient connection to the country in the months and years that followed.we thus begin by parsing the agency decisions with this question in mind.see sec chenery,if the administrative action is to be tested by the basis upon which it purports to rest,that basis must be set forth with such clarity as to be understandable in other words,we must know what a decision means before the duty becomes ours to say whether it is right or wrong.quoting united states chicago.
we start with the opinion of the immigration judge because the board affirmed her decision for the reasons that she provided.see matovu holder,cir.the introduction to the immigration judge analysis makes clear she made at least one finding namely,that,in her view,the earliest reliable evidence showing shul in the united states is his filing of his initial application for temporary protected status on may.in our view,the rest of her analysis most naturally reads as an explanation of why she believes the evidence shul submitted fails to support a contrary finding on that one key point.and,for that reason,we read her opinion as well as the board opinion affirming it to rest solely on that factual finding and not on an additional and independent finding that,even if shul were in the country earlier,his ties to this country thereafter were insufficiently continuous.waweru gonzales,cir explaining that clarity is a matter of degree,and,as such,the normal question s upon review of agency action are whether the evidence supports the conclusion and whether the agency basic rationale is clear enough to permit review.
the structure of the immigration judge opinion supports this reading.she begins the introduction to her analysis by stating that the department of homeland security finding that shul does not qualify for temporary protected status should be affirmed.she also states that,in her view,shul initial application for temporary protected status represents the earliest evidence that is reliable about his presence in this country.she then notes that shul did testify that he arrived in the united states earlier.specifically,she explains that shul testified that he entered the united states in september exact date unknown and that he never left.but she concludes the introduction to her analysis by stating that shul has no documentary proof of such and that conflicting evidence in the record leads her to have some concerns about the credibility of his testimony.
in light of this set up,the paragraphs that follow in the immigration judge opinion appear to represent an effort to detail the deficiencies in shul evidence of being in the united states prior to may.in the first several of those paragraphs,for example,the immigration judge focuses on her concerns about shul effort to provide documentation for his contention.
the immigration judge begins with a paragraph that describes two letters shul submitted from the east boston neighborhood health center.one letter,dated june,states that shul initially registered with the health center on may.it lists no additional dates of service on which shul was subsequently seen by the health center.but the other letter is,on its face,more helpful to shul effort to show he was in the united states earlier than may.dated june,this letter lists august,as when shul initially registered with the health center.in addition,it states shul was subsequently seen by the health center once in each,and.
the immigration judge concludes in the next paragraph,however,that shul was unable to adequately explain the inconsistencies in the two letters.furthermore,she notes that the letters do not accord with other parts of shul testimony.despite shul testifying that he had appendix surgery in or around,for example,the immigration judge observes that neither letter lists an entry near that date.and while she notes that it is possible shul was seen elsewhere,she states that if his treatment was at the health center it should have appeared on this form.
in the very next paragraph of the opinion,the immigration judge expresses the further concern that n o underlying medical records were presented to corroborate shul having registered as the health center in august or having been seen in july.and she adds that shul gave the impression that he had informed the health center that he needed information regarding earlier dates than had been placed in the first letter issued by the health center,although the immigration judge did acknowledge that shul was somewhat vague in his testimony on that point.
these inconsistencies,and other concerns,thus seem to be set forth in order to support the immigration judge decision to discount the significance of the letter.and because that letter,if credited,would constitute reliable evidence that shul was in the united states before may,the immigration judge ap
