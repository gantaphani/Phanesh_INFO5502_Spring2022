this case raises a question of first impression in our circuit whether a b ii,which precludes judicial review of the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security discretionary decisions under title,chapter,subchapter ii,applies to the revocation of visa petition approvals under.taking the same view as most other circuits,we conclude that it does and so judicial review is precluded.
title,section of the precludes judicial review of discretionary decisions made by the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security under title,chapter,subchapter ii.a b ii.decisions made under that subchapter as to the revocation of previously approved visa petitions are made discretionary by statute.see kucana holder,d explaining that congress barred court review of discretionary decisions only when congress itself set out the attorney general discretionary authority in the statute.because this statute is a clear expression of congressional intent,we,like seven other circuits,conclude that congress has barred judicial review.
we confine our discussion of the facts to those necessary to frame the issue on appeal.on february,m k engineering,m k,through its owner and president henry bernardo,filed an application for employment certification for samuel freitas to work as an assistant delivery supervisor.after the department of labor granted the certification on october,m k filed an i immigrant petition for alien worker visa petition for freitas.the united states citizenship and immigration services uscis initially approved the visa petition on march,
on september,the director of the uscis texas service center issued a notice of intent to revoke noir the approval of the visa petition.the noir alleged that m k was trying to circumvent immigration laws by committing fraud and requested additional information and documents.m k submitted additional evidence in response.on november,the director of the uscis texas service center issued a decision revoking the approval of the visa petition because the evidence does not indicate that the beneficiary had met the minimum experience requirements prior to the filing of either labor certification plus,the new evidence contradicts evidence already on the record.bernardo,as owner of m k,administratively appealed the revocation decision to the uscis administrative appeals office aao on december.on june,the aao affirmed the revocation decision and dismissed the appeal.
in july,bernardo,as owner of m k,filed a complaint with the massachusetts federal district court challenging the revocation of the visa petition approval.on november,the aao withdrew its decision and reopened the matter sua sponte.it requested additional evidence,which m k provided.after considering the evidence,on february,the aao dismissed the appeal,finding again that there were inconsistencies in the evidence,and that m k had failed to prove that freitas had the necessary work experience.on march,the government filed a motion to dismiss the district court proceeding for lack of jurisdiction.after briefing,on december,the district court issued a memorandum and order granting the government motion and dismissing the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.bernardo napolitano,wl.this appeal followed.
we review de novo a district court order dismissing a case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.mccloskey mueller,cir.in doing so,we accept the factual allegations of the plaintiff complaint and indulge all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.dominion energy brayton point,llc johnson,cir.
bernardo claims federal jurisdiction under,inter alia,of the administrative procedure act apa,which confers a general cause of action upon persons adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute.block cmty.nutrition,d quoting.however,of the apa withdraws that cause of action to the extent the relevant statute preclude s judicial review.id.alteration in original quoting a.such is the case before us 
the relevant statute,a b ii,removes judicial review of the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security discretionary decisions made under title,chapter,subchapter ii of the 
notwithstanding any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory no court shall have jurisdiction to review any other decision or action of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security,other than the granting of relief under section a of this title.
a b ii emphasis added.
the unambiguous language of a b ii withdraws judicial review from decisions the authority for which is specified to be in the discretion of the secretary of homeland security.id it is not contested that such decisions are not subject to judicial review.so we must determine whether the decision to revoke a visa petition approval is specified to be in the secretary of homeland security discretion.
the visa petition approval was revoked pursuant to.section,which falls under subchapter ii,provides in relevant part 
the secretary of homeland security may,at any time,for what he deems to be good and sufficient cause,revoke the approval of any petition approved by him under section of this title.we join seven of our sister circuits and conclude that this decision is discretionary,and so not subject to judicial review.see mehanna citizenship immigration,cir green napolitano,cir abdelwahab frazier,cir sands dep t of homeland,app x,cir per curiam ghanem upchurch,cir jilin pharm.usa,chertoff,cir el khader monica,cir.one panel majority in one circuit views the issue differently.see ana int l way,cir holding,with one panel member dissenting,that under,the authority of the attorney general to revoke visa petitions is bounded by objective criteria,id.at,and so a b ii does not remove judicial review.our dissenting colleague also views it differently.
we acknowledge the presumption favoring interpretations of statutes to allow judicial review of administrative action.kucana,at alteration in original quoting reno catholic soc,d.however,this presumption is just that a presumption l ike all presumptions used in interpreting statutes,it may be overcome by specific language or specific legislative history that is a reliable indicator of congressional intent.block,at see also mach mining,llc eeoc,d.here we have specific language a b ii withdraws judicial review from decisions committed to the secretary of homeland security discretion,and clearly indicates that the decision to revoke the approval of a visa petition is discretionary.
at least three language choices in dictate this conclusion may,at any time,and for what he deems to be good and sufficient cause.see ghanem,at jilin,at identifying four indications by separating deems to be from good and sufficient cause.by using the precatory term may,rather than the directory term shall,congress indicated its intent to make the decision discretionary united states aponte guzm√°n,cir see also haig agee,d explaining that may expressly recognizes substantial discretion.but see zadvydas davis,d but while may suggests discretion,it does not necessarily suggest unlimited discretion.
including at any time is also proof of congress intent to withhold judicial review.see mehanna,at jilin,at el khader,at.as the third circuit explained,the discretion to revoke at any time had once been restricted by a notice requirement in the statute.jilin,at citing firstland int l,ins,cir intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of,c,stat.congress elimination of this requirement strongly indicates an intent to strengthen the discretion of the secretary of homeland security to revoke approval of petitions.id.
third,the language for what the secretary deems to be good and sufficient cause makes clear that what constitutes good and sufficient cause is within the secretary discretion.see ghanem,at quoting webster new int l dictionary ed as defining deem as to sit in judgment upon,and interpreting the phrase for what he deems as vesting complete discretion in the secretary to determine what constitutes good and sufficient cause.together,these phrases in the statute determine the question of discretion.the supreme court case kucana holder supports this conclusion.see at explaining that the language any other decision in a b ii refers to decisions made discretionary by legislation 
bernardo and the dissent make much of footnote of kucana,which says,the statutory proscription congress enacted,a b ii,speaks of authority specified not merely assumed or contemplated to be in the attorney general discretion,at citing webster new collegiate dictionary,which defined specify as to name or state explicitly or in detail.we think that language,which includes that the secretary may,at any time,for what he deems to be good and sufficient cause,does clearly specify discretion.see mehanna,at s ection does not merely imply or anticipate that the secretary has discretion to revoke a visa petition,but explicitly authorizes revocation for what the secretary deems to be good and sufficient cause.quoting green,at.bernardo argument to the contrary that congress did not specify that visa petition revocations are within the secretary discretion for purposes of stripping district courts of jurisdiction under a b ii seems to rest on a notion that specified means that congress must use the word discretion for a decision to be discretionary,and so not subject to judicial review.but such a position is rejected by kucana itself.as the court noted,congress excepted from a b ii the granting of relief under a.kucana,at alteration in original.section concerns applications for asylum.id.notwithstanding the absence of the word discretion in the relevant provisions of,the court explained that a bsent the exception,asylum applicants might fall within a b ii jurisdictional bar because a statutory provision,b a,specifies that the attorney general may grant asylum.id.citing zadvydas,at,for the proposition that may suggests discretion.as the court suggested,and we agree,statutory language can be specified even absent the use of the word discretion.accord ana int l,at tallman,dissenting though it might make our job a bit easier,we should not require our lawmakers to recite the words sole and unreviewable discretion as some sort of talismanic incantation before we can conclude that a statute means what it says.mohammad napolitano,d.
bernardo and the dissent argument that good and sufficient cause imposes a legal standard that is subject to judicial review is also unavailing.bernardo and the dissent argue that good and sufficient cause constitutes a standard that meaningfully curtails the secretary discretion.based on some decisions from the board of immigration appeals bia and the aao,the dissent posits that good and sufficient cause exists when the evidence of record at the time the decision is rendered would warrant a denial of the visa petition.see,in re ho,bia in re tawfik,bia in re identifying information redacted by agency,wl,at aao feb.
we disagree with the premise that the phrase good and sufficient cause destroys the secretary discretion.we also demonstrate that the canons of construction do not support the dissent.as to both points,in the years preceding the most recent reenactment of,courts had multiple occasions to interpret that statute,including the phrase good and sufficient cause.in doing so,a number of them concluded that the determination of whether there exists good and sufficient cause necessarily is highly subjective,and there exist no strict standards for making this determination.el khader,at see also systronics ins,d,n o strict standards exist to determine when good and sufficient cause is present.the standard seems highly subjective,much like good moral character and extreme hardship.firstland,at suggesting that under,the substance of the decision that there should be a revocation is committed to the discretion of the attorney general pierno ins,cir observing that this section is permissive it grants the attorney general discretion in determining what shall constitute good and sufficient cause and whether revocation of approval shall occur or be withheld in those cases where there is good and sufficient cause for revocation 
the dissent nonetheless tries to show that the bia had an understanding that its was and that congress shared that understanding when it reenacted.the dissent invokes two related principles of statutory construction.first the dissent argues,when congress uses a term of art in legislation,it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken.molzof united states,d quoting morissette united states.the dissent suggests that good and sufficient cause constitutes a term of art,and that congress obviously intended to incorporate its supposedly meaning into when it reenacted the statute.
however,the dissent misapplies the term of art canon.even if good and sufficient cause would now constitute a term of art a proposition we do not accept this phrase was not a term of art at the time was enacted in.as the cases cited by the dissent make clear,we generally apply this rule of statutory construction with respect to concepts that are well understood at the time of a statute enactment.gustafson alloyd,d see also molzof,at legal dictionaries in existence when the ftca was drafted and enacted indicate that punitive damages were commonly understood to be damages awarded to punish defendants for torts committed with fraud,actual malice,violence,or oppression.emphasis added sullivan stroop,d congress use of child support throughout title iv shows no intent to depart from common usage.
this,obviously,does not apply to the case at hand.the dissent understanding of good and sufficient cause is rooted in a handful of decisions from the bia that have been issued decades after the statute enactment.the dissent does not suggest nor could it that good and sufficient cause had a longstanding or meaning at the time of enactment.
and so the dissent next conflates the term of art canon with the doctrine of legislative ratification.the supreme court has explained,congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it a statute without change.lorillard pons,d.the doctrine of legislative ratification would,at first glance,seem to be a much better fit for the dissent argument the bia understanding of good and sufficient cause,while not a term of art,is nonetheless an administrative interpretation of a statute of which congress might be presumed to be aware.and indeed,congress reenacted in and without disturbing the language of good and sufficient cause in the years since the bia first set forth its interpretation of that phrase.
however,this canon of statutory interpretation is of no help to the dissent.for the legislative ratification canon to apply,two requirements must be met congress must reenact the statute without change and t he supposed judicial consensus must be so broad and unquestioned that we must presume congress knew of and endorsed it.jama immigration customs enf t,d.here,the second requirement is lacking there was certainly no broad and unquestioned judicial consensus that good and sufficient cause had the interpretation the dissent advocates,nor does the dissent argue as much.in fact,as we have discussed above,a number of courts had interpreted the determination of whether there was good and sufficient cause as a decision left to the secretary discretion.
instead,the dissent points to bia and aao decisions as evidence congress adopted the agency understanding of good and sufficient cause.these decisions are plainly insufficient to warrant the presumption that congress knew of and endorsed such an understanding,of good and sufficient cause.id.at decisions of two courts of appeals insufficient to establish judicial consensus united states powell,d decisions of two district courts and two courts of appeals represent ed neither a settled judicial construction nor one which we could be justified in presuming congress,by its silence,impliedly approved.by the dissent reasoning,if congress is presumed to have been aware of the bia and aao treatment of,it was undoubtedly aware of the judiciary interpretations thereof as well.which is to say that there was no broad and unquestioned consensus as to the meaning of good and sufficient cause the dissent proposes.see jama,at.
to be sure,the supreme court has suggested that congressional reenactment of a statute that has been interpreted by an agency can provide persuasive evidence that the agency interpretation is the one intended by congress.cftc schor,d quoting nlrb bell aerospace,d.however,the circumstances giving rise to such a situation do not present themselves here.specifically,here we have no evidence that congress was even aware of the purported administrative interpretation,let alone intended to adopt it.by contrast,in schor,the cftc had declared by regulation its interpretation.id.at.further,the subsequent legislative history provided abundant evidence that congress both contemplated and authorized the cftc interpretation.id.at.similarly,in united states board of commissioners of sheffield,alabama,the attorney general longstanding construction was reported to congress by justice department officials,d,and the legislative history of the showed that congress agreed with that interpretation,id.at.the dissent identifies nothing within the legislative history of that suggests congress was aware of the bia and aao interpretations of good and sufficient cause.massachusetts fdic,cir congress is often deemed to have adopted an agency interpretation of a statute when,knowing of the agency interpretation,it reenacts the statute without significant change.emphasis added 
instead,the dissent merely assumes that congress was aware of some bia and aao decisions when reenacting.as we have discussed,there is no basis for making such an assumption here.zenith radio hazeltine research,d the respondent can point to no direct evidence that congress ever considered the issue now before us or voiced any views upon it on the contrary,it appears that congress left the matter for authoritative resolution in the courts.zuber allen,d where,as in the case before us,there is no indication that a subsequent congress has addressed itself to the particular problem,we are unpersuaded that silence is tantamount to acquiescence,let alone the approval discerned by the dissent.
absent evidence congress was aware of the administrative interpretations,it is significant that we lack any affirmative indication from congress that it intended to ratify these interpretations.we have explained that it is generally inappropriate to apply the doctrine of legislative ratification without some evidence that congress affirmatively sought to ratify the interpretation of a statute particularly when,as here,an ambiguous term lacks a widely accepted meaning and we lack any indication that congress was even aware of the administrative interpretation suggested in molina ins,in an opinion written by judge breyer,we explained that congressional reenactment of statutory language does not normally or automatically indicate a legislative intent to freeze all agency interpretations of language,forever after immunizing them from change,cir see also aclu clapper,cir i n the case of an administrative interpretation of a statute,for the doctrine of legislative ratification to apply,we must first ascertain whether congress has spoken clearly enough to constitute acceptance and approval of an administrative interpretation.mere reenactment is insufficient.quoting isaacs bowen,cir ass of am.interstate commerce comm n,the supreme court has indicated that in order to bring this doctrine of reenactment into play,congress must not only have been made aware of the administrative interpretation,but must also have given some affirmative indication of such intent.accordingly,given the complete lack of evidence that congress was aware of the bia and aao interpretation of good and sufficient cause,let alone affirmatively intended to ratify it,we are to conclude that a legislative ratification took place 
in sum,good and sufficient cause is not a term of art,much less does it establish that the secretary decision is.further,there is no basis to assume that congress shared that understanding when it reenacted.thus,the dissent is incorrect to conclude that the secretary discretion is bounded by objective criteria,or a legal standard that could be applied by a reviewing court.the statute provides no such standard,and there is no indication that congress intended to so constrain the secretary discretion.
moreover,bernardo and the dissent argument focuses on the words good and sufficient cause at the expense of the words for what he deems to be.we are not free to do so.see regions hosp.shalala,d it is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that significance and effect shall,if possible,be accorded to every word.quoting.mkt.hoffman.as the third circuit explained,t he phrase for what the secretary deems to be good and sufficient cause,can not be modified by judicial fiat to read the naked words,for good and sufficient cause.jilin,at second alteration in original.the language for what the secretary deems to be good and sufficient cause makes clear that what constitutes good and sufficient cause is within the secretary discretion.see ghanem,at 
our reading mirrors a conclusion reached by the supreme court in webster doe,d.in webster,the court examined c of the national security act of 
t he director of central intelligence may,in his discretion,terminate the employment of any officer or employee of the agency whenever he shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the united states 
id.at alterations in original quoting c the court read that statute to remove judicial review under apa a,which precludes judicial review where agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.id.at it explained 
section c allows termination of an agency employee whenever the director shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the united states emphasis added,not simply when the dismissal is necessary or advisable to those interests.this standard fairly exudes deference to the director,and appears to us to foreclose the application of any meaningful judicial standard of review.
id.at quoting c fed.energy admin.algonquin sng,d in authorizing the president to take such action,and for such time,as he deems necessary to adjust the imports of an article and its derivatives,the language of the statute seems clearly to grant him a measure of discretion in determining the method to be used to adjust imports.
bernardo and the dissent argument that kucana holder changes the analysis also fails.in kucana,the court was faced with a regulation that provided,in relevant part,that t he decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen is within the discretion of the board of immigration appeals.at second alteration in original quoting a.examining this regulation,the court addressed the question of whether the proscription of judicial review stated in a b applies not only to attorney general determinations made discretionary by statute,but also to determinations declared discretionary by the attorney general himself through regulation.id.at.the court conclusion that a b ii language specified under this subchapter includes statutory,but not regulatory,specifications,was based on several considerations the longstanding exercise of judicial review of administrative rulings on reopening motions,the text and context of a b,the history of the relevant statutory provisions,the presumption favoring interpretations of statutes to allow judicial review of administrative action,id.alteration in original quoting reno,at and s concerns,which caution us against reading legislation,absent clear statement,to place in executive hands authority to remove cases from the judiciary domain,id.
the dissent sua sponte focuses on the court second consideration,a b structure the dissent correctly points out that the supreme court stated,t he proximity of clauses i and ii,and the words linking them any other decision suggests that congress had in mind decisions of the same genre,id.at.the dissent relies on that sentence to argue that because revocation of a visa petition approval under is not a decision of the same genre as those listed in a b i,it is not encompassed by a b ii at all.however,the dissent omits the crucial end of that sentence,those made discretionary by legislation.id.at.indeed,the court goes on to say,r ead harmoniously,both clauses convey that congress barred review of discretionary decisions only when congress itself set out the attorney general discretionary authority in the statute.id.at.to the extent the court lists the types of decisions within the character of the decisions congress enumerated in a b i,it was doing so to set up a contrast with motions to reopen,which it described as procedural device s serving to ensure that aliens a re getting a fair chance to have their claims heard,id.at second alteration in original quoting tr.of oral arg.the question of whether revocations of visa petition approvals are of a like kind was not before the court,nor did it purport to address it.id.at 
finally,our conclusion does not lead to a senseless proposition,as bernardo and the dissent suggest.some visa petition approval decisions,in particular,for certain preference visas,have been held subject to judicial review.see,soltane dep t of justice,cir holding there is judicial review of denials of visa petitions under b,which provides that v isas shall be made available to qualified special immigrants spencer,united states,cir concluding that a b ii does not preclude judicial review of the decision whether to issue a visa pursuant to b.our dissenting colleague argues that if there is judicial review of the decision not to grant a visa petition to start with,then it would be anomalous to deny judicial review of decisions to revoke petition approvals.however,the argument works the other way.
as an initial matter,assuming initial visa petition denials are reviewable,the language as to the authority to grant preference visas is substantially different than the language as to the authority to revoke visa petition approvals.compare,u.b visas shall be made available emphasis added,and b after an investigation of the facts in each case,and after consultation with the secretary of labor the attorney general shall approve the petition emphasis added with the secretary of homeland security may,at any time,for what he deems to be good and sufficient cause,revoke the approval of any petition approved by him under section of this title.indeed,congress use of the permissive may in contrasts with the legislators use of a mandatory shall in the preceding sections.lopez davis,d.the difference in these language choices supports our conclusion that congress intended to treat visa petition denials and revocations of visa petition approvals differently barnhart sigmon coal,d i t is a general principle of statutory construction that when congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.quoting russello united states,d.
in any event,the inconsistency of allowing judicial review of certain visa petition denials but not the revocation of visa petition approvals does not undermine our conclusion that that is what congress intended.see jilin,at explaining that a b is one of many provisions of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of that are aimed at protecting the executive discretion from the courts indeed,that can fairly be said to be the theme of the legislation,id.quoting reno anti discrimination,d and that congress in and expanded administrative discretion by removing the notice requirement under and by establishing that a b ii applies beyond removal proceedings,and so there is ample reason to believe that congress could have intended to bolster the discretion of the secretary of homeland security to revoke approval of petitions,id.congress has to structure and allocate the resources of our immigration system.as such,judicial review may be thought to be warranted in some,but not all,situations.further,we note that petitioners have an opportunity to respond to the noir,receive an explanation of why the petition approval was revoked,and are afforded an administrative appeal.see requiring notice of intent to revoke,the opportunity for the petitioner to offer evidence supporting the petition,an explanation of the specific reasons for the revocation,and the opportunity for the petitioner to file an administrative appeal.congress could quite sensibly have concluded that is enough 
for the reasons set forth above,the order of the district court is affirmed.
the majority holds that a decision by the secretary of homeland security secretary to revoke his prior approval of a visa petition based on objective criteria is insulated from judicial review.in my view,the secretary visa revocation decision is subject to judicial review because the text of the pertinent statutes,the nature of the visa revocation decisions,and the overall statutory scheme do not rebut the presumption of judicial review applicable to immigration statutes.hence,i respectfully dissent.
the two statutory provisions at issue are a b and of the immigration and nationality act ina.section a b provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review 
i any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section h,i,or of this title or 
ii any other decision or action of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security,other than the granting of relief under section a of this title.
the authority to revoke the approval of a visa petition is provided under.section which is not listed in a b i states that t he secretary of homeland security may,at any time,for what he deems to be good and sufficient cause,revoke the approval of any petition approved by him under section of this title.id.the approval of a visa petition,which determines only the beneficiary eligibility to apply for an immigrant visa,is governed by.hence,the question is whether a b ii applies to that is,whether congress specified visa revocation decisions to be in the discretion of the secretary with the use of the words may,at any time,deems,and good and sufficient cause.
in considering a dispute over the effect of an immigration statute,we must apply a strong presumption in favor of judicial review of administrative action.ins cyr,d see also mcnary haitian refugee,d.where the statute leaves substantial doubt about the congressional intent,block comty.nutrition,d,or even is reasonably susceptible to divergent interpretation,gutierrez de martinez lamagno,d,the presumption that executive determinations generally are subject to review controls,id.
the supreme court recent construction of a b in kucana holder,d,further informs our analysis.in that case,the court observed that a b ii speaks of authority specified not merely assumed or contemplated to be in the secretary discretion.id.at.specified,according to the court,is not synonymous with implied or anticipated rather,it means to name or state explicitly or in detail.id.quoting webster new collegiate dictionary.thus,pursuant to kucana,in resolving a dispute over the applicability of a b ii,any statutory language that falls short of state explicitly whether an assum ption or a contemplat ion of,or a statement that merely implie s or anticipate s,an exercise of discretion by the secretary fails to overcome the presumption in favor of judicial review.
statutory interpretation begins with the text of the provision at issue.see.bank germain,d.while includes the words may,at any time,and deems,which suggest an exercise of discretion,the provision also cabins these words with the phrase good and sufficient cause.if good and sufficient cause provides a legal standard that circumscribes the secretary visa revocation decision,the decision is subject to judicial review.this is so because the presence of an objective legal standard in casts doubt on whether congress specified the revocation decision to be discretionary.to put it differently,where the cumulative effect of may,at any time,deems,and good and sufficient cause is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation that congress merely anticipated visa revocation decisions to be discretionary,rather than state d so explicitly,kucana,at,internal quotation marks omitted,the presumption of judicial review should govern,and the visa revocation decisions should be subject to review.accordingly,the secretary revocation decisions are subject to judicial review if i good and sufficient cause has an established meaning that supplies objective criteria for revoking the prior approval of a visa petition,and ii the meaning of the term withstands the surrounding language may,at any time,and deems in.the text and the structure of the relevant statutory provisions demonstrate both.
good and sufficient cause objective legal criteria of good and sufficient cause 
an examination of the agency visa revocation decisions reveals that good and sufficient cause has a clear objective meaning under.in matter of ho,the board of immigration appeals bia ruled that good and sufficient cause exists under when the evidence of record at the time the decision is rendered would warrant a denial of the visa petition,bia citing matter of estime,bia see also matter of tawfik,bia.a denial of a visa petition is in turn warrant ed when the petitioner has failed to show evidence of the beneficiary or petitioner qualifications necessary for approval.see b providing that the attorney general shall approve a visa petition when he determines that the facts stated in the petition are true and the eligibility criteria are met id.b a providing that visas shall be made available for a skilled worker upon satisfaction of specified conditions specifying the required qualifications for visa petitions.accordingly,the agency may revoke a visa petition under only when the evidence necessary for approval is lacking,and hence a denial is warranted.
such evidence consists of objective documentation.as to visa petitions,the evidence comprises documents substantiating the beneficiary prior employment and educational background,as described either in the labor or in the agency regulations and guidance.see instructions for petition for alien worker uscis hereinafter i petition manual see also stewart infra red commissary of,coomey,cir holding that,where applicable,the terms of the labor certification are binding on the agency in terms of which qualifications need to be shown.
for example,for a skilled worker visa petition,such as the one filed on behalf of freitas,the petitioner must submit documents demonstrating the beneficiary education,training,or experience as stipulated in the labor certification.l ii b i petition manual,at entry.the labor certification further breaks down each of the qualification areas roughly into duration,duration of the beneficiary highest formal education and prior work,specified by the employer as necessary for the job and nature of the experience,description of the prior job title and work duties,which the employer has also specified as necessary for the requested position see eta form,at alien information alien work experience.
accordingly,in assessing whether there is good and sufficient cause to revoke an visa petition,the agency examines,for instance,letters from employers and other similar documentation to determine whether the beneficiary has the requisite qualifications.see l ii a see also in re identifying information redacted by agency hereinafter iira,wl,at aao,finding that the record fails to support the beneficiary claimed high school attendance and the required two years of prior work experience in re iira,wl,at aao,affirming the revocation,inter alia,because the petitioner did not submit evidence that the beneficiary has the education required by the terms of the labor certification.here,similarly,the agency revoked the prior approval of the visa petition filed on behalf of freitas because the inconsistent documents did not evidence the two years of experience in the offered position or the related occupation of,appellants add.at,a fact that would have warranted denial in the first place matter of ho,at.
objective legal criteria also govern visa petitions approved under.in determining the necessary familial relationships,the agency relies on objective documentation,such as a marriage certificate or a birth certificate.see also instructions for form i,petition for alien relative,at uscis.further,where the denial of visa petitions turns on the validity of a marriage,see c,the agency examines the relevant evidence under the substantial and probative standard.matter of tawfik,at.indeed,with the benefit of the applicable legal standard and objective factual evidence,numerous courts have reviewed the agency denials of visa petitions based on marriage fraud.see gupta att y,cv orl,wl,at.july,applying matter of tawfik in reviewing the denial of a visa petition based on marriage fraud zemeka holder,d,applying the substantial and probative standard in reviewing the denial of a petition based on marriage fraud matter of arias,bia reversing a revocation decision based on marriage fraud because,under the good and sufficient cause standard,s pecific,concrete facts are meaningful,not unsupported speculation and conjecture.
congress adoption of the objective legal criteria established by good and sufficient cause 
the fact that the agency has interpreted good and sufficient cause as prescribing objective legal criteria is,of course,only an antecedent to the determination that congress shared that interpretation of.here,the relevant legislative background provides the bridge.it is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that,when congress employs a term of art,it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken.molzof united states,d quoting morissette united states.the absence of contrary direction may be taken as satisfaction with widely accepted definitions,not as a departure from them.morissette,at.where,as demonstrated below,congress has reenacted the relevant statute against the backdrop of a agency interpretation of that statute,the related canon of legislative ratification also applies.that is,congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it a statute without change.lorillard pons,d.
the two canons of statutory interpretation apply in tandem in this case.the good and sufficient cause standard,as defined in matter of estime and matter of ho,see supra section.a,has consistently been applied by the agency in decisions involving visa petition denials and revocations.see matter of tawfik,at in re iira,wl,at aao,in re iira,wl,at aao july,in re iira,wl,at aao,in re iira,wl,at aao,in re iira,wl,at aao.since those decisions,congress has revisited twice,first in when congress enacted a b as part of the comprehensive illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,and most recently in.see,g a,stat,c,stat.in the reenactment,congress took a closer look at the language of,removing two sentences from the section that required prior notice to the petitioner,while keeping intact the phrase good and sufficient cause.see stat.at.
the consistent agency application of good and sufficient cause prior to the reenactments of suggests that the phrase was understood as a term of art in the immigration context,and particularly with respect to visa petitions.indeed,contrary to the majority argument,good and sufficient cause need not have been rooted in centuries of practice to be deemed a term of art in the relevant statutory context.in sullivan stroop,d,the supreme court held that the phrase child support,which appeared in a statute undefined,is a term of art because it has an accepted meaning in common legal usage and amongst a ttorneys who have practiced in the area of domestic relations law.similarly,in gustafson alloyd,d,the court held that the word prospectus is a term of art because it has a well understood meaning in the relevant area of law securities law,even though the statute in which the word appears defined the word more generally than the particularized meaning associated with that term of art.the court thus adopted that meaning of the word.these cases indicate that,where a phrase has a unique,meaning within the relevant statutory context,the phrase need not have been rooted in centuries of practice in the common law for congress to understand it as a term of 
here,we have good reasons to assume that,at the relevant points in time,congress was aware of the particularized meaning of good and sufficient cause,as interpreted and applied by the agency.first,unlike in molina ins,cir breyer,where we were hesitant to apply the legislative ratification canon because the agency interpretation of the statute was unclear,the good and sufficient cause standard has consistently been applied by the agency since matter of estime and matter of ho.second,there is contextual evidence that congress was uniquely aware of the phrase good and sufficient cause as a term of art in.section is the only provision of the ina in which good and sufficient cause is used,while other provisions in the statute reference standards drawn from the term constituent words,such as good cause,reasonable cause,or sufficient cause,often with repetition see sullivan,at w here a phrase in a statute appears to have become a term of art,any attempt to break down the term into its constituent words is not apt to illuminate its meaning.see also united states graham,cir construing the statutory term aggravated felony as a term of art because,inter alia,the phrase includes misdemeanors in its definitional scope the fact that congress retained good and sufficient cause in through two reenactments,when it clearly knew how to depart from the term uniquely associated meaning,reinforces the conclusion that congress understood good and sufficient cause as a term of art in the visa revocation context.
the majority contends that the legislative ratification rule does not apply to this case because there is no evidence in the legislative history that congress affirmatively sought to ratify the agency interpretation of a statute.but the affirmative indication in legislative history is not a doctrinal requirement.the supreme court has not explicitly held so in more than a century of articulating the legislative ratification canon.see united states cerecedo hermanos y compania.t he reenactment by congress,without change,of a statute which had previously received long continued executive construction,is an adoption by congress of such construction.lorillard,at holding that the presumption of legislative ratification attaches where there is an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute,and congress that statute without change commodity futures trading comm schor,d it is well established that when congress revisits a statute giving rise to a longstanding administrative interpretation without pertinent change,the congressional failure to revise or repeal the agency interpretation is persuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one intended by congress.quoting nlrb bell aerospace,d 
nor have we held that affirmative indication in legislative history is required for the legislative ratification canon to apply.the only case cited by the majority molina,at does not suggest to the contrary.our statement in molina congressional reenactment of statutory language does not normally or automatically indicate a legislative intent to freeze all agency interpretations of language,id.at is inextricably tied to our reasoning that a court should be cautious about inferring legislative ratification where,as in that case,there is ambiguity in the agency interpretations of the relevant statutes.see id.the case before us presents a particularly weak case for implying congressional intent because the application of the ins rule was unclear.indeed,we held in molina that,where the agency has inconsistently applied the statute,congressional silence does not show a congressional intent to prevent subsequent agency clarification of its interpretation.id.emphasis added.we have no such inconsistent application of the relevant statute here.
to the extent that some affirmative indication from congress is helpful in confirming that congress in fact ratified the agency interpretation of a statute,the circumstances of the two reenactments of provide guidance.in merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith curran,the court held that the fact that a comprehensive reexamination and significant amendment of the statute left intact the statutory provisions at issue is itself evidence that congress affirmatively intended to preserve the challenged interpretation,d emphasis added.we have such affirmative intent in this case.if congress wanted to specif y the visa revocation decisions to be in the discretion of the secretary,it could have done so in,when it reenacted with the passage of iirira,or in,when it reenacted while removing other language from the same section.on either occasion,congress could have,for instance,enumerated in a b i or eliminated the phrase good and sufficient cause from.congress also could have added clearly discretionary language in a familiar tool that congress used in other provisions of the ina see,c providing that the attorney general may,in his discretion,admit any refugee determined to be of special humanitarian concern to the united states a a viii providing that the bar on citizens convicted of certain offenses against a minor filing a visa petition shall not apply,if the secretary,in his sole and unreviewable discretion,waives the bar.but congress did none of these things.instead,congress did not include in a b i and kept the good and sufficient cause standard in the only provision of the ina in which the phrase is used 
surrounding statutory language 
seemingly unperturbed by the dissonance between their construction of the statutory language and the agency application of it,my colleagues ignore the good and sufficient cause standard because it is modified by what he deems to be in.to focus on good and sufficient cause,according to the majority reasoning,would fail to give effect to the preceding word deems.my colleagues are not alone in this view.the third circuit has observed that t he phrase for what the secretary deems to be good and sufficient cause,can not be modified by judicial fiat to read the naked words,for good and sufficient cause.jilin pharm.usa,chertoff,cir alteration in original.
a failure to interpret good and sufficient cause,however,would be just as much an act of judicial fiat as ignoring the arguably discretionary words in.more importantly,recognizing that good and sufficient cause prescribes objective legal criteria that govern the revocation decisions is not incompatible with an understanding that may,at any time,and deems reserve certain administrative discretion to the secretary.as kucana instructs,it does not suffice for statutory language to contemplate or anticipate an exercise of discretion.to overcome the presumption of judicial review,the language has to be explicit,unencumbered by any ambiguity over congress intent.at see also ins doherty,d scalia,concurring in part,dissenting in part even discretion,however,has limits.
the cumulative effect of may,at any time,deems,and good and sufficient cause does not evince the level of clarity required to overcome that presumption.of the three language choices relied on by the majority,the only one that qualifies the effect of good and sufficient cause is the word deems.but deems in the combined phrase what he deems to be good and sufficient cause only allows the secretary to determine whether factual grounds exist to satisfy the good and sufficient cause standard,to warrant denial of the visa petition,not what the standard should mean in each individual circumstance.see ana int l,way,cir holding that the secretary has discretion to decide the specific factual ground upon which a particular visa is to be revoked,not the general principles under which individual decisions to revoke a visa should be made.
the majority resorts to a sleight of hand in proposing a contrary interpretation.without analyzing the interplay between the two phrases,the majority subsumes good and sufficient cause under deems,and concludes that deems defined as to sit in judgment upon indicates that what constitutes good and sufficient cause is within the secretary discretion.see ana int l,at tallman,dissenting not only does the secretary decide whether good and sufficient cause exists,he decides what constitutes such cause in the first place.jilin,at quoting the dissent in ana int l.but the word deems can not nullify the established meaning of good and sufficient cause that the relevant agency has applied for almost three decades,and that formed the backdrop against which congress reenacted.
the primary case that the majority cites in support of this reading is inapposite.the majority argues that deems in,like deem in webster doe,d,forecloses the application of any meaningful judicial standard of review.but the statutes at issue are not equivalent.in webster,the relevant statutory provision,section c of the national security act,provided that the director of the central intelligence agency may,in his discretion,terminate the employment of any officer or employee of the agency whenever he shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the united states.at emphasis added.hence,the statute in webster specified,or state d explicitly,kucana,at,that the decision to terminate an employee of the agency is in the director discretion.indeed,while the use of the word discretion in a statute is not necessary to insulate the underlying decision from judicial review,the presence of it is sufficient.
moreover,the judgment call contemplated in webster determining what is in the interests of the united states requires on its face a assessment that is categorically different from a determination of good and sufficient cause.with the former,a qualitative comparison of individual circumstances produces,by necessity,a spectrum of outcomes,an individual continued employment is more or less in the interests of the united states according to different considerations in play.the latter inquiry,by contrast,is predicated on binary outcomes,either freitas has worked in a managerial or supervisory capacity for two years,or he has not 
the webster court reasoning further crystallizes this distinction.the court observed that,s hort of permitting of the director concerning his views of the nation security and whether the discharged employee was inimical to those interests,we see no basis on which a reviewing court could properly assess an agency termination decision.at.here,there is no need to e the secretary.the revocation decision is based on objective evidence,such as a letter from an employer.the third circuit one of the early circuits to reject judicial review for visa revocation decisions made a similar misstatement,noting that to allow review would require courts to test whether the secretary genuinely deemed the proffered cause to be good and sufficient.jilin,at.again,where the relevant documentation is shown,good and sufficient cause does not give the secretary discretion to revoke his prior approval,regardless of how genuine his belief may be.in the end,it is the very rule of statutory construction cited by the majority significance and effect shall,if possible,be accorded to every word.mkt.hoffman.that dictates a different interpretation of the interplay between deems and good and sufficient cause.
the other language choices that the majority invokes may and at any time do not suggest otherwise.the supreme court has noted in a landmark immigration case that,while may suggests discretion,it does not necessarily suggest unlimited discretion.zadvydas davis,d even the majority acknowledges that the meaning of may is by no means invariable and can be defeated by indications of legislative intent to the contrary or by obvious inferences from the structure and purpose of the statute.united states rodgers,d.here,the construct of makes clear that what the secretary may do is restricted by the good and sufficient cause standard.kucana,at explaining that congress explicitly carved out as an exception to a b ii because which governs the granting of asylum relief provides that the attorney general may grant asylum without specifying any legal standard similarly,while at any time affords administrative flexibility to the secretary in determining when to revoke the prior approval,it does not undermine the good and sufficient cause standard,nor does it frustrate the objective nature of evaluating whether the standard has been met.
finally,in emphasizing may,at any time,and deems,my colleagues place substantial weight on the fact that these constitute three language choices,as opposed to,say,one or two.but the numerical count of the discretionary words in is a red herring.because the presumption of judicial review applies,need only reveal that the cumulative effect of the four language choices good and sufficient cause included is reasonably susceptible to divergent interpretation,gutierrez de martinez,at.that is to say,while good and sufficient cause is but a single phrase,it is sufficient to sustain the presumption of judicial review,as long as it prescribes an objective legal standard that curtails the secretary discretion.
the availability of judicial review in an immigration statute has often depended on whether there is a meaningful legal standard that guides the administrative decision and the potential subsequent review by courts.even for judgments that are enumerated in a b i as not subject to judicial review,courts have reviewed an agency predicate application of a statute where the application turns on a statutory term that has a defined,objective meaning.see,montero martinez ashcroft,cir reviewing a discretionary denial of cancellation of removal under,where the decision concerned an application of a defined statutory term,child.by contrast,where the statutory term that provides the basis for the agency decision has no objective meaning,courts have construed the decision as purely discretionary and thus precluded from judicial review.see portillo rendon holder,cir holding that a denial of cancellation of removal is not reviewable because good moral character the lack of which provided a basis for the denial is not define d in the statute romero torres ashcroft,cir finding that a denial of cancellation of removal based on the absence of extreme hardship is not subject to judicial review because the language of the phrase itself commits the determination to the opinion of the attorney general internal quotation mark omitted.because good and sufficient cause prescribes a meaningful legal standard,unaltered by the surrounding words in,i conclude that the applicable presumption of review should control,and that judicial review should be available for visa revocation decisions.
the structure of a b bolsters the conclusion that i draw from the text of the relevant statutes in kucana,the supreme court noted that t he proximity of clauses i and ii in a b,and the words linking them any other decision suggest that congress had in mind decisions of the same genre in both clauses.at.while the kucana court initially relied on the proximity comparison to emphasize that both clauses encompass only decisions made discretionary by legislation,not by regulations,the court immediately extended the comparison to the decisions enumerated as discretionary in a b i and the decisions rendered discretionary by the text of a b ii.thus,in determining what decisions may be precluded from judicial review under a b ii,the court found significant the character of the decisions congress enumerated in a b i.id.at.those decisions include waivers of inadmissibility based on certain criminal offenses,h,or based on fraud or misrepresentation,i cancellation of removal,permission for voluntary departure,and adjustment of status.id.at.they are,in other words,substantive decisions made by the executive as a matter of grace decisions that involve whether al
