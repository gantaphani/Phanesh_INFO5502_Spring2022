anar rafiyev petitions for review of two decisions of the board of immigration appeals.the first decision denied rafiyev applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat,and determined that his application for asylum was frivolous.the second decision denied rafiyev motion to reopen based on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel.we deny the petition in,but grant the petition in and remand that case for further consideration.
in july,rafiyev traveled to the united states using a visa for a nonimmigrant exchange visitor.in december,his visa status was converted to student,on the condition that he enroll at an educational institution.when rafiyev never enrolled in school,the department of homeland security dhs began proceedings to remove him to his native country of azerbaijan.rafiyev conceded that he was subject to removal for violating the conditions of his visa,but filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.rafiyev claimed that he and his family had been subjected to persecution by the azerbaijan government on account of their armenian nationality and membership in a particular social group,and that he had a well founded fear that he would be persecuted if he returned to azerbaijan.
an immigration judge ij denied rafiyev applications for relief after finding that rafiyev was completely,utterly not credible.the ij found that six documents submitted by rafiyev were fraudulent.these documents were a birth certificate from the,a birth certificate from azerbaijan,a death certificate for rafiyev mother,a death certificate for rafiyev brother,a medical record,and a police report.relying on in re,bia,the ij concluded that the counterfeit documents not only discredited rafiyev claims concerning identity and nationality,but also supported a finding that his overall claim was not credible.the ij further found that the filing of six fraudulent documents in support of an application for asylum qualified as the filing of a frivolous application,and that rafiyev therefore should be barred permanently from receiving any immigration benefit from the united states.see d.in connection with her decision that rafiyev did not qualify for asylum,the ij also found that united states government officials complied with regulations addressing the confidentiality of asylum applications during their overseas investigation of rafiyev documents.see.as such,the ij implicitly rejected any contention by rafiyev that a violation of the confidentiality provisions provided a new and independent basis for asylum.see averianova mukasey,cir.
on administrative appeal,the bureau of immigration appeals bia concluded that even accepting rafiyev arguments regarding two of the six documents cited by the ij,the medical record and the police report,he had not raised meritorious challenges regarding the remaining four documents found to be fraudulent.the bia thus found no reason to disturb the ij adverse credibility finding or her finding that rafiyev filed a frivolous application.the bia also found no reason to set aside the ij conclusion that government officials did not breach the confidentiality regulations.
rafiyev then filed a motion to reopen the proceedings,alleging that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his appeal to the bia.the bia found that rafiyev specific allegations of ineffective assistance were not supported by the record,and therefore denied the motion to reopen.
in dismissing rafiyev administrative appeal on his asylum claim,the bia did not expressly adopt the decision of the ij,and declined to accept certain portions of it.the bia did say,however,that rafiyev had raised no meritorious challenge to the ij findings that four disputed documents were fraudulent,and that the board found no reason to disturb the ij credibility findings.we read the bia opinion,therefore,to adopt the ij reasoning in relevant part,and we thus consider both the bia opinion and the decision of the ij in our review.see setiadi gonzales,cir.administrative findings of fact,including findings on credibility,are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b see singh gonzales,cir.the bia discretionary decision to deny asylum is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.b d.
a claim for asylum may be rejected solely on the ground that the applicant claim is not credible.falaja gonzales,cir.the bia or an ij may reach an adverse credibility determination based on the applicant submission of fraudulent documents,if the petitioner fails to offer a legitimate explanation for the suspected fraud.onsongo mukasey,cir.in reaching that credibility finding,the agency must give reasons that are specific enough that a reviewing court can appreciate the reasoning behind the decision and cogent enough that a reasonable adjudicator would not be compelled to reach the contrary conclusion.chen mukasey,cir internal citation omitted.
substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the bia conclusion that at least four documents submitted by rafiyev were fraudulent.the dhs presented testimony from a forensics document examiner that the birth certificate submitted by rafiyev was counterfeit,because it did not include a watermark that would appear on a genuine birth certificate,and because it was printed using a color inkjet printer rather than a continuous line offset type printing used on the genuine articles.the dhs also presented results of an investigation by the united states embassy in azerbaijan showing that rafiyev azerbaijan birth certificate and the two azerbaijan death certificates were fraudulent.this evidence included a finding that the language used in the certificates was not the official language,and that the seals applied to the certificates did not match official seals.the embassy also reported that the signature on the birth certificate did not match an exemplar from the person who would have signed such a document in,and that the woman who purportedly signed the death certificates said the signatures appearing on those documents were not hers.the investigation further revealed that there were no recorded incidents in the office registration books that match those described on the death certificates.
rafiyev testified in response that he relied on his father to provide documents in support of his claim,and that he had no knowledge about any fabrication.he also suggested that the ministry of internal affairs in azerbaijan,which produces documents of these nature,probably gave him counterfeit records,because the ministry was hostile to persons of armenian descent,and sought to cause trouble for him if he emigrated.rafiyev alleged that the ministry had persecuted him and his family,and he portrayed the alleged provision of flawed documents as a continuation of this mistreatment.even assuming nefarious activity by the azerbaijan government is a plausible explanation for the three fraudulent azerbaijan documents cited by the bia,however,rafiyev theory does not compel the conclusion that the ij and the bia erred by declining to accept it,because the alternative conclusion was also reasonable.nor does rafiyev suspicion about the actions of the azerbaijan government provide any explanation for the birth certificate that the ij and the bia also found to be counterfeit.accordingly,we conclude that the bia credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence.
rafiyev also argues that the bia erroneously concluded that the government complied with the federal regulation concerning confidentiality when processing his asylum application.the regulation provides that i nformation contained in or pertaining to any asylum application shall not be disclosed without the written consent of the applicant.a.the dhs transmitted several documents related to rafiyev application to the united states embassy in baku,azerbaijan,for verification,and this disclosure was consistent with the confidentiality regulation.id.c.rafiyev argues,however,that there is a distinct possibility that confidentiality was breached during th
