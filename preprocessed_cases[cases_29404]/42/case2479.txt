steeve shamoil youkhana,an assyrian christian,fled iraq in and sought asylum in the united states,claiming that he had been persecuted by the ruling party regime on the basis of his religion,ethnicity,and political opinion.the immigration judge ij who considered youkhana case found his testimony generally credible,but failed altogether to address youkhana religious and ethnic persecution claims.with respect only to his political opinion claim,the ij concluded that youkhana had indeed been persecuted for his refusal to join the party.this past persecution,however,was not enough to establish a basis for a fear of future persecution,because the party had been removed from power by the invasion of iraq.the ij thus denied youkhana claim.the board of immigration appeals bia summarily affirmed.
although we see no legally supported reason to disagree with the ij resolution of youkhana claim of persecution based on political opinion,we conclude that the bia erred by denying youkhana religious and ethnic persecution claims without discussion.we therefore grant youkhana petition for review and remand so that the bia can address these claims.
youkhana is an assyrian christian and a member of the chaldean catholic church.according to the state department country report on human rights in iraq,followers of the christian faith make up a small and shrinking minority of the population in iraq percent of iraqis are muslim,and the number of christians in iraq has decreased dramatically in recent years.in addition to being identified as members of a minority religion,assyrian and chaldean christians are considered by other iraqis to constitute a distinct ethnic minority.
in march,youkhana attempted to enter the united states at a border crossing in san ysidro,california,having already unsuccessfully attempted to apply for asylum in the united states from mexico.immigration officials stopped him at the border when he admitted that he did not possess a valid visa,they issued him a notice to appear.in june,youkhana moved for and was granted a change of venue for his immigration proceedings from san diego to chicago.in july,youkhana filed for asylum.
the asylum hearing took place on may,two months after the invasion of iraq,but prior to the capture of former iraqi president saddam hussein.the principal basis of youkhana asylum claim consisted of three incidents in which he was arrested and detained by authorities in iraq,allegedly because of his religion,ethnicity,and political opinion.in addition to his own testimony regarding these incidents,several aspects of youkhana claims were corroborated by the testimony of his sister,eilina shamoil youkhana,who is a legal permanent resident of the united states.
youkhana testified that he was first arrested in while in his final year of high school.in his written asylum statement,he explained that he and two of his assyrian friends were approached by government officials and accused of making derogatory comments about the party and saddam hussein.in his oral testimony,youkhana elaborated that the detention occurred because he refused to join the party and because i was assyrian christian,and they used to brand us as enemies of the party because we are christians,and we go to the church,and we have relations with parties opposing the regime.during days in custody,youkhana was interrogated and beaten.upon his release,he was required to sign a statement that he would not participate in any activities.
in,while undertaking compulsory service in the iraqi army,youkhana was arrested again,this time for allegedly throwing dirt at a picture of saddam hussein.while detained,youkhana was beaten about the head until he lost consciousness,leaving a scar behind his ear.before being released,youkhana was required to sign another statement,this one stating that he would be executed if he ever again participated in activity.
finally,in,while still in the army,youkhana was arrested and accused of assisting the escape of an assyrian prisoner charged with illegally selling fuel in the north of iraq.testifying in immigration court,youkhana denied the charge and explained that he was singled out for punishment only because the authorities wanted to stick this charge to me because i was assyrian christian,and because i was not a member of the party.again he was badly beaten about the head.after two days he managed to escape detention,at which point he decided to leave iraq.
the ij questioned youkhana and his sister at length about the removal of the party regime from power and the relevance of this fact to youkhana claim that he would be persecuted if he returned to iraq.youkhana testified that he remained at risk of persecution because members of the party remained active in iraq.he also explained that assyrian christians faced a new threat of persecution from muslim radicals who,youkhana testified,brand us christians as dirty infidels.this latter point was supported by several newspaper articles attached to youkhana asylum application.a typical article stated that christians throughout iraq are feeling intimidated and t hey say they are being harassed and threatened by members of shiite muslim groups who are grabbing power and who appear eager to transform iraq into an islamic republic.michael slackman robin dixon,shiite gains trouble christians,the detroit news,may,at.
in addition to his questions regarding country conditions in iraq,the ij made a number of unusual statements suggesting that youkhana had a duty to return to iraq to assist in the dismantling of the party regime.the ij inquired,for example,whether youkhana thought he could be of help to the forces in finding the bad,evil party people,and stated that t he government of iraq probably needs people like you.finally,in denying asylum to youkhana,the ij dressed his decision in patriotic garb,stating the government of iraq,particularly the party,have been removed at great expense in terms of lives of the coalition forces as well as the iraqi people.to ignore the effort that has gone into removing the party would be a significant injustice to all of those lives that were lost in freeing iraq from its persecutors.the ij also denied youkhana applications for withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture.regarding the latter claim,the ij reasoned that g iven the fact that there is no government of iraq any longer,it can not be stated that the government of iraq would persecute or treat the respondent in a cruel or inhumane manner.
youkhana appealed the denial of his asylum application to the bia,contending that the ij had failed to address his religious and ethnic persecution claims at all,had erred in not considering that conditions in iraq have changed for the worst sic in iraq for the christians,and placed the respondent in a most uncomfortable situation,in effect requesting that he join the military in iraq.the bia affirmed without opinion pursuant to e.after filing this petition for review,youkhana filed a motion to reopen with the bia,attaching further documentation of deteriorating conditions in iraq for assyrian christians.the bia denied this motion as well.youkhana did not file a second petition for review challenging the denial of his motion to reopen.
in this petition for review,youkhana contends that the bia erred by refusing to consider the religious and ethnic persecution aspects of his asylum claim and denying his request for relief under the convention against torture.he does not contest the bia denial of his claims for relief insofar as they rested on persecution based on his political opinion.youkhana also argues that the bia abused its discretion by refusing to grant his motion to reopen.we consider each of his claims in turn.
a petitioner seeking asylum carries the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that she suffered past persecution or has a fear of future persecution on account of her race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.sosnovskaia gonzales,cir.an applicant who has been found to have established past persecution shall also be presumed to have a fear of persecution on t
