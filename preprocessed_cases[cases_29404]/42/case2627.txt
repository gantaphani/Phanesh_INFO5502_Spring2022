on april,ameritrust mortgage corporation,prospective employer,filed an immigrant petition for alien worker classification on behalf and sought permanent resident status for him pursuant to the ina on august,the ins approved ameritrust petition on behalf of.shortly thereafter,on september,filed a new application for permanent resident status,which was premised on the ins recent acceptance of ameritrust approved visa petition for alien worker classification.
in order to process this application,the ins commenced an investigation of to assess whether he was qualified for a permanent resident visa.when undertaking this investigation,the agency looked into marriage with nadia muna and discovered some,that he never cohabited with his former wife,and,thus,they never consummated their marriage,and,further,that they possessed no joint,marital assets.relying on this information,the ins concluded that marriage to muna was a sham,undertaken for the purpose of evading immigration laws.see c.accordingly,on december,the ins informed ameritrust of its intent to revoke the approved immigrant petition for alien worker,stating that,a ccording to the service investigation,the marriage between and muna was a sham and was entered into for the purpose of procuring an immigration benefit.on may,ameritrust and responded to the ins notice of its intent to revoke his visa petition,arguing that his marriage was legitimate.maintained that,as an arranged marriage under the islamic faith,it was perfectly proper for the consummation of his marriage to be delayed and for him not to live immediately with his wife.furthermore,he argued that the marriage was genuine and that his wife was not pressured into filing the immigration petition on his behalf.he offered affidavits from himself,his former wife parents,his friends,and experts on the islamic religion testifying to this effect,although no affidavit was presented from his former wife.
on november,the ins issued a decision formally revoking previously approved worker visa because,based on its review of all the evidence submitted,it found that the plaintiff failed to establish a bona fide commitment to his wife during the entire course of their marriage.in particular,the ins noted that e ven though the marriage was an arranged marriage,failed to establish any commitment to his marital union other than filing for adjustment of status.that same day,the ins also denied his accompanying adjustment of status application on the basis that,once his worker visa petition was revoked,there existed no basis upon which to adjust his status.the ins authority to revoke the plaintiff approved visa petition resides in,which states that t he attorney general may,at any time,for what he deems to be good and sufficient cause,revoke the approval of any petition approved by him under section of this title emphasis added,including visa petitions provided for under b.
