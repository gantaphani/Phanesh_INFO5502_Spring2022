petitioner hasim husic,a native of the former yugoslavia and citizen of montenegro,seeks review of a february,decision of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the september,decision of an immigration judge ij sagerman,which ordered husic removal,denied his request for a waiver of inadmissibility under immigration and nationality act ina h,h,and denied his request for a continuance.in re hasim husic,no,aff g no.
this case presents an issue of first impression in this circuit whether an alien who lawfully entered the country without lawful permanent resident lpr status but later adjusted to lpr status is eligible to seek a waiver of inadmissibility under ina h.we join seven sister circuits and find that an alien like husic is unambiguously not an alien who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.ina h,h.husic is therefore eligible to seek a waiver under ina h if the attorney general chooses to exercise favorable discretion.husic concedes,however,that his challenge to the denial of his request for a continuance is moot.accordingly,we grant the petition in part,vacate husic removal order to permit his application for a waiver of inadmissibility under h,dismiss the remainder of the petition as moot,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
petitioner is a year old native of the former yugoslavia and citizen of montenegro.he entered the united states as a b visitor on or about july,was subsequently granted political asylum in,and became an lpr on july,based upon an application for adjustment of status.husic wife of years is also an lpr.he and his wife are the parents of three children,two lprs and a citizen.
on or about august,husic pleaded guilty to violating new york penal law,attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.he was sentenced to three years incarceration.
then,on or about february,husic was served with a notice to appear.he was charged with removability pursuant to ina a c and a a iii.removal proceedings commenced before the ij.husic eventually admitted to the allegations in the notice to appear,admitted the charge of removability based on a firearms offense,and denied the two removal charges based on aggravated felonies.counsel then informed the ij of husic intention to apply for a waiver under ina h b.
on september,the ij issued an oral decision.he held that husic conviction constituted an aggravated felony under both ina a f and a u.the ij further held that,although husic expressed his desire to apply for adjustment of status under section of the ina with a waiver of inadmissibility under section h,husic was not eligible for such relief because he is an lpr who has been convicted of an aggravated felony and therefore can not obtain the necessary waiver under section h,as is the prevailing view of the immigration laws here in the second circuit.special app.finally,the ij denied husic motion for a continuance to pursue a collateral attack of the conviction.
husic appealed to the bia,and on february,the bia dismissed the appeal,largely adopting the ij reasoning.the instant petition for review was timely filed on february,
discussion 
on appeal,husic challenges the ij and bia decisions finding that he is ineligible for adjustment of status under ina because he was convicted of an aggravated felony and is therefore ineligible for a h waiver and denying his application for a continuance to pursue relief.
we review questions of law de novo,but must give appropriate deference under chevron,natural resources defense council chevron,to the board interpretation of the ina.ganzhi holder,cir per curiam.
husic eligibility for a waiver under ina h 
we first consider whether the ij and bia erred in finding that husic is ineligible to seek a waiver of inadmissibility under ina h the critical issue is whether husic is an alien who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.ina h,h.if he is such an alien,he is statutorily barred from seeking a h waiver,but if he is not,he would be able to seek that discretionary relief.
by way of background,husic requests a discretionary adjustment of status under ina a.to be eligible for such adjustment,however,he must,inter alia,be admissible to the united states for permanent residence.a.to determine husic admissibility,we turn to the requirements contained in ina.the parties agree that he is inadmissible under a,presumably because husic has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude other than a purely political offense or an attempt or conspiracy to commit such a crime.id.a a i i.nevertheless,husic might be eligible to seek a waiver of his inadmissibility under h b because he is the spouse of an lpr and the parent of both a citizen and two lprs.section h b provides that the attorney general may,in his discretion,waive a bar on admissibility based on a a i i if removal would result in extreme hardship to the united states citizen or lawfully resident spouse,parent,son,or daughter of such alien.id.h b.i n the case of an alien who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,however,a waiver is barred if since the date of such admission the alien has been convicted of an aggravated felony.id.h.
the ina also defines two sets of terms contained in h that are central to this petition.ina a a provides that t he terms admission and admitted mean,with respect to an alien,the lawful entry of the alien into the united states after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.id.a a.additionally,ina a defines the term lawfully admitted for permanent residence as the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the united states as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws,such status not having changed.id.a.
husic contends that although he was convicted of an aggravated felony,the h bar does not apply to him because he is not an alien who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.he reasons that he was admitted to the united states as a visitor,and not as an lpr,and therefore attained lpr status through adjustment of status,rather than when he was admitted into the country.seven of our sister circuits have held that a person in husic position is eligible to seek a waiver of inadmissibility based upon the plain language of h.see,hanif att y,cir bracamontes holder,cir martinez mukasey,cir stanovsek holder,cir papazoglou holder,cir negrete ramirez holder,cir lanier att y,cir.but see roberts holder,cir per curiam holding that this provision is ambiguous and that the bia interpretation is reasonable.relying on these cases and a textual analysis of the provisions at issue,husic argues that h has been made unavailable only to an alien who was admitted as an lpr,rather than one who,like husic,adjusted to lpr status once already in the united states after lawful entry as a visitor.
in response,the government contends that husic is barred from seeking a h waiver because the bia reasonably interpreted the ambiguous provision to find that husic is an alien who has previously been admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.under the bia interpretation,husic was admitted to the united states as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence when he obtained lpr status following the approval of his application for adjustment of status.in support of its view,the government relies on the one circuit decision adopting its view,see roberts,as well as intratextual arguments,legislative history,and a purposive invocation to avoid absurd results.
we afford chevron deference to the bia interpretations of statutes when those interpretations are issued as binding,published decisions.see ganzhi,at.while the bia decision in this case was a decision,we have previously held that where the challenged unpublished decision relies on a binding published decision,chevron deference will extend to that earlier decision reasonable resolution
