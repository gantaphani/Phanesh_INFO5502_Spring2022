the question in this asylum case is whether the immigration judge properly applied the corroboration rule,under which an asylum applicant may be required to present evidence corroborating her testimony even when that testimony is deemed credible.the test,as set forth by the board of immigration appeals,hinges on whether it is reasonable to expect the applicant to produce particular pieces of evidence.because we conclude that the rule was unreasonably applied in this case,we grant the petition for review.
the petitioners,evguenia gontcharova and her daughter ksenia kidanova,are from kaliningrad,the westernmost province of russia.they arrived in the united states in august as visitors.a year later,they applied for asylum and withholding of deportation,claiming that they were persecuted in kaliningrad because of the whistleblowing activities of evguenia husband,andrei kidanov.
according to the narrative accompanying evguenia and ksenia asylum application,their family was targeted for persecution after andrei,a tax inspector,discovered evidence of widespread corruption involving the appropriation of public resources by a firm with close ties to the province governor.in the face of his agency unwillingness to pursue an investigation,andrei made copies of the incriminating documents and hid them at the home of his sister,lena.andrei repeated efforts to draw attention to the corruption led to threats against him and his family,raids on his home,and his eventual involuntary commitment to a mental hospital as an alleged schizophrenic.
earlier,andrei had discussed his findings with his wife,evguenia.while andrei was hospitalized,she and lena continued trying to publicize the situation,and they succeeded in getting a story published in a local opposition newspaper.soon after that,the newspaper offices were destroyed by arson and its editor was severely beaten.evguenia family was also targeted a motorcycle ran her son vladislav down,breaking his legs,and an anonymous caller told her that her daughter might suffer a similar attack.
at andrei request,evguenia and ksenia left kaliningrad in august,entering the united states on tourist visas.andrei and vladislav were both still hospitalized.evguenia hoped that the situation in kaliningrad would eventually return to normal,but instead things got worse.andrei was released from the hospital,only to be discovered dead a few months later.his body was found doused in vodka on the floor of his sister lena home,which suggested to evguenia that he had been anonymous caller had earlier threatened her that an assailant might exploit her husband weak heart by pour ing a glass of vodka into him and he will be done.soon after andrei death,his sister lena was found hanging from a noose.other family members met comparable fates lena husband was arrested and imprisoned,and vladislav disappeared altogether.
at their asylum hearing,evguenia and ksenia testified concerning the events described in their application and submitted background documentation concerning the political conditions and the widespread corruption in kaliningrad.they also submitted several documents pertaining to their specific situation,including andrei kidanov death certificate,identifying the cause of death as alcoholic cardiomyopathy a formal request from the federal tax police for an evaluation of andrei professional fitness from the vtek commission apparently some sort of ethics review board and a letter from irina bulatova,a former coworker of andrei who still lived in kaliningrad.
during evguenia and ksenia asylum hearing,the immigration judge occasionally expressed skepticism about their story of persecution.nevertheless,the ij found that their testimony was consistent with their written statement,and that the background information they provided adequately established the existence of widespread corruption.the ij did not,however,make an explicit finding as to whether the testimony was credible.instead,his analysis focused on the lack of evidence corroborating their claims,specifically their claim that andrei was killed because of his efforts to expose governmental corruption.the ij explained why he considered the documents they provided to be inadequate 
with the exception of the letter from irina bulatova,there is no evidence to indicate that kidanov was employed by the russian internal revenue service.a review of the letter generally mentions kidanov death.there is not enough information,assuming the contents of the letter to be entirely true,to support the assertion that kidanov was murdered because of his involvement in the investigation.
the ij went on to identify the kinds of documents he expected 
there are no documents from the tax service,there are no documents from the governor office,there are no statements other than the one previously mentioned from any other,no affidavits from friends,no affidavits from acquaintances t here are no documents to show that kidanov himself was hospitalized.
the ij also expressed concern about the absence of documents corroborating the allegedly suspicious circumstances in which andrei and his sister died 
the only document which appears in the file relative to his death is the actual death certificate which simply shows the cause of death as alcoholic cardiomyopathy.there is no other reference to the circumstances surrounding his death or the suspicious manner in which gontcharova believes he died.
gontcharova has made the claim that kidanov sister also met with foul play,that she was found hanging.there is no letter,newspaper article there is no document which supports that.
finally,the ij was troubled that the petitioners had not presented testimony from a woman evguenia knew from kaliningrad who now lived in chicago,a former neighbor named irina bongarenko the woman,incidentally,who had brought evguenia her husband death certificate.
evguenia offered explanations for failing to produce documents that may have been available to her when she left kaliningrad in august,she was fleeing from what she considered an imminent danger of assault,so she did not have time to gather documentation.she also had not originally intended to apply for asylum,hoping instead that the situation in kaliningrad would eventually return to normal and she could return safely.she further suggested that the people she knew back home were themselves fearful of government retaliation,and it was therefore difficult to ask them to help her obtain sensitive documents.
the ij did not address these explanations when he gave his decision,but simply concluded that evguenia and ksenia failed to meet their burden of they should have provided more specific documentation in order to specifically corroborate their claim to persecution.the ij therefore denied their requests for asylum and withholding of deportation but granted them voluntary departure.the board of immigration appeals affirmed without comment.
the petitioners now argue that the ij misapplied the bia corroboration rule.the rule is based on the bia interpretation of a,which provides that for purposes of establishing eligibility for asylum,t he testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain her burden of proof without corroboration.although on its face this regulation establishes a condition under which corroboration is not necessary,the bia has interpreted the phrase may be sufficient to mean that the applicant testimony,though credible,will not always be sufficient.
in the case of in re,wl bia,the bia defined the circumstances under which such testimony must be corroborated.distinguishing between claims that rely on general country conditions and claims that are based on particular experiences of persecution,the bia declared that where an applicant claim relies primarily on personal experiences not reasonably subject to verification,corroborating documentary evidence of the asylum applicant particular experience is not required.id.at.but the board went on to insist that where it is reasonable to expect corroborating evidence for certain alleged facts pertaining to the specifics of an applicant claim,such evidence should be provided.id.
