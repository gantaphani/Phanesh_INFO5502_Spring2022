defendant appellant manuel gonzalez melchor appeals his conviction and sentence for reentry after deportation in violation of.gonzalez melchor contends that his deportation was invalid because the immigration judge ij failed to advise him of his eligibility for voluntary departure.the government claims that we need not reach that question because gonzalez melchor waived his right to appeal.
we hold that the,negotiated by the district court at sentencing in exchange for a reduced sentence,is invalid and unenforceable.in a memorandum disposition filed contemporaneously with this opinion,we hold that the ij failed adequately to advise gonzalez melchor of his ability to apply for voluntary departure,and we remand for the district court to determine whether gonzalez melchor was prejudiced by that failure.
factual and procedural background 
on june,united states border patrol agents,responding to a seismic intrusion device near otay mesa,california approximately one mile north of the united states mexico border,found gonzalez melchor hiding in the brush.gonzalez melchor,a citizen of mexico,admitted to being in the united states without valid immigration documents.a routine records check revealed that gonzalez melchor had previously been deported from the united states.
the relevant facts concerning the underlying deportation hearing are as follows on september,gonzalez melchor appeared before an ij for a group deportation hearing.at that hearing,gonzalez melchor admitted that he previously had crossed the border from mexico six or seven times without inspection.
the ij explained his ruling to the group as follows 
t he only thing in the law that could possibly save you from deportation is voluntary departure.but i not considering you for that because i i would not give it to you even if you asked for it and i want you to know the reasons.voluntary departure is what the law calls a privilege.this means you can not have it simply because you would like to get it.to receive it you would have to show two things.first that you qualify for it.second,even if you do qualify,that you have a good record which shows you deserve the privilege.
now i note that in some of your cases,you have suffered within the past five years a conviction for a drug offense or in the case of one man,for burglary,and this criminal record disqualifies you from voluntary departure.for the rest of you,i see bad facts which tells me you do deserve voluntary departure.for example,s everal of you have entered the country without inspection on previous occasions i think the only fair and correct order for you is deportation to mexico.
the ij then explained that each respondent had a right to appeal the decision and asked each to stand and tell me in a loud and clear voice,either yes or no,whether you have any interest at all in appeal.gonzalez melchor answered,no.
four years later,on september,gonzalez melchor was indicted for one count of illegal reentry after deportation in violation of.he moved to dismiss the indictment,arguing that the illegal reentry charge was based on an invalid deportation because the ij had failed to advise him of his ability to apply for voluntary departure,or to give him the opportunity to develop a record to show his eligibility for such relief.
the district court concluded that the ij had failed to advise gonzalez melchor of his eligibility to apply for voluntary departure because in explaining the right,the ij makes a threshold announcement that he also made the decision.the court denied gonzalez melchor motion to dismiss the indictment,however,concluding that gonzalez melchor had validly waived his right to appeal to the district court,and had not demonstrated prejudice because the ij likely would not have granted discretionary relief.
gonzalez melchor waived his right to a jury trial and was convicted of one count of illegal reentry after deportation.at sentencing,the district court informed gonzalez melchor that he intended to reduce his sentence by two points for acceptance of responsibility,and noted,i f i was convinced you were going to stay out of the united states for good then that would persuade me that a sentence of less than whatever we end up with once you get credit for responsibility might be appropriate.the following colloquy then ensued between the district court,gonzalez melchor,and his counsel 
the court i also like to hear from gonzalez melchor,look,i had my day in court.my arguments were heard.i do have a real good argument 
and your experience is probably the same as mine.the ninth circuit is going to be reluctant to go the other way on that.so he can take his appeal,but it a.that grounding himself in some realism there convinces me of the bona fideness sic of the promise that he going to stay out.if i had that,then the sentence would be quite different than what it might be absent those things.
a n acknowledgment from him that he not coming back anymore,that he is,that he promises me or looks me in the eye man to man and says i not coming back anymore,and i accept the judgments of this court.i not going to waste anybody else time and money maybe i should say,waste,but i not going to expend additional resources to pursue this thing.i accept my fate,that would go a long way.he probably be somewhere in the range of,months,something like that,which is a substantial reduction from where he is even once he gets two points off for acceptance of responsibility.
counsel can i just have a minute to speak with gonzalez 
the court sure.
counsel thank you.
pause in proceedings 
counsel thank you,your honor.he ready to put this incident behind him and he waive appeal.
the court all right.gonzalez,your lawyer tells me that you prepared to accept the judgment of this court and waive any right to pursue any appeals or challenges to rulings that i made is that true 
defendant yes,sir.
the court and your counsel has explained to you the nature of your right in that regard.you could pursue it through the circuit and get a judgment from the three judges on a panel in the circuit and even go further.but if you waive your right to appeal,that would be an end of your case today.do you understand 
defendant yes,sir.
the court that what you want to do 
defendant yes,sir.
the court does he make that decision with your concurrence 
counsel yes,your honor.
the court you believe it voluntary on his part 
counsel i do,your honor.
the court the court finds that gonzalez has knowingly,voluntarily,and intelligently waived his right to appeal.i accept that waiver.
the district court sentenced gonzalez melchor to months imprisonment,a variance downward from the month bottom end of the guidelines.despite his putative,gonzalez melchor now appeals.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction under.we review de novo whether an is valid.united states shimoda,cir.
discussion 
the government contends that we should dismiss the appeal because gonzalez melchor waived his appellate rights.see a providing the statutory right for a defendant to appeal his or her sentence.gonzalez melchor responds that the waiver is invalid and contends that federal rule of criminal procedure c,which prohibits judicial participation in plea negotiations,should also extend to negotiations at the sentencing phase.we hold that the,negotiated by the district court in this case,is invalid and unenforceable.
generally,we retain jurisdiction over an appeal by a defendant who has signed an,although we will not exercise that jurisdiction to review the merits of a defendant appeal if we conclude that she knowingly and voluntarily waived her right to appeal.united states jacobo castillo,cir en banc quoting united states gwinnett,cir alteration in original.a waiver is voluntary if,under the totality of the circumstances,it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than coercion or improper inducement.united states doe,cir en banc.however,where a waiver is not the product of the defendant free will for example,where it has been procured by government coercion or intimidation the defendant can not be said to have knowingly and voluntarily relinquished his rights.jones united sta
