opinion of the court 
this is an appeal by carlos perez,a colombian national and permanent resident,from an order of the district court for the middle district of pennsylvania,the district where perez is held in ins detention,denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.the petition challenged the board of immigration appeals bia affirmance of an order of removal entered by an immigration judge ij following perez conviction for conspiracy to launder money.in his habeas petition,perez challenged the bia conclusion that he is ineligible to apply for relief pursuant to former c of the immigration and nationality act ina,c repealed.perez argued that because he was convicted for conduct that occurred before the repeal of c,he was entitled to apply for a waiver of deportation under that provision.the district court denied the writ on the ground that perez was ineligible to apply for relief under c because,under the new definition of the time of conviction created by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat,perez was convicted after the repeal of c.
perez relies here on the supreme court decision in ins cyr,d,contending that it overruled steele blackman,cir,and desousa reno,cir,prior third circuit cases that held that aliens whose removal proceedings,like perez,were initiated after the repeal date of c,were ineligible for relief under that section.perez also contends that cyr requires us to hold that aliens like perez,who are removable due to criminal conduct that occurred prior to the enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,and iirira,are entitled to apply for relief under c.while we acknowledge that cyr rejected the reasoning that we employed in steele and desousa,we nonetheless will affirm the order of the district court on the ground upon which the district court relied,that under iirira definition of conviction,perez was convicted after the repeal of c and can not now obtain relief under the repealed statute.
facts procedural history 
perez entered the united states in at the age of six and has lived in the since then as a lawful permanent resident.in january,perez was tried and found guilty by a jury in the united states district court for the northern district of california of conspiracy to launder money in violation of,based on criminal conduct that occurred in.he was sentenced in june to months in prison.
on october,while he was in prison,the ins issued perez a notice to appear alleging that his criminal conviction rendered him removable from the on august,an ij found perez removable under a a iii based on his conviction for an aggravated felony as defined by a d a u,which includes conspiracy to commit money laundering in the amount for which perez was convicted.the ij also found perez ineligible for withholding of removal under the convention against torture cat.perez was released from criminal custody to the custody of the ins on august,after serving months in prison.
perez appealed the ij order to the bia,contending that his conspiracy conviction did not constitute an aggravated felony because he was not convicted of the underlying crime,only conspiracy that the ij erred in denying his cat claims and that he should have been allowed to apply for a waiver of deportation under former ina c,c repealed,because the criminal conduct underlying his conviction occurred before that section was repealed.the bia affirmed the ij order,concluding that perez was convicted of an aggravated felony within the meaning of the ina and although perez qualifies to apply for withholding of removal under the cat,he failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to colombia,and is therefore not entitled to receive such relief.the bia also rejected perez claim that he should have been allowed to apply for a c waiver,citing steele for the proposition that perez is ineligible to apply for a c waiver because removal proceedings were instituted against him after april,the effective date of the repeal of c.
perez thereupon filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court for the middle district of pennsylvania,seeking a declaration that the retroactive application of iirira which repealed ina c to his criminal conduct is unconstitutional,and seeking remand of his case to the ij for consideration of relief under c.after holding its decision in abeyance until the supreme court issued its decision in cyr,the district court dismissed perez petition based on the fact that perez conviction occurred in june,which was after the effective date of the section of iirira that repealed c.the district court concluded that relief under c was therefore not available to perez,and that there is nothing retroactive about his inability to apply for a waiver under that section.
perez contends that the supreme court holding in relief under ina c remains available to aliens whose convictions were obtained by plea bargains and who would have been eligible for c relief under the law in effect at the time of the plea overruled steele,in which we held that c relief is not available to aliens whose removal proceedings were initiated after the repeal of c and suggested that c relief could remain available to aliens whose criminal conduct predated the enactment of the immigration amendments.perez submits that,on the basis of cyr,we must find that it would be unfairly retroactive to deny him the opportunity to apply for a waiver under c.the government takes issue with these contentions,but also endorses the reasoning of the district court,that because perez june conviction was entered after former ina c was repealed on april,c is not available as relief from his removal order.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,which grants district courts the authority to issue writs of habeas corpus in cases involving detainees held under the authority of the see cyr,at.steele,at holding that district courts retain the authority to issue writs of habeas corpus to detained aggravated felon aliens following the passage of iirira.we have jurisdiction to review the district court denial of a writ of habeas corpus based on.
ii.statutory background 
section of the ina of,formerly codified at c,excluded certain classes of aliens from the,including those convicted of offenses involving moral turpitude or illicit traffic in narcotics.see stat.the section was subject to a waiver provision,c,which was codified at c.it provided 
aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years,may be admitted in the discretion of the attorney general 
c repealed.although c was literally applicable only to exclusion proceedings,it has been interpreted by the board of immigration appeals to authorize any permanent resident alien with a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years to apply for a discretionary waiver from deportation.cyr,at.citing matter of silva.
in,congress amended c to bar discretionary relief to those convicted of an aggravated felony who had served a term of imprisonment of at least five years.see immigration act of,stat,amending c.when congress enacted aedpa on april,it included d,which barred c relief to those aliens who were convicted of a broad set of offenses,including aggravated felonies,drug convictions,certain weapons or national security violations,and multiple convictions involving crimes of moral turpitude.see,stat,amending c.
later that same year,on september,congress passed iirira.iirira b,which went into effect on april,repealed ina c,and replaced it with a new section,which is now codified at,and which gives the attorney general authority to cancel removal only for a narrow class of inadmissible or removable aliens.that class does not include anyone previously convicted of an aggravated felony.a.iirira also changed the definition of when a money laundering conviction constitutes an aggravated felony,as defined by a d.that section formerly provided that an aggravated felony includes an offense described in section of title,united states code relating to laundering of monetary instruments or section of that title relating to engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specific unlawful activity if the amount of the funds exceeded.iirira a decreased the minimum amount of funds to,which brought perez into its net 
iii.discussion 
a.the legal application of civil statutes 
perez contends that it is unconstitutional for congress to change the consequences of a crime for purposes of the immigration statutes after the date of the commission of the criminal acts.this argument appears to derive from the ex post facto clause,see const.art.i,cl.no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed,but such an argument is not available to perez because deportation statutes are civil in nature.they do not constitute criminal punishment for past acts,even where,as here,the alien qualifies for removal because of a past criminal act.see ins,d rejecting the argument that deportation is punishment for past behavior and therefore subject to the various protections that apply in the context of a criminal trial harisiades shaughnessy.deportation,however severe its consequences,has been consistently classified as a civil rather than a criminal procedure.perez therefore may not challenge the retroactive application of iirira repeal of c under the ex post facto clause,which applies only to the retroactive application of criminal statutes.see collins youngblood,d.
nevertheless,there are limitations on when courts will interpret congress to have applied civil statutes retroactively.congress may apply civil laws retroactively as long as it indicates clearly its intention to do so and it would not violate the constitution for it to do so.if congress does not clearly indicate its intention to apply a civil statute retroactively,courts apply a presumption against retroactive application.the controlling precedent is landgraf usi film products,d,in which the supreme court applied a process when determining whether amendments to civil statutes are intended to be retroactive.
in the first step,the court asks whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.id.at.if so,and a bsent a violation of a specific provision of the constitution,the potential unfairness of retroactive civil legislation is not a sufficient reason for a court to fail to give a statute its intended scope.id.at.therefore,if congress speaks clearly in saying that it intends for a civil statute to apply retroactively,a court must effectuate congress intent,absent a constitutional violation.the clear statement requirement is an exacting one.c ases where the supreme court has found truly retroactive effect adequately authorized by statute have involved statutory language that was so clear that it could sustain only one interpretation.lindh murphy,d.
if congress has not spoken clearly to indicate its intent for a civil statute to apply retroactively,then a court must determine whether the application of the statute to the conduct at issue would result in a retroactive effect.martin hadix,d.if there would be such a retroactive effect,then the court should presume that the legislation does not apply to the conduct in question,and apply it only prospectively.id.
cyr effect on steele and desousa 
perez first challenges the validity of our opinions in steele and desousa,contending that the supreme court implicitly overruled these cases in cyr.the bia relied on steele to reject perez argument that iirira repeal of c is unfairly retroactive.steele involved the review of a district court denial of the habeas petition of desmond steele,a national of grenada who was excluded after returning from that country,where he had attended his mother funeral,because of his three prior misdemeanor marijuana possession convictions.the ins instituted exclusion proceedings after the effective date of iirira and after the end of the period in which the statute transition rules applied.the ij found steele excludable and ineligible for cat relief,and the bia affirmed.
steele had argued in his habeas petition,inter alia,that he was entitled to relief under former ina c because his convictions and the acts upon which they were based took place prior to the enactment of iirira.we rejected this argument,reasoning as follows 
section c of title,ina c,provides that waivers of inadmissibility might be granted to certain immigrants who traveled abroad for brief periods of time.section c was repealed by section c of iirira,effective april,but by its terms is still applicable to certain removal proceedings initiated before its effective date.iirira a.because steele removal was initiated after april,section c is not an available avenue of relief for steele.
steele argues that section c must remain available in his case because its unavailability would constitute a retroactive application of the permanent provisions of iirira to a conviction that preceded the act and this result was not intended by congress.we find steele argument foreclosed by our opinion in desousa reno,cir.in desousa,the petitioner was a citizen of portugal who had been a lawful permanent resident of the united states since.the petitioner had served four and years in prison on an aggravated assault charge.desousa claimed that iirira amendments restricting eligibility for section c waivers should not be construed to apply retroactively to his case,since his convictions iirira.we disagreed,finding it likely that congress had intended the amended version of section c to apply to convictions preceding the amendment.id.at.because the issue was not absolutely clear,however,we proceeded to analyze whether the removal of relief was retroactive in any sense.we concluded,in accordance with our earlier opinion in scheidemann ins,cir,that because the statute related only to the discretion of the attorney general to grant a future waiver,its eligibility restriction had only prospective impact.at.
steele,at.desousa,the earlier third circuit opinion on which steele relied,concluded that aedpa changes to former ina c did not have a retroactive effect within the meaning of the second step of the landgraf test because c relief could be granted solely in the discretion of the attorney general.
in cyr,the supreme court considered whether the restrictions on discretionary relief from deportation contained in aedpa and iirira apply to removal proceedings brought against an alien who pled guilty to a deportable crime before their enactment.at.the court applied landgraf retroactivity analysis to iirira b,the section that repealed former ina c.the court concluded that that section,which simply states that section c c is repealed,did not show congress unequivocal intent to apply the repeal retroactively to aliens like cyr who had pleaded guilty before the repeal of c.having decided that congress did not unambiguously state its intention to make the repeal of ina c retroactive,the court went on to the second step of determining whether the rule would have an impermissible retroactive effect for aliens who,like cyr,were convicted pursuant to a plea agreement at a time when their plea would not have rendered them ineligible for c relief.id.at.the court held that it did have such an effect,finding that 
iirira elimination of any possibility of c relief for people who entered into plea agreements with the expectation that they would be eligible for such relief clearly attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past.landgraf,at.plea agreements involve a quid pro quo between a criminal defendant and the government.in exchange for some perceived benefit,defendants waive several of their constitutional rights including the right to a trial and grant the government numerous tangible benefits,such as promptly imposed punishment without the expenditure of prosecutorial resources.there can be little doubt that,as a general matter,alien defendants considering whether to enter into a plea agreement are acutely aware of the immigration consequences of their convictions.
