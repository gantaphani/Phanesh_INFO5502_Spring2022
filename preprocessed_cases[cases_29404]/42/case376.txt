vllasi cuko,a citizen and national of albania,petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia,which affirmed an immigration judge ij denial of his application for political asylum.
background 
after cuko entered the united states via italy in july,he was placed in removal proceedings and filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat,predicated on allegations of persecution based on his political opinions.at the removal hearing,cuko testified that the former communist government of albania forcibly interned his family in a concentration camp during the and.after the fall of the communist government in,cuko became an active member of his hometown chapter of the democratic party.the democratic party major political opponent is the socialist party,the legal successor to the albanian communist party.
cuko also testified that,in november,he allowed his official membership in the local chapter of the democratic party to lapse because he had decided to sell his home and relocate his family to the capital,but that he ultimately was unable to acquire a new house.
cuko testified that,in february,he helped to organize,and participated in,a democratic party election rally in fier.later that evening,his house was stoned and his family terrorized by unknown masked individuals.shortly thereafter,cuko and his wife began receiving anonymous telephone threats that their son would be kidnapped if cuko did not cease his activities with the democratic party,and cuko paid to have his wife and son smuggled into the united states.when cuko held another party rally on march,the,cuko claims,are all socialist party him,held him for several hours,and insulted and beat him.when the democrats lost the election to the socialists,cuko sold his house,then left for the united states via italy.
the ij denied cuko application for asylum and withholding of removal and his claim for relief under the cat.in an oral decision,the ij began by noting that cuko testimony was inconsistent,both internally and with some exhibits,and that his demeanor suggested mendacity.
the ij then described the present country conditions in albania and noted that there were no longer any indications of systemic political persecution against communist party opponents.the ij found that even if he credited cuko account that he and his family were interned in a labor camp in the,virtually all albanians suffered similarly from the years to.therefore,even if cuko could credibly show past persecution,the presumption of a fear of future persecution would be overcome by the changed country conditions.
the ij further noted that he did not find the applicant to be a credible witness in any regard in this case.the ij has carefully observed the applicant demeanor throughout this hearing and finds the applicant to be a furtive,evasive,and wholly incredible witness.
the ij then specifically detailed the bases for his adverse credibility determination.first,the ij noted that cuko testified that,after he had arrived in the united states,he asked his in albania to obtain cuko party membership card from the democratic party archives and mail it to him.moments later,cuko completely changed his testimony to say that he had left the card at his home when he departed albania.immediately thereafter,he changed his testimony again and said that he had given the card to his before departing for the united states.the ij noted,in particular,that based on cuko demeanor,cuko seemed to modify his second answer as soon as he realized that it was inconsistent with his earlier testimony that he had sold his home before leaving albania.i t actually appeared that cuko was giving answers then realizing that his prior testimony conflicted with these answers,and he would then change his answer and give another one that he thought would be more plausible and so on until he ended up with the final version of his testimony.the ij noted that cuko had also not appropriately authenticated the membership card even though it was clear that cuko was well aware of the procedures for authentication.
second,the ij observed that a certificate dated december,from the local democratic party branch office,which certified that cuko has been a member of this party from till sic november of the year and has regularly paid the monthly membership fees to the party,contradicted cuko testimony that he was an active and vibrant democratic party member and organizer through his arrest in march.
the ij also rejected,as wholly unsatisfactory,cuko explanation for the november membership termination that he had intended to move to another town and reregister with its local democratic party branch,but that he ultimately failed in his efforts to buy a new house in the other locality,and decided to stay in fier.if this were true,the ij noted,it would be likely that the letter would have mentioned that he had remained active,especially in light of his purported efforts as an organizer up until his arrest in march.
in addition,the ij determined it inconceivable that the december certificate,written by the chairman of the local democratic party and purportedly issued after the alleged harassments,assaults,arrest,and beatings of cuko in the spring of,never mentioned this persecution.
the ij found that these two discrepancies and inconsistencies were material and went to the heart of the applicant asylum claim and that in light of them,cuko could not be found to be a credible witness.
finally,the ij noted other discrepancies.cuko testimony about how much and when cuko paid to have his wife and child smuggled out of albania changed from one moment to the next and directly contradicted the testimony of his wife.his demeanor was completely evasive and nonresponsive when he was testifying as to the source of the money used to pay the smugglers.cuko appeared to say that he sold one of the two houses he owned to raise the money,but his wife clearly testified that they owned only one home in albania.the ij also noted that the timing of the sale of the house was completely unclear to the ij.the ij found cuko testimony simply not to be credible on this point,and that the truth is something other than the applicant testimony,that is,that the applicant and his family had plans to come to the united states,and they have concocted this story in an effort to obtain lawful permanent residence 
the ij concluded that these discrepancies became material in combination with cuko other perjurious testimony regarding his party membership card and the december certificate.
the ij,having rejected the application for asylum,rejected cuko claim for withholding of removal,noting that the latter requires a higher burden of proof.the ij also rejected cuko claim for relief under the cat,based both on his finding that cuko was not credible and that there was no record support that it was more likely than not cuko would be tortured were he to return to albania,especially given the country changed political circumstances.
after cuko appealed the ij decision,the bia affirmed and adopted the ij decision finding the applicant not credible,in a brief,but not summary,opinion.based on an examination of the record,the bia disposed of cuko contention on appeal that the ij conduct in questioning cuko went beyond his authority.the bia also found sufficient record support to uphold the ij adverse credibility finding.the bia affirmed the finding that based on state department country reports,cuko did not have a fear of future persecution.cuko then petitioned for review of the bia final decision.
discussion 
cuko petition argues that the bia erred in sustaining the decision of the ij denying cuko asylum,withholding of removal,or relief under the cat.he claims again that the ij improperly assumed the role of a government attorney.he argues the ij adverse credibility determinations,which the ij based on his perceptions of testimonial inconsistencies and witnesses demeanors,and upon which he founded his denial of cuko asylum application,are not supported by the record.
where,as here,the bia adopted and affirmed the ij ruling,but also discussed some of the bases for the ij opinion,we review both the ij and bia opinions.lin gonzales,cir quoting zheng gonzales,cir.when the bia adopts the ij decision,we can not disregard the particular findings of the ij just because the bia does not expressly address them.see,chanthou hem mukasey,cir reviewing both the ij and the bia opinion when the bia adopts and affirms the ij ruling and discusses some of the ij bases for decision lin,at same yu gonzales,cir same zheng,at same.
adverse credibility determination 
where the bia has adopted the ij credibility determination,as here,we review the determination of the ij.mewengkang gonzales,cir see also,chanthou hem,at.
since the ij has the best vantage point from which to assess the witnesses testimonies and demeanors,we accord significant respect to these witness credibility determinations.afful ashcroft,cir.accordingly,we review the ij adverse credibility determination under the deferential substantial evidence standard,and must sustain it unless the record evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.stroni gonzales,cir emphasis added.specifically,we narrowly inquire whether i the discrepancies articulated by the ij the bia are actually present in the administrative record ii the discrepancies generate specific and cogent reasons from which to infer that petitioner or his witnesses provided testimony and iii petitioner failed to provide a persuasive explanation for these discrepancies.hoxha gonzales,cir in re,bia.
the custody chain of the democratic party membership card 
as the first ground for his adverse credibility determination,the ij noted that cuko gave three different accounts as to how he obtained his democratic party membership card as a supporting exhibit.the ij also found that cuko demeanor led the ij to believe that cuko gave the multiple accounts because he recognized the inconsistency between his prior account and his other testimony.
these discrepancies in cuko testimony about how he obtained the democratic party membership card are clearly present in the administrative record.they are based not only on inconsistency of statements but also on observation of demeanor.they also go the heart of cuko claim of persecution based on political beliefs see ins,cir.further,the ij considered cuko explanation for his inconsistencies in testimony,and found it was not credible because his answer appeared to change only after he realized it conflicted with his prior testimony.see simo gonzales,cir our cases make frequent reference to the failure of a petitioner to sufficiently explain inconsistencies.citing chen gonzales,cir dhima gonzales,cir.
under our deferential standard of review,we can not say that the record compels us to make a determination contrary to that of the ij.the ij determination was also based on cuko demeanor,and the ij findings as to demeanor are subject to great weight.see,rodriguez del carmen gonzales,cir matters of witness credibility and demeanor are peculiarly for the factfinder.
the december certificate from party chairman 
as the second ground for his adverse credibility determination,the ij observed that the december,certificate,in which the local party chairman certified that cuko had paid party dues from through november,contradicted cuko testimony that he remained an active democratic party member into early,and that cuko explanation for terminating his membership,his aborted attempt to purchase a house in tirana was wholly unsatisfactory.
in addition,the ij found that the december certificate reasonably should have included but did not some account of the political persecution that cuko purportedly suffered in early.cuko explanation that the december certificate was just a ministerial verification of cuko official enrollment dates in the party was undercut by the evidence that the december certificate did make reference to cuko forced labor under the prior albanian regime.again,under our deferential standard of review,it was reasonable for the ij to note the inconsistencies and find cuko explanation inadequate 
cuko argues that the even if he was no longer an active democratic party member,he may still be at risk of political persecution because he was perceived to be a democratic party member.it is correct,but not material here,that an asylum claim can be predicated not only on an applicant actual political affiliation,but on his perceived affiliation with a particular political opinion.see mekhoukh ashcroft,cir ins,cir a n imputed political opinion,whether correctly or incorrectly attributed,can constitute a ground of political persecution within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act.see also koudriachova gonzales,cir t he relevant question is not whether an asylum applicant subjectively holds a particular political view,but instead whether the authorities in the applicant home country perceive him to hold a political opinion and would persecute him on that basis.gao gonzales,cir b iii.
this point is irrelevant to the ij determination,however.the ij used the discrepancy over cuko party membership dates as one of many factors,including its finding that his demeanor suggested mendacity,to find cuko was personally not credible.the ij basis of decision was not that because cuko was no longer a democratic party member,he would not have been subject to persecution it was that because of cuko testimonial inconsistencies and demeanor,cuko did not meet his burden of showing a fear of persecution.
further,this was not a case in which cuko was not afforded an opportunity to explain the inconsistency.see hoxha,at noting that the asylum applicant must provide a persuasive explanation for the purported discrepancies zi lin chen ashcroft,cir noting that asylum applicant should be afforded a reasonable opportunity to explain what the ij perceived as an inconsistency in her testimony.cuko attempted to explain the inconsistency by his aborted move to tirana.the ij found that explanation also to be not credible,and the record does not compel a contrary finding.
the testimony concerning the cukos smuggling transaction 
as another ground for his adverse credibility determination,the ij cited discrepancies between the testimony of cuko and his wife concerning details of the transaction by which cuko was smuggled to the united states.because cuko petition the effective date of the real id act,our deferential standard of review is subject to an important caveat a n adverse credibility determination can not rest on trivia but must be based on discrepancies that involved the heart of the asylum claim.lin,at quoting,at internal quotation marks omitted.the ij found that these discrepancies as to the smuggling,when combined with cuko other testimony,became material and went to the heart of his claim.the bia considered the inconsistencies in the testimony regarding the cukos smuggling transaction while collateral to cuko claim if viewed alone,they still provided additional support for the ij adverse credibility finding.while these additional discrepancies do not necessarily go to the heart of lin persecution claim,and thus might not be enough standing alone to support an adverse credibility finding,in this case they provide further support for the ij conclusion that petitioner was not candid in her recitation of events.id.at citations omitted.the inconsistencies about the funding and selling of the home,which provided the source of money to pay the smugglers,raised issues of credibility regarding cuko reasons for fleeing to the united states,which go to the heart of his application.the record does not compel a different conclusion.
other concerns 
cuko argues that the ij purported to base his adverse credibility decision,in part,on material inconsistencies and discrepancies between the applicant written asylum application and his testimony,but then did not,in the remainder of his decision,cite any specific examples of such discrepancies.emphasis added.as described above,the ij does explain the inconsistencies between cuko testimony and the exhibits that cuko submitted.regardless,the ij had sufficient other grounds,based on the testimony alone,upon which to rest his adverse credibility determination,and no prejudice would have resulted to cuko.
further,the ij noted that even if cuko had met his burden of showing he had been persecuted as an active democratic party member and he had not,the background information does not corroborate his claim that persecution awaits him upon his return to albania,and therefore,he can not establish that he has a fear of suffering future persecution.this background information,namely the state department country note only minimal political violence and retaliation in,the contention that his family would be harmed in the future if they returned to albania.this finding is relevant to cuko failure to prove a fear of future persecution.even if cuko had shown he suffered past persecution,which he did not,the ij reliance on the state department reports was sufficient to rebut the presumption of a fear of future persecution arising from allegations of past persecution based on support for the democratic party.gjiknuri mukasey,wl,at cir,alibeaj gonzales,cir tota gonzales,cir.the record does not compel a contrary conclusion.
in any event,the adverse credibility determination defeats the petitioner asylum claim.see dine gonzales,cir w hen a petitioner case depends on the veracity of testimony,a fully supported adverse credibility determination,without more,can sustain a denial of asylum.quoting olujoke gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the denial of cuko asylum claim also effectively disposes of his withholding of removal claim.see makhoul ashcroft,cir a claim for withholding of deportation demands that the alien carry a more stringent burden of proof than does an asylum claim.thus,if an alien can not establish asylum eligibility,his claim for withholding of deportation fails a fortiori.
in this case,the petitioner brief does not advance any arguments specific to his cat claim.to the extent that the claim is not waived,see dine,at,cuko cat claim was predicated on the veracity of his testimony and the current albanian political climate,and so this claim,too,fails.
b.the conduct of the immigration judge 
cuko makes a perfunctory argument that the ij overstepped his authority by assuming the role of a government attorney and engaged in prosecutorial questioning.the bia rejected this position,as we do.the petitioner brief points to no specific instance in the record to support this claim.it is well settled that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.united states zannino,cir.
regardless,it is clear from the hearing transcripts that the ij was acting within his broad discretion.see b authorizing the ij to receive evidence,interrogate,examine,and the alien or witnesses jorgji mukasey,cir.we agree with the bia that the questions and warnings directed to the applicant by the ij do not indicate any bias against the applicant,or go beyond the ij broad discretionary authority to control the pace and scope of the hearing.cuko opportunity to present his case was not restricted.
conclusion 
the petition for review is denied.
because the majority seriously misreads the appellate record,and particularly the agency two written decisions,i respectfully dissent.in deferring wholesale to the agency credibility determinations in these circumstances,the majority turns our review function into a hollow exercise in.
in assessing pivotal credibility determinations,we the very the agency to its word.if the bia had merely affirmed and adopted the ij decision without further elaboration,we would review the ij rationales directly and exclusively.importantly,however,that is not what the bia decision purported to do it added its own gloss.the bia expressly did not affirm but instead ij decision that the discrepancies concerning how cuko smuggled his wife and child into the united states could be weighed in assessing his credibility w e agree with the applicant that the inconsistencies in the record concerning how much he paid to have his wife and son smuggled into the united states are collateral to his asylum claim.emphasis added.the majority insistence to the contrary is directly at odds with this plain language.
further,although the bia is not required to catalog every basis for affirming an ij credibility decision,and indeed could have simply affirmed the ij remaining rationales without comment,the bia in this case expressly stated that it had found sufficient other evidence in the record to support the ij credibility finding.see sou gonzales,cir in our review,we consider only the reasons stated by the board for denying relief and do not independently consider whether other grounds would be supported by the record.if the bia had proceeded merely to give an example of this other evidence,one reasonably might argue that it implicitly was affirming all of the ij remaining rationales.rather than begin the next sentence with the phrase for example,however,the bia begins with specifically,which connotes that it intends to identify the other evidence that independently supports its affirmance.see mukasey,cir as the bia adopted and supplemented the ij opinion with its own substantive gloss,we evaluate both the ij decision and the bia decisions.xue hong yang united states dep t of justice,cir noting that when the bia affirms the ij decision in all respects but one,the appellate court must review the ij decision as modified by the bia decision,minus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the bia.given this choice of language,we must ask whether the specific evidence cited as a ground for the party certificate per se contradicts cuko testimony that he remained an active and recognized party member in february and march the appellate review standard,the presence of an actual discrepancy which generates specific reasons to suspect the applicant veracity,and for which he has provided no persuasive explanation.see hoxha gonzales,cir in re,bia.
the majority mistakenly suggests that even this narrower bia determination is itself a sufficient ground to deny cuko petition for review.the putative party certificate necessary implication that cuko thereafter became inactive in his party simply not a inconsistency.an asylum applicant might testify,for example,that he entered the country from canada,then testify later that he entered the country from mexico.in that case of facial inconsistency,both versions of the historical facts can not be simultaneously true,we would be to find that the ij could not rely on that unexplained inconsistency in finding the applicant not worthy of credence.
by contrast,the party certificate suggests only that cuko,a party member,stopped paying his dues in november.when specifically asked to explain why he had stopped paying his dues,he testified that he had planned unsuccessfully to relocate to tirana to escape increased political persecution.he later testified,however,that he remained active in the party after november,and continued to be recognized as an active party member and organizer.unlike the discrepancy hypothesized above,however,the perceived discrepancy between the concepts and active is hardly inexorable.see san kai kwok gonzales,cir a dverse credibility determinations should not be grounded in easily explained discrepancies because such bases lack the necessary legitimate nexus to the finding.citation omitted ming shi xue bia,cir w hen an inconsistency is not,an ij may not rely on it to support a credibility determination without first bringing the perceived discrepancy to the alien attention,thereby giving the alien an opportunity to address and perhaps reconcile the seeming inconsistency,to the ij satisfaction,at the least.accord he chun chen ashcroft,cir a mbiguous answers at airport interviews should not be relied upon to question the credibility of the alien.the adjective active obviously requires some further definition and explanation,and in this instance,the ij did not point out the perceived inconsistency to cuko at the hearing,nor did he allow cuko a reasonable opportunity to explain why or how the two items of evidence were not
