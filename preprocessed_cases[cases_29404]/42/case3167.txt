petitioner sunny calaogan viloria is the adopted son of a citizen father and a naturalized citizen mother.born in the phillippines in,he entered the united states on an orphan visa at age seven.in june,the government served him with a notice to appear charging him as removable based on his conviction for a drug offense seven years earlier.see a b i.
viloria argued before the immigration judge ij that he was not removable because he obtained automatic derivative citizenship from his parents upon his adoption.the ij agreed and terminated removal proceedings.the government appealed the termination order to the board of immigration appeals bia,which concluded that viloria had not met his burden to establish citizenship,vacated the ij termination order,and remanded.
viloria now petitions this court for review of his citizenship claim.as we explain below,because viloria has not been ordered removed,we lack jurisdiction.
viloria was admitted to the united states in june,in honolulu,hawaii,on an orphan visa.he immediately entered into the custody of his adoptive parents.the adoption became final in august.viloria has resided in the united states continuously since his adoption and has remained unmarried.
when he was years old,viloria pleaded no contest to promoting a dangerous drug in the third degree,in connection with his possession of methamphetamine.the government later filed a notice to appear in the honolulu immigration court,charging viloria as removable under a b i as an alien convicted of a controlled substance violation other than possession for personal use of less than thirty grams of marijuana.
at a hearing before the ij,viloria contested his removability on the ground that he obtained derivative citizenship through his adoptive parents.at the time of viloria adoption,the statutory provision for derivative citizenship provided that 
a a child born outside of the united states,one of whose parents at the time of the child birth was an alien and the other of whose parents then was and never thereafter ceased to be a citizen of the united states,shall,if such alien parent is naturalized,become a citizen of the united states,when 
such naturalization takes place while such child is unmarried and under the age of eighteen years and 
such child is residing in the united states pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence at the time of naturalization or thereafter and begins to reside permanently in the united states while under the age of eighteen years.
b subsection a of this section shall apply to an adopted child only if the child is residing in the united states at the time of naturalization of such adoptive parent,in the custody of his adoptive parents,pursuant to a lawful admission for permanent residence.
viloria admitted that he did not meet the criteria under section b because his adoptive mother like him,a filipino citizen by birth was naturalized in,after viloria birth but before viloria began residing in the united states in his adoptive parents custody.he argued,however,that subsection a of section,rather than subsection b,applied to him,because he met the statutory definition of child 
the term child means an unmarried person under years of age and includes a child legitimated under the law of the child residence or domicile,or under the law of the father residence or domicile,whether in the united states or elsewhere,and,except as otherwise provided in sections to of this title,a child adopted in the united states,if such legitimation or adoption takes place before the child reaches the age of sixteen years,and the child is in the legal custody of the legitimating or adopting parent or parents at the time of such legitimation or adoption.
c.because he was an unmarried person under the age of in the legal custody of his parents at the time of his adoption,he was a child under section c therefore,he contended,for purposes of obtaining citizenship he was subject to section a,not section b.
the ij noted that the definition of child in section c applied except as otherwise provided by sections and,and that the except clause could be read to preclude section c from applying when derivative citizenship is at stake.but the ij was persuaded by viloria argument that section b supplemented,rather than replaced,the definition of child in section c as it applied to adopted children.that is,the ij held that former section a was applicable both to an adopted child who met the criteria of section b and to an adopted child who met the definition of child in section c.
after the ij terminated removal proceedings,the government appealed.the bia sustained the appeal,reasoning that under the plain language of former section,adopted children were required to meet the criteria under subsection b to benefit from subsection a.it rejected viloria argument that he was a child under section c,indicating that,under the plain language of that statute,section was an except ion to the definition of child,not a supplement.accordingly,the bia vacated the ij order and remanded for further proceedings.
viloria then petitioned this court for review.the government filed a motion to dismiss for lack of a final order of removal.we denied the motion without prejudice to renewal of the jurisdictional argument in the answering brief.
we dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.
it is well established that this court jurisdiction over removal proceedings is limited to review of final orders of removal.in relevant part,b provides 
judicial review of all questions of law and fact,including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions,arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the united states under this subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under this section.
emphasis added.
that limitation applies even if it appears a removal order is likely forthcoming on remand.alcala holder,for example,held that this court lacked jurisdiction over the bia order affirming an ij grant of the government motion to dismiss removal proceedings so that the government could reinstate a prior order of removal,cir.rejecting the petitioner argument that the court had jurisdiction because the prior order of removal was likely to be reinstated,alcala reaffirmed that t he carefully crafted congressional scheme governing review of decisions of the bia limits this court jurisdiction to the review of final orders of removal,even if the petitioner raises a constitutional claim or question of law.id.at.and abdisalan holder,a recent en banc decision of this court,confirmed that w hen the bia remands to the ij for any reason,no final order of removal exists until all administrative proceedings have concluded,cir,as amended.
against this backdrop,viloria asserts that this court nonetheless has jurisdiction to resolve his citizenship claim on appeal of the bia order vacating the ij order terminating removal proceedings.viloria concedes that no final order of removal has issued.he maintains,however,that the statutory provision for review of nationality claims,section b,creates an exception to this court limitation to review of final removal orders.we disagree.
first,the statute itself belies viloria argument.section is headed judicial review of orders of removal.emphasis added.section b is entitled requirements for review of orders of removal and further states that it applies w ith respect to review of an order of removal.emphases added.section b a states that i f the petitioner claims to be a national of the united states and the court of appeals finds from the pleadings and affidavits that no genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner nationality is presented,the court shall decide the nationality claim section b b instructs the court to transfer proceedings to the district court if a genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner nationality is presented and section b c limits consideration of a nationality claim to the manner provided in sections b a and b.finally,as noted above,section b states that j udicial review of all questions of law and fact shall be available only i
