petitioner antonio reyes paulo,iii paulo petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia pretermitting his application for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to the c of the immigration and nationality act ina.we hold that res judicata binds the bia to the final decision of the district court for the northern district of california,which held that paulo is eligible for discretionary relief under c based on ins cyr.
we grant paulo petition and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
paulo is a native and citizen of the philippines.he was admitted to the united states as an immigrant on august.at that time he was fourteen years old.he is the son of a lawful permanent resident mother and a citizen father.he has a citizen daughter,born on october.
on september,paulo was convicted in california state court of assault with a firearm in violation of california penal code a.he served two years and nine months imprisonment.for reasons not clear from the record,on october,a california superior court vacated this conviction,and paulo pled guilty to assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm in violation of california penal code a.the new conviction was entered nunc pro tunc as of the date of the original conviction,and the sentence was unchanged.on march,paulo pled guilty to receiving known stolen property in violation of california penal code a,and was sentenced to sixteen months imprisonment.
on september,paulo was served with a notice to appear based on these criminal convictions.the notice charged him as removable under both ina a a iii,a a iii,for conviction of an aggravated felony,and ina a a ii,a a ii,for conviction of two crimes involving moral turpitude not arising out of a single scheme.the aggravated felony charge was based on his conviction for assault with a deadly weapon,and the moral turpitude charge was based on both criminal convictions.
paulo conceded removability and sought relief through withholding of removal,asylum,and the convention against torture cat.for reasons not relevant to this appeal,the immigration judge ij concluded that paulo was not eligible for either asylum or withholding of removal,and rejected paulo cat claim.the ij issued an order of removal to the philippines on october.the bia affirmed on february.this court dismissed the subsequent petition for review for lack of jurisdiction on may.
on june,the supreme court decided ins cyr,a challenge to the retroactive application of the provision of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira that repealed ina c,formerly codified at c.section c gave the attorney general the discretionary power to grant relief from deportation to certain aliens convicted of criminal offenses.the supreme court held in cyr that the repeal of c can not be applied retroactively to aliens who had,before the passage of iirira,reasonably relied on the availability of c relief in pleading guilty to offenses making them deportable.cyr,at.under cyr,paulo was potentially eligible for c relief.
approximately one year later,on november,a california superior court vacated paulo conviction for receiving known stolen property on the ground that his plea had been unconstitutionally obtained.paulo then pled guilty to false personation under california penal code.false personation is not a crime of moral turpitude.thus,paulo was no longer removable under ina a a ii.
because the time in which paulo was entitled to file a motion to reopen with the bia had expired,see c,he petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court for the northern district of california on may.the two grounds for his petition were that he was entitled to a new removal hearing because one of the grounds for his removal,his conviction of two crimes of moral turpitude,was no longer valid and that he was eligible for c relief under cyr.
the government objected to both grounds.as to the first ground,the government argued that paulo was still convicted of an aggravated felony assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm and thus his removal order should still stand under ina a a iii.as to the second ground,the government argued that paulo was not covered by cyr because at the time paulo pled guilty to assault with a firearm in,a lawful permanent resident convicted of a firearm offense was not eligible for c relief.the government argued that paulo therefore could not have relied on the availability of c relief when he pled guilty to assault with a firearm.the government argued that the fact that the conviction was changed to a offense in was irrelevant.furthermore,the government noted that c relief was unavailable to an aggravated felon who had served a term of imprisonment of at least five years.the government argued incorrectly that paulo had served a sentence.the government made no other argument against paulo eligibility for c relief.
the district court agreed with the government that because the removal order was based on two independent grounds,one of which remained valid,paulo was not entitled to a new removal hearing.however,the district court agreed with paulo that he was eligible for c relief based on cyr.it agreed with the government that in a lawful permanent resident convicted of a firearm offense was ineligible for c relief.it concluded,however,that the plea for assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm was the relevant plea for the purposes of cyr reliance analysis.when paulo pled guilty to assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm,he was eligible for c relief.the district court observed correctly that paulo had only served a and sentence,which was less than the sentence necessary to bar an aggravated felon from c relief.the district court granted paulo habeas petition on june.it ordered respondents shall allow petitioner to apply to the attorney general for a discretionary waiver of deportation under former c of the immigration and nationality act.the government did not appeal and has not moved under rule for a modification of the district court order.
in compliance with the district court order,the bia remanded the case to the ij on december,to allow paulo to apply for c relief.the ij held preliminary hearings in early.
on april,the bia decided in re blake,bia,and on june,the bia decided in re brieva perez,bia.blake and brieva concern the statutory counterpart rule of c.by its plain language,c applies only to aliens in exclusion proceedings,not removal the term for deportation proceedings.see ina c repealed providing eligibility for relief to a liens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years.in francis ins,cir,however,the second circuit concluded that there was no rational basis for treating aliens who had traveled abroad and were attempting to return to the united states differently from aliens who had never left the united states.based on constitutional avoidance,the second circuit extended c to cover removable as well as excludable aliens.id.at.the bia acquiesced to francis in matter of silva,bia.we agreed with francis in tapia acuna ins,cir.
because the application of c to removable as well as excludable aliens is dependent on the equal protection argument underpinning francis,courts,including this court and the bia,have repeatedly held that in order for removable aliens to be eligible for c relief,the statutory basis for their removability must have a statutory counterpart in the statutory bases for excludability.see,komarenko ins,cir to prevent equal protection violation,c need only cover deportable aliens when a subsection of the exclusion statute is substantially identical to a subsection of the deportation statute matter of esposito,bia matter of montenegro,bia matter of meza,bia.this requirement was codified in a.cyr regulation,promulgated on september,which provides that aliens are ineligible for c relief if they are removable on a ground which does not have a statutory counterpart in section of the ina.f.
