in,appellant juan antonio,a native of mexico,pleaded guilty in north carolina court to three counts of indecent liberties with a child.according to,neither his counsel nor the court informed him of the potential immigration consequences of his guilty plea.but those consequences turned out to be significant,and in,was removed from the united states on the basis of his state convictions.
after reentered the country without permission,he was charged in federal court in with illegal reentry by a removed alien,see a,b,as well as failure to register as a sex offender under sorna,the sex offender registration and notification act,see.argued,however,that his underlying convictions were unconstitutional in light of the supreme court intervening decision in padilla kentucky,holding that the sixth amendment requires a defense attorney to advise a client of the immigration risks of a guilty plea.and,indeed,in,a north carolina court vacated convictions,relying on padilla.
the primary question before us now is what effect the alleged constitutional deficiency in state convictions has on his subsequent prosecution for illegal reentry.we conclude that the alleged infirmity has no effect.because padilla does not apply retroactively to defendants like,convicted before the case was decided,see chaidez united states,convictions remain valid today as a matter of federal law,and his attempt to collaterally attack his removal is unavailing on that ground alone.
accordingly,we hold that the district court properly denied motion to vacate the removal order and to withdraw his guilty plea to the charge of illegal reentry.and for similar reasons,we find no error in the district court reliance on the vacated state convictions in determining sentencing range under the sentencing guidelines.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court in all respects.
we begin with a brief overview of the statutory background relevant to the illegal reentry charge against.under a and b,an alien who has been removed from the united states after being convicted of an aggravated felony as was in,based on his state convictions commits a felony if he subsequently reenters the united states without permission.to win a conviction under,the government must prove,as an element of the offense,the defendant prior removal or deportation.see united states el shami,cir.
typically,the government may rely on the removal order itself,issued by the department of homeland security dhs,to meet this burden.but in united states,the supreme court held that the fact of a removal order may not be treated as conclusive proof of an element of a criminal offense where the immigration proceeding was not conducted in conformity with due process.id.at.in that case,the court concluded,the underlying immigration proceeding violated due process,because the immigration judge permitted improper waivers of the right to appeal and failed to advise of eligibility to apply for suspension of deportation.id.at.and because those procedural defects foreclosed judicial review of the resulting deportation order,the court held,the defendants were entitled to collaterally attack that order in their subsequent prosecution for illegal reentry.id.at.
congress responded by codifying the principle of in d.see united states sosa,cir.under that statute,in order to bring a successful collateral attack against a removal order,the defendant in an illegal reentry prosecution must meet three requirements,demonstrating that 
he or she exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order 
the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and 
the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.
d see united states,cir.like,these three factors exhaustion of administrative remedies,the denial of judicial review,and fundamental unfairness are concerned with procedural irregularities in immigration proceedings that may insulate the resulting orders from judicial review,making it fundamentally unfair to rely on those orders in later criminal prosecutions.sosa,at.
immigrated to the united states from mexico with his family as a child.his parents became legal permanent residents,as did his five siblings.applied for legal permanent residency,but the process never advanced due to his eventual removal from the united states.
there are two underlying proceedings relevant to this case a state prosecution for indecent liberties with a child,and a subsequent immigration proceeding that led to deportation.first,in,was charged in north carolina court with three counts of felony indecent liberties with a child,see stat.ann,arising from consensual relationship with a old girl when he was.pleaded guilty and was sentenced to to months imprisonment.at the plea hearing,the court instructed that he would be required to register as a sex offender after his release from prison.but alleges that he was not informed of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea by his attorney or by the court.although his plea document noted that deportation was a possible consequence,did not sign the plea document and claims he never saw a copy of it.
second,while was serving his state sentence,dhs initiated removal proceedings,on the ground that his indecent liberties convictions qualified as aggravated felonies subjecting him to deportation.see 
a a iii.because was never lawfully admitted to the united states for permanent residence,he was subject to an expedited removal process.see b etienne lynch,cir.describing expedited removal process.instead of being afforded a hearing before an immigration judge,was served with a notice of intent to issue a final administrative removal order noi,indicating that dhs would enter a final removal order and that had ten days to rebut the charge in writing.see b i etienne,at.did not contest the charge and instead requested that he be removed to mexico.in march of,soon after service of a final removal order and release from state prison,dhs deported.
at some point prior to,reentered the united states without permission and returned to north carolina.he did not register as a sex offender under sorna,despite his convictions for a qualifying sex offense.a subsequent arrest revealed him to the authorities and led to the current federal proceeding.
in june,was indicted in the middle district of north carolina on two charges illegal reentry by a removed alien,under a and b and failure to register as a sex offender,under.the parties entered into a written plea agreement,under which pleaded guilty to the illegal reentry charge,and the government agreed to dismissal of the charge for failure to register.
after his guilty plea,in february returned to north carolina court and filed a motion for appropriate relief mar seeking to vacate his state indecent liberties convictions.relying on the supreme court decision in padilla kentucky,issued three years after his convictions argued that his convictions should be set aside because his lawyer failure to inform him of the immigration consequences of his guilty plea meant that his plea was not knowing and voluntary.the north carolina court agreed,and vacated convictions on the ground that they were the result of a plea that was not sufficiently knowing and voluntary under padilla.neither nor the north carolina court addressed the supreme court decision holding that padilla does not apply retroactively to defendants like,whose convictions became final before that decision was issued.see chaidez,at.
with the state mar ruling vacating his convictions in hand,returned to federal district court.according to,his removal order a predicate for the charge of illegal reentry was subject to collateral attack under d on the ground that it rested on unconstitutional and convictions.thus moved to vacate the removal order and,if successful,to withdraw his guilty plea to the charge of illegal reentry.that would leave in place the charge for failure to register as a sex offender but that charge,too,argued,could not go forward in light of the vacatur of his underlying convictions.accordingly,also moved the district court to dismiss both counts of the indictment against him.
at a hearing in july,the district court denied all of motions.as to the illegal reentry charge,the district court explained,the vacatur of state convictions was not dispositive to make a case of illegal reentry under,the government need not prove the underlying convictions from,but only that in fact had been removed in.see t he new prosecution for illegal reentry is not based on the old vacated conviction,it is based on the deportation and the deportation was based on a facially valid conviction at the time of the deportation.
nor,the district court held,could mount a collateral attack on the removal order based on the purported constitutional deficiency of his convictions.the district court reviewed the standard of exhaustion of administrative remedies,preclusion of judicial review,and fundamental unfairness and held that,who had consented to his deportation and never sought any sort of review of any part of the deportation proceedings,could not meet the first two requirements.the court rejected argument that his failure to seek administrative or judicial review should be excused because he was then unaware of a potential constitutional infirmity in his state convictions.though there are cases excusing a failure to exhaust when it is caused by a procedural irregularity in a deportation proceeding itself,the court explained,those cases concern rights one has with the immigration proceeding,not with respect to an underlying conviction.and here,had identified no procedural problems with his immigration proceeding at all 
does not contend he was affirmatively misadvised by anyone involved in the deportation proceedings concerning his right to contest the deportation or to appeal the decision he has not identified anything that immigration authorities should have done during the course of the deportation proceedings that they did not do,and the court thus finds that he not met the first two requirements of the statute as those requirements would ordinarily be interpreted.
relying on failure to satisfy the first two requirements of,the district court had no need to make a final determination as to the third factor,fundamental unfairness.but the court did note that was not asserting actual innocence of the indecent liberties charges,and that padilla,on which the state mar court relied,does not apply retroactively.ultimately,the court concluded that and could provide no relief because complaint was not with his immigration proceedings but rather with his underlying state convictions,independently subject to judicial review through the mar process.the court therefore denied motions to vacate the removal order and to withdraw his guilty plea to the illegal reentry charge.
the district court recognized that motion to dismiss the indictment against him was dependent on the success of his motions to vacate his removal order and withdraw his plea.if the removal order and plea agreement remained in effect,that is,then would stand convicted of illegal reentry,and the charge of failure to register as a sex offender would be dismissed pursuant to the plea agreement.id.if i deny the motion to vacate the deportation order the motion to withdraw the guilty plea does need to be heard and it sort of does away with the motion to dismiss the indictment as well.nevertheless,the court went on to deny the motion to dismiss both counts of the indictment t o the extent it is still before the c ourt.
in september,the district court held a sentencing hearing on the illegal reentry charge.consistent with the presentence report psr,and over objection,the district court used the vacated indecent liberties convictions as the basis for a enhancement to offense level under of the sentencing guidelines,on the ground that previously was deported after a conviction for a crime of violence.sentencing guidelines manual b sentencing comm amended.after a minor downward departure,the district court was left with a guidelines range of to months,and sentenced to months imprisonment.
this timely appeal followed.
we begin with the core issue in this case motion to vacate his removal order,without which,he argues,he may not be convicted of illegal reentry.this court reviews de novo a collateral attack on a removal order under d.el shami,at.
as described above,d,like the decision it codifies,is concerned with failures of due process in an immigration proceeding that would make it fundamentally unfair to rely on a removal order coming out of that proceeding.in particular,where a procedural defect in an immigration proceeding insulates the resulting order from judicial review,due process requires that the order be subject to collateral attack if it is relied on in a subsequent criminal prosecution.see,at holding that immigration proceeding violated due process because immigration judge permitted waivers of right to appeal that were not knowing d,requiring,as condition of collateral attack,that defendant have exhausted administrative remedies and been deprived of judicial review.that principle is broad enough,courts have held,that a failure to exhaust administrative remedies or seek judicial review as required by d will be excused,and a collateral attack permitted,where that failure is itself the product of a procedural flaw in the immigration proceeding.see,sosa,at excusing administrative exhaustion requirement of d where immigration judge fails to inform of right to apply for administrative relief united states,cir.finding waiver of right to appeal removal order does not preclude collateral attack under d where immigration judge failed to advise of right to seek relief from deportation see also,at accepting government concession that d exhaustion requirements are excused by failure to provide translator where language barrier prevents informed decision to waive appeal rights.
but this case,as the district court recognized,is quite different.the thrust of argument is not that his immigration proceedings were procedurally defective it is that his underlying state criminal proceedings were rendered constitutionally infirm by his counsel failure to inform him of the potential immigration consequences of his guilty plea.at bottom,asks us to find that his immigration proceedings were fundamentally unfair and violated due process not because of any intrinsic procedural irregularity,but because they were predicated on unconstitutional state convictions.
as the district court observed,there is an obvious mismatch between the kind of claim seeks to advance and the concerns of and requirements of d.perhaps most important,whereas and d focus on the preclusion of judicial review of an immigration order as justification for subsequent collateral attack,here had access to a route to judicial review of his underlying state conviction,by way of the state mar statute.see does help because in that case there were no avenues for judicial review of the decision at issue.here,the state court mar statute provides a mechanism for judicial review of an allegedly unconstitutional conviction.and while immigration officials must satisfy certain due process obligations with respect to their own proceedings,see,at,at,there is no authority imposing on them the duty to advise aliens of potential legal infirmities in prior criminal proceedings.see due process does not require that immigration officials evaluate and advise someone facing deportation based on a deportable criminal conviction of all the possible reasons the conviction might be invalid.
we need not decide today,however,whether these hurdles might be overcome,or whether due process might in some circumstances demand that an immigration order based on an unconstitutional conviction be subject to collateral attack.that is because in this case,argument is flawed in its premise that his state convictions in fact were constitutionally infirm.pleaded guilty in,three years before the supreme court decision in padilla.because the supreme court subsequently decided that padilla does not apply retroactively,see chaidez,at,any failure by lawyer to warn him of the possible immigration consequences of
