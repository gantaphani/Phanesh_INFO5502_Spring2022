background 
factual background 
a citizen of mexico,was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident alien on april,at the age of ten.in,a was convicted of armed robbery in illinois state court,and was sentenced to in prison.now years old,has since married a united states citizen,with whom he has two children.
on april,the department of homeland security commenced removal proceedings against by filing a notice to appear nta against him in the immigration court.the nta charged that was removable from the united states under three provisions of the immigration and nationality act ina section a a iii for conviction of an aggravated felony relating to a theft or burglary offense as defined in a g of the ina see a a iii,a g section a a iii for conviction of an aggravated felony relating to a crime of violence as defined in a f of the ina see a a iii,a f and section a c for a conviction that involved the use or possession of a firearm see a c.
statutory background 
the thrust of argument in this court turns on the interplay of several amendments to the federal immigration laws.a short discussion of each of the relevant enactments is helpful.
the abuse act of 
congress first made conviction for an aggravated felony a deportable offense in,when it amended the ina through the abuse act of adaa.see adaa a.at that time,the statutory definition of aggravated felony did not include theft offenses or crimes of violence.section b of the adaa provided that the amendments applied only to any alien who has been convicted,on or after the date of the enactment of this act,of an aggravated felony.therefore,under the adaa,only aliens convicted of an aggravated felony on or after november,were deportable.in his petition,relies on the temporal restriction set forth in adaa b for his position that he can not be deported for his conviction.
the immigration act of 
in,congress enacted the immact,a of which broadened the definition of aggravated felony to include any crime of violence for which a term of imprisonment of at least years is imposed.the new definition applied only to crimes committed on or after november.see immact b.
section c of the immact provided 
savings the amendments made by this section,any alien who was deportable because of a conviction before the date of the enactment of this act of an offense referred to in paragraph,or of section a of the immigration and nationality act,as in effect before the date of the enactment of this act,shall be considered to remain so deportable.except as otherwise specifically provided in such section and subsection d,the provisions of such section,as amended by this section,shall apply to all aliens described in subsection a thereof notwithstanding that any such alien entered the united states before the date of enactment of this act,or the facts,by reason of which an alien is described in such subsection,occurred before the date of the enactment of this act.
the immigration technical corrections act of 
on october,congress again broadened the definition of aggravated felony to include theft offenses for which the term of imprisonment imposed is at least five years.see itca a.the itca provided that t he amendments made by section a shall apply to convictions entered on or after the date of enactment of this act.itca b.
the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 
congress revisited the definition of aggravated felony again in with the enactment of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira.see iirira a.section b of iirira amended the ina to read notwithstanding any other provision of law including any effective date,the amended definition of aggravated felony applies regardless of whether the conviction was entered before,on,or after september.section c of iirira states that t he amendments made by this section shall apply to actions taken on or after the date of the enactment of this act,regardless of when the conviction occurred.
procedural background 
in the proceedings before the immigration judge ij,contended that he had previously appeared before an ij and had been granted a waiver of deportation however he could produce no evidence of such a waiver.also applied for cancellation of removal.on april,the ij concluded in a written opinion that was removable on all three charges based on his conviction for armed robbery.specifically,the ij found that armed robbery certainly is an offense relating to a theft offense,identified in a g of the ina.furthermore,the ij determined that armed robbery constitutes a crime of violence as defined in ina a f because it involves a clear risk of harm to an individual.finally,the ij found that was removable pursuant to a c because he had been convicted of a crime that involved the use or possession of a firearm.the ij dismissed application for cancellation of removal,concluding that he was ineligible for cancellation because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony.see a barring a permanent resident alien from eligibility for cancellation of removal if he has been convicted of an aggravated felony.
on appeal of the ij decision to the bia,argued that he was not removable pursuant to a c because he had not been convicted of a firearm offense also maintained that,because he was not deportable at the time he was convicted,he can not be removed today.specifically,argued that the iirira expanded the definition of aggravated felony enacted in not be applied to his conviction because there is a presumption against retroactive application,and retroactive application would violate his due process rights.
on march,the bia dismissed appeal,rejecting argument that the iirira aggravated felony provision should not apply retroactively.for that conclusion the bia relied in part on our decision in ins,cir,which we discuss further below.the bia did not determine whether was removable under a c,noting that even if he was not,he had failed to establish that he was not otherwise removable under a a iii.
ii.discussion 
generally,we lack jurisdiction to review an order removing an alien who has been convicted of committing an aggravated felony.see a c gaiskov holder,cir.however,pursuant to a d,we have jurisdiction to review questions of law and constitutional claims.here,raises legal questions regarding the interpretation of the aggravated felony provisions of the ina and a constitutional claim founded on the ex post facto clause.therefore,we have jurisdiction to consider the petition.while we review questions of law and constitutional claims de novo,we defer to the bia reasonable interpretation of the ina,so long as it is consistent with the language and purposes of the statute.gattem gonzales,cir.
exhaustion 
in the instant petition,effectively concedes that he is removable under our decision in ins,cir,but argues that we instead should follow the ninth circuit decision in holder,cir.as the discussion below demonstrates,contrary to interpretation,the two cases are not necessarily in conflict.more importantly,failure to raise before the bia the arguments addressed in,which he effectively adopts in his petition,precludes us from considering this line of reasoning.
in,we squarely rejected the argument advanced before the,that the iirira definition of aggravated felony can not be applied retroactively.the petitioner in had been convicted in of a crime that was not classified as an aggravated felony until.we concluded that the amended definition could be applied to the earlier con
