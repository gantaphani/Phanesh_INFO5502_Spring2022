background 
jose luis is a native and citizen of el salvador.in january,entered the united states and,on may,submitted an application for asylum with the immigration and naturalization service ins.in july,the ins denied asylum application and referred the matter to an immigration court.the ins commenced removal proceedings against by filing a notice to appear,charging as a removable alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled under a a i.
admitted to the allegations set forth in the notice to appear and conceded removability.however,contested his deportation from the united states,filing an application for asylum and moving for special rule cancellation of removal under the nicaraguan adjustment and central american relief act of nacara.nacara,stat.
shortly thereafter,the ins also filed a charging document alleging that was statutorily ineligible for special rule cancellation of removal under a a i because he was convicted of two crimes involving moral turpitude.
on july,an immigration judge ij ruled that was a removable alien,denied his application for asylum,and found him ineligible for special rule cancellation of removal under the nacara.as to nacara claim,the ij ruled that his past convictions for providing false information to police and gross misdemeanor qualified as crimes involving moral turpitude,therefore barring the ij from finding he possessed the requisite good moral character necessary to trigger eligibility under the nacara.
subsequently appealed this decision to the board of immigration appeals bia.the bia denied appeal,issuing a per curiam opinion affirming the ij decision.the bia also added two points of substantive analysis supplementing the ij decision.now files a petition for review of the bia order.
ii.discussion 
challenges a number of rulings.first,he argues the ij erred by rejecting his claim for asylum based on past persecution and a reasonable fear of future persecution under b.next argues the bia abused its discretion when it rejected his application for asylum based on the severity of his past persecution.see b iii a.third,argues the bia committed error when it mistakenly referred to a critical regulation by the wrong section heading in its opinion.finally,argues the ij committed error when he failed to consider him eligible for asylum based on past persecution.we will address each claim in turn.
asylum based on past persecution and a reasonable fear of future persecution.
first challenges the denial of his application for asylum under b.this court reviews the bia asylum eligibility rulings under the substantial evidence standard.ashcroft,cir.we will only overturn the bia decision if no reasonable could arrive at the conclusion reached by the bia.id.where the bia adopts and affirms the decision of the ij,we will review the ij opinion directly.gonzales,cir.in this case,the bia affirmed and adopted the decision of the ij on this issue.therefore,we review the ij decision directly.
under b,is eligible for asylum if he is a refugee.a refugee is defined as an alien unwilling to return to his home country because of past persecution or a fear of future persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.proof of past persecution based on one of the enumerated bases listed under a a gives rise to a presumption that also maintains a reasonable fear of future persecution.b.this presumption,in turn,places the burden on the government to demonstrate,by a preponderance of the evidence,that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances in el salvador such that may no longer credibly claim a fear of future persecution.gomez gonzales,cir.
the ij ruled that even if had established past persecution,the government discharged its burden of proof by showing that he did not maintain a reasonable fear of future persecution.in response,argues that a single state department report can not,as a matter of law,discharge the government burden of proof.this case does not present such a narrow question.instead,the ij properly relied on the state department report and the testimony of to conclude that does not have a reasonable fear of future persecution.
the ij first recognized that general conditions in el salvador have improved because there is no longer civil war.to support this conclusion,the ij relied on a state department country conditions report,which noted that general conditions have improved in el salvador since the signing of the peace accords.we recognize that allegations of past persecution stemmed from heightened tensions between members of el salvador official military and guerilla fighters during the civil war.the state department report therefore helps demonstrate that the general civil unrest which led to abuse has abated.in this regard,the ij properly considered the state department report in reaching his conclusion.our court has expressly held that a state department report assessing country conditions may be used to rebut the presumption that an has a reasonable fear of future persecution.awale ashcroft,cir.
the ij also based his decision,in part,on the testimony of.testified that he did not fear government persecution in the event he was returned to el salvador.also stated that he has not been actively recruited by members of the official military since he lived in el salvador in.we therefore rule that testimony,together with the state department country conditions report,provide substantial record evidence to demonstrate that he did not have an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution.as such,the ij properly found ineligible for asylum under b.
asylum based on the severity of past persecution.
we next address claim that the bia abused its discretion when it failed to grant him relief based on the severity of his past persecution on review,we will not disturb the discretionary rulings of the bia unless they are arbitrary and capricious.maashio ins,cir.
under b iii a,or the humanitarian grant of asylum provision,the bia has discretion to grant an applicant asylum so long as he can demonstrate compelling reasons for being unwilling or unable to return to his county arising out of the severity of past persecution.b iii a.to qualify for relief under this provision,we have required petitioners to demonstrate abuse that is particularly atrocious.cigaran heston,cir.moreover,asylum based on past persecution is properly invoked only where the past persecution is so severe that it would be inhumane to return the alien even in the absence of any risk of future persecution.vaduva ins,cir.by contrast,courts have upheld the bia denial of asylum based on past persecution where the applicant was arrested,beaten,fired,and denied future employment.rojas ins,cir.
we acknowledge that was beaten unconscious by members of the el salvadorian military,leaving him with a physical deformity and several scars.friend was also killed during this incident.however,the severity of this abuse,in addition to the circumstances surrounding it,do not place in the class of individuals entitled to this form of relief.therefore,we rule that the bia exercise of discretion in this instance was not arbitrary or capricious and,as such,the bia did not err when it found ineligible for relief based on past persecution.
remaining claims.
also contends the bia committed error when it incorrectly referenced the humanitarian grant of asylum provision by the wrong regulation section in its opinion.specifically,the bia mistakenly cited b iiii a instead of correctly referencing b iii a.although we acknowledge the bia clerical error,we note that the bia applied the correct controlling language from b iii a to support its analysis.therefore,we rule that the bia error was purely ministerial and therefore harmless.see united states devore,cir stating that a clerical error that causes no prejudice is immaterial and harmless.
finally,argues the ij committed error when he did not expressly consider eligibility for asylum based on past persecution.in his opinion,the ij questioned whether the abuse suffered as a youth in el salvador even rose to the level of persecution.gi
