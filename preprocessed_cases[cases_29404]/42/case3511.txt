in this petition for review,we consider whether the board of immigration appeals bia has jurisdiction to review a motion to reconsider and reopen filed after a petitioner has been involuntarily removed from the united states.we conclude that it has jurisdiction and we grant the petition for review.
reyes torres is a native and citizen of mexico who obtained lawful permanent resident status in.since then he has been convicted of two crimes relevant to this petition.in,reyes torres was convicted of transporting aliens in violation of a.in,he was convicted of possession of a controlled substance in violation of california health and safety code a.
the department of homeland security dhs served reyes torres with a notice to appear nta in,charging him with being removable pursuant to a a iii as an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony and a b i as an alien who has been convicted of a law relating to a controlled substance.at a hearing before an immigration judge ij,reyes torres admitted the factual allegations in the nta,contested removability on the basis of the aggravated felony charge,and conceded removability on the basis of his controlled substance violation.he also stated his intention to seek relief from deportation in the form of cancellation of removal.such relief is unavailable to permanent residents who have been convicted of any aggravated felony.a.
the ij issued a written decision finding that reyes torres alien transportation conviction constituted an aggravated felony and he was therefore ineligible for relief in the form of cancellation of removal.in light of this finding,and in light of reyes torres concession of removability on the controlled substance conviction,the ij ordered him removed to mexico.reyes torres appealed to the bia and it affirmed the ij decision on september.
reyes torres was removed from the united states on october.on october,a california superior court judge granted reyes torres motion to withdraw his guilty plea to the controlled substance charge resulting in his controlled substance conviction.the judge granted the motion on the ground that reyes torres was not adequately informed of the immigration consequences of the plea.on october,reyes torres filed with the bia a motion to reconsider and reopen proceedings based on the new evidence of the vacated conviction.
on december,the bia dismissed reyes torres motion to reopen and reconsider,concluding that it lacked jurisdiction because reyes torres had been removed from the united states prior to its filing.the bia cited the departure bar in d for this proposition.reyes torres timely petitioned for review of both the bia september,decision dismissing his appeal case and the bia december,decision dismissing his motion to reconsider and reopen case.the court sua sponte consolidated the petitions.
the regulatory departure bar at issue in this case reads 
a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the united states.
d.the bia argues that its interpretation of the departure bar strips it of jurisdiction to hear motions to reopen or reconsider filed by aliens who have already been removed from the united states.
we recently examined the departure bar in coyt holder,cir.coyt entered the united states without inspection and,twenty years later,the immigration and naturalization service initiated removal proceedings against him.id.at.coyt conceded removability but applied for cancellation of removal or voluntary departure.id.the ij granted a voluntary departure period.id.at.the bia affirmed the ij decision,granting coyt an additional thirty days to depart voluntarily.id.at.due to a miscommunication with his attorney,coyt did not receive notice of the bia decision,and did not depart within the requisite thirty days.id.when coyt eventually learned of the bia decision,he moved for the bia to reissue its decision so that the voluntary departure period would restart,arguing ineffective assistance of counsel.id.on the same day,coyt was removed.id.
the bia issued an order finding coyt removal resulted in the withdrawal of his motion to reissue,citing d.id.that section reads in full 
a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the united states.any departure from the united states,including the deportation or removal of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings,occurring after the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider,shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion.
coyt petitioned this court for review and we granted his petition.id.at.we explained that the first step in analyzing a regulation under chevron requires us to determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at quoting chevron res.def.council.we then analyzed congress amendments to the immigration and nationality act,which granted aliens subject to a removal order the right to file a motion to reopen.id.at citing c a.these amendments,collectively known as the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,provide that within ninety days,the alien may file a motion to reopen,and the attorney general must remove the alien.c c a a see also id.c b granting aliens thirty days to file a motion to reconsider.
after reviewing the statutes,we determined that the intent of congress is clear,and that in passing iirira,congress anticipated that petitioners would be able to pursue relief after departing from the united states.coyt,at.as such,we held that 
the only manner in which we can harmonize the provisions simultaneously affording the petitioner a ninety day right to file a motion to reopen and requiring the alien removal within ninety days is to hold,consistent with the other provisions of iirira,that the physical removal of a petitioner by the united states does not preclude the petitioner from pursuing a motion to reopen.
there is no principled legal distinction to be drawn between coyt and this case.the only factual difference between the cases is that coyt filed his motion to reopen prior to his involuntary departure.reyes torres did not file his motion to reopen and reconsider until after he was removed.this distinction is immaterial in light of congress clear intent in passing iirira.reyes torres was forcibly removed seven days after the final order of removal was entered.if we accept the government argument,the attorney general would have the power to unilaterally reduce the time in which reyes torres could have filed his motion to reopen from the statutorily mandated ninety days to seven days.because such a result would completely eviscerate the statutory right to reopen provided by congress,we reaffirm our holding in coyt that the physical removal of a petitioner by the united states does not preclude the petitioner from pursuing a motion to reopen.id.
reyes torres also appeals the bia september,decision affirming the ij conclusion that his alien transportation conviction constituted an aggravated felony.we do not find it necessary to decide whether the conviction constituted an aggravated felony for removal purposes in light of our holding in ledezma galicia holder,wl cir.in ledezma galicia,we held that a a iii does not apply to convictions that occurred prior to the enactment of the anti drug abuse act of adaa.id.at.the adaa which created the category of crimes denominated aggravated felonies and provided that aliens convicted of such aggravated felonies were subject to deportation was enacted november.anti drug abuse act of,stat.because reyes torres conviction for alien transportation occurred prior to november,it can not constitute a removable aggravated felony.
the fact that reyes torres was deemed removable under a b i due to his controlled substance conviction does not alter the analysis.the guilty plea has since been vacated and can no longer serve as a basis for removability see cardoso tlaseca gonzales,cir a conviction vacated because of a procedural or substantive defect is not considered a conviction for immigration purposes and can not serve as the basis for removeability.internal quotation marks and citation omitted wiedersperg ins,cir this and other courts have clearly established that the nullification of a conviction upon which deportability is premised deprives deportation of a legal basis.the fact that reyes torres sought to vacate his controlled substance conviction in light of the immigration consequences does not change the reasoning because the petitioner motive is not the crucial inquiry.see pickering gonzales,cir.instead,the inquiry must focus on the state court rationale for vacating the conviction,and the burden is on the government to prove that it was vacated solely for rehabilitative reasons or reasons related to his immigration status cardoso tlaseca gonzales,at citing pickering gonzales,cir,amended and superseded by pickering,at see also pickering,at explaining the difference between a conviction vacated for rehabilitative or immigration reasons and a conviction vacated for procedural or substantive infirmities.this question is not before us because it is one that must be determined in the first instance by the bia on remand.cardoso tlaseca,at.until the bia determines that the conviction was not vacated on the merits,reyes torres was not properly found removable under the ina on a ground separate and distinct from a pre aggravated felony conviction,unlike the petitioner in becker gonzales,cir.therefore,because the controlled substance conviction has been vacated,the aggravated felony conviction is the only remaining basis for removability,and ledezma galicia controls the determination.
we grant the petition for review and remand this case to the bia for further action consistent with this opinion.
petition granted.
the majority decision fails to follow the principles of agency deference and misreads our recent precedent for determining whether an aggravated felon is eligible for cancellation of removal.therefore,i dissent.
in october,ruben reyes torres,who had become a lawful permanent resident,was removed from the united states based on his state conviction for unlawfully possessing a controlled substance.see a b i.during his removal proceedings,reyes torres conceded removability on the basis of his controlled substance conviction,but requested cancellation of removal pursuant to a.this request was denied,however,because reyes torres had also been convicted of an aggravated felony smuggling aliens in.
shortly after his removal to mexico,reyes torres filed a motion to reopen and reconsider his removal proceedings with the board of immigration appeals board.according to reyes torres,he was entitled to relief because he had recently withdrawn his guilty plea on the controlled substance charge.the board,however,denied the motion because reyes torres had departed the united states prior to filing the motion.see d.
reyes torres raises two issues for our review.he first challenges the board refusal to reopen and reconsider his removal proceedings.reyes torres also contends that the immigration courts erred when they held that his conviction for alien smuggling constitutes an aggravated felony.i would deny reyes torres petition for review on both issues.
reyes torres motion to reopen and reconsider his removal proceedings was denied based on the board departure bar,which is set forth at d.that section,enacted by the united states attorney general,provides 
a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not be made by or on behalf of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings subsequent to his or her departure from the united states.any departure from the united states,including the deportation or removal of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings,occurring after the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider,shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion.
id.relying on coyt holder,cir,the majority concludes that the departure regulation can not stand in this case because reyes torres was involuntarily deported.in my view,the majority should have given appropriate deference to the board reasonable interpretation of its own regulation.see chevron,natural res.def.council,requiring deference to an agency interpretation of an ambiguous statutory or regulatory provision unless the agency interpretation is unreasonable.
the board has explained that it lacks the power to provide administrative relief to an alien who has departed the territory of the united states.in re armendarez mendez,bia.since the early,the board has consistently maintained this position and regularly applied this bar to departed aliens.see in re g y b,bia.the board defines section d as jurisdictional.armendarez mendez,at.thus,the board explains that this regulatory bar limits its adjudicative authority and capacity to consider claims of departed aliens,even when as is the case here the alien departure is involuntary.see id.
the board interpretation of its departure rule as a jurisdictional bar is not unreasonable or implausible.see chevron,at.while it may seem linguistically awkward to consider the forcible removal of an alien as constitut ing a withdrawal of any pending motions filed by the alien,the issue is not whether the board interpretation of its own regulation is somewhat awkward.zhang holder,cir alteration in original.instead,we must consider whether the agency interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the plain language of section d does not preclude the board interpretation,and reyes torres points to nothing in the immigration and nationality act ina that prohibits the board from treating its departure bar as a jurisdictional rule.accordingly,under chevron,we should defer to the board interpretation of its own departure provision.see at auer robbins,explaining that the judiciary should defer to an agency plausible reading of its own regulations.
i recognize that congress has enacted legislation allowing aliens the right to file at least one motion to reopen with the board.see c a.i also appreciate the general rule that an administrative agency can not contract a statutory grant of jurisdiction.see union pac.of locomotive eng rs.the general rule holds true,however,only to the extent that congress has not given the agency authority to adopt rules of jurisdictional dimension.see id.emphasizing that the controlling statute did not allow the agency to limit the scope of its own jurisdiction.this case therefore is unlike the agency regulation at issue in union pacific.here,congress has expressly delegated very broad authority to the attorney general to establish regulations as necessary to enforce our nation immigration laws.see g authorizing the attorney general to establish such regulations,review such administrative determinations in immigration proceedings,delegate such authority,and perform such acts as the attorney general determines to be necessary under the ina.based on this authority,the attorney general has seen fit to establish the departure bar and limit the board power to reopen removal proceedings when an alien leaves the united states.d.
significantly,congress silence on the propriety of the removal bar,despite repeated amendments to the ina,demonstrates legislative acquiescence to the attorney general authority to enact a departure regulation.zhang,at,citing immigration act of.d.because congress has acquiesced to the attorney general authority to limit an alien right to file a motion to reopen,and given that the board interpretation of that limitation is reasonable,we should defer to the board.
it is true that our sister circuits have split over the validity of the departure bar.the sixth and seventh circuits,for instance,have invalidated section d,concluding that the attorney general lacks authority to limit the board jurisdiction over motions to reopen.pruidze holder,cir marin rodriguez holder,cir.meanwhile,the fifth
