mom phal and her husband,soeun nou,are citizens of cambodia.the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the decision of the immigration judge ij denying their applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.after careful consideration,we conclude that substantial evidence supports the bia determination that phal lacked credibility and that she had failed to demonstrate a reasonable fear of future persecution we therefore deny the petition for review.
background 
on april,phal entered the united states on a nonimmigrant visa nou arrived several months later.within a year of phal entry,the couple filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal and also sought protection under the cat,alleging persecution based on political opinion.on june,the immigration and naturalization service issued a notice to appear,charging that phal and nou had remained in the united states longer than permitted.they admitted to the allegations and conceded removability.phal and nou,with counsel,appeared and testified before the ij on march,seeking relief for political persecution based on their activism as members of the sam rainsy party srp.
on september,the ij denied the petitioners applications for asylum.the ij found that phal was not credible,citing to a number of discrepancies between her oral testimony and written application,inconsistencies within her testimony,and discrepancies regarding her documentary evidence.given the lack of credibility,the ij concluded that phal had not established eligibility for asylum.the ij also concluded that even if she had testified credibly,she had failed to demonstrate a fear of future persecution because she remained in cambodia campaigning for the srp until april,nearly two years after her alleged arrest and detention in,without any problems or incidents.moreover,the ij noted that she was able to leave cambodia with her own passport in her own name and had no apparent difficulties with the cambodian authorities.the ij also rejected the petitioners claims for withholding of removal and found them ineligible for cat protection because phal failed to present credible evidence that she was tortured in the past or would face torture in the future if she were to return to cambodia.
the petitioners appealed the ij decision.in a per curiam order,the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision that phal had failed to present a credible claim of persecution.the bia found that the ij conclusions were not erroneous and that the various discrepancies and inconsistencies identified by the ij were central to their claims of persecution.the bia was unpersuaded by the contentions that the inconsistencies were minor many of the inconsistencies cited by the immigration judge are significant and the documentation submitted to establish the respondents political activities does not accurately identify them.the bia also agreed with the ij determination that phal had failed to establish a fear of future persecution,given the evidence that she had remained living in cambodia without incident for nearly two years after their alleged arrests.the bia,thus,dismissed the appeal.
ii.discussion 
the petitioners make two claims in their petition for review.first,they argue that the ij erred in making her adverse credibility finding.second,they assert that relief should be granted because the record demonstrates that phal sustained past persecution and that she has a fear of future persecution.the bia rejected both of these arguments we agree.
adverse credibility 
in its per curiam order,the bia adopted and affirmed the ij adverse credibility finding and took the opportunity to discuss some of the grounds identified by the ij.we review both opinions.see lin gonzáles,cir where,as here,the bia adopted and affirmed the ij ruling,but also discussed some of the other bases for the ij opinion,we review both the ij and the bia opinions.quoting zheng gonzáles,cir.
we review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence standard we overturn the agency findings only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b stroni gonzáles,cir.we give great deference to an ij credibility determinations so long as the ij provide d specific reasons for those determinations.dhima gonzáles,cir.such deference is demanded where 
the discrepancies and omissions described by the ij are actually present in the record those discrepancies and omissions provide specific and cogent reasons to conclude that the petitioners provided incredible testimony regarding facts central to the merits of the asylum claim and petitioners do not provide a convincing explanation for the discrepancies and omissions.

the bia and ij identified several concerns regarding phal testimony,namely inconsistencies regarding the attacks against her in may,july,and april a discrepancy between her testimony and her written application regarding the date on which she joined the srp and questions of authenticity surrounding certain letters from party leader sam rainsy after reviewing those grounds,we conclude that the bia affirmance is sustained under our deferential standard of review.we briefly address the inconsistencies and discrepancies discussed by the ij and bia.
the ij discussed phal testimony regarding three different alleged attacks against her as a result of her political opinions,noting inconsistencies within her testimony.first,she testified that three hun sen soldiers hit her in may,but on stated that the attack involved only two soldiers.second,with respect to the july attack during the demonstration,she first denied being attacked,but then said that hun sen soldiers had shot at the group,although not at her directly.third,regarding the april attack,phal testified that two men on a motorcycle fired bullets into her home and yelled,t his is a gift for your new year,but she had attested in her affidavit that only one individual had fired at her home.
phal asserts that the ij makes too much of minor inconsistencies and urges us to treat them as honest mistakes.she explains that the inconsistencies regarding the number of attackers and whether she herself was attacked when soldiers fired into a group of people are reasonable mistakes that the ij should not have weighed so heavily.while these inconsistencies are perhaps minor in isolation,when taken together with the other concerns discussed by the ij,they raise questions regarding phal claims of political persecution and add to a reasonable inference of lack of candor.lumaj gonzáles,cir.
furthermore,there are other,more concerning inconsistencies between phal testimony and her asylum application.the ij and the bia both noted that in her written application,she stated that she had begun working actively with the srp in december and suffered persecution by the hun sen as a result of her activism.specifically,phal wrote that she had received a threatening letter in march which told her to stop helping the sam rainsy or you will disappear.yet,during her removal hearing,she testified that she did not join the srp until march and made no mention of the threatening letter.the discrepancy between the date on which she became active within the srp and when she allegedly received threats is central to her claim of political persecution phal vague response was not a persuasive explanation for the inconsistency we have specifically noted that inconsistencies between statements in an asylum application and testimony during the asylum proceedings provide substantial evidence to support an adverse credibility determination.see melhem gonzáles,cir.
the ij and the bia also determined that the documentary evidence produced by phal raised questions about her candor and credibility.one letter,purporting to be from sam rainsy and sent from lowell,massachusetts,was submitted as evidence that phal and her husband were members of the srp.the letter,however,had the incorrect date of birth for both phal and her husband and incorrectly identified phal as a male.the letter is the only evidence provided to corroborate the testimony that phal was a member
