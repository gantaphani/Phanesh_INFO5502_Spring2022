opinion of the court 
igor leia petitions this court for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia dated april,dismissing his appeal from the order of the immigration judge ij denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal.leia argues,inter alia,that the bia abused its discretion in affirming the ij refusal to admit the documentary evidence that he proffered following remand of the case because it had not been authenticated in the manner required by,the primary factor contributing to an adverse credibility determination.app.at.the bia dismissal order stated,inter alia,based on the lack of authenticated collaborating documentation,we find that the respondent failed to meet his burden of proof.id.because this court has recently issued an opinion interpreting the authentication requirement in,see liu ashcroft,cir,an opinion that was not available to either the ij or the bia at the time of their respective decisions,we will grant leia petition for review,vacate the bia order,and remand.
leia is a ukrainian citizen of polish descent.according to him,ukrainians living in the ukraine like himself are treated differently than ethnic ukrainians.in the agency proceedings,he argued that because he is not of ukrainian ancestry he was often subject to ridicule and was repeatedly denied job promotions.leia testified that in order to combat this discrimination he joined a political organization called the united national front unf,whose goals are to promote the rights of ukrainians within the ukraine.as a member of this organization,leia would attend meetings,hand out information in the streets and squares of the city of his residence,and correspond with unf organizations in other cities.app.at.
leia testified that during a unf meeting on december,he was beaten by members of the organization of ukrainian nationalists and the ukrainian revolutionary army nationalistic party,a conglomerate group according to leia,he was struck in the head with a pair of brass attack that left a scar.he further stated that instead of arresting the members of the nationalistic party who had started the fight,the authorities arrested him and other victims of the altercation.leia was then incarcerated for over hours,and claims that while in police custody,he was further beaten and insulted.app.at.indeed,leia claimed that when he asked the arresting officers why his attackers had not been apprehended,the officers replied caustically and stated that if y ou want trouble,we will give you trouble.app.at.following his release,leia filed a complaint with the prosecutor office but stated that he never received a response.id.
after this incident,leia began getting calls and threats at home from people demanding that he stop his political activities and suggesting that he leave the ukraine.app.at.he further claims to have received notes containing similar threats.then,while leia was walking home on march,he was beaten on the street by members of the nationalistic party.during this attack,his assailants taunted him remember we warned you to stop,but you did not listen.app.at.as a result of this assault,he suffered multiple contusions and bruising all over his neck and body,a concussion,and injury to his brain 
approximately two months later,he and his wife were both attacked and beaten by a group of apparent in the yard in front of their apartment.app.at.leia was beaten with a metal bat and again sustained a concussion further,his wife,who was pregnant at the time,suffered a miscarriage.he and his wife were then taken to the hospital.after they were released,his wife filed a complaint with the authorities,but once again no action was taken in response to this complaint.app.at.fearing that he would be subject to future beatings and acts of persecution,leia came to the united states and,within a year of his arrival,sought asylum.app.at.
after reviewing leia claim,the ij held that he was not eligible for asylum.the ij,in an oral decision dated november,based her decision on the issue of credibility,stating she had grave misgivings regarding the credibility of leia,on the lack of objective facts in support of the application,and on the fact that the united state department of state country reports,profiles,and advisory opinions indicated that leia could live in other areas in the ukraine without experiencing persecution.app.at.the ij credibility determination in turn was primarily based on leia failure to obtain original documents from the various ukrainian governmental authorities and on the fact that the facsimile copies he did obtain were not properly authenticated pursuant to.app.at.in fact,because leia had failed to authenticate the foreign documents pursuant to the protocols delimited in,the ij sustained an objection to those documents lodged by the immigration and naturalization service ins and refused to enter them into evidence.
in addition to the authentication of documents issue and leia resultant inability to provide documentary support for his averments,the ij noted two inconsistencies in leia testimony which she found troubling and which affected her credibility determination.the first inconsistency concerned the date of the second beating.although leia testified that the second beating occurred on march,the ij noted that his passport shows that he was in poland on this date.app.at.
the second inconsistency in leia testimony to which the ij referred concerned the legal status of the unf.at various times in his testimony,leia referred to the organization as legal and at other times he described it as illegal.according to leia,the unf had applied for legalization but had not received papers indicating that it was legal or illegal.he testified that because the unf had never received papers saying it was illegal he believed the unf not to be illegal.at another portion of his testimony,petitioner stated that he could not obtain proof of his membership in the unf because these would be illegal papers.app.at.the ij stated that this testimony was internally inconsistent.
lastly,the ij determined that leia testimony regarding his need for asylum was contradicted by the department of state advisory opinions and the country reports on human rights for which indicated that there were areas in the ukraine where petitioner would be able to live without experiencing persecution.on these bases,the ij found that petitioner testimony regarding his need for asylum was not credible and denied his request for asylum.app.at.
on appeal,the bia focused on the ij decision sustaining the ins objections to the unauthenticated facsimile documents.the bia pointed out that the ins was provided with the evidence approximately two months before the hearing but failed to notify the leias of its objections until the hearing.noting the importance of the documents,the bia determined that the leias should be given further opportunity to authenticate their evidence and have it considered.app.at.
sometime thereafter,leia filed an affidavit directed to the discrepancy noted by the ij as to the date of the second beating.leia explained that he had not remembered the date he was attacked so he relied on the certificate from the hospital,which was apparently incorrect.subsequently,he obtained a corrected version of the hospital record,which confirmed march,as the date of the second attack.he proffered the affidavit and the corrected version of the hospital record.it is not clear from the record what weight,if any,the ij accorded this affidavit in the subsequent remand.
as directed by the bia,the ij held additional hearings respecting leia asylum petition.after granting several continuances in order to afford leia an opportunity to authenticate the documents,the ij held a merits hearing on july.at this hearing,leia presented the testimony of professor peter stavrakis who the parties stipulated was an expert in ukrainian politics.app.at.professor stavrakis testified regarding the current political situation in the ukraine and explained why he believed leia would be unable to obtain authenticated documents in the political climate at that time.app.at.
at the conclusion of the july,hearing,the ij issued an oral decision.the ij dismissed the testimony of professor stavrakis as irrelevant because she concluded he was not an expert on authentication.app.at.she reiterated her concern about the failure to provide authenticated documents,noting that even though leia had been granted two continuances on the remand totaling over a year in order to afford him sufficient time to obtain authentication,he had failed to do so.she stated that leia 
was given an opportunity to provide to this court properly authenticated documents which had been found inadmissible for lack of proper authentication pursuant to and on remand the respondent has again failed to provide the authentication necessary and the decision of the immigration court provided on november,is adopted herein once more.
app.at.leia appealed and this time,the bia affirmed.in its decision dated april,it stated 
based on the lack of authenticated collaborating documentation,we find that the respondent failed to meet his burden of proof in the present case,the respondent attempted to proffer documents to corroborate his claim that he had been subject to physical abuse,had filed police reports,and had received corresponding medical treatment exhs,and,marked for identification only.the documents which the respondent submitted were copies transmitted by facsimile.although we accorded the respondent an opportunity to authenticate the documents,the respondent failed to provide evidence that he attempted to comply with the regulations instead,he attempted to explain why it would be unreasonable to expect compliance.the existence of such corroborating documentation is undisputed.the absence of authenticated corroborating documentation is also undisputed.for the reasons set forth in the immigration judge july,decision,we find that the respondent failed to demonstrate that it would be unreasonable to expect authentication of the corroborating documentation in the instant case 
in sum,we agree with the immigration judge conclusion that the respondent failed to put forth sufficient credible testimony in support of his persecution claim.the respondent thus failed to establish eligibility for asylum and withholding of deportation accordingly,the appeal is dismissed.
app.at.leia thereafter lodged this timely petition for review.

the bia affirmed the ij denial of leia application for asylum based on its conclusion that leia failed to present authenticated corroborating documentation under and thus failed to carry his burden of proof.in addition,the bia,adopting wholesale the ij opinion,found that leia had otherwise failed to present credible evidence as stated in the foregoing procedural summary,the ij finding of adverse credibility was based primarily on leia failure to authenticate his documents pursuant to the regulation set forth in,but was also based in part on the two inconsistencies in leia oral testimony and the contradiction between leia accounts and the department of state advisory opinion and country report on human rights practices in the ukraine.we turn first to the authentication issue under.
section,the regulation governing authentication,provides in pertinent part 
in any proceeding under this chapter,an official record or entry therein,when admissible for any purpose,shall be evidenced by an official publication thereof,or by a copy attested by an officer so authorized the attested copy,with the additional foreign certificates if any,must be certified by an officer in the foreign service of the united states,stationed in the foreign country where the record is kept.
b.in affirming the ij order,the bia agreed that this provision is the only mechanism whereby an asylum applicant can authenticate an official record.
in the ij first opinion,she interpreted this regulation as requiring her to disregard any documents that were not authenticated pursuant to the procedures set forth in this regulation.app.at on remand,and even after hearing professor stavrakis testimony as to the political situation in the ukraine which made it impossible to have documentary evidence authenticated,the ij reaffirmed her prior conclusion that leia was not credible because of his failure to provide authenticated documents.in fact,as indicated by her comments during the july,hearing,the ij disregarded professor stavrakis testimony because that portion of the testimony regarding perhaps political motives that just as far as i concerned just totally irrelevant it the regulations that i bound by and it does matter what country the person comes from and that a fact.app.at.the bia affirmed,stating,inter alia,that for the reasons set forth by the ij,leia failed to demonstrate that it would be unreasonable to expect authentication of the corroborating documentation in the instant case.app.at.
in our recent opinion addressing the question whether an ij may exclude documentary evidence from review solely because it was not certified pursuant to,we held that is not an absolute rule of exclusion,and is not the exclusive means of authenticating records before an immigration judge.liu,at.we agreed with the government statement in its brief that asylum applicants can not always reasonably be expected to have an authenticated document from an alleged persecutor.id.at quoting gov t letter br.at we held,therefore,that the applicants should have been given the opportunity to prove the authenticity of their documentary evidence through other means.in addition,we explained that because the documentary evidence at issue in that case,if found genuine,would corroborate the applicants testimony and because the other inconsistencies cited by the ij,when viewed as a whole,did not amount to substantial evidence that the applicants were not credible,remand was appropriate.
in the case before us,the ij interpretation of and the bia ultimate acceptance of and approval of that interpretation were made without the benefit of our decision in liu and are contrary to our holding in that case.as in liu,the hospital documents proffered here,especially the hospital certificates,if found genuine,would corroborate leia testimony regarding the attacks he suffered.
moreover,we believe that the bia abused its discretion in approving sub silentio the ij decision to reject professor stavrakis testimony regarding the political conditions in the ukraine and why these conditions made it difficult,if not impossible,for leia to follow the processes outlined in.professor stavrakis has a very distinguished record.he is an associate professor in the department of political science of the university of vermont,and has been deputy director of the kennan institute for advanced russian studies with the woodrow wilson international center.app.at.at the remand hearing on july,both parties agreed that he is an expert in ukrainian political affairs.he testified at length,covering some forty pages of the july,transcript,about the impact of the political situation in the ukraine on leia ability to obtain the relevant authentication.he explained that before the documents can be authenticated by the united states foreign service,they needed to be certified by the ukrainian ministry of justice and the ukrainian ministry of foreign affairs.app.at.professor stavrakis stated that many supporters of the ukrainian nationalist movement hold positions in civil government and would be unlikely to provide leia with the required certifications.
we held in liu that is not the exclusive means to authenticate documents and that asylum seekers must be given the opportunity to prove authentication by other means.at.leia had the right to present evidence explaining why authentication was impossible and it thus was an abuse of discretion for the ij to refuse to consider professor stavrakis testimony on the ground that he had absolutely no knowledge or at the least very little knowledge about the authentication process.app.at.that was not the basis for presentation of professor stavrakis expert testimony.instead,he testified as to the effect of the political situation on the ability of a dissident,such as leia,to obtain government certification.that was a subject within his expertise.we conclude that this matter must be remanded to the bia for reconsideration in light of liu.of course,we assume that on remand the bia will direct the ij to determine the genuineness of the documents,a prerequisite for acceptance of documents that can not reasonably be authenticated via the ordinary channels.
remand,of course,is appropriate in situations where,as is the case here,a court of appeals has made a legal determination,regarding admissibility of evidence that fundamentally upsets the balancing of facts and evidence upon which an agency decision is based.in such instances,we are obliged to remand to the agency to reconsider and reweigh the facts,rather than attempting to undertake that task ourselves.see immigration naturalization serv.ventura,d liu,at.moreover,in this case the bia final decision agree ing with the ij conclusion that leia failed to put forth sufficient credible testimony in support of his persecution claim,app.at,does not appear to have been based exclusively on the documents that were unauthenticated and excluded,although that was the only issue explicitly discussed by the bia.under these circumstances and in order to provide some guidance,we will consider the other bases for the ij adverse credibility determination as they may be relevant on remand.
as set forth in our discussion of the facts,the ij found troubling what she termed two inconsistencies in leia testimony which affected her adverse credibility determination.the first inconsistency concerned the date of the second beating.although leia initially maintained that the second beating occurred on march,his passport showed that he was in poland on this date.after this discrepancy was revealed,leia filed an affidavit explaining that he had not remembered the date he was attacked so he relied on the certificate from the hospital,which was apparently incorrect.app.at.subsequently,he obtained and submitted a corrected version of the hospital record,which confirmed the date of the second attack.although there is no explicit rejection by the ij of the affidavit in the record,the ij may have rejected the affidavit because it was supported only by the corrected medical records which,of course,had not been authenticated according to the procedures set forth in.as explained above,rejection on that ground was erroneous.thus,this inconsistency fails to support the ij adverse credibility determination.see also immigration naturalization,cir m inor discrepancies in dates that are attributable to the applicant language problems or typographical errors can not be viewed as attempts by the applicant to enhance his claims of persecution and have no bearing on credibility.
the second inconsistency in leia testimony to which the ij referred concerned the legal status of the unf.during his testimony,leia referred to the organization as legal and at other times he described it as illegal.according to leia,the unf had applied for legalization,but had not received papers indicating that it was legal or illegal.leia explained that because the unf had never received papers saying it was an illegal organization,he believed it was probably legal.app.at.however,during a different portion of his testimony,leia stated that he could not obtain proof of his membership in the unf because these would be illegal papers.id.
we do not see this testimony as supporting the ij adverse credibility determination.what the ij treated as a contradiction appears to be more reflective of the inconsistencies in the ukrainian government and its politics than of leia credibility.as discussed in the department of state profiles and country reports respecting the ukraine,political groups are required to register with the government.according to the country reports,this registration requirement lends itself to abuse and bureaucratic manipulation.the country reports further suggest that whether a group is legal or not is not necessarily dispositive of how the government will actually treat it.professor stavrakis testimony can be construed as supporting a finding that a political organization might technically be legal and yet for all intents and purposes be treated as illegal by the ukrainian government.thus,the fact that leia did not know if the unf was technically legal or not should not be used to impugn his credibility.leia could only be expected to know how the organization was actually treated by the government.the ij apparently failed to consider the testimony and evidence which provided a reasonable explanation of what seemed to the ij to be an inconsistency in leia statements.furthermore,even if this explanation were found unsatisfactory by the ij,we doubt whether this one contradiction by itself could support an adverse credibility finding,at.
lastly,the ij found that leia testimony that he would face persecution throughout the ukraine was not credible because it was contradicted by the department of state advisory opinions and country reports on human rights for.app.at.according to the department of state profile,m any of the problems encountered by applicants from ukraine are local or regional in nature,and therefore internal flight would be a logical solution to many frictions.the ij held that this profile supported her credibility finding because it contradicted leia testimony by clearly indicat ing that leia would in fact be able to reside in other areas of the ukraine without any problems.app.at.
to be sure,it is well established that although a showing of past persecution raises the presumption of future persecution,this presumption may be rebutted by a finding that the applicant could avoid future harm by relocating to a different part of the country.see b i b shardar ashcroft,cir.the burden of proof is ordinarily on the government to prove the feasibility of relocation.
we have recently had occasion to consider the issue of the feasibility of relocation in two decisions.see gambashidze ashcroft,cir berishaj ashcroft,cir.in gambashidze,we stated that in making a determination regarding the feasibility of relocation,a court must engage in a inquiry.first,the court must consider whether the relocation would be a successful means of escaping persecution,and second,whether relocation would be reasonable.furthermore,a court must view the record to see if substantial evidence supports the conclusion that petitioner could avoid persecution in one area of his country by relocating to another.at.
we stated that once past persecution was established,there must be significant evidence supporting the government position that the asylum appli
