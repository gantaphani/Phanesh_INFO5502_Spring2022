we address the effect of lying in an asylum application and to an asylum officer on an adverse credibility finding.
harminder singh is a native and citizen of india.he,his parents,and his sisters went to canada,where they lived for two and a half years.they applied unsuccessfully for asylum in canada.after the denial,they somehow entered the united states without inspection,and singh applied for asylum here.the immigration judge ij denied his claim,the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed without opinion,and singh petitions for review.we deny the petition.
singh application for asylum in the united states,which he swore to be true,was,as he has subsequently acknowledged,a lie.he answered no to the question asking whether he had ever filed for or been granted or denied asylum by any other country,and claimed to have resided in india during the two and a half years he actually lived in canada.he submitted numerous documents with the application,including a sworn affidavit stating that the affiant knew singh whole family was active in sikh politics and he,his father,and his mother had been arrested several times,a statement by an indian lawyer alleging the same thing,and a hospital certification indicating that singh had been treated for a week for multiple blunt injuries on his whole body.singh subsequently admitted that all these documents were fake,he was never arrested,his mother was never arrested,and singh had been in canada at the time of the supposed medical treatment in india.
the political persecution singh claimed in his asylum application was for sikh activism.he claimed that he,his father,and his mother had all been arrested repeatedly because of the family participation in sikh politics.the police,he said,had tortured both him and his father in the past and had continued their persecution until he left india in.subsequently,he admitted that he was in canada from on,his mother had never been arrested,and singh himself had never been arrested,nor had he been tortured or beaten by the police.nor was his family engaged in sikh activism.he had simply lied.
singh had two asylum interviews.he testified that at the first one,he verified that everything in his false application was true because avtar singh gill,who had prepared singh immigration application,accompanied him and told him to stick to his story.the second time,gill was not present,but singh was upset because of the recent death of his mother,and gill had threatened to tell the government the truth,that he had been in canada when he had claimed to be in india,so singh again reaffirmed the truth of the false application.
subsequently singh filed what he called corrections to his asylum application and testified before the ij about the falsehoods in it.he conceded that he had left india three years before coming to the united states.the corrections disclosed two and a half years residence and his unsuccessful application for asylum in canada.according to the new statement,his father had been a successful professional photographer at a tourist location in kashmir not the owner of a refrigeration and business as singh had previously sworn,but had moved to delhi in because of muslim hostility to,and had subleased his kashmir property to a muslim.the police had arrested his father in on suspicion of aiding kashmiri separatists not sikh activism,and after his father was released,the family moved to canada.far from being active in sikh politics,singh father was not a member of any political group in india.singh new story had nothing of the sikh activist claim that he had sworn to in the asylum application.nor did the new story allege that singh was beaten,or that he,his father,and his mother were arrested multiple times.
before the ij,singh testified that his father was arrested on december,beaten and tortured,and then released on bail.subsequently,the police repeatedly came to the singh residence asking about the alleged kashmiri separatists and threatening that if the family did not tell them,they would take us into captivity and commit atrocities against us.the following summer,the family moved to canada.they remain in touch with their extended family and former neighbors in india.
at singh merits hearing,government counsel introduced the fraudulent documents for their bearing on singh credibility.singh conceded that he had perjured himself previously,before the asylum officer,but asked that the ij listen with an open mind to his testimony since he conceded previously testifying falsely.the ij did so,rejecting the government suggestion the past falsehoods alone made a hearing unnecessary.since the only arrest,torture,and beating claimed was of singh father rather than singh,the ij asked where the father was.singh attorney said that the father was in the united states,but that the father mental health had deteriorated since his wife death and he would not be a competent witness.the ij asked if there was medical evidence to support the claim of incompetence.singh counsel conceded that there was none.counsel added,e very time i speak to him and you mention his wife,he breaks down because of the events they went through.
government counsel suggested that singh needed corroboration,particularly since singh had previously lied and the only harm claimed was to the father.since the father also had an asylum application pending,government counsel asked for a written waiver of confidentiality for the father asylum file so that if he did testify,the father could be effectively cross examined.the asylum regulations limit disclosure of information in an asylum application without the written consent of the applicant.the ij advised singh lawyer that singh had the burden of proof,and it would be much heavier in a situation like this where there is he has completely changed his story and particularly where he admits to having lied under oath at the asylum office.because of this,the father testimony might be crucial corroboration.if he was not going to testify because of incompetence,there should be something more than singh lawyer opinion,such as a psychological evaluation.and if he was,he should be designated on the witness list,and absence of a written waiver might be a problem.after discussion of what dates would be mutually convenient for all counsel and the court,the hearing was adjourned for three and a half weeks,which singh attorney said would be fine.no testimony was taken at this first hearing.testimony was put off until continuation of the hearing at the agreed upon later date.
at the next hearing,singh father was in court,though no witness list naming him had been filed.though singh sisters lived with him in hayward,california,singh had not brought any of them to the hearing.singh counsel said that he still did not think the father was competent to testify,but he had no medical evidence,so the judgment on competence would be one for the court to make.singh lawyer proposed to ask the father about his own asylum application and offered an oral waiver of confidentiality.the ij postponed deciding whether the father could testify until after hearing singh own testimony.
singh then told his new story,about police suspicion that his family aided kashmiri not sikh separatists.he explained that he had previously given his false story because gill had prepared his application with the false story and told him that he should not disclose his lengthy canadian residency because that not good for our case.singh said that even though the application was in his own handwriting,he had copied from what gill had written for him.but he feared returning to india,because they are going to question me about my father,where my father is.if i do not tell them where my father is,they are going to kill me at that time,at that very instant.he conceded that his father pending asylum application also contained errors falsely claiming persecution in india when he was actually in canada,omitting the unsuccessful asylum application in canada,and leaving out his son singh in the blanks for all your children.singh said he did not have his passport,because if the family had returned to the canadian authorities to get their passports back,they would have been deported.
counsel and the court discussed,both at the beginning and the end of singh testimony,what to do about testimony from his father,who was present in the courtroom.singh lawyer explained his earlier questioning of the father competence to testify it not like he seeing a doctor or anything,but he suffers from severe anxiety attacks and he most of the time not very coherent.he said he had tried to get him medically evaluated friday of the previous week at kaiser permanente the hearing was on monday,but it had not been possible.the father had separate counsel,who was not present,but singh lawyer said the father lawyer did not object to the father testifying.government counsel objected to the father testifying because he had not been listed on singh witness list,his competence was questioned and no medical evaluation had been done,no written waiver had been obtained so the government would not be able to cross examine effectively,and the father lawyer was not present to confirm the father waiver of confidentiality for his own asylum application.
after singh testimony had concluded,singh lawyer said he would only ask the father two questions,why he left india and why he was claiming asylum,and would expect answers consistent with singh.government counsel continued to object,and the ij said he did not think the father testimony would in the circumstances be crucial.singh lawyer then rested his case.government counsel argued that there was a sidhu issue the ij announced that if the parties were to rest on this record,she would deny asylum.singh had not borne his burden of proof,she said,on account of failure to corroborate his new story despite having admittedly perjured himself when swearing to his earlier story,and she would not grant asylum even if she found him credible.the father testimony might or might not bolster singh credibility,since it might offer some other reason to believe him or might simply tend to show that they together lied about being persecuted in india when they were actually safe in canada.singh then changed his position on resting his case,and asked for a continuance to perform the necessary tasks so that the father could testify.the ij denied the request.
the ij decided that singh had not borne his burden of proof.she found that singh had submitted a false application for asylum,along with false documents,and then had sworn to an entirely different story.she noted that at the first of the two hearings,she had told singh attorney that he should either have the father available to testify after she had continued the hearing for three and a half weeks,with an executed waiver of confidentiality,or have something verifying his lack of competence,but singh attorney did neither.although the father was present at the continued hearing,he had not been medically evaluated,his lawyer was not present,and had not executed a written waiver of confidentiality.singh asylum application with the false story had been entirely in singh handwriting.he had testified to the false story at his asylum office interviews,one with gill present and one without.the court was troubled not only by singh admitted perjury and false documents but also by the absence of corroboration for the new story.the father testimony had not been introduced,and singh sisters,who lived with him and who were obviously material witnesses,did not testify.the ij therefore reasoned that singh had not been a credible witness in that he has perjured himself in the past and has failed to present anything other than his own testimony when other forms of evidence could have been available to him.
the bia summarily affirmed the ij,and singh appealed.
singh argues that the ij adverse credibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence in the record,and that he was denied due process of law by the denial of a continuance so that he could put his father on the stand where,as here,the bia summarily affirms the ij,we review the ij decision as the final agency action we review the findings of fact,including adverse credibility determinations and the findings underlying the denial of relief,for substantial evidence we review due process claims de novo,and will reverse only if the proceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented from reasonably presenting his case.
credibility.
singh argues that because the ij found his testimony to be internally consistent on direct and cross and consistent with his second application for asylum,the facts he swore to had to be deemed true,and the ij was not entitled to reject his credibility because of his failure to provide corroboration.he provides quotations from several of our decisions that might,taken out of context,provide support for those propositions this case is id act,so the provision in that statute that the trier of fact may require corroboration,even for otherwise credible testimony does not apply to this case.
context is all,though.in some of the cases singh cites,the bia assumed credibility but nevertheless required corroboration in some,there was no explicit credibility determination and in the rest,the comments cited by singh are factually distinguishable none stand for the proposition that testimony both internally consistent and consistent with the asylum application must be deemed credible,or that credibility can not be rejected on account of an absence of reasonably available corroboration,regardless of any other circumstances.neither proposition is correct.
the burden of proof is on the asylum seeker,not the government asylum cases differ from ordinary civil cases in that the events happened in foreign countries,and the expense and difficulty of obtaining corroboration can be overwhelming.persecuting regimes may control the flow of information so that corroboration is impossible,despite the truth of an asylum seeker account.asylum cases also differ in that expense,difficulty,or impracticability may render it impossible to prove the falsity of an asylum seeker allegations of fact.that is why we have described the whole adjudication as an honor system it depends largely on the assumption that asylum seekers will take the oath seriously,and that they will be truthful in their testimony i n order for the process to work,we must construe and enforce the oath strictly,so that we may be more lenient elsewhere in the process.in an ordinary civil case,lawyers depose witnesses and obtain documents to prove or disprove witnesses allegations,but in asylum cases there are no depositions and usually no documents except what the asylum seeker submits and general country information occasionally supplemented by an individualized state department letter.
so how is the ij supposed to decide whether someone is lying one way is internal consistency.if the person can not tell substantially the same story twice in substantially the same way,that suggests a likelihood that the story is false.but just because the asylum seeker does tell the story consistently,that does not establish that it is true.that my story and i sticking to it is a comic line suggesting falsity,not evidence of truth.inconsistency may suggest falsity,at least where the differences are not of the sort that honest people make in repeated accounts of the same events,but consistency does not establish truth 
likewise,documentary evidence,or its absence,may or may not tend to show that a story is true or false,depending on the circumstances.sometimes corroboration by documents or testimony is reasonably available and any sensible litigant would expect to have to produce it,sometimes not.we would not expect a police report from a tyrannical regime saying,we tortured this individual to make him reveal his political associates names.but if the asylum seeker whose credibility has been questioned testifies that his family was subjected to atrocities in their home,and corroboration is readily available because members of the family live with him in california,it is reasonable to question his credibility if none of them testify to corroborate his account.to be sensible,rather than a collection of arbitrary r
