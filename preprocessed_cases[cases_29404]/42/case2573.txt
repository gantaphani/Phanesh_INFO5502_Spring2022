srivenugopala gattem,a native and citizen of india who overstayed his visa,seeks review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals the board or bia which determined in relevant part that when gattem solicited a minor to engage in a sexual act,he committed sexual abuse of a minor and therefore an aggravated felony for purposes of section a a of the immigration and nationality act,a a the ina.that finding not only renders gattem removable from the united states,see a a iii,but also makes him ineligible for cancellation of removal,see id.a,and strips the judiciary of the power to review the order of removal entered against him,id.a c.because the board correctly concluded that gattem committed an aggravated felony,we deny in part and dismiss in part gattem petition for review.
gattem entered the united states lawfully in pursuant to a,visa.his visa expired in january,but gattem remained in this country beyond the expiration and later that year married an american citizen.gattem and his wife subsequently filed and applications seeking to have him declared a permanent resident of the united states based on their marriage.however,when they appeared in november for their interviews on those applications,gattem was taken into custody by immigration and customs enforcement.he was notified that he was subject to removal from the united states on three different grounds,the third of which was eventually dropped and replaced with the ground relevant here,which is that following his entry into the united states,he had been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in section a a of the,sexual abuse of a was therefore removable pursuant to section a a iii of the act,a a iii.
the conviction that the government characterized as an aggravated felony was a conviction in the circuit court of du page county,illinois,for solicitation of a sexual act.the illinois statute pursuant to which gattem was convicted provides 
any person who offers a person not his or her spouse any money,property,token,object,or article or anything of value to perform any act of sexual penetration as defined in section of this code,or any touching,or fondling of the sex organs of one person by another person for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification,commits the offense of solicitation of a sexual act.
ilcs a.the verified criminal complaint alleging gattem violation of this provision alleged that gattem had offered jane doe,a juvenile under the age of,and a person not his spouse,free cigarettes in exchange for oral sex,while at the convenient foods,hobson road,woodridge,il.solicitation of a sexual act in violation of section a is a class b misdemeanor,see ilcs b,and following his conviction,gattem was sentenced to months of probation.
the government took the position that the crime of which gattem had been convicted constituted sexual abuse of a minor,and for that reason qualified as an aggravated felony for purposes of ina section a a.when he appeared before an immigration judge ij,gattem contested the government assertion.gattem acknowledged the conviction and admitted that the individual from whom he had solicited a sexual act was a juvenile under the age of,but he denied that the conviction amounted to the sexual abuse of a minor and therefore an aggravated felony.he conceded that he was removable on the other two grounds identified by the government.
the ij sustained the government position.he noted first that gattem conviction,although for a misdemeanor offense,could nonetheless qualify as an aggravated felony for purposes of the ina.citing ins,cir.as for whether the offense constituted sexual abuse of a minor,the ij,relying on the board decision in in re,bia,looked to a for guidance.that provision broadly defines sexual abuse to include,among other things,the inducement of a child to engage in a sexual act as well as other form of sexual exploitation of children.the ij found that gattem solicitation of a minor met those criteria and so qualified as sexual abuse of a minor and in turn an aggravated felony for purposes of ina section a a.as a result,gattem was not only removable under section a a iii of the ina,a a iii,but ineligible for cancellation of removal under section a,a.
gattem took an appeal to the bia,which agreed with the ij that gattem conviction was one for sexual abuse of a minor.consulting the definition of sexual abuse found in section a as it had in,the board concluded that soliciting a minor in violation of the illinois statute fell within the scope of that definition 
the illinois statute clearly satisfies section a definition as the respondent was convicted thereunder for persuading a minor to engage in sexual conduct.persuading or inducing a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct involves sexual abuse of a minor.

our jurisdiction in this case is limited.the ina,as amended by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,strips the judiciary of authority to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony.see a c,a a iii.the bia,of course,determined that gattem had committed such a felony.nonetheless,we retain the authority to assess our own jurisdiction,land dollar,overruled on other grounds by implication by larson domestic foreign commerce,and as we explained in yang ins,cir,w hen judicial review depends on a particular fact or legal conclusion,then a court may determine whether that condition exists.consequently,we have jurisdiction to determine whether,as the bia held,gattem indeed is removable by reason of having committing an aggravated particular,the sexual abuse of a minor.see also,ashcroft,cir per curiam ins,cir.moreover,section a a iii of the real id act of,signed into law on may of this year,adds the following qualification to the provision found in section a c of the ina 
nothing in subparagraph b or c,or in any other provision of this act other than this section which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.
stat.section b of the new legislation provides that t he amendments made by subsection a shall take effect upon the date of enactment of this division and shall apply to cases in which the final administrative order of removal,deportation,or exclusion was issued before,on,or after the date of the enactment of this division.stat.at.thus,to the extent that the board holding turned on its construction of the ina,and in particular the meaning of sexual abuse of a minor,it presents a question of law that congress has given us the power to address.
generally speaking,we review questions of law,including jurisdictional questions,de novo,ali ashcroft,cir,at.as always,however,we owe the board deference in its interpretation of the ina.ins,d ins,d.because congress did not define what constitutes sexual abuse of a minor for purposes of the ina,it has fallen to the board to give the term meaning on a case by case basis.therefore,insofar as the board holding as to gattem turns on an interpretation of the ina,we must defer to that construction so long as it is consistent with the language and purposes of the statute,at.at.
the ina defines the term aggravated felony to mean,among other offenses,murder,rape,or sexual abuse of a minor.a a.as we have noted,the statute does not in turn identify what offenses fall under the rubric of sexual abuse of a minor.the attorney general of the united states,who is charged with the administration and enforcement of the ina,has delegated that interpretative task to the board as the need arises in removal proceedings,at citing.
because removal proceedings are a function of federal law,the board has sought out a federal standard for what constitutes sexual abuse of a minor,at.several different provisions of the federal code of crimes and criminal procedure offer definitions of sexual abuse and from these the board has selected the broadest,which is found at a.that provision of the code empowers a federal court in certain cases where the victim or witness is a child to take a variety of measures aimed at protecting the child,including,for example,allowing the child to give testimony via television or videotaped deposition,b,and appointing a guardian ad litem for the child,h.among the proceedings in which these protective measures are available are cases in which a child is alleged to be a victim of sexual abuse.see a a.the statute supplies the following definition of sexual abuse 
t he term sexual abuse includes the employment,use,persuasion,inducement,enticement,or coercion of a child to engage in,or assist another person to engage in,sexually explicit conduct or the rape,molestation,prostitution,or other form of sexual exploitation of children,or incest with children.
a the bia believed that this definition best reflected the full range of criminal conduct that reasonably can be understood to constitute sexual abuse of a minor.the board noted,for example,that just as abuse generally can involve mental as well as physical mistreatment,sexual abuse of a minor may or may not entail physical contact and the terms of section a were broad enough to account for that reality,at.the board also noted that states categorize and define sex crimes against children in many different ways,and we find that a better captures this broad spectrum of sexually abusive behavior.id.by contrast,the other definitions found in the criminal code were too narrow to fully encompass that spectrum and in that sense were inconsistent with the evident congressional intent to remove aliens who are sexually abusive toward children and to bar them from any relief.id.
the board was at pains to emphasize,however,that although it would look to section a for illumination as to what constitutes sexual abuse of a minor,it did not intend that definition to be dispositive for purposes of section a a.we are not adopting this statute as a definitive standard or definition but invoke it as a guide in identifying the types of crimes we would consider to be sexual abuse of a minor.id.
we previously have concluded that the bia resort to section a and its broad definition of sexual abuse for guidance is reasonable.in,at,we rejected the notion that the board was obliged to define sexual abuse for purposes of section a a with reference to the more narrow standards found elsewhere in the criminal code,including in particular a,which establishes the federal offense of sexually abusing a minor 
congress did not define sexual abuse of a minor by expressly referencing any other provision of the,as it did with respect to other terms in a.congress decision not to limit a a in a similar fashion is conspicuous,and it strongly suggests that congress intended to give a broad meaning to the term sexual abuse of a minor.moreover,since creates a substantive federal offense,while a a merely attaches immigration consequences to criminal acts already committed,it would have been reasonable for congress to intend a broader definition for the latter provision.finally,as the bia noted in in re,interim,wl bia,sexual abuse is defined more broadly in than it is in.this further undermines argument because,even if we were to accept his misguided premise that a a definition of sexual abuse of a minor should be exhaustively defined by reference to some other single statutory provision,offers no good reason why we must refer to rather than to 
at citations omitted.more recently,in,at,we again emphasized that congress intended the phrase sexual abuse of a minor to broadly incorporate all acts that fall within the ordinary,contemporary,and common meaning of the words quoting united states,cir and that the reach of the phrase need not be limited to the more narrow definitions found in other provisions of the criminal code.and put to rest our dissenting colleague contention that the board has gone astray in choosing section a as a reference point in assessing the nature of an alien conviction.
in this case,the board had no difficulty concluding that gattem solicitation offense was within the range of conduct that section a describes as sexual abuse of a minor.the statute indicates that persuading,inducing,or enticing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct amounts to sexual abuse.in the board view,when gattem offered a minor cigarettes if she would engage in oral sex with him,he was using persuasion or inducement in an effort to convince her to engage in sexually explicit conduct.we can find no fault with the board analysis.
the approach to identifying those state crimes that congress intended to be treated as aggravated felonies for purposes of the ina is categorical one looks to the elements of the state offense in question and,where necessary,to the charging document pursuant to which the petitioner was convicted,to determine whether the offense corresponds to one of the crimes described as aggravated felonies in the ina,at,at.
here,the illinois statute pursuant to which gattem was convicted reaches conduct aimed at adults as well as minors it proscribes the solicitation of sexual contact from anyone not the defendant spouse.ilcs a.but the complaint issued against gattem indicates that he solicited a minor,and there is no dispute at this juncture that the individual he solicited was under the age of,see,and,supra.and although the illinois offense is a misdemeanor,there is also no dispute that a misdemeanor can nonetheless qualify as an aggravated felony so long as it otherwise amounts to sexual abuse of a minor.see,see also gattem br.at noting that gattem does not challenge,inter alia,the notion that his misdemeanor conviction can qualify as an aggravated felony for purposes of the ina.
gattem contends that if the offense involves only words,without any threat or coercion,then it causes no harm to the minor that would permit it to be described as sexual abuse.thus,although the crime proscribed by the illinois as here the victim is a corresponds with the definition of sexual abuse found in section a in that it involves the persuasion,inducement or enticement of a minor to engage in sexually explicit activity,gattem contends that it is nonetheless inappropriate to categorize his offense as sexual abuse of a minor.
the attorney general responds that the ordinary meaning of sexual abuse encompasses verbal conduct that is not overtly threatening or coercive.abuse,in the attorney general view,involves the misuse of authority and,as the board pointed out in,can take the form of physical or mental mistreatment.he therefore reasons that sexual abuse can include verbal conduct that takes improper advantage of an adult seniority and proximity to a minor.
we agree with the board and the attorney general that gattem conviction is properly classified as one for sexual abuse of a minor.although it may be true,as gattem argues,that solicitation in the abstract is not necessarily coercive or threatening,we think that there is an inherent risk of exploitation,if not coercion,when an adult solicits a minor to engage in sexual activity.minors as a group have a less sense of judgment than adults,and thus are at greater peril of making choices that are not in their own best interests.see bellotti baird,d during the formative years of childhood and adolescence,minors often lack the experience,perspective,and judgment to recognize and avoid choices that could be detrimental to them.thus,when a minor is offered an item of,contraband cigarettes that a minor could not legally obtain exchange for having sex with an adult,she may well be incapable of fully appreciating the consequences of yielding to the lure of the offer.because minors are,in this respect,more susceptible to corrupt influences,it is reasonable to think of an adult solicitation of a minor to be abusive in the sense of exploiting the minor vulnerabilities.of course,a conviction for solicitation requires no proof that the minor accepted the offer,let alone engaged in any sexual activity.but that is the obvious goal an offer like the one that gattem made and solicitation,like attempt,is deemed a crime because the defendant has embraced an unlawful objective and taken one or more steps in pursuit of it,exposing his victim and society to a risk of injury that might have materialized but for the intervention of the authorities or some other fortuitous turn of events.see united states hsu,cir the law of attempts was traditionally viewed as a way to deal with conduct which create d a risk of immediate harmful consequences.quoting wayne lafave austin scott,substantive criminal law,b,at ed see also charles torcia,wharton criminal law,at ed.there is no dispute that gattem would be guilty of sexually abusing a minor had she actually had sex with him in exchange for the cigarettes.as it was,he asked a minor to engage in sex with him and offered her an inducement to say yes.given that minors lack the mature judgment of adults,there was a genuine risk that she might have acceded to his request and suffered any number of grave consequences that she could not have envisioned in the way that an adult could.see united states shannon,cir en banc.to mention treating a girl as if she were a the harm in asking.see state tarbay,ohio app d.
our colleague suggests that in focusing on the potential harm to the juvenile had she said yes to gattem proposal rather than on the actual harm if any resulting from the rebuffed solicitation,we are improperly redefining sexual abuse of a minor as attempted sexual abuse.post at.noting that until now the cases on this issue all have involved actual sexual acts including touching or exposure,post at,our colleague believes that the board is obliged to offer some justification for treating a simple solicitation as sexual abuse,for words themselves are not acts,post at.but section a does refer to the persuasion,inducement,or enticement of a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct,and even if that language is construed to mean that the child must actually have been persuaded,induced,or enticed to participate in a sexual act,see post at,logic does not foreclose the board from taking note of an unsuccessful effort to lure a child into sexual activity.federal criminal law punishes inchoate offenses along with completed crimes.see.thus,it can hardly be considered surprising,let alone unreasonable,for the board to include within the realm of sexual abuse an attempt to persuade,induce,or entice a child to engage in a sexual act.indeed,the ina explicitly provides that an attempt or conspiracy to commit any of the other offenses identified in the statute as aggravated felonies shall itself be considered an aggravated felony.see a u.
we acknowledge that categorizing gattem conviction as an aggravated felony,which both renders him subject to removal and bars him from seeking relief,may to some seem like a harsh result.but we believe that result to be consistent with congressional intent.construing sexual abuse of a minor broadly to include the crime of soliciting a minor is reasonable notwithstanding the absence of any physical contact with or threat against the minor,given the inherent risk of exploitation that soliciting a minor presents.
the bia correctly categorized gattem illinois conviction for solicitation as sexual abuse of a minor for purposes of section a a of the ina.because gattem is removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony,we have no jurisdiction to further review the bia order of removal and do not reach the other issue that gattem has raised,which concerns the ij discretionary refusal to continue the removal proceeding pending the adjudication of the application for adjustment of status that his wife filed on his behalf.a c see flores ashcroft,cir we therefore deny in part and dismiss in part gattem petition for review.
gattem was ordered removed from this country on the ground of his having committed an aggravated felony,defined as murder,rape,or sexual abuse of a minor.a a,a a iii.his aggravated felony was his violating an illinois misdemeanor statute by,according to the charging document,offering a girl who had not yet reached the age of a pack of cigarettes in exchange for her performing oral sex on him.the illinois statute provides that any person who offers a person not his or her spouse anything of value to perform any sexual act commits the offense of solicitation of a sexual act.ilcs a.neither gattem age at the time of the offense,nor the girl,was indicated,other than her being under nor is there any suggestion that the girl accepted gattem offer.he was sentenced not to prison,but to months on probation.
the immigration and nationality act does not define sexual abuse of a minor.casting far afield,the board of immigration appeals in in re,bia,found a statute that defines the term as including the employment,use,persuasion,inducement,or coercion of a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct.a.i say far afield because it is not a statute that criminalizes sexual abuse.rather,it provides procedural protections for child victims and child witnesses,such as allowing a child to give testimony via television rather than in person if the child is alleged to be a victim of sexual abuse.b.
applying the statute to this case is doubly odd because it is unclear whether persuasion or inducement includes unsuccessful efforts to persuade or induce.one can be induced or persuaded without being employed suggesting prostitution,though successful inducement or persuasion would result in the use of a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct.the previous reported cases all involved touching or exposure rather than failed persuasion or inducement.ashcroft,cir ins,cir mugalli ashcroft,cir united states,cir.my colleagues acknowledge that the language of the statute might be construed to mean that the child must actually have been persuaded,induced,or enticed to participate in a sexual act,but they add that logic does not foreclose the board from taking note of an unsuccessful effort to lure a child into sexual activity.there is no indication that the board has noticed,let alone taken note,of the difference.nor is it easy to see how a state misdemeanor becomes translated not only into a felony,but into an aggravated felony,for removal purposes.
without more detail concerning gattem crime,i am unconvinced that the board made a rational judgment in classifying it as an aggravated felony.the number of unmarried teenaged girls in this country who have engaged in sexual intercourse,let alone in oral sex,is in the millions for of all girls in grade few of whom would have turned,percent have had sexual intercourse.centers for disease control and prevention,youth risk behavior states,morbidity mortality weekly,may.oral sex is even more common in a study of ninth graders,half again as many were found to have had oral as vaginal sex.bonnie et,oral versus vaginal sex among adolescents perceptions,attitudes,and behavior,pediatrics.solicitation of such girls to engage in sex must be common.that does make it right and circumstances of course alter cases the younger the girl,the older the man,and the more insistent or prurient the means of inducement employed,the likelier is the solicitation of an underage girl or boy for sex to be a serious crime even if the solicitation is unsuccessful.but we can not let our imaginations roam if we could,we could imagine the girl as a prostitute.based on what little we know,illinois characterization of gattem conduct as a misdemeanor undeserving of prison time is reasonable,rather than being evidence that illinois does not take sexual offenses seriously.
no basis has been shown for reclassifying gattem offense as an aggravated felony.the government brief describes his proposal to the girl as disgusting and depraved a dubious characterization if she was one day short of her eighteenth birthday,as she may have been and,continuing in this vein,speculates without reference either to evidence relating to gattem conduct or to a psychological literature that might bear on it that such a proposal might cause the victim to have negative thoughts about sexuality and produce psychological injury that may be difficult to overcome.carried away by its own rhetoric,the government describes what gattem did as the forcing of unwanted sexual activity upon the girl,even t
