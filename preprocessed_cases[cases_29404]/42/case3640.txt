once again we face the question of what is moral turpitude a nebulous question that we are required to answer on the basis of judicially established categories of criminal conduct.although that may not be a satisfactory basis for answering such a question,it is the role to which we are limited by precedent as a court of law.furthermore,any answer based on other considerations would in all probability be unacceptable to one or another segment of society and could well divide residents of red states from residents of blue,the old from the young,neighbor from neighbor,and even males from females.there is simply no overall agreement on many issues of morality in contemporary society.
morality is not a concept that courts can define by judicial decrees,and even less can it be defined by fiats issued by the board of immigration appeals,to whose decisions the courts must give great deference.yet,for the purpose of our immigration laws we are required to follow those determinations and to start by applying categories of offenses that the judiciary or the board members appointed by the attorney general have deemed morally turpitudinous in all of their applications.we call this the categorical approach.how sensible those decisions are and how close to rational concepts of morality they may come can be seen by considering one of the offenses involved in the case before us.while under our law numerous felonies are deemed not to be morally turpitudinous,all acts of petty theft automatically qualify for that label and the drastic legal consequences that may follow.as some in today society might say,and with good reason,go figure.
victor ocegueda nuñez appeals the board of immigration appeals bia affirmance of an immigration judge ij decision ordering him removed to mexico.the bia determined that ocegueda had been convicted of two crimes of moral turpitude and that he was thus statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under b b.because we conclude that indecent exposure under of the california penal code is not categorically a crime of moral turpitude,we grant the petition and remand.
iii.factual and procedural background 
victor ocegueda nuñez ocegueda a native and citizen of mexico,entered the united states without inspection in march,at the age of.while in the united states,he met and married his wife,a citizen,with whom he has three citizen children.on june,the department of homeland security began removal proceedings against him on the ground that he was present in the united states without having been lawfully admitted or paroled.he conceded removability,but applied for cancellation of removal pursuant to b,on the basis that his removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his wife and children.
on september,one day before the hearing on ocegueda application for cancellation was to be held,the government filed a motion to pretermit.it argued that ocegueda was statutorily ineligible for cancellation because he had been convicted of two crimes of moral turpitude during the past ten years petty theft in and indecent exposure in.the government only evidence of the petty theft conviction was an fbi report indicating that ocegueda had been arrested and charged with petty theft on may.the report did not indicate the disposition of the charge.although ocegueda counsel was aware of the indecent exposure conviction,the motion to pretermit was apparently the first she had heard of ocegueda arrest for petty theft.a single conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude is not a statutory bar to cancellation of removal if the maximum penalty does not exceed one year imprisonment,and if the individual is sentenced to six months or less.see a a ii.two convictions,however,render an alien ineligible for cancellation.b c.
immediately after the government filed its motion to pretermit,ocegueda filed an emergency motion to continue the hearing.he argued that he needed time to establish that indecent exposure was not a crime involving moral turpitude,and that he had not actually been convicted of the petty theft offense.the ij denied the motion.
at the september hearing,the ij questioned ocegueda about the petty theft charge.he admitted that he had been arrested after a store security guard accused him of stealing a pair of pants and that he had subsequently appeared in court and paid a fine.the ij concluded that this testimony sufficed to establish a prior conviction for petty theft.the ij determined that both petty theft and indecent exposure are crimes of moral turpitude and that ocegueda was statutorily ineligible for cancellation on the basis of the two convictions.the ij then concluded the hearing,without hearing any of ocegueda evidence that his removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his citizen family.
ocedgueda appealed to the bia.he argued that indecent exposure was not a crime of moral turpitude,and that the ij denial of his motion for a continuance violated due process.he did not contest the classification of petty theft as a crime of moral turpitude.the bia affirmed the ij,concluding that indecent exposure,the offense proscribed by california penal code,was also such a crime.it did not address the due process issue or the petty theft conviction except to agree with the ij that ocegueda two convictions for crimes of moral turpitude made him statutorily ineligible for cancellation.
on appeal,ocegueda raises two challenges to the bia decision.first,he argues that indecent exposure is not categorically a crime of moral turpitude.second,he argues that his due process rights were violated because he never had an opportunity to respond to the government motion to pretermit.because we agree that california penal code covers a broader range of offenses than the generic definition of crimes of moral turpitude,we hold that indecent exposure is not categorically such a crime.accordingly,we need not reach the due process question.
iv.jurisdiction and standard of review 
whether a crime involves moral turpitude is a question of law that we have jurisdiction to review pursuant to a d.we review the bia interpretation of the statute of conviction de novo.holder,cir en banc.the bia conclusion that a particular crime does or does not involve moral turpitude is subject to different standards of review depending on whether the bia issues or relies on a published decision in coming to its conclusion.if it does either,we accord chevron deference.id.if it does neither,we defer to its conclusion to the extent that it has the power to persuade.id.at quoting skidmore swift.
to determine if a crime involves moral turpitude,we first apply the categorical approach.mukasey,cir,overruled on other grounds by,at.this requires us to compare the elements of the crime to the generic definition of moral turpitude and decide whether the conduct proscribed in the statute is broader than,and so does not categorically fall within,this generic definition.id.quoting ashcroft,cir.in making this determination,we must find a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that the state would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of moral turpitude.id.at quoting gonzales.this realistic probability can be established by showing that,in at least one other case,the state courts in fact did apply the statute in the special nongeneric manner id.at relying on one case to establish a realistic probability see also matter of,same 
if the crime does not qualify under the categorical approach,we apply the modified categorical approach and look to documents within the record of conviction to see whether the conviction in the particular case involved moral turpitude.however,because the only information before the ij was the fact of conviction,ocegueda conviction of indecent exposure can qualify as a crime of moral turpitude on the record before us only if it so qualifies under the categorical approach.
elements of 
california indecent exposure statute reads as follows 
every person who willfully and lewdly e xposes his person,or the private parts thereof,in any public place,or in any place where there are present other persons to be offended or annoyed thereby is guilty of a misdemeanor.
the bia correctly identified the elements of.the provision prohibits sexually motivated exposure of one private parts in a public place or a place where others are present.with respect to the mens rea element,california courts require proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the actor not only meant to expose himself,but intended by his conduct to direct public attention to his genitals for purposes of sexual arousal,gratification,or affront.in re smith,cal see also people archer,d,holding that sexual modifies arousal,gratification,and affront.
generic definition of moral turpitude 
we have previously discussed at some length the inherent ambiguity of the phrase moral turpitude and the consistent failure of either the bia or our own court to establish any coherent criteria for determining which crimes fall within that classification and which crimes do not see,at m oral turpitude is perhaps the quintessential example of an ambiguous phrase.id.at berzon,dissenting t he bia precedential case law regarding the meaning of the phrase crime involving moral turpitude is a mess of conflicting authority,at summarizing ninth circuit law on moral turpitude and recognizing that w e have not relied on a consistent or easily applied set of criteria to identify crimes of moral turpitude.our definition tells us only that crimes of moral turpitude are crimes that involve either fraud or base,vile,and depraved conduct that shock s the public conscience.gonzales,cir en banc reinhardt,concurring for the majority internal quotation marks removed.
absent consistent or logical rules to follow as we determine whether a crime other than one involving fraud involves moral turpitude,our most useful guidance often comes from comparing the crime with others that we have previously deemed morally turpitudinous.see,at reinhardt,j,concurring for the majority under our current test for moral turpitude,we compare a crime depravity with that of crimes we have previously determined to be base,vile,and depraved.a review of bia and ninth circuit precedent reveals that crimes of moral turpitude almost always involve an intent to harm someone,the actual infliction of harm upon someone,or an action that affects a protected class of victim 
see,in re,bia identifying murder,rape,robbery,kidna p ping,voluntary manslaughter,some involuntary manslaughter offenses,aggravated assaults,mayhem,theft offenses,spousal abuse,child abuse,and incest as crimes of moral turpitude holder,cir explaining that assault is not generally a crime of moral turpitude unless it involves either intentional infliction of serious harm or infliction of harm on a protected class of victim gonzales,cir,dissenting,reheard in banc,cir citing cases in which the bia and ninth circuit determined that burglary,assault and battery,malicious mischief,alien smuggling,assault with a deadly weapon,indecency,rioting,and money laundering are not crimes of moral turpitude.
this is no less true when it comes to sexual offenses.we have held that the following crimes are categorically crimes of moral turpitude lewd and lascivious conduct toward a child,schoeps carmichael,cir incest,ins,cir knowing possession of child pornography,united states santacruz,cir and communication with a minor for immoral purposes,morales gonzales,cir.we have also recognized that rape is categorically a crime of moral turpitude,at reinhardt,j,concurring for the majority.these crimes universally involve either actual infliction of harm or a protected class of victim most often a combination of the two.in fact,never without the presence of at least one of these factors have we deemed a sexual offense to involve moral turpitude.
if we search far enough back into the case law of the bia and other circuits,it is true that we find decisions holding that conduct that is shock ing,not by virtue of its impact upon victims,but by virtue of its incompatibility with contemporary sexual attitudes is,on that basis alone,morally turpitudinous.at various times,the bia and the courts have labeled as morally turpitudinous such offenses as consensual oral sex,matter of leyva,bia,consensual anal sodomy,ins,and overt and public homosexual activity matter of,bia.these cases remind us that private,consensual homosexual conduct,which the supreme court held to be constitutionally protected in lawrence texas,was not so long ago deemed base and depraved and a crime of moral turpitude in some courts.see,williams state,so d,w e have no hesitancy whatever in arriving at the conclusion that a crime that consists of sexual relations between persons of the same sex involves moral turpitude the practice of sodomy is inherently inimical to the general integrity of the human person,and i s clearly an offense involving moral turpitude internal quotation marks omitted.
since these older cases were decided,the fluid boundaries of our nebulous moral turpitude standard have moved away from the rigid imposition of austere moral values on society as a whole and substantially in the direction of affording tolerance and individual liberty to those whose moral attitudes differ from the contemporary majority.today,consensual sexual conduct among adults may not be deemed base,vile,and depraved as a matter of law simply because a majority of people happen to disapprove of a particular practice.indeed,as with all crimes,if the conduct at issue were not offensive to at least a majority,there would be no reason to prohibit it and thus render it a criminal act.more is required for moral turpitude.see,at holding that a definition of moral turpitude that encompassed all criminal conduct would be overbroad and contrary to the intent of congress.
and the generic definition of moral turpitude 
we now turn to the question whether all of the conduct proscribed by falls within our generic definition of moral turpitude.the bia concluded that indecent exposure under is categorically a crime of moral turpitude,which means that it must have found the answer to our question to be,yes.the bia reached this conclusion in an unpublished opinion that does not rely on prior precedential decisions 
therefore,we will defer to its determination only to the extent that it has the power to persuade.here,we can dispose of that question quickly.as the supreme court stated in skidmore swift,deference should be given according to the thoroughness evident in the agency consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.see also,at.the bia analysis rests entirely on the ipse dixit statement that because requires a sexual motivation,it is a crime of moral turpitude.we do not find the bia cursory,conclusory analysis in any way persuasive and therefore do not defer to its conclusion with respect to the morally turpitudinous nature of.
california indecent exposure statute criminalizes a range of conduct that offends the sensibilities of many,and perhaps most,people.we conclude that it does not,however,categorically meet the federal standard for moral turpitude.some of the behavior that may be punished under the california statute would certainly qualify as morally turpitudinous,but that is not the question before us.here we must determine whether the full range of conduct prohibited by the statute falls within the definition of that term.the answer to that question is no.
we start by recognizing one point that does not appear to be in dispute.exposing oneself in a public place is not necessarily either lewd as required by or base,vile and depraved as required by our traditional definition of moral turpitude.for example,as the bia and the california courts appear to agree,a sunbather who removes all his clothes to tan on an unoccupied public beach and wakes to find himself surrounded by offended beachgoers has done nothing either lewd or depraved and thus is neither in violation of nor guilty of a morally turpitudinous act.see smith,at.similarly,the california courts have indicated that they would not uphold a conviction for urinating in public,because exposure motivated by the need to relieve oneself is not properly classified as lewd.id.at.under,it is the sexual intent with which the exposure occurs that transforms it into an act that is criminal,rather than an act that is merely improper or inappropriate.thus,the question we must next answer is whether,by limiting to sexually motivated exposure,california courts have limited it to conduct all of which can properly be described as morally turpitudinous for the reasons we now discuss,the answer once more is no.
in a number of important respects,california courts have construed sexual motivation quite broadly.as one would expect,exposure is sexually motivated if it is done with the intent to sexually gratify the actor.however,the statute also reaches the specific intent to create sexual arousal in those persons observing the defendant.people conway.dep t super.emphasis added,partially disapproved of by morris municipal court,cal see also people earle,d.additionally,the statute is satisfied if a person acts for the purposes of sexual affront,which involves neither sexual gratification of the actor nor the viewer,but rather an intent on the part of the actor to insult or offend in a sexual way.see archer,d at.finally,the statute requirement that there be present other persons to be offended or annoyed thereby is fulfilled when the exposure occurs in the presence of individuals who might in theory be offended by the conduct,even if,in actuality,they are not 
it is not the burden of the prosecution to prove that the observer was in fact offended by the conduct but only that the conduct was such that defendant should know that the observer may be offended.although the distinction is a subtle one,it is significant.the thrust of this inquiry is the state of mind of he should know that his conduct may offend another.whether the observer thereafter is offended thus has minimal evidentiary bearing upon defendant preceding state of mind.
people rylaarsdam.dep t super.
the statute thus encompasses three quite different types of sexually motivated exposure.a person may be convicted under for exposing himself for the purposes of his own sexual gratification,for the purpose of sexual gratification of the viewer,or for the purpose of offending the viewer in a sexual way.as the california court of appeal recently confirmed 
w hile insult is a common feature of the paradigmatic indecent exposure under,it is not a necessary element of the crime.a purpose of affronting the victim may satisfy part of the mens rea,but it is not necessary the crime is also complete if the defendant acts for purposes of his own or the victim presumably imagined arousal or gratification,whether or not he intends to cause affront or believes he is doing so.
earle,d at analyzing mental elements of internal quotation marks removed see also cal.jury instr.stating that,to prove violation of,government must show that the defendant exposed him or herself with the specific intent to direct public attention to his her genitals for the purpose of his her own sexual arousal or gratification,or that of another or of sexually insulting or offending others.
exposure for sexual gratification 
with respect to both mens rea and actus reus,in its first two with the intent to sexually gratify oneself or the quite similar to the crime of annoy ing a child,defined as engaging in objectively irritating conduct toward an underage victim when motivated by an abnormal sexual interest in victim,which we recently held not to be categorically a crime of moral turpitude,at.neither offense requires that the victim actually be harmed or even bothered by the offender conduct.id.nor does either require that the offender intend any harm rather,in both cases,the statutory elements may be satisfied as long as the offender motivation was sexual and he should have known that his conduct may be offensive in the case of indecent exposure or irritating in the case of annoying a child.we held that the crime of annoy ing a child is not a crime of moral turpitude,even though that crime does share one characteristic with other crimes we have found morally turpitudinous a protected class of victim,at.indecent exposure,in contrast,as interpreted by the california courts,does not categorically have anything in common with the type of crime we have normally held to involve moral turpitude.it can be committed without any intention of harming anyone,it need not result in actual harm,and it does not necessarily involve a protected class of victim.thus,under,would appear not to prohibit only conduct that is morally turpitudinous and thus does not categorically constitute a crime of moral turpitude.indeed,as we now explain,california courts in fact have appl ied the statute to reach turpitudinous conduct,at.
because there is no requirement that the viewers actually be offended by the exposure,and because the purpose of the conduct may be the sexual arousal or gratification of the viewer,rather than the exposer,california courts have,under,upheld convictions for nude dancing at bars.for example,in people conway,the 
defendant was a waitress and dancer in a beer bar.while she was clothed when serving beer,she was observed to undress and perform naked on a raised platform located along one wall of the barroom.she openly displayed her private parts to the nearby customers,paying most of her attention to those customers who placed money on the platform for defendant.
conway.at see also people ex rel.hicks sarong gals,noting multiple arrests of dancers at a bar for violating.
erotic,completely nude dancing is offensive to many people.it is not,however,so base,vile,and depraved that it shocks the conscience.as a plurality of the supreme court explained,nude dancing is expressive conduct,although it falls only within the outer ambit of the first amendment protection.city of erie,at.it would be odd indeed to hold that conduct that is entitled to some protection in order to keep our society free is also flatly contrary to the societal duties we owe each other,at.nude dancing,moreover,is a prototypical victimless crime.whatever one view of the merits of such conduct,it is simply not base,vile,and depraved.as with the conduct at issue in rylaarsdam,see,supra,it may shock certain individuals but not those who patronize the establishment in order to see or take part in it.it does not cause them physical or psychological harm and it certainly does not shock their conscience.
exposure for sexual affront 
the application of the statute to nude dancing is sufficient to resolve this case in ocegueda favor.despite the ambiguity of the term moral turpitude,it is as clear as can be that nude dancing lies outside its boundaries.however,in case any doubt remains,we need consider only that in its third with the intent to sexually offend the viewer encompasses conduct that can not under any reasonable definition of the term be classified as moral turpitude.
both our court and the bia have repeatedly held that simple assault and battery are not categorically crimes of moral turpitude.see,at.this is,in part,because they encompass de minimus conduct or harm,such as offensive or provocative physical contact or insults,which is not ordinarily considered to be inherently vile,depraved,or morally reprehensible.in re solon,see also gonzales,cir holding that the crime of knowingly touching another person with the intent to injure,insult,or provoke does not involve moral turpitude.similarly,in another the crime of property damage,rather than held that washington malicious mischief offense was not categorically a crime of moral turpitude because it encompassed the destruction of as little as of another property with an evil wish to annoy and thus extends to include pranksters with poor judgment.ins,cir.
section,as interpreted by the california courts,also encompasses offensive or provocative insults,solon,at,as well as the conduct of pranksters with poor judgment,at.two examples suffice to illustrate the point.in one recent case,the california court of appeal upheld the conviction under of a defendant who,in a fit of road rage,exposed his penis and yelled suck my dick at an adjacent driver.archer,d at.in the second case,the court upheld the conviction of a boy who pulled down his pants during class and showed his penis to two female classmates.people lionel,no,wl,unpublished 
on both occasions,the court found that mental state requirement was satisfied because the defendant had acted with the purpose of sexually insulting or offending the viewer the former defendant conduct was surely crass and the latter was just as obviously inappropriate.however,neither act could rationally be characterized as inherently base,vile and depraved compared to the other crimes we have deemed to involve moral turpitude,the defendants actions were relatively harmless.see supra part.the only difference between their acts and the provocative insults and tasteless pranks that we have previously held to be turpitudinous is the element of sexuality involved.but our society is past the point where transitory nudity or a brief reference to sex necessarily transforms an otherwise de minimus provocation into a morally turpitudinous offense.there are obviously circumstances under which unwanted,sexually motivated exposure would be highly threatening,intrusive,and psychologically damaging to viewers.however,as our two examples make clear,reaches far beyond such harmful conduct to encompass mere acts of provocation,bad taste,and failed humor.although inappropriate and offensive,these acts are not base,vile,and depraved,nor do they shock the conscience.
because nude dancers and partially exposed purveyors of sexual insults have been convicted under,there is a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that the state would apply the indecent exposure statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of moral turpitude.at.here the state courts in fact did apply the statute in the special nongeneric manner for which ocegueda argues.id.indecent exposure is therefore not,categorically,a crime of moral turpitude.california statute,as interpreted by state court judges,has not been limited to conduct that can objectively be held to meet our standardless standard that governs moral turpitude.
because indecent exposure as defined by code,and as construed by california courts,is not categorically a crime involving moral turpitude,the bia erred in determining on the record before it that ocegueda was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal.we therefore grant the petition and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
petition granted and remanded.
california punishes persons who willfully and lewdly expose their private parts in a public place or in a place where there are unwilling persons.cal.penal code.the california supreme court has read to reach only one who intentionally direct s attention to his genitals for sexual purposes.in re smith,cal.in gonzales,the supreme court told us that to find that california indecent exposure statute is a crime outside the generic definition of a crime involving moral turpitude requires more than the application of legal imagination to a state statute language.indeed,i t requires a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that the state would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of the crime.but legal imagination and theoretical possibilities are the warp and woof of the majority decision.
despite the clarity of california indecent exposure statute,punishing persons who wilfully and lewdly expose their private parts,the majority holds that ocegueda conviction is not a crime involving moral turpitude.op.at.the majority does not expressly argue that such lewd conduct is not a crime involving moral turpitude.instead,the majority points to three convictions that,in its opinion,did not involve lewd conduct.first,the majority claims that california has upheld convictions for nude dancing at bars.op.at.no it has,at least not in any way that counts under.the one nude dancing case the majority cites,people conway.dep t super,was expressly disapproved by the california supreme court in,morris municipal court,and the case has not been cited since.and,i am quite confident that there is nude dancing going on in california bars even as i write this,and no one is being arrested under.so much for a realistic probability.second,the majority discovered two other cases that it thinks demonstrate overbreadth.one involved indecent exposure during a road rage incident,people archer,d,and the other an unpublished decision involved indecent exposure to twelve girls at school,people lionel,wl.without any record on which to base its judgment,the majority dismisses conduct the california courts found to be lewd as relatively harmless and merely provocative insults and tasteless pranks.op.at.the majority collateral attack on these convictions is wholly inappropriate in this context and,at best,revisionist history.
whatever ocegueda did to get himself convicted of indecent exposure,we can be fairly confident that it involved more than being a nude dancer at a bar or a tasteless prank.because i believe that ocegueda conviction for indecent exposure under is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude,i would uphold the decision of the board of immigration appeals and deny the petition.i respectfully dissent.
section b of title gives the attorney general discretionary authority to cancel the removal of an alien who is inadmissible to or deportable from the united states.to qualify for cancellation of removal under this section,an alien must establish,among other requirements,that he or she has been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than years immediately preceding the date of the alien application for cancellation of removal,and has been a person of good moral character during such period.b a b.section f provides that an alien can not establish good moral character if the alien has been convicted of a crime listed in a a b,which includes a crime involving moral turpitude.a a i i.
in this case,the only evidence tendered by the government is the fact ocegueda was convicted of violating,california indecent exposure statute.thus,absent additional documentation,ocegueda conviction only qualifies under a a i i if categorically describes conduct involving moral turpitude.
the supreme court has placed a critical limit on the scope of our inquiry under the categorical approach.in gonzales,the court explained,to find that a state statute creates a crime outside the generic definition of a listed crime in a federal statute requires more than the application of legal imagination to a state statute language.id.at.rather,i t requires a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that the state would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.id.the court continued,t o show that realistic probability,an offender must at least point to his own case or other cases in which the state courts in fact did apply the statute in the special nongeneric manner for which he argues.id.
we have held that the supreme court squarely placed the burden on the alien to demonstrate a realistic probability that the state would apply the offense in a way that falls outside the generic definition of the crime.mukasey,cir.ordinarily,we begin by asking whether the state statute plainly and specifically criminalizes conduct outside the contours of the federal definition.cerezo mukasey,cir.if we think the statute is too broad,we will still consider whether california courts have interpreted the statute more narrowly so as to make it applicable only to conduct which involves moral turpitude.id.at.although it seems less likely,we may also entertain an argument the state courts have expanded what the statute plainly and specifically criminalizes.
the import of in this case is clear.we may not apply our legal imagination,but must find a realistic probability that california is enforcing its indecent exposure law outside a generic definition of moral turpitude.proof of such a realistic probability requires cases in which california courts in fact applied the statute in a nongeneric fashion.the majority claims that t his realistic probability can be established by showing that,in at least one other case,the state courts in fact did apply the statute in the special nongeneric manner op.at quoting mukasey,cir.i question whether just any single case will satisfy.the case the majority cites for the proposition,relied on a single,unpublished decision for evidence of the realistic probability.that portion of the opinion,however,was the opinion of a single judge and thus is not the judgment of the court.see,at opinion of fletcher,id.at pregerson,specially concurring id.at bybee,dissenting.
moreover,for reasons i explained in my dissent in,i think that to satisfy we need something more than scouring state records to see if we can find a conviction that we think falls outside some generic ideal.as i wrote in,i do not believe that the supreme court in meant for us to take the least generous approach possible in analyzing state cases under the categorical approach at bybee,dissenting.as judges,we are,or should be,well aware of our own mortality.just as our occasional,uncorrected errors do not represent the body of the law of the united states,we should hesitate before taking a single,possibly aberrant state case and elevating it to state law.a considered case from the state highest court or appellate court would be strong evidence of the meaning of the statute.a single decision of a lower state when the decision is dated or the opinion is not carefully not,in my view,satisfy the petitioner duty to show the realistic probability.as the supreme court told us,to show that realistic possibility,an offender,of course,may show that the statute was so applied in his own case.but he must at least point to his own or other cases in which the state courts in fact did apply the statute in the special nongeneric manner for which he argues.at emphasis added.
as ocegueda declined to come forward with any evidence that california applied the indecent exposure statute to him in a special nongeneric manner,we are left to consider how california construes and applies in the main.with in mind,i address first the generic standards for a crime of moral turpitude.i then address standards for obtaining a conviction under and discuss how california courts have applied those standards in fact.lastly,i address the cases the majority uses to show that california applies to conduct outside the generic definition of a crime involving moral turpitude.
we have consistently defined moral turpitude as involving conduct that is inherently base,vile,or depraved,and contrary to the private and social duties man owes to his fellow men or to society in general.gonzales,cir en banc.this definition is employed by the bia and is relatively consistent throughout the federal courts.id.
in general,we have divided crimes involving moral turpitude into two basic types those involving fraud and those involving grave acts of baseness or depravity.gonzales,cir quoting carty ashcroft,cir see also in re ajami,bia matter of short,bia.in cases,we have looked to accepted moral standards for guidance in determining the types of behavior that involve moral turpitude.see ins,cir.
the federal courts have long held that sexual offenses violate accepted moral standards and come within the category of grave acts of baseness or depravity.these offenses include indecent assault,maghsoudi ins,cir lewd and lascivious conduct,schoeps carmichael,cir statutory rape,castle ins,cir marciano ins,cir incest,morales gonzales,cir and contributing to the sexual delinquency of a minor,sheikh gonzales,cir palmer ins,cir.unlike other types of crimes falling into the category of grave and base acts,sexual offenses have generally been classified as crimes involving moral turpitude irrespective of any injury to the victim,physical or otherwise.sexual misconduct also need not involve physical assault to violate contemporary moral standards even fully consensual conduct can involve moral turpitude.see,franklin ins,cir noting that statutory rape is a crime of moral turpitude castle,at same marciano,at same.in fact,the sexual misconduct in question need not even involve a threat of physical contact.for example,we have held that merely communicating with a minor for immoral purposes of a sexual nature involves moral turpitude because s exual communication with a minor is inherently wrong and contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons.morales,at.
california indecent exposure statute reads,in relevant part every person who willfully and lewdly e xposes his person,or the private parts thereof,in any public place,or in any place where there are present other persons to be offended or annoyed thereby is guilty of a misdemeanor.cal.pen.code,subd.the california supreme court has held that indecent exposure encompasses only conduct that is sexually motivated and thus requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the actor not only meant to expose himself,but intended by his conduct to direct public attention to his genitals for purposes of sexual arousal,gratification,or affront.in re smith,cal see also people archer,d,interpreting term sexual in smith as modifying all three words that follow.
the california supreme court has applied requirement of lewd intent narrowly.in smith,the defendant went to a public beach,removed all of his clothes,and fell asleep on a towel.at.the police arrived several hours later and arrested the defendant at this time,several other people were also present on the beach.id.the smith court concluded that the defendant conduct did not violate,reasoning that a bsent additional conduct intentionally directing attention to his genitals for sexual purposes,a person,as here,who simply sunbathes in the nude on an isolated beach does not lewdly expose his private parts within the meaning of section.id.at.

by contrast,california courts have reversed convictions under in cases either where there is no evidence that the defendant exposed his genitals or where there is no evidence that the offending conduct was accompanied by lewd intent.for example,in people massicot,d,the defendant had concealed his genitals but exposed other parts of his body,including his buttocks and thighs,by appearing in lace underpants and a lace bra.the court of appeal reversed the conviction,holding that the statutory phrase e xposes his person applied only where the defendant displayed his or her entire unclothed body,including the genitals.id.at.similarly,in in re dallas,the court of appeal held that a juvenile who had twice moon ed oncoming traffic could not be convicted under because there was no evidence that he had bared his buttocks in public with lewd intent.id.at.the dallas court also disapproved of the standard jury instructions used in that case because they permitted conviction on a finding that the defendant had acted with the intent to cause affront to others,even if that affront was in nature.id.at.
the majority agrees that u nder,it is the sexual intent with which the exposure occurs that transforms it into an act that is criminal,rather than an act that is merely improper or inappropriate.op.at.but for the majority,california careful application of to only lewd conduct is not enough,and it obliquely argues that sexual intent or lewdness no longer qualifies as moral turpitude.instead,the majority attempts to whittle down a crime of moral turpitude to conduct that necessarily involves either actual infliction of harm or a protected class of victim most often a combination of the two.op.at.unless lewd conduct no longer qualifies as moral turpitude,california indecent exposure statute categorically satisfies requirement of a crime involving moral turpitude.whatever the fluid boundaries of our nebulous moral turpitude,indecent exposure bears no resemblance to consensual sexual conduct among adults and,as defined by california,is conduct offensive to at least a majority.op.at.
notwithstanding the narrow scope the california courts have given,the majority cites to three cases that it contends demonstrate that california construe s sexual motivation quite broadly and punishes conduct that,in fact,does not involve moral turpitude op.at.the first case is a conviction for nude dancing at bars.op.at.the remaining two are cases that,by the majority lights,represent a tasteless prank or de minimus provocation.op at.
the principal case the majority uses to create a realistic probability that california will use to punish conduct that is not morally turpitudinous is a thirty nude dancing case,people conway.dep t super.conway was expressly disapproved by the california supreme court in in morris mun.court,n,and has not been cited since.there is no evidence whatsoever that conway is good law or that california has any intention of using to try to punish mere nude dancing.
in conway,the appellate division of the los angeles superior court upheld a municipal court conviction of a waitress and dancer in a beer bar who performed naked on a raised platform display ing her private parts.conway.at.the court reasoned that her specific intent to create sexual arousal in observers met the lewd and wilful requirements of.id.at.the majority argues that the dancing in conway was not so base,vile,or depraved that it shocks the conscience and,therefore,a conviction under can not be categorically a crime of moral turpitude.op.at.
conway can not establish a realistic probability that california would use to convict nude dancers in a nude entertainment venue of indecent exposure.there is no need to discuss whether mere nude dancing is so base,vile,or depraved that it shocks the conscience.for purposes of this case,i am willing to assume that nude dancing in bars,without more,is not morally turpitudinous,although i am not sure that anything in the supreme court jurisprudence compels that assumption.see city of erie pap,upholding,a municipal ordinance banning public nudity against a first amendment challenge barnes glen theatre,city of newport iacobucci,per curiam new york state liquor auth.bellanca,per curiam.not only is conway the only case since to use to uphold a conviction of a nude dancer,but conway was decided when the law relating to nude dancing teetered back and forth from protected to unprotected expression under the first amendment.conway is even weaker precedent in showing a realistic probability that california will use to punish nude dancing because the law relating to nude dancing has changed dramatically since conway was decided conway relied on a decision that has been overruled,and its reasoning is doubtful.
in,the california supreme court overturned a conviction under for topless dancing at a nightclub.in re giannini.the court found that dance was a form of expression protected by the first amendment,and thus the conviction for indecent exposure was unconstitutional.id.four years later,the california court of appeal upheld an injunction prohibiting owners of a bar from using the premises for lewdness in people ex rel.hicks sarong gals.the court noted that there had been arrests at the bar under,but found that the activities went well beyond nude dancing protected by the first amendment under in re giannini.id.at.rather,these activities were purely and simply obscene acts performed for the purpose of inciting the sexual desires and imaginations of a group of randy,patrons.id.at.the sarong gals bar featured live entertainment involving naked females masturbating on stage,male customers masturbating while watching a naked dancer simulate sexual intercourse,naked females allowing customers to look into her innards and vigorously rubbing items in private areas.id.at.such activity is obscene by any standards,but in,the court was clearly justified in finding such activity to be obscene and thus not protected as a form of expression.see miller california.it is clear that was used in this situation to arrest people for committing obscene acts and not as a way to convict nonobscene nude dancing.
a year after hicks,the california supreme court overruled in re giannini in crownover musick.in crownover,the court upheld city ordinances that prohibited the service of food or drink by topless women or bottomless persons of either sex and prohibited live acts by any such persons.id.at.the court found both activities to be conduct,not speech,and concluded that regulation of these activities was justified by considerations of public morals and general welfare.id.at.
the los angeles superior court decision in conway was issued in when crownover was still good law.in conway,the court explicitly found that crownover precluded the defendant claim that her dancing was protected by the first amendment.conway.at stating that defendant places her reliance on in re giannini,and that case was overruled in crownover musick.w e are bound by crownover internal citations omitted.just three years after conway,however,crownover was overruled by morris municipal court.morris established the current law for regulation of nude dancing in california.the court concluded 
a ban on nude dancing can not be sustained on the theory that it regulates only conduct and does not impinge upon protected speech.nonobscene nude dancing can not be barred without,in some cases,infringing upon constitutionally protected expression.an enactment prohibiting nonobscene nude dancing which extends beyond establishments serving alcohol is presumptively overbroad.
id.at.in a footnote,morris specifically disapproved conway to the extent it is inconsistent with the present opinion.id.at.i can not find any case after morris where a court upholds a conviction for indecent exposure of a nude entertainer in a bar,and conway has not been cited since by any court.there is,thus,no support whatsoever,except the majority ipse dixit,that conway remains good law in relevant part.op.at.if anything in conway survives,it is plainly not the majority claim that california courts will,under,uph o ld convictions for nude dancing at bars.op.at 
even if,as purely theoretical matter,there remains a sliver of unprotected,nude entertainment which is not so base,vile,and depraved that it shocks the conscience but nevertheless could be prosecuted under as indecent exposure,there is no indication that there is a realistic probability of conviction in the future.the statute requires that the exposure occur in a public place,or in any place where there are present other persons to be offended or annoyed thereby.cal.pen.code,subd.it is unlikely that a conviction would stand for an individual who exposed herself or himself in an establishment devoted to nude dancing.realistically,any person who attended a venue expecting nude entertainment would not be offended or annoyed by seeing the object of his or her presence.
more importantly,there is ample evidence that california and its municipalities tolerate nude dancing and do not regard it as violation of.california regulates businesses that serve alcohol,including bars featuring nude dancers,but it does not do so through.so far as i can determine from the published cases,in the past twenty years,no nude dancing or nude entertainment cases in california courts have even mentioned.the majority of these cases deal with regulating alcohol licenses of commercial establishments that offer such entertainment,and a number of them show sensitivity to first amendment questions surrounding nude dancing.see sp star enter.city of los angeles,d holding that an adult nude entertainment club argument that alcohol restrictions regulated speech lacked merit krontz city of san diego,d upholding city suspension of a nude entertainment establishment license when the establishment violated the rule that dancers must be six feet away from patrons dep t of alcoholic beverage control alcoholic beverage control appeals,d upholding suspension of a license because the nude entertainment club violated alcoholic beverage control regulations wooten superior court,d reversing conviction for pimping and pandering where defendants hired women to perform sexual acts on each other and not customers tily.city of newport beach,d holding that the city ordinance prohibiting nude dancing and requiring pasties and during performances did not violate the first amendment smith county of los angeles,d holding that a city ordinance prohibiting nude dancing was too vague to survive constitutional scrutiny thomas county of los angeles.same city of rancho cucamonga warner consulting.upholding regulations on nude dancing in places that serve alcohol stroh midway restaurant.same.we too have dealt with some of the problems in the regulation of nude dancing establishments in california.see united states inzunza,cir appeal by members of san diego city council convicted of accepting bribes to repeal the no touch ordinance for nude dancing.the reality is that no one in california seems to be concerned with nude dancing per se.certainly,there is no evidence that in past years anyone has been prosecuted under for nude dancing in bars.
the majority proposed use of conway strips the supreme court limitation in of any real meaning.when the supreme court said a realistic probability it meant something more than dredging up a case from the superior court that was expressly disapproved years ago by the california supreme court and has not been cited since.
the majority cites the last two cases as examples of california punishing a tasteless prank or de minimus provocation.op.at.the first case,people archer,d,involved a male driver who exposed his genitals to a female driver and then yelled a sexually explicit comment to her in a road rage incident.the majority dismisses the incident as crass and involving only transitory nudity.op.at.that characterization is quite unfair to the california courts.archer appealed his conviction for indecent exposure on the grounds that there was no evidence that he acted with lewd intent.beginning from the premise that lewd is an essential element of the offense,the court of appeal found there was sufficient evidence to uphold his conviction.d at quoting in re smith,at.the court worked carefully through the california supreme court seminal decision on,in re smith,and the decision of the court of appeal dismissing a conviction under for mooning,in re dallas,d.in in re smith,the california supreme court held that lewd intent meant that the accused direct ed public attention to this genitals for purposes of sexual arousal,gratification,or affront.at.the dallas court had held that the adjective sexual modified all three of the terms that followed arousal,gratification,and affront.in re dallas,d at.the dallas court had found that dallas acted only to annoy and affront people and not with sexual intent in the sense that he intended to arouse himself or a third person by his act dallas did not violate section by mooning traffic.id.at emphasis in original.archer claimed that he too merely intended to offend or annoy his victim by exposing his penis to a female driver.the court of appeal rejected this argument because it is enough if the defendant exposed himself for purposes of sexual affront.archer,d at.accordingly,a defendant who intentionally exposes his person,or the private parts thereof to another for the purpose of sexually insulting or offending the other person commits indecent exposure in violation of section.id.at.the court concluded that archer act of exposing his penis accompanied by the comment suck my dick was sufficient evidence to support his conviction under.id.
the majority also points to an unpublished opinion of the court of appeal,people lionel,wl,in lionel,a twelve boy called hey,look to two old girls in his class.lionel had pulled his pants down and exposed his penis.lionel appealed his conviction under on the grounds that he did not have lewd intent.the court of appeal reviewed in re smith,in re dallas,and archer.the court stated that merely exposing his genitals would not have been sufficient to convict lionel under.it found that this case includes additional facts suggesting a lewd intent 
lionel approached the two girls,gained their attention,and then exposed his penis.the exposure of his genitalia was not,as in smith,a consequence of passive nudity,but a deliberate action directed at two young girls lionel did not,for example step to the front of the room to briefly flash the entire class or streak through the school halls instead he targeted devyn and marlena and ensured they observed his private parts from a close distance lionel choice to highlight only his penis provides adequate evidence of the sexual nature of the offense.
although the circumstances surrounding lionel action are subject to other reasonable interpretations,we find sufficient support for the trial court implied finding that appellant acted with the purpose of a sexual affront.
based on its own reading of these cases,the majority finds that these incidents were not highly threatening,intrusive,or psychologically damaging to the victims but were mere acts of provocation,bad taste,and failed humor.op.at.the majority conclusion is way beyond any evidence in the cases or the record before us.in fact,the california courts have rejected the claim that reaches mere acts of provocation,bad taste,and failed humor.as the california court of appeal said in in re dallas the mooning case,dallas may have been guilty of some other offense,and he certainly exhibited bad judgment and poor the trial court findings make it clear that dallas did not violate section.cal rptr d at citation omitted emphasis in original.
the majority characterization of archer and in re lionel is one of two things.either it is a collateral attack on the judgments because the majority simply does believe the evidence or,even worse,it is a determination that lewd conduct is categorically no longer a crime of moral turpitude.if it is a collateral attack,it is sorely misplaced.we have no competence in this proceeding to question the findings of the california courts,and the fact that judges on our court might have taken a different view on direct review of those cases is of no moment.the california courts found that archer and lionel deliberately engaged in lewd conduct in a public place and that is a crime involving moral turpitude.
if,however,the majority means to remove lewd conduct from the category of crimes involving moral turpitude,its discussion is a wholesale assault on sex crimes as crimes involving moral turpitude.as our cases demonstrate,it is too late for the majority to take that position,but one reads the majority opinion wondering how any sex crimes will satisfy its standards.
our morality is not the measure of accepted moral standards,at.california is in a far better position to determine those moral standards.whatever inclination california might once have had to regulate nude dancing,it is clear that one may now dance nude in bars with aplomb.but california continues to draw a line against those who expose their genitals in public when they do so lewdly,meaning for purposes of sexual arousal,gratification,or affront.in re smith,at.that members of our court might have taken a different view of the evidence in a state case does not change that fact.it certainly does not satisfy ocegueda burden of showing a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that california would apply its indecent exposure statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime involving moral turpitude,at.
i would deny the petition.i respectfully dissent.
multiple spellings of the petitioner name appear throughout the record.we use victor ocegueda nuñez,or ocegueda,because that is the spelling used by the petitioner himself.
relying on his dissent in a prior case,judge bybee challenges our conclusion that one case may establish a realistic probability.dissent at.the dissent would be more generous to the government and would impose a higher burden on the petitioner to show that the state in fact applies its law to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of moral turpitude.id.we do not believe that such generosity is appropriate.has not fundamentally changed the categorical approach,which requires us to ask whether the full range of conduct encompassed by the statute constitutes a crime of moral turpitude.cerezo mukasey,cir internal quotation marks omitted.although the dissent is correct that not all of the opinion was joined by a majority of the panel,dissent at,the majority of the panel did agree that t o suggest that a state law does not apply to conduct involving moral turpitude unless it is regularly applied to nonturpitudinous conduct would not only bring an end to the categorical approach,but would also require an entirely unmanageable standard,at.moreover,the majority specifically rejected judge bybee admonition that it is unwise to rely on a single unpublished decision.id.at bybee,dissenting.to the extent that there may be any doubt whether these views constituted a part of the majority holding,we adopt them here.further,where a criminal statute,as interpreted by the courts,encompasses conduct that is not morally turpitudinous and has actually been applied to punish such conduct,it requires no legal imagination,at,to conclude that there is a realistic probability that the state would once again so apply it.cerezo,at w here the state statute plainly and specifically criminalizes conduct outside the contours of the federal definition,we do not engage in judicial prestidigitation by concluding that the statute creates a crime outside the generic definition of a listed crime.quoting,at.
we have held that,at this stage of our analysis,we rel y on our own generalized definition of the term moral turpitude because the bia has failed to provide any generic definition to which we could meaningfully defer.holder,at.
we do not suggest that every crime that has been held by us to involve moral turpitude falls within this grouping.there are a number of exceptions or outliers.see,holder,cir en banc deferring to the bia conclusion that driving under the influence without a license is a crime of moral turpitude.the difficulty of discerning any logical justification for these exceptions is one of the reasons we have repeatedly concluded that our own and the bia case law on moral turpitude is inconsistent and incoherent.see,id.at stating that the bia has fail ed to particularize the term moral turpitude in any meaningful way internal quotation marks removed,at recognizing that w e have not relied on a consistent or easily applied set of criteria to identify crimes of moral turpitude.our characterization does not seek to encompass every single crime that has been held to involve moral turpitude largely because we do not think there is any meaningful characterization that can do so.rather,we intend to identify only the general grouping into which the vast majority of crimes of moral turpitude intent to harm is usually key to satisfying what the bia has said is the defining characteristic of a crime of moral turpitude evil intent.matter of flores,bia e vil or malicious intent is the essence of moral turpitude.but see matter of medina,bia the presence or absence of a corrupt or vicious mind is not controlling in deciding whether a crime involves moral turpitude.the intentional or reckless commission of an act that causes harm to where the harm was not specifically also satisfy this evil intent requirement.see matter of franklin,bia holding that involuntary manslaughter is a crime of moral turpitude.and,where a protected class of victim is involved,such as children or individuals who stand in a close relationship to the perpetrator,both the bia and this court have been flexible about the intent requirement,extending the category of crimes of moral turpitude to encompass even unintentional acts that only threaten harm.see,morales gonzales,cir holding that communication with a minor for immoral purposes is a crime of moral turpitude.
the bia decision cites one precedential case,matter of mueller,but only for the purpose of rejecting petitioner argument that mueller required it to conclude that indecent exposure was not a crime of moral turpitude.bia.the bia found that mueller was distinguishable because the statute it examined did not require a sexual motivation.the bia did not rely on mueller to determine that is a crime of moral turpitude,but rather determined only that mueller did not control.
to answer this question,we do not consider,as the dissent suggests,dissent at,whether the conduct is lewd,but rather whether it is base,vile,and depraved.see supra at.
the facts of people rylaarsdam are illustrative of the problems inherent in judging whether particular sexual conduct is so offensive and shocking as to involve moral turpitude.that case upheld a conviction under for an incident that took place in a motion picture booth at an adult bookstore where gay pornography was being shown.at.the bookstore was a cruising place where gay men often went to meet other gay men.the defendant stuck his finger into a hole between his booth and an adjacent known as a glory hole in which an undercover police officer happened to be sitting.this overture was not received negatively,and the two men made eye contact through the hole.the defendant interpreted the response as a receptiveness to further sexual advances.he then inserted his penis through the hole into the adjacent booth,a function that the hole was designed to serve.id.we need not rely on this case in making our determination,however,because,as we discuss infra,reaches other conduct that even more obviously fails to qualify as morally turpitudinous.
conway remains good law in relevant part,despite the california supreme court subsequent disapproval of some of its language.see morris,at.although morris excludes conduct protected by the first amendment from reach,there is nothing in morris to suggest that a conviction for nude dancing in a bar would violate the first amendment.morris held only that a n enactment prohibiting nonobscene nude dancing which extends beyond establishments serving alcohol is presumptively overbroad.id.at emphasis added.under morris,restrictions on nude dancing in establishments serving alcohol do not violate the first dissent argues at length that conway is weak precedent because the law relating to nude dancing has changed dramatically since conway was decided.dissent at.but the change in law to which the dissent refers has significantly strengthened conway conclusion that application to nude dancing does not violate the first amendment.in the years since conway was decided,the supreme court has on two occasions upheld public nudity ordinances against first amendment challenges,even though the ordinances had the effect of completely banning totally nude erotic dancing performed by women and requiring that,erotic dancers must wear,at a minimum,pasties and a.city of erie pap,plurality see also barns glen theatre,plurality.as the california courts have recognized,barns and erie establish that nude dancing receives less first amendment protection than morris had assumed.see krotz san diego,d,had morris been decided today,we have no doubt that it would have recognized the limits on the first amendment protection extended by the united states supreme court in barnes and erie.tiley,city of newport beach,d,rejecting first amendment challenge to ordinance banning public nudity,including nude dancing,and stating that morris expansive interpretation of first amendment protection for nude dan
