this case involves parents who face separation from their children due to the way our immigration system operates.appellants,the parents,have all immigrated to the united states and become lawful permanent residents.their children,however,have not been able to join them because the children are no longer under the age of.
appellants became lawful permanent residents through the immigration process,which allows certain aliens to immigrate based on their status as relatives of either citizens or lawful permanent residents.when appellants began this process,they all had children under the age of who would have been eligible to immigrate with them under the immigration and nationality act ina.see b,d entitling a child under the age of to the same immigration status as a parent.however,due to delays associated with the immigration process,these children turned before their parents were able to immigrate or adjust status.because these children had aged out of child status under the ina by the time their parents immigrated or adjusted status,they were no longer eligible to accompany their parents.
the question we are faced with today is whether appellants children are entitled to any relief under the child status protection act cspa,h,which was enacted to help keep families together by expediting the immigration process for certain aliens.united states citizenship and immigration services cis denied appellants requests for relief under the cspa,and appellants challenge the denial as arbitrary and capricious.the district court,deferring to the board of immigration appeals bia interpretation of h,held that the cspa did not apply to appellants children.because we agree that the bia interpretation of h warrants deference,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of cis.we hold that appellants children are not among the aliens entitled to relief under h.
understanding this appeal requires familiarity with the immigration process and,specifically,the complicated family preference system.immigration is one of the primary avenues by which an alien can obtain lawful permanent residence in the united states,along with immigration,immigration,and asylum.the immigration process allows a citizen or lawful permanent resident lpr to file a form i immigration petition on behalf of an alien relative.a.after the petition is filed,cis determines if it establishes a qualifying relationship between the citizen or lpr petitioner and the alien relative beneficiary.because there is no annual cap on the number of permanent resident visas also known as green cards available to immediate relatives of citizens,a citizen spouse,child under the age of,or parent can apply for one immediately.
for other qualifying relatives of citizens and for qualifying relatives of lprs,the number of visas available annually is capped.id.c.to allocate these visas,the ina establishes the following preference system 
aliens subject to the worldwide numerical limitation for immigrants shall be allotted visas as follows 
unmarried sons and daughters age or older of citizens 
qualified immigrants who are the unmarried sons or daughters of citizens of the united states shall be allocated visas in a number not to exceed numerical quota formula.
spouses and unmarried sons and unmarried daughters of permanent resident aliens 
qualified immigrants 
a who are the spouses or children under of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,or 
b who are the unmarried sons or unmarried daughters but are not the children of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,
shall be allocated visas in a number not to exceed numerical quota formula.
married sons and married daughters of citizens 
qualified immigrants who are the married sons or married daughters of citizens of the united states shall be allocated visas in a number not to exceed numerical quota formula.
brothers and sisters of citizens 
qualified immigrants who are the brothers or sisters of citizens of the united states,if such citizens are at least years of age,shall be allocated visas in a number not to exceed numerical quota formula.
id.a.if an i petition establishes one of these qualifying relationships,cis approves it and places the alien beneficiary in line in the appropriate preference category.these family preference categories are referred to as,or,corresponding to a numbered paragraphs.
because annual demand for family preference visas exceeds the statutory cap in all categories,a beneficiary may wait years before a visa becomes available,with some categories having longer wait times than others.the beneficiary place in line is determined by the date the petition was filed,which is known as the priority date.every month,the state department publishes a visa bulletin with updated cut off dates for each family preference category.when the date is later than the beneficiary priority date,the priority date is current,and a lawful permanent resident visa is then available for the beneficiary.in order to obtain the visa and become an lpr,however,the beneficiary must act within one year of notification of visa availability to complete consular processing if abroad or apply for an adjustment of status if present in the united states.
under the ina,a beneficiary spouse or child is deemed a derivative beneficiary entitled to the same immigration status and priority date as the primary beneficiary 
a spouse or child shall,if not otherwise entitled to an immigrant status and the immediate issuance of a visa under subsection a of this section,be entitled to the same status,and the same order of consideration provided in the respective subsection,if accompanying or following to join,the spouse or parent.
d.importantly,to be considered a child,a person must be unmarried and under the age of.id.b.due to the long wait times often associated with family preference visas,some aliens who begin the process eligible to immigrate as a child either as the primary beneficiary of an petition or as a derivative beneficiary of a petition for a parent in any of the other family preference categories will age out of eligibility by turning before a visa becomes available.
in,congress enacted the cspa to provide relief to aged out alien children by allowing them either to maintain child status longer,see h,or to automatically convert to a valid adult visa category while retaining the priority date associated with their original petition,see id.h.the issue before us is whether an derivative beneficiary of an petition for married sons or daughters of citizens or petition for siblings of citizens,a grandchild or niece or nephew of a citizen is entitled to automatic conversion and priority date retention,or either of them separately,under the cspa.
two cases,each with multiple plaintiffs,were consolidated before us in this appeal.the facts of these cases illustrate the immigration process and the problem.
in one case,rosalina cuellar de osorio was the beneficiary of an petition filed by her citizen mother on may.cuellar de osorio son,who was born in july,was thirteen at the time and a derivative beneficiary of the petition.by the time cuellar de osorio priority date became current on november,her son had turned and aged out of derivative status.therefore,he was no longer eligible to immigrate with his mother.after cuellar de osorio became an lpr in august,she filed an petition for adult sons or daughters of lprs on behalf of her son.invoking the cspa,she requested retention of the original petition may,priority date for the petition,which would enable her son to immigrate much sooner than if he was assigned a more recent priority date based on the filing date.
on june,cuellar de osorio filed a lawsuit against cis in the central district court of california along with several other similarly situated plaintiffs who had asked cis for and not obtained priority date retention for their children they sought declaratory and mandamus relief,alleging that cis arbitrarily and capriciously failed to grant the requested priority dates in violation of the cspa provisions codified at h.
the district court held the case in abeyance pending a precedential bia decision interpreting h in matter of wang.on june,the bia issued its decision,which held that the automatic conversion and priority date retention provisions of the cspa did not apply to derivative beneficiaries of petitions.see.the district court then granted summary judgment to cis on october,holding that the bia interpretation of h in matter of wang,according to which the plaintiffs were not entitled to relief,should receive chevron deference.plaintiffs timely appealed.
meanwhile,on june,teresita costelo and lorenzo ong had separately filed a lawsuit in district court.costelo was the beneficiary of an petition filed by her citizen mother on january.at the time,she had two daughters,aged and,who were derivative beneficiaries of the petition.by the time costelo priority date became current fourteen years later in,both daughters had aged out of derivative status.after costelo became an lpr,she filed petitions for her adult daughters and requested retention of the january,priority date for the petitions.
ong was the beneficiary of an petition filed by his citizen sister in.at that time,he had two daughters,aged and.by the time ong priority date became current years later in,his daughters had aged out of derivative status.in march,after ong obtained lpr status,he filed petitions on behalf of his daughters and requested retention of the priority date for these petitions.
on july,the district court certified a class in costelo chertoff consisting of 
aliens who became lawful permanent residents as primary beneficiaries of and visa petitions listing their children as derivative beneficiaries,and who subsequently filed petitions on behalf of their unmarried sons and daughters,for whom defendants have not granted automatic conversion or the retention of priority dates pursuant to h.
after the parties for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment to the government on november,again deferring to matter of wang.plaintiffs timely appealed.the appeals in de osorio and costelo have been consolidated before us.
we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment.family citizenship immigration,cir.the interpretation of a statute is a question of law,united states cabaccang,cir en banc,and we review de novo the bia determination of questions of law,except to the extent that deference is owed to its interpretation of the governing statutes and regulations.garcia quintero gonzales,cir.we review a precedential decision of the bia interpreting a governing statute according to the principles of chevron,natural res.def.council.ins aguirre aguirre.
under the familiar chevron framework,we first ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.at.if it has,we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress,regardless of the agency interpretation.id.at.if,on the other hand,the statute is silent or ambiguous with regard to the issue,we proceed to step two and determine whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at footnote omitted.we must defer to the agency interpretation if it is reasonable.id.at holding that when congress has left a gap for an agency to fill,a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator or agency.
we now turn to the statutory provision at issue.in order to address the problem,congress passed the cspa in.see child status protection act,stat.the cspa,in relevant part,amended the ina to provide as follows 
h rules for determining whether certain aliens are children 
in general 
for purposes of subsections a a and d of this section,a determination of whether an alien satisfies the age requirement of this title shall be made using 
a the age of the alien on the date on which an immigrant visa number becomes available for such alien or,in the case of subsection d of this section,the date on which an immigrant visa number became available for the alien parent,but only if the alien has sought to acquire the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence within one year of such availability reduced by 
b the number of days in the period during which the applicable petition described in paragraph was pending.
petitions described 
the petition described in this paragraph is 
a with respect to a relationship described in subsection a a of this section,a petition filed for classification of an alien child under subsection a a of this section or 
b with respect to an alien child who is a derivative beneficiary under subsection d of this section,a petition filed for classification of the alien parent under subsection a,b,or c of this section.
retention of priority date 
if the age of an alien is determined under paragraph a to be years of age or older for the purposes of subsections a a and d of this section,the alien petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.
the parties do not dispute the meaning of paragraphs and above.paragraph provides that,if an alien applies for a visa within a year of one becoming available,within one year of the priority date on a relevant petition becoming current,the alien age for purposes of determining whether she is a child is determined by her age on the date the visa became available minus the number of days that the petition was pending that is,the number of days between the filing of the petition with cis and its approval by cis.see ochoa amaya gonzales,cir.in this way,paragraph ensures that an alien does not lose child status solely because of administrative delays in the processing of an otherwise valid petition.however,it does not address the much longer oversubscription delays that are typical between the approval of a petition and the availability of a visa 
paragraph,which is referenced at paragraph b,simply defines the universe of petitions to which the formula in paragraph applies.paragraph a refers to petitions for children of lprs.see a a.paragraph b refers to any family preference petition for which a child is a derivative beneficiary see id.d.
at issue is the meaning of paragraph,which provides relief to aliens who are or over even after the formula in paragraph is applied.in such a case,the alien petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original petition.id.h.importantly,this is different from the relief offered by paragraph.paragraph allows an alien to remain eligible for a visa as a child under the original petition.paragraph,in contrast,does not allow the alien to retain child status.instead,it allows him to move into a different category as an adult without having to file a new petition and get a new priority date.the alien may still wait in line in the new category,but because he is able to retain an older priority date,his wait time is reduced.the parties dispute whether derivative beneficiaries of and petitions are entitled to this relief.to answer this question,we undertake our chevron analysis.
our first charge under chevron is to ascertain,by employing traditional tools of statutory construction,whether congress had an intention on the precise question at issue.at.we begin,as always,with an examination of the statute plain language.see nw.env.def.ctr.brown,f d,cir.
first of all,we reject any contention that the word petition in paragraph is ambiguous because it is not defined by express reference to paragraph,as it is in paragraph.as we explain,express reference to paragraph is unnecessary.
paragraph initial clause makes it contingent upon the operation of paragraph.see h if the age of an alien is determined under paragraph to be years of age or older.thus,paragraph is triggered only if one has determined by doing the calculation in paragraph that an alien is or over if it is triggered,the alien petition shall automatically be converted to the appropriate category and the alien shall retain the original priority date issued upon receipt of the original p
