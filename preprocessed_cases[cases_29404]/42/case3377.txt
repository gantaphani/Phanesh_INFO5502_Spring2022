javier castrijon garcia castrijon petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia,holding that his conviction for simple kidnapping under california penal code cpc a is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude under a a i i,making him statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under b c.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a d to determine whether a crime involves moral turpitude.see nunez holder,cir whether a crime involves moral turpitude is a question of law that we have jurisdiction to review pursuant to a d.we grant the petition for review and remand to the bia for further proceedings.
we have held that crimes of moral turpitude almost always involve an intent to harm someone,the actual infliction of harm upon someone,or an action that affects a protected class of victim.id.at.simple kidnapping under cpc a does not involve any of these elements.moreover,california courts have applied the statute to conduct that is not morally turpitudinous.see gonzales duenas alvarez.therefore,we hold that simple kidnapping under cpc a is not categorically a crime involving moral turpitude.we remand to allow the bia to conduct a modified categorical analysis of castrijon crime.see ins ventura.
factual and procedural background 
castrijon is a native and citizen of mexico who,according to his application for cancellation of removal,entered the united states without inspection in.he has resided in the united states continuously since that time,with the exception of two short trips to mexico in and.he has three citizen children as well as citizen sisters,and his mother is a legal permanent resident.
in,the department of homeland security charged castrijon with removability under a a i,in that he was an alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled,or who arrived in the united states at any time or place other than as designated by the attorney general.he conceded removability,designated mexico as his country of removal,and submitted an application for cancellation of removal under b.the conviction records submitted as part of the application for cancellation of removal reflect that in castrijon pled guilty to attempted kidnapping in violation of cpc and a,and received a suspended sentence of days in jail and months of probation.during a hearing before the immigration judge,he explained that the incident occurred while he was with friends and that he did not know the victim.the conviction records also reflect that in and castrijon was convicted of driving with a suspended license.
the immigration judge issued an oral decision finding castrijon ineligible for cancellation of removal under b c because his conviction for attempted simple kidnapping is a categorical crime of moral turpitude in that the language of the statute requir ed the element of instilling fear in the victim.the bia affirmed in an unpublished decision.it noted that it had previously listed kidnapping as an example of a crime of moral turpitude,found that kidnapping for ransom under the federal kidnapping act involves moral turpitude,and found that the offense of kidnapping,as defined by the california penal code cpc,involves moral turpitude.the bia identified the elements of cpc a as a person was unlawfully moved by use of physical force or fear,the movement was without the person consent,and the movement of the person was for a substantial distance.it held that,although ransom was an element under the federal kidnapping act,the lack of a ransom element in cpc a was not relevant because there is no requirement that a state offense match all the elements of an analogous federal offense in order to be classified as a crime of moral turpitude.the bia concluded that simple kidnapping is a crime of moral turpitude because it involves readiness to do evil and is an offense that grievously offends the moral code of mankind in its inherent nature,citing to people zataray.it therefore held that castrijon was ineligible for cancellation of removal.castrijon now petitions for review.
the determination whether a conviction under a criminal statute is categorically a crime of moral turpitude involves two steps,to which different standards of review apply.uppal holder,cir see also marmolejo campos holder,cir en banc clarifying standard of review.the first step is to identify the elements of the statute of conviction.see uppal,at.because t he bia has no special expertise by virtue of its statutory responsibilities in construing state or federal criminal statutes,we review its conclusion in that regard de novo.id.quoting marmolejo campos,at.the second step is to compare the elements of the statute of conviction to the generic definition of a crime of moral turpitude and decide whether the conviction meets that definition.see id.because the bia does have expertise in making this determination,we defer to its conclusion if warranted,following the chevron framework if the decision is a published decision or an unpublished decision directly controlled by a published decision interpreting the same statute,and following the skidmore framework if the decision is unpublished and not directly controlled by any published decision interpreting the same statute.see also chevron,natural res.def.council,skidmore swift.
we turn to the first step of our analysis identifying the elements of the statute of conviction.castrijon was convicted of simple kidnapping in violation of cpc a.that statute provides 
every person who forcibly,or by any other means of instilling fear,steals or takes,or holds,detains,or arrests any person in this state,and carries the person into another country,state,or county,or into another part of the same county,is guilty of kidnapping.
cpc a.to prove a defendant guilty of kidnapping,the prosecution must establish that the defendant took,held,or detained another person by using force or by instilling reasonable fear using that force or fear,the defendant moved the other person,or made the other person move a substantial distance and the other person did not consent to the movement.people burney,cal see also people jones,d.the california supreme court has explained that the force used against the victim need not be physical.the movement is forcible where it is accomplished through the giving of orders which the victim feels compelled to obey because he or she fears harm or injury from the accused and such apprehension is not unreasonable under the circumstances.people majors,cal internal quotation marks and citation omitted.for example,an implicit threat of arrest satisfies the force or fear element of section a kidnapping if the defendant conduct or statements cause the victim to believe that unless the victim accompanies the defendant the victim will be forced to do so,and the victim belief is objectively reasonable.id.at.
when the victim is a person capable of giving consent,the purpose or motive of the taking and carrying away is immaterial.in re michele,cal internal quotation marks,alterations and citation omitted.the rule governing the forcible carrying of conscious persons capable of giving consent makes a person who forcibly carries such a person and transports him against his will guilty of kidnap p ing,however good or innocent his motive or intent may otherwise be people oliver,cal see also people sheasbey,holding that no state of mind or belief is a part of the crime of kidnap p ing.this is because s imple kidnapping traditionally has been a general intent crime,and does not require,for example,the intent to instill fear in the victim.people moya,d.a crime is characterized as a general intent crime when the required mental state entails only an intent to do the act that causes the harm people davis,cal.when the victim is an unresisting infant or child or other person incapable of giving consent,however,the amount of force required to kidnap is simply the amount of physical force required to take and carry the child away a substantial distance for an illegal purpose or with an illegal intent.in re michele,at.
we now turn to the second step of our analysis comparing the elements of the statute of conviction to the generic definition of a crime involving moral turpitude.the parties disagree about whether we must defer to the bia unpublished decision.the government argues that because,in its decision,the bia cited to several published decisions,including matter of lopez meza,matter of p,matter of nakoi,and matter of c m,its decision that simple kidnapping in violation of cpc a is a crime involving moral turpitude is entitled to chevron deference.alternatively,the government argues that the bia decision was persuasive and is thus entitled to skidmore deference.castrijon contends that the bia decision is not entitled to chevron deference because the decision was unpublished and the cited decisions do not construe the identical statute and instead consist of boilerplate generalities and other conclusory statements.castrijon also contends that the bia decision does not warrant deference under skidmore because its decision lacks any real analysis and consists of a single conclusory paragraph.
we hold first that the bia decision here is not entitled to chevron deference.chevron deference is afforded to an unpublished decision only when it is directly controlled by a published decision interpreting the same statute.uppal,at.although the bia unpublished decision cites to published decisions,none interprets cpc a and thus none directly controls.the first case cited by the bia,matter of lopez meza,involved the offense of aggravated driving under the influence in violation of arizona law.bia.the second and third cases cited by the bia,matter of p and matter of nakoi,involved convictions under the federal kidnapping act,which contains different elements than simple kidnapping under cpc a,most important being that the kidnapping be committed for ransom or reward or otherwise.matter of p,bia matter of nakoi,bia.finally,although matter of c m,the fourth case cited by the bia,involved a kidnapping conviction under the california penal code,the bia did not interpret cpc a or even decide that kidnapping was a categorical crime of moral turpitude.bia.rather,the petitioner took no issue with the finding by the special inquiry officer that the offense of kidnapping,as defined by the california penal code,involves moral turpitude,instead arguing that he had been convicted as a juvenile and that the proceedings were therefore not criminal.id.at.in sum,the cases cited by the bia in its unpublished decision did not interpret the same statute and thus do not directly control the outcome here.see uppal,at.therefore,the bia decision is not entitled to chevron deference 
we turn to the skidmore framework to determine whether we should nevertheless defer to the bia decision to the extent it has persuasive effect.under skidmore,the weight afforded to the agency decision will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.skidmore,at see also uppal,at.here,the bia decision is unpersuasive.it had little reasoning and its analysis of why cpc a constitutes a crime of moral turpitude consists only of two conclusory statements.in these statements,the bia simply repeated phrases used in a decision by the california court of appeal,zataray.at,which decided that under california evidence law,a simple kidnapping conviction was admissible for impeachment purposes.borrowing the language from that decision,the bia said that simple kidnapping under cpc a involves readiness to do evil and is an offense that grievously offends the moral code of mankind in its inherent nature.this is no analysis at all the bia does not explain why simple kidnapping under cpc a involves a readiness to do evil or even what readiness to do evil means,or why it so deeply offends our moral code especially as it is a general intent crime,see moya,d at.moreover,we have held that whether a crime has been found to be one of moral turpitude under california law is not of great weight given the different roles of the crime involving moral turpitude designation under the immigration and nationality act and california law.latter singh holder,cir the bia unreasoned reliance on a state court decision that is of a type that we have held is not of great weight because it relates to the very different issue of whether a crime is morally turpitudinous for purposes of california evidence law,lacks power to persuade and thus is not entitled to deference see saavedra figueroa holder,cir holding that bia decision has no persuasive authority and declining skidmore deference where immigration judge speculated that the crime was considered heinous by the people of california without explanation and failed to address intent element uppal,at declining to afford bia decision skidmore deference because its analysis was neither thoroughly reasoned nor consistent with prior bia and ninth circuit case law.we therefore decline to grant deference to the unpublished bia decision and determine de novo whether the elements of simple kidnapping under cpc a meet the generic definition of moral turpitude under immigration law.
to determine whether a given offense constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude,we apply the categorical and modified categorical approaches set forth in taylor united states.see nunez,at.under the categorical approach,we compare the elements of the crime to the generic definition of moral turpitude and decide whether the conduct proscribed in the statute is broader than,and so does not categorically fall within,this generic definition.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in order to hold that the statute of conviction is overbroad,we must determine that there is a realistic probability of its application to conduct that falls beyond the scope of the generic federal offense.see also duenas alvarez,at.if the crime does not qualify under the categorical approach,we apply the modified categorical approach and look to the documents within the record of conviction to see whether the conviction in the particular case involved moral turpitude.nunez,at.
the immigration and nationality act does not define the term crime involving moral turpitude,but courts and the bia have generally defined it as comprising crimes that are inherently base,vile,or depraved,and contrary to the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed between persons or to society in general.robles urrea holder,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted such crimes are of two types those involving fraud and those involving grave acts of baseness or depravity.id.fraud is not an element of simple kidnapping under cpc a,nor is it inherent in the nature of the crime.in fact,the california supreme court has held that when the consent of the victim is obtained through fraud alone,the defendant is not guilty of simple kidnapping.see majors,at in contrast to the use of force or fear to compel asportation,asportation by fraud alone does not constitute general kidnapping in california.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we therefore focus on whether simple kidnapping involves grave acts of baseness or depravity.
we have explained that some offenses are so base,vile,and depraved that they qualify as crimes of moral turpitude even though they have no element of fraud.these offenses involve rather grave acts of baseness or depravity such as murder,rape,and incest.navarro lopez gonzales,cir reinhardt,concurring for the majority citation omitted,overruled on other grounds by united states aguila montes de oca,cir en banc.the majority in navarro lopez explained 
not all serious crimes meet this standard,however.indeed,we have determined,for example,that burglary,cuevas gaspar gonzales,cir,and assault with a deadly weapon,carr ins,cir,do not involve moral turpitude.to be considered a crime of moral turpitude,a crime other than fraud must be more than serious it must offend the most fundamental moral values of society,or as some would say,shock the public conscience.medina united states,cir quoting matter of danesh,bia.
id.at alteration in original.ultimately,o nly truly unconscionable conduct surpasses the threshold of moral turpitude.robles urrea,at.
crimes of moral turpitude generally involve some evil intent.mendoza holder,cir.the bia has emphasized that evil or malicious intent is the essence of moral turpitude,and we have upheld this emphasis on evil intent.latter singh,at internal quotation marks,alterations,and citations omitted.a review of our past analyzing whether particular offenses are crimes of moral turpitude reveals that crimes of moral turpitude generally involve an intent to injure,actual injury,or a protected class of victims.nunez,at.in uppal,for example,we held that a conviction for aggravated assault under of the canada criminal code was not categorically a crime involving moral turpitude because an assault statute not involving a specific intent to injure or a special trust relationship and not requiring that the assault cause death or even serious bodily injury can not qualify as a categorical crime of moral turpitude.at emphases in original.similarly,in saavedra figueroa,we analyzed a conviction for false imprisonment under cpc,and held that it was not a categorical crime of moral turpitude because the statute does not proscribe conduct that categorically causes serious harm or is directed against a protected class of persons and does not require the defendant to have had the intent to harm necessary for the crime to be base,vile,or depraved.at internal quotation marks omitted.
simple kidnapping under cpc a does not require an intent to injure,actual injury,or a special class of victims.the three elements of simple kidnapping under the statute are the defendant took,held,or detained another person by using force or by instilling reasonable fear using that force or fear,the defendant moved the other person,or made the other person move a substantial distance and the other person did not consent to the movement.burney,at.it is a general intent crime,and does not require,for example,the intent to instill fear in the victim.moya,d at.the california supreme court has held that the purpose or motive of the taking and carrying away is immaterial when the victim is capable of giving consent illegal intent or motive is required only when a child or other person incapable of consenting is kidnapped.in re michele,at,internal quotation marks,alterations and citation omitted.therefore,a person can be guilty of kidnapping however good or innocent his motive or intent may otherwise be.oliver,at see also people bruno,kidnapping conviction upheld even where defendant believed that he was engaged to the victim and the victim would not object.in fact,no state of mind or belief is a part of the crime of kidnap p ing,sheasbey,at,and a person can be convicted of kidnapping if he actually,but unreasonably,believed that the victim consented to the movement,see mayberry,at williams,at.accordingly,the intent to cause injury is not an element of simple kidnapping 
nor does simple kidnapping involve the actual infliction of harm upon someone,or an action that affects a protected class of victim.nunez,at.there is no requirement that the kidnapping result in actual injury to the victim,and simple kidnapping convictions under cpc a have been upheld even when the victims have been found to be uninjured.see,people felix,d,kidnapping conviction upheld where defendant kidnapped victim to request a renewal of their relationship and eventually returned her home safely.moreover,while a kidnapping under cpc a could involve a minor victim or other person with a special trust relationship to the defendant,see,in re michele,p d at victim was minor child,it can also involve complete strangers,see,majors,at victim was year old girl without relationship to defendant.
thus,simple kidnapping under cpc a does not categorically have anything in common with the type of crime we have normally held to involve moral turpitude.it can be committed without any intention of harming anyone,it need not result in actual harm,and it does not necessarily involve a protected class of victim.see nunez,at.it is true that the bia and our cases note that some crimes involve moral turpitude because they are intrinsically wrong malum in se.mendoza,at.we have noted,however,that not all malum in se crimes categorically involve moral turpitude.nicanor romero mukasey,cir,overruled on other grounds by marmolejo campos.instead,we have emphasized that both the actus reus and the mens rea must be considered in concert to determine whether the behavior they describe is sufficiently culpable to be labeled morally turpitudinous.id.at.in fact,in concluding that kidnapping for ransom under the federal kidnapping act was a crime of moral turpitude,the bia emphasized that the record of conviction established that the kidnapping had involved ransom.matter of p,at.even in the specific context of a kidnapping conviction,therefore,the bia has acknowledged the importance of considering the presence of a culpable mental state in determining whether the crime is one of moral turpitude.
in sum,simple kidnapping under cpc a does not fall within the types of cases we have previously held are categorical crimes of moral turpitude.moreover,courts in california have applied cpc a to conduct that is not morally turpitudinous.for example,in one case,black students at a college complained about the actions of a football coach in beating a black football player during the course of a game.people apo.members of the black students union demanded to meet with several administrators,who responded that only the president of the college could take action on personnel issues.see id.the students then surrounded the administrators and marched from the physical education building to the administration building,a distance of yards just slightly less than of a mile,so that the administrators could speak with the president of the college regarding the incident.id.at.during the march,some students pushed the administrators,and made threats to make them continue moving.see id.several of the students who participated in the march were convicted of kidnapping.see id.at.their convictions,which were upheld on appeal,demonstrate that simple kidnapping under cpc a will be applied to conduct that,although criminal,is not truly unconscionable such that it meets the moral turpitude standard.the students in apo acted foolishly,no doubt,but their conduct can not be said to involve rather grave acts of baseness or depravity.navarro lopez,at reinhardt,concurring for the majority internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
in a more recent case,the defendant was convicted of kidnapping after he intercepted his year old niece,who had run away to go live with her boyfriend,and drove her back to his home.people.garibay,wl.may,unpublished.the conviction was upheld on appeal.the niece had made abuse allegations against her father,and left home to go live with her boyfriend and his parents.id.at.one night,when she and her boyfriend were returning from dinner with some friends,the defendant,his brother the father of the girl,and two other men intercepted their vehicle.id.at.the father grabbed the girl by the arm,threatened her friends,got her into the car the defendant was driving,and the defendant drove away,taking his brother and niece to his house.id.at.that the defendant,the uncle of the victim,was convicted of simple kidnapping again demonstrates that cpc a is applied to conduct that is not morally turpitudinous.the defendant acted in an unlawful manner,but assisting one brother in bringing back a family member who has run away from home is not conduct we would classify as truly unconscionable such that it meets the moral turpitude standard.
these two cases demonstrate that there is a a realistic probability,not just a theoretical possibility,that california would apply the simple kidnapping statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of the crime.duenas alvarez,at.we have held that t his realistic probability can be established by showing that,in at least one other case,the state courts in fact did apply the statute in the special nongeneric manner.nunez,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.here,california
