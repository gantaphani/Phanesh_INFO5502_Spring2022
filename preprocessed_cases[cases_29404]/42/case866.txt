petitioner stella chukwudumebi emokah,a native and citizen of nigeria,seeks review of a june,decision of immigration judge ij michael straus denying her applications for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to i and an adjustment of status under a see in re emokah,no.a imm.hartford june.the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed the ij decision in an opinion issued on june.see in re emokah,no.a bia june.on appeal,petitioner contends that she did not need a waiver of inadmissibility to adjust her status because her knowing use of a fraudulent surname to obtain a visa did not amount to a willful misrepresentation of a material fact within the meaning of a c i,see note ante text of provision.in the alternative,petitioner contends first,that her possession of an approved visa petition obviated the need for a section i waiver and,second,that if the section i waiver was required,her circumstances were such that the waiver should have been granted.we find these arguments to be without merit but write to clarify that,where an alien whose previous visa application has been denied receives a visa after providing false information about her identity,that conduct constitutes willful misrepresentation of a material fact for purposes of a c i.
background 
petitioner entered the united states in august,on a visa that was valid until february.she married peter emokah,a citizen,in october.emokah filed an visa petition on petitioner behalf in december but withdrew the petition in may based on suspicions that petitioner was already married to someone else in nigeria.in june,the and naturalization service initiated removal proceedings against petitioner on the basis that she had remained in the united states past the expiration of her nonimmigrant visa.four months later,petitioner and peter emokah separated and later divorced.in october,petitioner filed an petition,see ante note,on her own behalf.petitioner then appeared before the ij for a removal hearing in october wherein she conceded her removability but sought a continuance of the removal proceedings to allow for the adjudication of her petition.the ij granted petitioner request for a continuance on this occasion,in june,and again in january.
at a hearing held on june,petitioner counsel informed the ij that the petition had been approved.the ij asked whether petitioner counsel anticipated any issues with petitioner application for adjustment of status and petitioner counsel answered p ossibly one,relating to m isrepresentation at the embassy where petitioner obtained her visa.the ij then adjourned proceedings so that petitioner counsel could file an application for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section i,see note ante.at petitioner fifth appearance before the ij,on may,the ij noted that petitioner counsel had not yet filed the application for a section i waiver on her behalf and reminded petitioner counsel that petitioner bore the burden of proof on the issue of her admissibility.petitioner counsel agreed to submit the application for a section i waiver within ten days.
on june,the ij held a merits hearing on petitioner applications for a waiver of admissibility and adjustment of status.at the hearing,petitioner testified that,prior to taking the name of her citizen husband,her surname was limogou.she also acknowledged that she had provided a different surname oke when applying for her visa in lagos,nigeria.on direct examination,she explained that oke was the surname of a wealthy and nigerian businessman with whom she had been romantically involved for several years.she further explained that she had a child with oke but was not married to him because he was already married to someone else.petitioner testified that,to obtain a visa for travel to the united states,she had gone with oke and their son to the american embassy in lagos.the consular official in charge of visa interviews called them up as ok e family and they were interviewed together.oke stated that the visa was for him and that he was traveling with his family.according to petitioner,because of the bank statements and all the things that he provided,the embassy officials did not ask any further questions.they just said,come tomorrow,pick up your passports by noon.id.these events occurred in,shortly before petitioner first trip to the united states.thereafter,whenever petitioner visa expired,oke would fill out a new visa application on her behalf and take it,along with petitioner passport,to the american embassy in lagos.it was in this way that petitioner obtained the visa on which she traveled to the united states in august.
petitioner further testified that oke had paid for her to visit the united states in,and.her august visit,however,was undertaken without oke knowledge and motivated by her desire to leave him.shortly after arriving in the united states,she met and married peter emokah.nevertheless,she continued to call oke periodically to discuss matters relating to their son,who was living in nigeria with petitioner sister.petitioner testified that these communications,and the surname oke on her passport,caused emokah to suspect that a marriage had been contracted between petitioner and oke.id.at.in response to these suspicions,emokah withdrew the visa petition he had filed on petitioner behalf they separated several months later and subsequently divorced.
petitioner also testified about the hardships she would face if she were returned to nigeria.specifically,she stated that she did not have any prospects for employment and feared retaliation from oke.she also testified that her l ife would not be safe,generally based on country conditions.id.at.petitioner submitted a number of documents to corroborate her testimony.among these were a letter from her father to emokah,reassuring emokah that petitioner was not married to oke but had used his surname in order to obtain a visa for travel to the united states after a prior visa application in her own surname had been rejected and a letter from emokah to the immigration and naturalization service stating that petitioner had told him that she used mr oke name to get her visa because of financial verification purposes.id.at.
at the close of the hearing,the ij issued an oral decision finding that petitioner had committed visa fraud on several occasions by using the name oke when she,in fact,did not have that name and there is some discrepancy as to why she used the name oke.see in re emokah,no.a,at imm.hartford june.evaluating whether petitioner had satisfied the extreme hardship requirement for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section i,the ij determined that c onsidering all the factors,petitioner had not presented sufficient evidence to establish extreme hardship.id.rather,petitioner claim of hardship is generally the hardship that happens based on anyone who departs the united states.id.the ij also concluded that,based on the underlying fraud and the clear discrepancies in the evidence presented by petitioner,the favorable exercise of discretion is not warranted.id.at.accordingly,the ij denied petitioner applications for a waiver of inadmissibility and adjustment of status and ordered petitioner returned to nigeria.
petitioner then appealed to the bia.on appeal she claimed that she did not need to obtain a section i waiver of inadmissibility prior to adjusting her status because her use of oke name on her visa application did not constitute misrepresentation or fraud her possession of an approved visa petition rendered her admissible under a a ii ii obviating the need for a section i waiver and if the section i waiver was required,her circumstances were such that the section i waiver should have been granted.
in an opinion issued on june,the bia explained that 
in our review of the record,we concur with the immigration judge finding that petitioner committed fraud or a willful misrepresentation within the scope of a c i which necessitated a section i waiver.petitioner acknowledged that she used the surname of her child father to facilitate her obtaining a visa and signed the visa application knowing the use of the surname was a willful misrepresentation.
