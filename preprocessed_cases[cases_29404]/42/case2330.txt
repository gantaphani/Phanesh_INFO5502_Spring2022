pedro flores torres,a native and citizen of honduras,seeks asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.torres claims that he was persecuted while a soldier in the honduran army because of his membership in a social,his family,which included four older brothers,three of whom were military deserters.torres asserts that he was tortured and abused as punishment for his brothers actions.on may,immigration judge carlos cuevas declined torres primary requests for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture,granting instead his alternative prayer for voluntary departure.the ij found that torres lacked credibility because of,first,inconsistencies and omissions in torres written application for asylum and his testimony at a series of immigration hearings,and second,torres inability to establish the requisite nexus between torres mistreatment and his family unfavorable reputation in the honduran military.the board of immigration appeals summarily affirmed the ij decision in an order issued february.we find that the ij credibility determination was tainted due to the ij improper conduct during the hearings and that there was not substantial evidence to support the ij conclusions.we vacate the decisions of the bia and ij and remand for further proceedings.
pedro flores torres entered the united states without inspection in october and submitted a written application for asylum and withholding of removal one year later.in december,the department of homeland security charged torres with being removable as an unadmitted alien pursuant to a a i.at a series of immigration hearings held in april and may,torres admitted he was removable but renewed his requests for asylum and withholding of removal,as well as relief under the convention against torture.torres written application,accompanying affidavits,and testimony by torres and his brother juan carlos provide the following facts.
a.the flores torres family 
from to,guadalupe torres gave birth to eight children in comayagua,a village in honduras.five of these children were boys.the oldest son,mario noe,was born in.the next three elias,gerardo isaac,and juan born in,and,respectively.the youngest child,pedro alfredo,is the petitioner in this matter and was born in.the children father left the family shortly after pedro birth.
pedro four older brothers were conscripted into the honduran navy,where each spent at least some time at the naval base in amapala,near the el salvadoran border.while serving,each of the four older sons endured brutal mistreatment at the hands of his superiors.three of the four ultimately deserted the navy to escape these abuses.because pedro claims are based largely on his brothers experiences within the honduran military,those experiences merit some discussion.
mario is the only torres son not considered a military deserter.mario served for approximately one year,during which time his arm was broken and his ear punctured,resulting in permanent hearing damage.he escaped,only to be captured and put back into active service.at one point,mario,luis,and gerardo were all serving in the honduran military at the same time.this prompted the navy,due in part to heavy lobbying by gerardo,to release mario pursuant to a honduran law that prohibited any one family from having more than two members in the military.
the second son,luis,suffered two broken arms from a severe beating with a baton and fled the navy soon thereafter.soldiers found him in a hospital and returned him to duty.after enduring further mistreatment,luis escaped again,this time with a broken leg.when the military found luis the second time,it determined that his disabled condition rendered him useless to serve and designated him a deserter.
the actions of the third son,gerardo,were particularly aggravating to the military.in addition to lobbying for mario discharge,gerardo refused to commit war crimes,citing his christian faith to explain his unwillingness to kill his innocent countrymen.gerardo was imprisoned for fifteen days,deprived of food,and savagely beaten.as further punishment,his commander made gerardo walk through a field of land mines while the commander lobbed grenades in his direction,one of which tore away one of gerardo legs and ravaged his back with shrapnel.his commander left gerardo to die in the mine field,but gerardo compatriots helped him escape alive.faced with what he felt was a certain death if he returned to his unit,gerardo deserted.
juan carlos,only two years pedro senior,was conscripted into the honduran navy in at the age of seventeen,one year before he was of legal age to serve.he was singled out for abuse because of gerardo exploits.once,when juan carlos fell during a run,a superior officer slashed his leg with a bayonet,inflicting an injury that required surgery.following the operation,doctors told juan carlos that he needed two months to recover instead,he was forced back into training after only fifteen days.his unhealed leg made it impossible for him to perform,and the premature exercise reopened his wound.juan carlos deserted in.
today,two of the brothers,mario and luis,live secretly in honduras,afraid of military retribution for their family history.gerardo and juan carlos both escaped to the united states.gerardo was granted asylum in and died one year later,at the age of,from brain cancer.juan carlos was granted asylum in and is now a united states citizen.he resides in elkhart,indiana,near two of his sisters,both of whom are legal permanent residents.
as a result of these disturbing circumstances,repeated not once but four times,the tale of the flores torres brothers has apparently gained some notoriety within honduran military circles the flores torres clan is known as a family of deserters.juan carlos was the first son punished by the military in retribution for his brothers exploits.his past persecution on account of his family formed the basis of his successful asylum claim.as we will discuss below,pedro,the youngest son and the last to serve in the military,also was forced to pay for the perceived offenses of his four brothers.
pedro flores torres tenure in the honduran army 
born september,pedro alfredo flores torres attended school in comayagua until age eleven.for the next eleven years,he painted automobiles for car repair shops,earning money to help support his mother.
pedro stated in both his written asylum application and his testimony before the immigration judge that in february,two honduran soldiers left notice at guadalupe home that pedro had hours to report for military duty.although military service is no longer compulsory in honduras,pedro testified that he felt he did not have any other option but to enlist.if he did not,pedro believed that he would be found and beaten,or worse,would simply disappear.the next day,pedro reported to the primer battalon de artilleria,an inland army base near the town of zambrano,where he became a member of the artillery corps.
according to pedro testimony,upon reporting for duty he was confronted by his commanding officer,colonel luis martinez.pedro testified that martinez said to him,i was waiting you are the last one in the family.
pedro claimed that he was subjected almost immediately to physical and mental abuse from his above and beyond anything suffered by other soldiers.pedro stated that officers and other soldiers called him degrading names and violently beat him.according to his affidavit,pedro fellow soldiers and a superior officer told pedro that his mistreatment was because of his brothers.
pedro mounted two unsuccessful escape attempts during his first six months of service.the first,which came approximately five months into pedro tenure,ended with a savage beating at the hands of military guards who apprehended pedro in the act of fleeing.the second came only a week later and again ended with a beating from a guard baton.following the second attempt,pedro was stripped of his clothing and locked in solitary confinement,a place pedro called the hole.
in his affidavit,pedro said the hole was what hell must be like.a darkened room measuring one meter on all sides,the hole provided no space for its captive to lie down.there was little ventilation,and the heat was intense.because he could not leave,pedro was forced to use the hole to relieve himself.for forty days,pedro remained trapped,nude,in his own excrement the stench was overwhelming.during those forty days,pedro was given beans and tortillas once a day,as well as two small servings of water.when he finally emerged,pedro had lost forty pounds,of his body weight.
pedro discussed the name calling,the beatings,the two failed escape attempts,and the forty days of solitary confinement in both his written asylum application and his testimony.during his testimony before the immigration judge,however,pedro discussed several additional examples of abuse for the first time.
in the first,colonel martinez ordered pedro stripped nude and placed in a large,barrel.the water was high enough that only pedro nose remained above the surface.pedro stated that his first time in the water barrel occurred one month after he enlisted the last was in july,one month before he successfully escaped.on questioning by the immigration judge,pedro testified that he was subjected to the water barrel on approximately eighty different occasions,and that he was sometimes held in the barrel for as long as ten hours other times he was held overnight.he further testified that fifteen times medics had to pump his chest when he was pulled from the water barrel.martinez told pedro that the water barrel was to pay for the escape of his brothers.
the second relevant chain of events that emerged during pedro testimony involved mock killings at the hands of colonel martinez.pedro stated that martinez would tell him,i going to kill you,place a pistol to pedro head,and pull the trigger.the gun,unbeknownst to pedro,was unloaded.pedro testified that martinez said this was to make pedro pay for his brothers desertion.the first of many times these mock executions occurred was two to three weeks after pedro joined the army.
the final example of mistreatment that pedro discussed for the first time during his immigration hearings was colonel martinez forcing him to run nude in front of his unit.according to pedro,one month into his time with the army,martinez forced pedro to run completely naked during a training run,with nothing covering him but a rifle slung across his back and a second rifle that he carried in his arms.he was even denied footwear.pedro testified that martinez ordered his soldiers to p ut this man to run until he falls dead.pedro also stated,in testimony that was often jumbled because of language difficulties and the ij frequent interruptions,that martinez told him,y ou have to pay for what your brothers did for their escape because they violated.they defy the army.pedro stated that this occurred on numerous occasions.
seventeen months after he joined the honduran army,pedro succeeded in escaping during a military celebration.after a brief visit with his mother,whom the military had prevented pedro from seeing during his time in the army,pedro began his journey north to seek refuge with his family in the united states.he now lives near his brother and two sisters in elkhart.
prior decisions by the immigration judge and the board of immigration appeals 
immigration judge cuevas held a series of three hearings on april,april,and may.the ij played an active role in the hearings,frequently interjecting himself into the testimony.at the conclusion of the proceedings,the ij issued an oral decision denying pedro requests for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture.the ij based his decision on what he found to be pedro lack of credibility.the ij granted pedro alternative request for voluntary departure.the bia summarily affirmed the ij decision in a written opinion issued on february.
ii.analysis 
an ij decision to deny a petition for asylum and withholding of removal is a finding of fact that we review for substantial evidence.capric ashcroft,cir.we must affirm the immigration court decision if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d internal quotation marks omitted.we will reverse only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion.ciorba ashcroft,cir quoting bradvica ins,cir.when,as here,the bia adopts the reasoning of the ij,we review the ij decision under this deferential standard.ursachi ins,cir.
in this case,torres pursued three alternative paths to avoid removal from the united states asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture.below,we first discuss the standards for these claims.the ij decision in all three of these areas hinged on his determination that pedro evidence lacked credibility,a finding that we review in depth in the final portion of our discussion.
standards for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture 
the ij first rejected torres petition for asylum.a petitioner for asylum bears the burden of proving that he is a refugee within the meaning of a.see also a.specifically,torres must demonstrate that,because of his race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,he either was the victim of past persecution or maintains a fear of future persecution.oryakhil mukasey,cir see also a b.even if an individual satisfies these requirements,he is not guaranteed asylum.final asylum decisions rest in the discretion of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security.jun ying wang gonzales,cir see also b a.
the ij also declined torres second request,which was for withholding of removal pursuant to b.to succeed in this claim,torres must establish a clear probability of persecution if returned to honduras.see prela ashcroft,cir.in other words,torres must show that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted upon return to his native country.see id.as with claims for asylum,the persecution here must be on account of one of the five statutorily defined grounds.see also b.the clear probability of persecution standard is a higher threshold than that for asylum.bevc ins,cir.thus,because torre attempt at asylum failed,his claim for withholding of removal had to fail as well.see toptchev ins,cir.
successful applicants for either asylum or withholding of removal must show that they have been,or will be,the victim of persecution.we have described persecution as punishment or the infliction of harm for political,religious,or other reasons that this country does not recognize as legitimate.de souza ins,cir.acts of persecution must rise above mere harassment,roman ins,cir,and include threats to life or freedom,as well as threatening violence or physical abuse,ciorba,at.as examples of persecution,we have cited detention,arrest,interrogation,prosecution,imprisonment,illegal searches,confiscation of property,surveillance,beatings,or torture.mitev ins,cir.
as a third and final avenue to avoiding removal,torres also requested protection under the convention against torture.see c.to succeed,torres must prove that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured within the meaning of the convention if he returns to honduras.see prela,at see also c.torture is any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.a.the ij in this case declined torres request for relief under the convention against torture.
b.the ij adverse credibility determination 
the ij rejected all three of torres asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against because the ij found that torres evidence lacked credibility.
one of an immigration judge primary functions is to assess the credibility of an applicant evidence.capric,at.when making a credibility determination,an ij evaluates the applicant claims only for internal consistency,detail,and plausibility.id.the ij credibility finding is often paramount b ecause direct authentication or verification of an alien testimony evidence is typically very difficult and often impossible.id.in lieu of direct evidence,an alien credible testimony,by itself,is generally sufficient to sustain the alien burden of proof.lin ashcroft,cir uwase ashcroft,cir see also a.if the ij finds an alien testimony to be incredible,however,then the alien must provide either a convincing explanation for the noted discrepancies in his evidence or credible evidence that corroborates his claims.capric,at.
if the ij credibility determination is supported by specific,cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding,then this court will be highly deferential in its review of that conclusion.capric,at internal quotation marks omitted see also hysi gonzales,cir we give great deference to an ij credibility determinations so long as they are supported by cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.emphasis added ahmad ins,cir.we will not,however,defer to credibility determinations drawn from insufficient or incomplete evidence,nor shall we uphold adverse credibility determinations based on speculation or conjecture,rather than on evidence in the record.korniejew ashcroft,cir international quotation marks and citations omitted.
in addition,we have recognized that an ij improper behavior while conducting an immigration hearing can render his credibility determinations unreliable.see,huang gonzales,cir.the record reveals that the ij conduct had that effect here.thus,before beginning our substantive review of the specific reasons the ij gave in support of his adverse credibility determination,we find it necessary to discuss our disapproval of the ij conduct during torres hearings.
the immigration judge conduct during the hearings 
for purposes of developing the record,an immigration judge may question an applicant for asylum during a hearing.hasanaj ashcroft,cir.in so doing,the ij may not demonstrate impatience,hostility,or a predisposition against the applicant claim.huang,at.we have overturned an ij credibility findings when the ij does more than ask a few questions,but instead actively interject s himself into the proceedings,far exceed s his role of developing the record,and at times assume s an inquisitorial role.id.that is exactly what the ij did here.
the transcripts of torres immigration hearings are littered with lengthy discourses by the ij.in fact,it appears from the transcripts that direct questioning by the ij occupied more than half of the hearings.the ij impatience with torres was glaring,even through the emotionless pages of the hearing transcript.the ij grew frustrated with the language barrier,a problem the ij exacerbated by his unwillingness to give torres the time he needed to compose his thoughts into meaningful sentences.instead,the ij assumed the role of inquisitor,incessantly interrupting torres while he tried to assimilate his responses.the ij questioning was so pervasive that it was often difficult to determine who was representing the federal government with more ij or the government attorney.
at times the ij comments crossed the line.during one particularly troubling exchange concerning the occasions on which martinez forced torres to run nude in front of his unit,the ij,noting the heat in honduras,said,i guess my point is that if it was hot outside,you rather run with less clothes,not naked.but you rather run with less clothes because it more comfortable.at.the ij seemed to be implying that colonel martinez,by forcing torres to run nude in extreme heat,was actually doing him a favor.
at other times during the hearings,the ij drew wholly unsubstantiated comparisons between service in the honduran and american militaries.in the course of his questioning,the ij referred to boot camp and drill sergeants,common american military concepts that were clearly unfamiliar to torres.at one point,the ij referenced a signal man in a question to torres.when torres counsel asked the ij to clarify the term,the ij replied simply,he would know.
we find the ij conduct in this case analogous to the ij conduct in huang.there,the petitioner,a chinese citizen,sought asylum based on her fear of persecution for her membership in an illegal catholic church.id.at.during the petitioner immigration hearing,the ij aggressively questioned her,interrupted her,mischaracterized her testimony,and relied upon his personal knowledge of the catholic faith in reaching his decision.id.at.we concluded that the ij excessive role in the questioning of the petitioner,his improper conduct during the hearing,and his reliance on personal beliefs rather than information contained in the record served to taint the ij credibility finding.id.at.as such,we found the tainted credibility finding unsupported by specific,cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding and remanded the case for further proceedings.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
although we do not believe,as torres argues,that the ij conduct was so egregious as to violate torres due process rights,we do find that the ij overactive role during the hearings,his demonstrated impatience,his improper lines of questioning,and his reliance on personal knowledge beyond the facts in the record tainted his credibility findings.this conclusion,by itself,is sufficient to remand the case.see id.because the ij made additional errors in his analysis,however,we turn briefly to his substantive findings.
the ij based his adverse credibility determination on three basic grounds first,alleged inconsistencies surrounding the circumstances attending torres enlistment in the honduran army second,torres purported inability to provide the nexus for the mistreatment and third,a series of three events that torres omitted from his written asylum application and discussed for the first time during his testimony before the ij.we consider each of these grounds in turn.
the circumstances attending torres enlistment in the honduran army 
in his opinion,the ij focused at length on the circumstances surrounding torres decision to join the honduran army.the ij found particularly concerning torres alleged confusion about whether military service in honduras was voluntary or compulsory,apparent inconsistencies in torres testimony regarding his level of knowledge of the mistreatment endured by his brothers during their military service,and torres inability to explain why the military,if it was so intent on punishing the flores torres family,waited until torres was years years older than the legal age of forcing his enlistment.for the following reasons,we conclude,first,that torres motivations for enlisting in the honduran army are irrelevant to his claims of past persecution and second,that the ij erred in looking for evidence of torres subjective fear of past persecution.
first,we find that torres motivations behind his decision to join the honduran army are irrelevant to his asylum application,and,as such,can not form the basis for an adverse credibility determination.we have frequently overturned an ij credibility determination if it is based on immaterial or inconsequential facts.see,dong gonzales,cir georgis ashcroft,cir uwase,at see also korniejew,at recognizing that a minor inconsistency alone was not enough to support an adverse credibility determination before finding additional facts to support upholding the ij finding.what matters to torres claim is whether he was persecuted on account of his familial ties once he became a soldier,not why he joined the honduran army in the first place.the ij reliance on these facts was misplaced.there is no logical connection between torres reasons for enlisting and his claims of mistreatment while he served.given the controlling questions of this case,such facts do not constitute a valid,cogent reason for a negative credibility finding.uwase,at see also korniejew,at w e remind those evaluating administrative records that adverse credibility determinations should not be grounded in trivial details or easily explained discrepancies as recounted above,an adverse credibility determination must be supported by specific,cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.quoting ahmad,at.
second,to the extent that the ij considered whether the circumstances surrounding torres enlistment in the honduran military provided a basis for his subjective fear of persecution in the past,that analysis was in error.to establish a successful claim for asylum,an applicant must show either that he was the victim of past persecution or that he has a fear of future persecution.oryakhil,at see also a b.a fear of future persecution must be both objectively and subjectively reasonable to be.kllokoqi gonzales,cir see also b.a victim of past persecution need not show any objective or subjective that he was in fact persecuted.see bolante mukasey,cir unless a petitioner establishes past persecution,a petitioner must show that the fear of future persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.in this case,torres seeks to prove that the honduran military persecuted him in the past nonetheless,the ij attempted to determine whether torres subjectively feared any persecution by surrendering himself to the military.at.if,as the ij opinion seems to indicate,the ij was looking to these facts to establish torres subjective fear of persecution in the past,that analysis was incorrect.
the nexus for torres mistreatment as a precondition to credibility 
as another basis for his adverse credibility determination,the ij stated that t he difficulty with crediting the respondent testimony is his inability to provide the nexus for the mistreatment.at.as we discuss below,this analysis erected an insurmountable burden in torres quest for asylum and,as such,was in error.
an applicant for asylum must demonstrate a nexus between his alleged persecution and one of five protected grounds.wang,at reno,cir.a successful asylee must show that he was persecuted because of his race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,at.our prior opinions make it clear that we consider family to be a cognizable social group within the meaning of the immigration law.iliev ins,cir discussing this court history on this issue.our sister circuits share this view.see,ashcroft,cir jie lin ashcroft,cir gebremichael ins,cir see also in re acosta,bia holding that a social group consists of persons sharing a common,immutable characteristic such as sex,color,or kinship ties,overruled on other grounds by in re mogharrabi,bia.
although an individual seeking asylum must prove the requisite nexus to his claims of past or future persecution before his claim for asylum will be successful,he need fact,he generally this nexus as a precondition to credibility.one must be careful not to confuse the ultimate the petitioner qualifies as a refugee with the credibility analysis,which looks only at consistency,detail,and plausibility.capric,at a credibility analysis should not be confused with a burden of proof analysis.
in stating that t he difficulty with crediting the respondent testimony is his inability to provide the nexus for the mistreatment,the ij conflated the nexus and credibility questions this placed torres in a situation.torres attempted to prove the nexus for his mistreatment through his testimony,which the ij found incredible yet before the ij would credit torres testimony,he required a nexus for torres mistreatment.requiring a nexus for the mistreatment as a precursor for credibility was legal error.
even assuming,arguendo,that the ij did not err by requiring a nexus for torres mistreatment as a prerequisite to finding him credible,a proper analysis of the record shows that torres clearly did establish such a nexus.the ij conclusions to the we reiterate are tainted by the ij improper without support in the record,are irrelevant,or are based on the ij speculation and,as such,do not provide a proper basis for an adverse credibility determination.see georgis,at korniejew,at.
torres testimony is rife with examples that provide his family history as the nexus for his mistreatment.throughout the hearing,torres noted the numerous occasions on which colonel martinez,his primary persecutor,referenced torres family while inflicting harm on torres.in at least one instance when martinez placed an unloaded pistol to torres head and pulled the trigger,torres testified that martinez said,you are going to pay for your brothers desertion.you are going to pay for his escape because you are the last one that you we sic have.at.according to torres testimony,martinez told torres that he placed torres in the water barrel because i had to pay for the escape of my brothers.at.torres testified that when martinez forced torres to run nude in front of his unit,martinez ordered,put this man to run until he falls dead because you have to pay for what your brothers did for their escape because they violated.they defy the army.at.torres also stated,i was so afraid that i was going to stay in the army and i was afraid to die in there.because colonel luis martinez told me that i was never going to leave that place because i was going to pay for my brothers escape because i was the last one that remained.at.
the ij disregarded these statements and numerous others like them scattered throughout torres testimony.instead,the ij focused on purported inconsistencies regarding martinez involvement in,and motivation for,the mistreatment of torres.in particular,the ij questioned why martinez,if he played such a pivotal role in torres mistreatment,was not named in torres written asylum application why martinez would say he knew torres mother,while guadalupe had no recollection of martinez the plausibility of torres story about his family military reputation in light of the different branches of military involved,the distance between the implicated military bases,and the length of time between the service of torres brothers and his own and whether torres mistreatment was punishment for his poor performance and his improper acts,not for his family affronts to the honduran military.none of these provides a sound basis for the ij adverse credibility finding.
this court has stated that we will not automatically yield to the ij conclusions when they are drawn from insufficient or incomplete evidence.georgis,at.similarly,we will not uphold credibility determinations based on speculation or conjecture,rather than on evidence in the record.korniejew,at quoting gao ashcroft,cir.
keeping these things in mind,we turn first to martinez purported absence from torres affidavit.other circuits have recognized that the failure to file an application form that was as complete as might be desired can not,without more,properly serve as the basis for a finding of a lack of credibility.ins,cir.a reading of the affidavit in this case reveals that although it does not mention martinez by name,it does reference the role of torres supervisors and officers in his mistreatment.in the affidavit,torres noted that he was singled out for mistreatment by his supervisors.at.he also stated that an officer who was training me told me directly that i received mistreatment because my last name was flores torres.at.we find this to be more than ample specificity for the affidavit and in no way contradictory with torres subsequent testimony.there is no basis here for an adverse credibility determination.
next,we find it irrelevant to torres claim whether martinez knew guadalupe torres.again,what matters is whether martinez knew of torres brothers and their history in the honduran military.martinez relationship,or lack thereof,with guadalupe has little or no bearing on this.further,we find the two martinez knew guadalupe but that guadalupe had no memory of inconsistent.it is not clear from the testimony whether martinez merely knew of guadalupe perhaps because of her status as the mother of the flores torres boys,or whether he claimed to know her personally.in addition,it is perfectly plausible that one party to an encounter has memory of the meeting while the other does not.
third,the ij speculated that martinez did not know the history of the flores torres family.without this information,martinez would have no reason to persecute torres on account of his membership in that family.in reaching this conclusion,the ij found persuasive that torres s
