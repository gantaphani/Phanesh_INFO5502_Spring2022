appellant jesus mortera appeals the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia dismissing his petition for adjustment of status under i a i on the ground that he is inadmissible to the united states under a c i i.we affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
mortera is a native and citizen of mexico.he entered the united states illegally for the first time in november of.on march,he married margarita mortera,who was then a lawful permanent resident and has since become a naturalized citizen.shortly after their marriage,mortera filed a petition with the immigration and naturalization service ins for an immigrant visa for her husband.this petition was received by the ins on april.
at some undetermined point after november,mortera left the united states and illegally reentered on june.nearly a year later,on april,mortera was convicted,on his guilty plea,by the united states district court for the northern district of texas,of violating a by illegally entering the united states without inspection on june.on may,the immigration and customs enforcement ice agency of the department of homeland security dhs served mortera with a notice to appear nta,alleging that he was subject to removal under a a i as an alien present in the united states without having been admitted or paroled 
in response to the nta,mortera appeared before an immigration judge ij on september.mortera maintained that the nta was in error insofar as it alleged that he illegally entered the united states on june.through counsel,he contended that his first and only illegal entry occurred in late and his plea to the contrary before the district court was inadvertent.with the consent of the dhs,the ij amended the nta by interlineation to reflect mortera representation that the operative date should be in,not.the ij then found mortera subject to removal in light of his admission that he had in fact entered illegally in.mortera then requested permission to adjust his status under i a i to that of a lawful permanent resident on the basis of his wife pending visa application for him.the ij granted mortera a recess to pursue that option.
mortera next appeared before the ij on august,this time with a valid spousal visa,which ice had approved on march.the dhs contended that mortera was not eligible to adjust his status under section i a i because he was inadmissible under a c i i.section a c i i states that aliens are inadmissible if they have more than one year of unlawful presence in the united states and thereafter illegally enter or reenter the united states without being admitted mortera,the dhs argued,fell under section a c i i because he entered illegally in november of,and then reentered illegally on june,after he had accumulated more than one year of illegal presence.the dhs took the position before the ij that an alien subject to section a c i i was ineligible to adjust his status under section i a i to that of a lawful permanent resident.
mortera responded once again stating that his conviction did not accurately reflect his conduct because he only once entered the united states illegally and that entry occurred in,so he was not subject to section a c i i because he did not enter the united states without being admitted after he had been unlawfully present in the united states for more than one year.the ij,now faced with an objection from the dhs,was no longer willing to credit mortera account of the facts,and ruled that mortera was collaterally estopped from denying the truth of the material allegations underlying his conviction.the ij then ruled in favor of the dhs,concluding that mortera was inadmissible under section a c i i and,as a consequence,was ineligible to adjust his status under section i to that of a lawful permanent resident.the ij also denied mortera the opportunity to remove himself voluntarily,deciding he was untrustworthy because he had fraudulently used someone else green card to obtain work.
mortera then appealed to the bia,which,on march,affirmed the decision of the ij and dismissed the appeal.in affirming the ij,the bia drew two important conclusions of law i a i,which allows certain physically present aliens who entered the united states without inspection to adjust their status to that of a lawful permanent resident,applies only to aliens whose sole statutory ground of inadmissibility is established merely by their having made a single entry without inspection,those who are rendered inadmissible only by a a i,see note supra and the e xcept as otherwise provided clause of a does not waive the inadmissibility created by section a c i i see note,supra and thereby permit such an inadmissible alien to adjust his or her status under section i a i.it is from this disposition that mortera now appeals

discussion 
mortera wants to adjust his status under i a i from that of an illegal alien to that of a lawful permanent resident.section i,titled adjustment of status of certain aliens physically present in united states,provides in relevant part 
notwithstanding the provisions of subsections a and c of this section,an alien physically present in the united states 
i entered the united states without inspection or 
ii is within one of the classes enumerated in subsection c of this section and 
b who is the beneficiary of a spousal visa issued under d 
may apply to the attorney general for the adjustment of his or her status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
the attorney general may then grant the application if,inter alia,the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the united states for permanent residence.i a emphasis added.
the government does not dispute that mortera is physically present in the united states or that he is the beneficiary of a valid spousal visa.the government maintains,however,that the attorney general can not lawfully adjust mortera status because,as the bia determined,section a c i i renders him inadmissible to the united states.
the bia concluded,as the government now argues,that mortera is indeed inadmissible under section a c i i.section a c,titled aliens unlawfully present after previous immigration violations,states that any alien who has been unlawfully present in the united states for an aggregate period of more than year,and who enters or attempts to reenter the united states without being admitted is inadmissible.a c i i emphasis added see note above.the government contends that the bia,in ruling mortera inadmissible,was simply applying the law in a manner consistent with its plain language because mortera had accumulated more than one year of unlawful presence and he thereafter committed an illegal reentry on june.
mortera does not contend that section a c i i does not apply to in effect concedes that it rather argues that the except as otherwise provided prefatory language in a see note above implicitly waives this ground of inadmissibility for purposes of rendering him eligible for an adjustment of status under section i a i.section a states at the outset that e xcept as otherwise provided in this chapter,aliens who are inadmissible under the following paragraphs are ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the united states.emphasis added.this except as otherwise provided language,mortera contends,was inserted by congress to instruct courts that conflicts between section a and any other provision of the immigration and nationality act ina,should be resolved in favor of the other provision.see,black law dictionary ed defining a savings clause as a statutory provision exempting from coverage something that would otherwise be included.mortera contends that just such a conflict exists in this case because section i a i provides for the adjustment of status by a physically present illegal alien like himself who entered the united states without inspection whereas section a c i defines him as inadmissible and therefore disqualifies him from adjusting his status.he argues that in this context the savings clause acts as a waiver of his inadmissibility under section a c i,thereby giving effect to the otherwise conflicting provision of section i a i.
the general thrust of mortera argument has some force,as applied to the ground of inadmissibility specified in a a i entry without inspection see note,supra,as the government has recognized.if being inadmissible by virtue of section a a i entry without itself precluded an alien from applying for adjustment of status under section i a i allowing such application by aliens who entered the united states without inspection then section i a i would be a wholly inoperative nullity.in an effort to avoid treating section i a i as a nullity,the ins implemented a policy under which an alien inadmissibility under section a a i would not of itself render the alien ineligible to apply for adjustment of status under section i a i.the ninth circuit recently summarized the history and rationale of this policy 
the ins itself has recognized the contradiction created by the statutory terms in a a and i.in a legal opinion issued by the ins office of general counsel on february,the agency found that section a a did not create a statutory bar to adjustment of status,stating that,
based on our review of the relevant legislative history of section i,it is our opinion that congress goals in enacting section i of the act would not be achieved were the service to deem entrants without inspection inadmissible when they otherwise qualify for adjustment of status under section i of the act.
couns.mem,request for legal opinion the impact of the act on section i of the act,quoted in interpreter releases,ins general counsel issues important opinion on ewi eligibility for adjustment,march.the legal opinion reached this result by focusing on the savings clause to section a,which precedes the list of classes of inadmissible aliens by stating that the following classes are inadmissible e xcept as otherwise provided in this chapter.section a emphasis added.this ins legal opinion suggests that section a a does not bar illegal entrants from receiving adjustment of status as a matter of law.
the ins confirmed the applicability of this interpretation in a guidance memorandum issued to all field directors and officers by the ins associate commissioner.see memorandum by louis crocetti,ins comm r may,reprinted in bender immigration bulletin,june,this new ground of inadmissibility a a does not disqualify aliens present in the united states without admission or parole from adjustment of status under section i of the act see also immigration law and procedure,vol,b,section a a is trumped by a section i filing where it is permissible.
thus,section a a is not a ground of inadmissibility that would categorically bar petitioner application for adjustment of status.
ashcroft,cir see also interpreter releases march,interpreter releases july,explaining the legislative purpose and histories of section various subsections.
the bia essentially took this position in denying adjustment of status to mortera,stating that section i a i was meant to provide a waiver for aliens who entered without inspection aliens who are inadmissible under section a a i,not for aliens with multiple illegal entries as described under section a c i i of the act.
the precise reach of section i a i is an implicit statutory ambiguity the executive branch is authorized to fill.when congress has left an implicit ambiguity such as this one,the question before us is simply whether the decision of the bia is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron.at.in answering this question,we consider only whether the decision is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the immigration and nationality act.id.we may not substitute our own preference for a reasonable alternative formulated by the bia.id passenger boston me,d judicial deference to reasonable interpretations by an agency of a statute that it administers is a dominant,principle of federal law.citations omitted.the specific chevron issue in this case is whether the bia was acting arbitrarily when it refused to apply section i a i to mortera inadmissibility under section a c i i in the same way it would have applied section i a i to him if he were inadmissible only by reason of section a a i.
to answer this question,it is useful to review the history of these three provisions.section i was enacted in,b.under the version of section then effective,an alien who was physically present in the united states pursuant to an entry without inspection could adjust his or her status under section i a i to that of a lawful permanent resident because section did not define such an alien as being inadmissible see prior to april,when,c became effective interpreter releases march,appendix ii at.this changed on april,when the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira of took effect and amended a a i into its present form,which does define aliens who have entered without inspection as inadmissible,c.the ins reasoned that the except as otherwise provided clause of section a allowed i a i to continue to apply to aliens who had merely entered without inspection because to conclude otherwise would mean that congress,in amending section a a,intended to render section i a i superfluous and thereby work a major change in federal immigration policy by excluding all aliens who had entered without inspection from adjusting their status.
it is doubtful that this was what congress intended because,tellingly,congress did not repeal section i a i when it amended section a a on september,as part of iirira and in fact,as part of an omnibus appropriations bill,revised it on the same day in small ways such as reformulating the surcharge for adjusting status.see,a,september,substituting in i for five times the fee required for the processing of applications under this section.in addition,the legislative history establishes that the rationale for the amendment to section a a was to eliminate certain procedural advantages some aliens acquired by entering illegally rather than taking the lawful route.interpreter releases march,appendix ii at citing,inter alia,matter of patel,bia and matter of,bia.the purpose of the iirira change to section a a,in other words,was not to preclude all aliens who had entered without inspection from adjusting their status.after careful consideration of iirira implications,the ins steered a middle course,adopting the position that the except as otherwise provided clause of section a in effect waived the ground of inadmissibility created by section a a.as a consequence of this waiver,some aliens who had entered without inspection,who had been eligible to adjust their status after and prior to the iirira amendment,would still be able to adjust their status.
mortera contends that the bia,which rendered its decision in accordance with this policy,was acting arbitrarily when it refused to treat section i as a waiver of his inadmissibility under section a c i i,which was created by iirira and has no analogue.he in effect argues that there is no salient distinction between sections a a and a c i,and reasons that if,through section a except as otherwise provided clause,section i a i waives the inadmissibility created by section a a i,then it should ipso facto also waive the admissibility created by section a c i.
mortera finds support for his position in the ninth circuit recent decision.the court considered,inter alia,whether aliens inadmissib
