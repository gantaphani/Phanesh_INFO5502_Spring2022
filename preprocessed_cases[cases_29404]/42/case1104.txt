mark anthony johnson johnson,appeals from a judgment of conviction and sentence on a indictment charging him with reentering the united states after deportation for an aggravated felony,in violation of a and b.the judgment was entered after a trial on stipulated facts in the united states district court for the southern district of new york jones.prior to trial,johnson had moved to dismiss the indictment,claiming that the order of deportation was unlawful by reason of the erroneous advice of an immigration judge.the district court rejected the claim and found that johnson had failed to fulfill the statutory requirements for a collateral challenge to the deportation order.
background 
johnson is a native and citizen of jamaica who entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident on january.prior to his deportation in august,johnson had been convicted of two felonies on february,he was convicted in new york state supreme court,kings county,for attempted sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.this conviction arose from the sale of crack cocaine to a new york city police department undercover officer.for this offense,johnson was sentenced to a term of imprisonment and to a term of probation.then,while on probation,he was convicted in new york state supreme court,nassau county,of aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle in the first degree.this conviction apparently was predicated upon the operation of an automobile following license suspension for failure to pay traffic tickets.for that offense,johnson was sentenced to a probation term of five years.
upon his arrival in the united states on january,after a trip to jamaica,johnson was apprehended at the airport by agents of the immigration and naturalization service ins in a notice to appear nta issued by the ins on the same date,he was charged with being removable as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony after admission,pursuant to a a iii of the immigration and nationality act ina.a superseding nta was filed on february,classifying johnson as an arriving alien and charging him with being removable as an alien convicted of violating a controlled substance law,pursuant to ina a a i ii.he was also charged with being an alien whom a consular officer or the attorney general had reason to believe to be an illicit trafficker in a controlled substance,pursuant to ina a c i.
responding to the nta,johnson first appeared by counsel before an immigration judge ij assigned to conduct johnson deportation hearing.in compliance with the request for briefing by the ij,counsel for johnson submitted a memorandum arguing that johnson was eligible for cancellation of removal as well as for the discretionary relief of waiver of deportation.the government filed a memorandum in opposition,contending that johnson did not meet the statutory requirements for cancellation of removal and that,by reason of amendments to the ina,discretionary relief from deportation was no longer available.
the amendments referred to came in the form of two statutes enacted by congress in.the first was the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat,amending c.section d of the aedpa eliminated the discretionary waivers of deportation for those aliens deportable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony or drug offense.the second statute was the illegal immigration reform and immigration responsibility act iirira,stat.section of the iirira repealed section c of the immigration and nationality act of,stat.section c of the ina,c repealed,had provided the attorney general with broad discretion,which he had delegated to the board of immigration appeals,to waive deportation of aliens who had accrued seven years of lawful residence in the united states.immigration judges were constrained to exercise that discretion by balancing the alien undesirability as a permanent resident against the social and humane considerations presented in his behalf.matter of marin,wl bia see lovell ins,cir.
the legislation replaced the section c provision for discretionary relief from deportation with a more strict procedure designated cancellation of removal.see swaby ashcroft,cir.this procedure,enacted in ina a,a,authorizes the attorney general to cancel removal of certain permanent aliens who are deportable from,or inadmissible to,the united states if three conditions are met.the alien must have been lawfully admitted as a permanent resident for at least five years have resided in the united states continuously for seven years after admission in any status and have not been convicted of any aggravated felony.swaby,at.
by an interlocutory decision and order dated may,the ij denied the relief sought by johnson.finding that his state conviction fit within the definition of aggravated felony,see ina a b,a b,the ij concluded that johnson was not prima facie eligible for cancellation of removal.the ij also concluded that johnson eligibility was barred by his failure to reside continuously in the united states after he had been admitted in any status,since the continuity had been interrupted by johnson drug conviction and incarceration.as to johnson claim for eligibility for a section c waiver,the ij concluded that this form of relief has been repealed by the enactment of the amendments to the ina wrought by the iirira of,sections b and d thereunder.counsel for johnson urged that section c,although repealed,could still be applied to provide discretionary relief from deportation in the case of an aggravated felon whose conviction predated the effective date of the repealing statute.in other words,counsel urged that,because johnson conviction in preceded the aedpa legislation repealing c,the aedpa could not be applied retroactively to deprive johnson of eligibility for c relief.
the ij convened a hearing on june,following the issuance of the interlocutory decision and order.johnson was present at the hearing,and his counsel appeared telephonically.based on the submissions of counsel,documentary evidence,and the determinations made in the interlocutory decision,the ij found that both of the charges set forth in the notice to appear have been sustained by clear and convincing evidence and that an order of deportation therefore was warranted.upon inquiry by the ij regarding designation of a country of removal,counsel responded that johnson wished to designate jamaica.the following colloquy ensued 
ij is this going to be a final order today are you going to,is johnson going to exercise his right to appeal 
counsel i not sure whether johnson going to exercise his right to appeal or not.johnson has expressed some concerns about taking appeal,the time that might take.before i would waive that right on his behalf,i would want to discuss it more formally with him and his family.
counsel so at this point i would reserve,unless at this point johnson wishes to affirmatively himself state that he wishes to take no appeal.
ij johnson,you heard the outcome of this case.unfortunately for you,i believe the law is against you in this matter.it a kind of technical or complex analysis and i concede that to you.but the bottom line,what important to you,is i found that under the present immigration and nationality act,the laws and regulations pertaining to that,your conviction precludes you from remaining in the united states under any circumstance.
now,this is an issue that has not been definitely decided by appellate courts.but it up to you as to whether you want to take this as a final decision.if you do that,by waiving your right to you do have a right to appeal to a higher immigration would necessitate your remaining in detention,obviously,for a period of time.
but be that as it may,that is your right.if you want to waive your appeal,it will be a final order and you will not be able to change your mind later on.
do you understand what do you want to do your attorney suggested he might want to talk to you about this.
johnson no,i do not have the time.i wish to waive my right to an appeal.
counsel judge,i did hear what he said.
ij he said he wants to waive an appeal.
counsel that what i thought he would say.okay.
ij do you have any questions,johnson 
johnson no,sir.
there were no further proceedings in the matter,and johnson was deported to jamaica on august.he thereafter returned without authorization and,apparently,came to the attention of the authorities in december of,when he was arrested on an unrelated charge.on january,johnson was indicted on the charge for which he was convicted in this case,that 
the defendant,being an alien,unlawfully,willfully,and knowingly did enter,and was found in,the united states,after having been deported from the united states subsequent to a conviction for the commission of an aggravated felony,to wit,a conviction on february,in the new york state supreme court,kings county,for attempted sale of a controlled substance in the third degree,without having obtained the express consent of the attorney general of the united states to his reapplying for admission.
by motion filed on march,johnson moved to dismiss the indictment,contending in a supporting memorandum of law that he was illegally deported after a fundamentally unfair proceeding that deprived him of administrative and judicial review,in violation of the due process clause.specifically,johnson alleged that he had been eligible for c relief from deportation and that the ij had incorrectly advised him otherwise.indeed,the supreme court decided,one year following johnson hearing before the ij,that the aedpa was not retroactively applicable to aggravated felons whose convictions predated the effective date of that statute.see ins cyr,d.accordingly,johnson was in fact eligible for c relief at the time of his hearing.
johnson also contended in his motion in the district court,as he does here,that he meets the statutory requirements for collateral attack on his deportation order.see d.such an attack is permitted by d where the alien has exhausted available administrative remedies the proceedings giving rise to the deportation order improperly caused the deprivation of any opportunity for judicial review and entry of the deportation order was fundamentally unfair.we have held that the third factor requires a showing of both a fundamental procedural error and prejudice resulting from that error.united states,cir.
after extensive briefing by both sides following oral argument of the motion to dismiss,the district court issued an oral decision on june.the district judge noted that she had listened to the tape recording of the june,deportation hearing and considered all the arguments and submissions of counsel.in determining that johnson had waived his right to appeal,and therefore had failed to comply with one of the essential statutory requirements for collateral attack on his deportation order,the district court stated 
certainly the ij finding,accompanied by his explanation that johnson could appeal,was sufficient to explain to johnson that he had a right to appeal.this is not a case where it could be argued that the ij misled the defendant,discouraged the defendant from seeking relief or only casually referred to the defendant right to an appeal.
i find that,contrary to johnson claims,he was informed of his right to appeal and given an opportunity to ensure that he understood his right.i find that this defendant waived his right to appeal with the full awareness both of the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.as such,he did not exhaust his remedies with respect to the underlying deportation order,nor was he deprived of the opportunity for judicial review,in my view.
on june,johnson appeared before the district court with counsel,who presented a stipulation as to all the evidence to be introduced for the trial of the criminal charge.under oath,johnson waived his right to a jury trial,reaffirmed the stipulation,and stated that he knew that his reentry into the united states after deportation was illegal.based on the stipulation and on the allocution,the district court found johnson guilty as charged.on october,following a review of the presentence report,consideration of the submissions of counsel,and further argument by counsel for johnson relating to criminal history and family circumstances,the district court applied the sentencing guidelines to impose a sentence of imprisonment of months,a term of supervised release of three years,and a special assessment of.this appeal followed.
discussion 
i.the contentions of the parties 
on appeal,johnson contends that the statutory exhaustion requirement is unconstitutional that,in any event,he was excused from the requirement by reason of the erroneous advice provided by the ij and that he satisfied the other two statutory requirements for collateral attack on his deportation order.with regard to those two requirements,he contends that he was deprived of the opportunity for judicial review,because of the incorrect advice imparted to him by the ij and that the entry of the deportation order was fundamentally unfair,owing to serious procedural error the erroneous conclusion of the ij and prejudice the likelihood that johnson would have been afforded c relief.for the reasons that follow,we reject johnson claims that congress exceeded its authority in imposing an exhaustion requirement,as well as his claim that his failure to exhaust was excused by the erroneous views of the ij.we therefore have no reason to pass on johnson other contentions,and decline to do so.
ii.constitutionality of the exhaustion requirement 
johnson contention that congress exceeded its authority in enacting section d is premised on the argument that the statute somehow overrules the supreme court decision in united states,d.since this constitutional challenge never was raised in the district court,johnson must meet the requirements of the plain error doctrine to raise it here.see united states olano,d united states feliciano,cir.johnson can not demonstrate any error,let alone meet the requirements for a showing of plain error,in the district court failure to recognize any unconstitutionality in section d.far from being inconsistent with,the statute is designed to carry out the supreme court mandate for ensuring due process in any collateral attack on a deportation order.
as in the case at bar,involved prosecution for illegal entry into the united states following a deportation order.the defendants in that case moved in the district court for dismissal of the indictment,arguing that the ij had not adequately informed them of their right to counsel at the deportation hearing.the district court rejected that argument,but found that the defendants apparently had failed to understand the ij explanation of their right to apply for suspension of deportation.see,at.based on the ij failure in that regard,the district court concluded that the defendants had not made a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to apply for suspension of deportation and,accordingly,dismissed the indictments.the eighth circuit court of appeals affirmed.id.at.see also united states,cir.in its review,the supreme court defined the issue as whether a federal court must always accept as conclusive the fact of the deportation order,even if the deportation proceeding was not conducted in conformity with due process.at.
answering the question in the negative and affirming the eighth circuit,the supreme court provided the following rationale 
our cases establish that where a determination made in an administrative proceeding is to play a critical role in the subsequent imposition of a criminal sanction,there must be some meaningful review of the administrative proceeding.this principle means at the very least that where the defects in an administrative proceeding foreclose judicial review of that proceeding,an alternative means of obtaining judicial review must be made available before the administrative order may be used to establish conclusively an element of a criminal offense.
id.at.citations omitted.
section d is,on its face,wholly consistent with the dictates of.the exhaustion requirement does not,after all,foreclose or even limit judicial review the statute merely requires an alien to pursue his due process objections through the administrative proce
