the question presented is whether the united states district court for the southern district of new york denny chin,judge properly found that repatriation to france under any circumstances would subject two children who were abducted by their mother to stress disorder and,therefore,whether the court correctly refused to repatriate would ordinarily be required under the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child applying the grave risk of psychological harm exception to the general rule of repatriation set forth in that treaty.see hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction,b grave risk exception,reprinted in.the hague convention or convention et domestic implementing legislation.
this is the second appeal in this case.the facts of this dispute are set forth fully in the district court first opinion,see blondin dubois,d,blondin i,and in our opinion in the first appeal,see blondin dubois,cir blondin ii.we assume familiarity with those opinions and now describe only the facts necessary to the disposition of the instant appeal.
marthe dubois and felix blondin lived together between and and had two children,marie eline and françois.dubois also had a son from a previous relationship,crispin,who lived with her and blondin during some portion of this period.dubois claims that blondin abused her and their children throughout the time they lived together.before françois birth,dubois allegedly left the house twice as a result of blondin physical and emotional abuse,taking and crispin with her.on one of those occasions,dubois and her daughter spent eight or nine months in a battered women shelter,while crispin lived in a youth shelter.both times,dubois and blondin reconciled,but both times,blondin assertedly resumed his violent abuse.
in august,when was six years old and françois two,dubois abducted the children and came to the united states.in doing so,dubois forged blondin signature on a passport application.when blondin learned that dubois and the children were living in the united states with dubois brother and his family,he instituted proceedings in the district court seeking the return of the children to france under the hague convention.
the convention requires the repatriation of an abducted child to its country of habitual residence in all but four exceptional circumstances.see hague convention,preamble a children who are wrongfully removed or retained within the meaning of the convention are to be promptly returned unless one of the narrow exceptions set forth in the convention applies.see also blondin ii,at describing the four exceptions.in response to blondin petition,dubois successfully invoked the article b exception,which permits a judicial or administrative authority to refuse to order the repatriation of a child if there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.hague convention,b see also blondin i,d at.
on appeal,we vacated the judgment of the district court and remanded the cause for further proceedings.see blondin ii,at.we did not question the court findings regarding blondin history of abuse,and we declined to disturb its decision not to repatriate the children under circumstances that,for lack of another alternative,might force them and dubois to live with blondin see id.at.however,because the aim of the convention is to ensure the prompt return of abducted children,see hague convention,preamble,we held that further proceedings were required in order to determine whether any arrangements might be made that would mitigate the risk of harm to the children,thereby enabling them safely to return to france.see id.at.specifically,we stated that it is important that a court considering an exception under article b take into account any ameliorative measures by the parents and by the authorities of the state having jurisdiction over the question of custody that can reduce whatever risk might otherwise be associated with a child repatriation.id.
on remand,the district court found that if dubois and the children returned to france,they would be eligible for social services,and dubois would receive free legal assistance in the pending custody proceedings that blondin would assist her and the children financially in moving back to france,and would agree not to attempt to make contact with them prior to the judicial determination of custodial rights and that the french government would not prosecute dubois for the abduction or the forgery.see blondin dubois,d,blondin iii.however,the district court found,on the basis of the evidence presented,that even these,that any arrangements at fail to mitigate the grave risk of harm to the children,because returning to france under any circumstances would cause them psychological harm,as france was the scene of their trauma.see id.at.the court based this determination on uncontested expert testimony that the children would suffer from stress disorder upon repatriation.see id.
blondin timely filed this appeal on january.
the aim of the hague convention is to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention and to establish procedures to ensure their prompt return to the state of their habitual residence.see hague convention,preamble see also blondin ii,at.as we explained in more detail in blondin ii,a wrongful removal under the convention is one in breach of rights of custody under the law of the state in which the child was habitually resident.hague convention,see also blondin ii,at.if the removal was wrongful,the child must be returned unless the defendant can establish one of four defenses.blondin ii,at internal quotation marks omitted see also a.no one disputes that dubois removal of the children was wrongful within the meaning of the convention.rather,the parties disagree as to whether dubois has established a defense under the convention.
dubois originally sought to make out a defense only under article b,pursuant to which a court may decline to repatriate a child if the party opposing repatriation establishes by clear and convincing evidence that repatriation would create a grave risk of physical or psychological harm to the child see hague convention,b blondin ii,at.it was this matter that the district court considered in blondin i,and that we reviewed in blondin ii.however,following our decision in blondin ii,dubois asked the district court to expand its inquiry specifically to take into account whether had become so deeply rooted in the united states that returning her to france would expose her to a grave risk of psychological harm,arguing that the second circuit had left this issue open to consideration on remand.blondin iii,d at emphasis added.ordinarily,the issue of whether a child is settled in a new environment arises under article of the convention,which applies only if the petitioning parent commences proceedings more than one year after the abduction.see hague convention,because blondin filed his petition within a year,article does not apply in this case.expressly recognizing this,the district court nevertheless granted dubois request and took into account whether both children were settled in their new environment as one factor in its grave risk analysis under article b.see blondin iii,d at.
in addition,the district court considered objections to returning to france.like the settled exception of article,the child views on repatriation ordinarily arise under another provision of the hague this case,an unnumbered provision of article the district court,however,decided to consider views,as yet another factor in the grave risk analysis under article b.see id.at.
blondin challenges the conclusion that repatriation would create a grave risk of psychological harm within the meaning of article b,and objects to the district court consideration,as part of its grave risk analysis,of whether is settled in her new environment and whether she objects to returning to france.we consider these matters in turn.
before proceeding to the merits of this case,we consider the applicable standard of review.only recently we stated that t he proper interpretation of the hague convention is an issue of law,which we review de novo.croll croll,cir.in cases arising under the convention,a district court factual determinations are reviewed for clear error.see walsh walsh,cir shalit coppe,cir lops lops,cir friedrich friedrich,cir.the district court application of the convention to the facts it has found,like the interpretation of the convention,is subject to de novo review.see feder,cir holding that de novo review applies to the district court choice of legal precepts and its application of those precepts to the facts emphasis added cree flores,cir we review de novo the interpretation and application of treaty language.underlying factual findings,including findings of historical fact,are reviewed for clear error.citations omitted.
accordingly,in this case we review for clear error the district court factual findings that the children will suffer a recurrence of acute,severe traumatic stress disorder if they return to france,in part because they are settled in an environment in which they are recovering from their previous trauma that objects to returning to france and that was old enough and mature enough at eight years of age for her views to be considered we review de novo the court conclusion that a likelihood of stress disorder constitutes a grave risk of psychological harm within the meaning of article b,and its decision to consider both whether the children were settled in their new environment,and whether objected to returning to france,as individual factors in a broader grave risk analysis under article b.
on remand from blondin ii,the district court inquired into what arrangements might be made in order to make possible the children return without subjecting them to a grave risk of psychological harm.see blondin iii,d at.the court heard the testimony of veronique chauveau,an expert on french family law and international law,concerning the social and legal support services that would be available to dubois and her children if they were to return to france received letters on the same matter from the french ministry of justice,which acts as the french central authority under the convention and heard from albert solnit,an expert in child psychiatry and pediatrics and sterling professor emeritus at yale university.see id.at.
chauveau testimony and the submissions of french authorities established that,on arrival in france,dubois could seek a modification of a pending order by a french court granting dubois and blondin joint custody of the children and fixing their principal residence with blondin.see id.at.such a modification,which could take up to three months to obtain,would fix the habitual residence of the children with dubois pending an evaluation and a new custody hearing.see id.in addition,the french ministry of justice would arrange for dubois to receive free legal services should she choose to seek modification of the order.see id.at.
blondin himself offered to make several undertakings in order to mitigate the risks associated with repatriation he agreed to pay for the airfare and a stay at a hotel for dubois and the children while dubois applied for social services,and agreed not to attempt to enforce the existing custody order while renewed custody proceedings were pending.see id.according to chauveau,a french court would enforce these undertakings by blondin provided they are not contrary to the public policy of france.id.internal quotation marks omitted.in addition,the office of the prosecutor in bobigny,where dubois resided before she left for the united states,agreed not to prosecute dubois for the abduction or the forgery of the passport documents.see id.
finally,the district court also accepted solnit,as the only expert testimony presented on the risk of psychological harm to the children,stand uncontroverted.see id.at see also letter to the honorable denny chin from albert solnit,and barbara nordhaus,msw,lcsw,solnit report.solnit interviewed dubois,and françois,and examined the following documents the opinions in blondin i and blondin ii the district court order dated october,determining that the settled exception could be considered as one factor in the grave risk analysis the october order and the transcript of blondin testimony at a hearing held on june.see blondin iii,d at see also solnit report at.
solnit concluded that and françois were recovering from the sustained,repeated traumatic state created in france by their father physically and emotionally abusive treatment and that if the children were returned to france with or without their mother and even if they could avoid being in the same domicile as their father they would almost certainly suffer a recurrence of their traumatic stress disorder stress disorder that would impair their physical,emotional,intellectual and social development.solnit report at.he explained further that such a recurrence would set them back in a very harmful way as they are still recovering from the trauma they had been suffering from until two and a half years ago.such a move would undo the benefit of the psychological and emotional roots they have established with their mother and her extended family,which has resulted in the beginning of a full recovery from their severe trauma in france.id.at 
blondin did not present any evidence as to the psychological impact that a return to france would have on the children.we are thus presented with a rare situation in which,for unexplained reasons,no evidence was presented by one party that would contradict the conclusions of an expert procured by the opposing party.solnit conclusions thus stand uncontroverted.they are the only evidence that we and the district court have available as to whether repatriation to france would cause the children to suffer a recurrence of traumatic stress disorder.
after hearing solnit testimony and reviewing his report,the district court found,by clear and convincing evidence,that return of and françois to france,under any arrangement,would present a grave risk that they would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or that they would otherwise be placed in an intolerable situation.blondin iii,d at.in addition,the court found that,although it might be possible to place dubois and the children with a third party or to provide them with subsidized housing and social services,thereby avoiding all contact with blondin pending a resolution of custody issues,there is nevertheless nothing the french authorities could do to protect the children from the harm they face in this particular situation,because their mere presence in france,the site of their trauma,would create the risk.see id.at.in entering these findings,the court noted that solnit is a widely recognized expert in child psychiatry and psychology and that h is books and articles have been cited hundreds of times in federal and state court cases,including by the second circuit.id.at.
in light of solnit qualifications and expertise,see,goldstein,freud,solnit goldstein,in the best interests of the child his examination of relevant documents his interviews with dubois and the children and,we emphasize,the absence of any contravening evidence on point,we see no basis upon which to question the district court finding that the children will suffer from a recurrence of traumatic stress disorder if they return to france.
blondin evidence consisted entirely of testimony concerning the government services available to dubois and the arrangements that blondin and the french authorities would be willing to make to facilitate repatriation of the children.we do not underestimate the importance of this evidence,which we requested,and we appreciate the lengths to which both blondin and the french authorities have gone to address the concerns raised by dubois and by our courts.however,in light of the evidence presented by dubois,blondin evidence is essentially inapposite,as it does not purport to cast doubt on the court finding that even with all of these arrangements in place,the children face an almost certain recurrence of traumatic stress disorder on returning to france because they associate france with their father abuse and the trauma they suffered as a result.therefore,we can not say that the district court conclusion was clearly erroneous,and we decline to disturb it.
reviewing de novo the district court application of article b to this factual determination,we affirm its decision to deny repatriation on the ground that a grave risk of psychological harm exists within the meaning of article b.
the hague convention is not designed to resolve underlying custody disputes.see hague convention,blondin ii,at.this fact,however,does not render irrelevant any countervailing interests the child might have.according to the explanatory report of the convention,
the dispositive part of the convention contains no explicit reference to the interests of the child however,its silence on this point ought not to lead one to the conclusion that the convention ignores the social paradigm which declares the necessity of considering the interests of children in regulating all the problems which concern them.on the contrary,right from the start the signatory states declare themselves to be firmly convinced that the interests of the children are of paramount importance in matters relating to their custody 
elisa,explanatory report hague conference on private international law,in acts and documents of the fourteenth session the explanatory report or report,see generally blondin ii,at n explaining why the report is an especially useful aid to interpretation of the convention.as the report explains,article b clearly derive s from a consideration of the interests of the child t he interest of the child in not being removed from its habitual residence gives way before the primary interest of any person in not being exposed to physical or psychological danger or being placed in an intolerable situation.explanatory report at.
the united states department of state legal analysis of article b provides the following example of an intolerable situation 
a review of deliberations on the convention reveals that intolerable situation was not intended to encompass return to a home where money is in short supply,or where educational or other opportunities are more limited than in the requested state.an example of an intolerable situation is one in which a custodial parent sexually abuses a child.if the other parent removes or retains the child to safeguard it against further victimization,and the abusive parent then petitions for the child return under the convention,the court may deny the petition.such action would protect the child from being returned to an intolerable situation and subjected to a grave risk of psychological harm.
at in other words,at one end of the spectrum are those situations where repatriation might cause inconvenience or hardship,eliminate certain educational or economic opportunities,or not comport with the child preferences at the other end of the spectrum are those situations in which the child faces a real risk of being hurt,physically or psychologically,as a result of repatriation.the former do not constitute a grave risk of harm under article b the latter do.
the sixth circuit analysis under article b in friedrich describes a similar spectrum.see friedrich,at.the sixth circuit observed that t he exception for grave harm to the child is not license for a court in the country to speculate on where the child would be happiest.id.instead,the sixth circuit indicated that a grave risk exists in only two situations where returning the child means sending him to a zone of war,famine,or disease or in cases of serious abuse or neglect,or extraordinary emotional dependence,when the court in the country of habitual residence,for whatever reason,may be incapable or unwilling to give the child adequate protection.friedrich,at emphasis added.
the district court found that the facts presented in this case belong on the latter end of the spectrum.see blondin iii,d at.the district court did not deny repatriation on the basis of financial considerations,educational opportunities,the children preferences,or other such advantages.rather,the district court based its decision on its findings of the serious abuse involved in this case and the resulting harm that the children would suffer on returning to france.see id.the district court also found,with respect to this harm,that the authorities in reasons entirely beyond their provide the children with the necessary protection.see id.at.clearly,the french authorities are both willing and able to make numerous arrangements and accommodations to facilitate repatriation.however,due to the particular circumstances presented here,they can not provide the necessary protection because doing so would require them to fulfill the impossible task of ensuring that a return to france would not trigger a recurrence of traumatic stress disorder in the children.walsh,at holding that although the court had no doubt that courts of the home country would issue appropriate protective orders,repatriation was denied in part because spouse habitual disobedience of such orders would render them ineffective 
since the district court the basis of uncontested expert the children will face a recurrence of traumatic stress disorder if repatriated to france,and we have concluded that this finding is not clearly erroneous,we can not say that article b does not apply in this case.a grave risk of psychological harm,even construed narrowly,undoubtedly encompasses an almost certain recurrence of traumatic stress disorder therefore,the district court properly applied article b to the facts presented in this case.we affirm its decision.
the district court granted dubois request that it consider whether was so deeply rooted in the united states that returning her to france would expose her to a grave risk of psychological harm.blondin iii,d at see also october order.the court did not consider this matter under the rubric of article of the hague convention under which the issue of whether a child is settled usually arises,because that provision applies only if the petition was filed over one year after the abduction,whereas blondin instituted these proceedings within months of the abduction.see blondin iii,d at.instead,the court accepted dubois argument that the issue of whether a child is settled in its new environment may be considered as one of several factors in the grave risk analysis under article b.in support of this proposition,dubois quotes our statement in blondin ii 
we do not rule out the possibility of a case in which a petition seeking a child return is filed less than a year after the child abduction,but it is nevertheless established by clear and convincing evidence on the child behalf that he or she is so deeply rooted in the united states that there is a grave risk that the child return would expose the child to psychological harm.the child might then be excepted from return under article b.the record as now constituted does not present such a case.
appellee brief at quoting blondin ii,at.in blondin ii,we neither ruled out this possibility nor explored it in any detail.we now conclude,on the basis of an expanded record and additional findings of fact and conclusions of law by the district court,that the court properly considered whether the children were settled in their new environment as one factor in the article b analysis.
as we read article,it does not,of course,judicial or administrative authority to refuse to order the repatriation of a child on the sole ground that the child is settled in its new environment,if more than one year has elapsed between the abduction and the petition for return.the article begins by setting forth the general rule that 
w here a child has been wrongfully removed or retained and,at the date of the commencement of the proceedings before the judicial or administrative authority of the contracting state where the child is,a period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of wrongful removal or retention,the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.
hague convention.it then carves out a simple exception 
the judicial or administrative authority,even where the proceedings have been commenced after the expiration of the period of one year referred to in the preceding paragraph,shall also order the return of the child,unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment.
id.emphasis added.in other words,if more than one year has passed,a demonstra tion that the child is now settled in its new environment may be a sufficient ground for refusing to order repatriation.
to the extent that article permits the courts of a party to the convention to deny repatriation on this basis,it effectively allows them to reach the underlying custody dispute,a matter which is generally outside the scope of the convention.see explanatory report at i n so far as the return of the child is regarded as being in its interests,it is clear that after a child has become settled in its new environment,its return should take place only after an examination of the merits of the custody rights exercised over which is outside the scope of the convention.however,the convention framers recognized that although its aim is to ensure the return of abducted children without reaching the merits of underlying custody disputes,there could come a point at which a child would become so settled in a new environment that repatriation might not be in its best interest.see id.therefore,they settled on the time limit,which,although perhaps arbitrary,nevertheless proved to be the least bad answer to the concerns which were voiced in this regard.id.
none of this implies that the question of whether a child is settled may not be considered at all under article b it simply means that this factor can not be the sole reason for repatriation,except as provided by article.under article b,the fact that a child is settled may form part of a broader analysis of whether repatriation will create a grave risk of harm.the ordinary disruptions necessarily accompanying a move would not by themselves constitute such a risk.see walsh,at we disregard the arguments that grave risk of harm may be established by the mere fact that removal would unsettle the children who have now settled in the united states.that is an inevitable consequence of removal.friedrich,at explaining that adjustment problems that would attend the relocation of most children are not sufficient to warrant a denial of repatriation under article b.yet in the course of an article b analysis,a district court may be presented with evidence that a child is now settled in a new environment,and such evidence may be relevant to the issue of grave risk.as we suggested in blondin ii,at,a district court may consider it as part of an analysis under article b as long as that factor is not the sole basis for a finding that there is clear and convincing evidence that a grave risk of harm exists 
the district court in this case properly considered the evidence that the children were settled in their new environment as one factor in its grave risk analysis.the court was careful to establish the connection between the fact that they were settled and the grave risk of harm the court had found a return to france would create i am convinced that wrenching the children away from the safe,environment in which they have begun to recover from the trauma caused by their father abuse would thwart their recovery by causing a recurrence of the traumatic stress disorder they suffered in france,the site of their father sustained,violent abuse.blondin iii,d at emphasis added.the district court explicitly rejected the argument that it should consider whether they had become deeply rooted in the united states to the extent that respondent was attempting to invoke the exception set forth in article of the convention,agreeing to consider it only within the context of article.id.at.its discussion makes clear that the evidence that the children are in the united states was not,by itself,the dispositive factor in this case.accordingly,we conclude that the court did not err in considering this evidence as one factor in its article b analysis.
in declining to order the return of the children,the district court also took into account objections to returning to france.see blondin iii,d at.the court was somewhat ambiguous as to the applicable provision in this regard.it initially cited the unnumbered provision of article that governs a court consideration of a child views but it subsequently explained that it was considering views as only one factor under its article b analysis h er objection to being returned to france is simply one of several reasons for invoking article b and refusing to send the children back.id.
the unnumbered provision of article permits a court to refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.hague convention.according to the explanatory report,under this provision a child objection may be conclusive 
t he convention also provides that the child views concerning the essential question of its return or retention may be conclusive,provided it has,according to the competent authorities,attained an age and degree of maturity sufficient for its views to be taken into account.
explanatory report.the convention does not establish a minimum age at which a child is old enough and mature enough to trigger this provision as explained in the report,all efforts to agree on a minimum age at which the views of the child could be taken into account failed,since all the ages suggested seemed artificial,even arbitrary.id.the report itself,however,cites the example of a t he fact must be acknowledged that it would be very difficult to accept that a child of,for example,fifteen years of age,should be returned against its will.id.
blondin challenges the factual finding that at eight years old was old enough for the court to consider her views.the united states,in turn,objects to this portion of the court analysis on the ground that the unnumbered provision of article does not contemplate a general airing of a child views as part of an article b analysis of grave risk rather,it permits,although does not require,a court to refuse return based on the separate ground of an older child maturely considered objection to return.brief of amicus curiae united states at emphasis added.at the same time,the united states concedes that a court may consider the testimony of a younger child as part of the grave risk,in its view,such testimony must be limited to evidence that abuse has occurred or that return to the immediate custody of an abusive parent would pose a grave risk of harm.id.at.
we agree with the government that the unnumbered provision of article provides a separate ground for repatriation and that,under this provision,a court may refuse repatriation solely on the basis of a considered objection to returning by a sufficiently mature child.we also agree with the government that a court may consider a younger child testimony as part of a broader analysis under article b.in either case,of course,a court must take into account the child age and degree of maturity in considering how much weight to give its views.as the government acknowledges,however,it stands to reason that the standard for considering a child testimony as one part of a broader analysis under article b would not be as strict as the standard for relying solely on a child objections to deny repatriation under article.see brief of united states as amicus curiae at.moreover,we do not find any basis in the convention or in the relevant case law for limiting such testimony to evidence that abuse has occurred or that return to the immediate custody of an abusive parent would pose a grave risk of harm.id.emphasis added.rather,if a child testimony is germane to the question of whether a grave risk of harm exists upon repatriation,a court may take it into account.
in the instant case,we conclude that the district court properly considered views as part of its grave risk analysis under article b,and that it did not clearly err in finding that was old and mature enough for her views to be considered in this context.however,because it is evident that the court did not rely solely on her views in reaching its judgment,see blondin iii,d at,we do not reach the question of whether she had attained an age and degree of maturity sufficient for her views to be conclusive pursuant to the unnumbered provision of article.for the same reason,we do not reach the question of whether,if views had been the sole basis for a denial of repatriation,the objections she expressed would have been sufficient to support such a denial.
both the district court and solnit interviewed,on different occasions.judge chin interviewed the children together in his chambers without their mother present he gave them toys to play with while they talked to him and he did not wear his judicial robe.see id.at.solnit testified that he interviewed the children with a colleague,in a playroom,where they also played with toys.see transcript tr.at.in each of these sessions,stated that she did not wish to return to france because she was afraid of her father,and she described various instances of abuse and its effects on her,including her father spitting on and hitting her mother,at least once with a belt buckle his putting something around neck and threatening to kill her and own fear,nightmares,and inability to eat.see tr.at.when asked by judge chin whether she would like to return to france if she did not have to live with her father,she replied that she would like to visit paris for just one day or so.id.at.
on the basis of these interviews,the district court found that objects to being returned to france,noting that she explicitly stated that she does not want to return to france because she does not want to be subjected to further physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her father.blondin iii,d at.the court also found that is a bright,poised,intelligent child who has an understanding of the purpose of these proceedings and who spoke thoughtfully and expressively about her views on being returned to france,and that she is a remarkably mature.id.although both solnit and the court could not rule out the possibility that may have been coached,id.at,solnit testified that he did not detect any training or rehearsal in her statements,see id.at,and the court found that her objections to returning to france were not the product of the abductor parent undue influence,id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
blondin does not argue that is immature for her age rather,he simply questions whether any is old enough for its views to be considered,and he observes that she is not as mature as a.this argument lacks merit.to accept it we would have to conclude that under the convention,as a matter of law,an is too young for her views to be taken into account.we decline to do so,as this would read into the convention an age limit that its own framers were unwilling to articulate as a general rule.see explanatory report.
blondin also questions whether truly objects to returning to france,as opposed to returning to live with her father specifically.this argument has some merit in both conversations,several times distinguished between returning to france itself and returning to live with her father,and objected specifically to the latter.tr.at.nevertheless,although we doubt that the objections expressed by would be sufficient,without more,to sustain the judgment in this case,we can not say that the district court clearly erred in finding that she objects to returning to france.this finding,relying as it in part did on the court personal observations of,is of the sort peculiarly within the province of the trier of fact and is entitled to considerable deference.see mackler productions cohen,cir explaining that assessment of witnesses credibility is peculiarly within province of district court united states thai,cir noting district court unique ability to observe the witnesses in affirming court decision that was competent to testify.therefore,we decline to disturb it.
accordingly,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that was old enough and mature enough for her views to be taken into account,and that it properly considered them as one factor in a broader grave risk analysis under article b.
for the reasons stated above,we conclude that,in the particular and unusual circumstances presented in this which the only expert testimony in the record supports the district court conclusions and judgment 
the district court finding that the children would face a recurrence of acute,severe traumatic stress disorder if they were repatriated to france was not clearly erroneous 
the district court properly applied article b of the hague convention to this finding in reaching the legal conclusion that repatriation of the children would subject them to a grave risk of psychological harm and 
the district court properly considered a whether the children were settled in their new environment,and b whether objected to returning to france,as individual and factors in its broader grave risk analysis under article b.
accordingly,the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
although the convention deals with the repatriation of abducted children,it is apparent from the district court opinion and the parties submissions to this court that no one contemplates the return of the children to france without the accompaniment of dubois.
article b provides,in relevant part notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding article,the judicial or administrative authority of the requested state is not bound to order the return of the child if the person,institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that b there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.
the relevant portion of article provides the judicial or administrative authority,even where the proceedings have been commenced after the expiration of the period of one year referred to in the preceding paragraph,shall also order the return of the child,unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment.
this unnumbered provision in article provides the judicial or administrative authority may also refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.
the district court made other factual findings which are not in,that dubois would be eligible for social services that would enable her and the children to live apart from blondin while the french courts resolved the custody dispute,and that both blondin and the french authorities are willing and able to take steps toward reducing the risk of harm associated with repatriation.
chauveau was presented as a witness by amicus curiae the united states,which supports blondin position.the united states submitted a statement of interest pursuant to,which provides the solicitor general,or any officer of the department of justice,may be sent by the attorney general to any state or district in the united states to attend to the interests of the united states in a suit pending in a court of the united states,or in a court of a state,or to attend to any other interest of the united states.
the convention provides that a contracting state shall designate a central authority to discharge the duties which are imposed by the convention on such authorities.hague convention.the french ministry of justice acts as france central authority,see blondin iii,d at,while the department of state acts as the central authority for the united states,see exec.order,reprinted in.pursuant to our advice to make any appropriate or necessary inquiries of the government of france,blondin ii,at,the district court contacted both the french ministry of justice and the united states department of state.blondin iii,d at.the united states attorney for the southern district of new york,representing the department of state,forwarded to the district court the responses of the french ministry of justice.see id.at.
although the hague conven
