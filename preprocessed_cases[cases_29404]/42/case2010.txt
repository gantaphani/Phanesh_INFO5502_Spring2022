ahmad khalil barakat,a native and citizen of lebanon,petitions this court for review of the board of immigration appeals denial of his motion to terminate removal proceedings.barakat and most of his immediate family members entered the united states on immigrant visas in and then became lawful permanent residents.ten years later,the government charged barakat with removability on the basis of an intervening state conviction of a controlled substance offense.an immigration judge found that the government had proved barakat removability with clear and convincing evidence and then denied barakat requests for relief from removal.barakat appealed the ij adverse decision to the bia.while his appeal to the bia was pending,however,barakat moved the state court to withdraw his guilty plea.after the state court granted the motion and dismissed barakat criminal case,he moved the bia to terminate his removal proceedings.because the bia improperly put the burden on barakat to prove that the state court vacatur of his conviction was not for rehabilitative or immigration reasons,and because the government failed to bear its burden of proving that barakat conviction was vacated for rehabilitative or immigration reasons,we grant this petition for review.
barakat entered the united states legally in september after his brother,a united states citizen,petitioned for a visa on barakat behalf.see a g.approximately five years later,barakat pled guilty in the recorder court in the city of detroit to possession of less than grams of cocaine in violation of.comp.laws a v.the state court sentenced him to one year of probation pursuant to.comp.laws,which allows a state court,without entering a judgment of guilt,to impose a sentence of probation upon a offender guilty of one of a number of controlled substance offenses.section provides that,
u pon fulfillment of the terms and conditions of probation,the court shall discharge the individual and dismiss the proceedings.discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime 
id.thus,after barakat completed his probation,the state court dismissed the proceedings against him.
in september,the government filed a notice to appear charging barakat with removability pursuant to a b i as an alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of any law or regulation of a state relating to a controlled substance.in a proceeding before an ij,barakat conceded the following factual allegations supporting his removability that he is not a citizen or national of the united states that he is a native of lebanon and a citizen of lebanon and that he was admitted to the united states at new york,new york,on or about september,as an immigrant.however,barakat denied the government fourth factual allegation,that he had been convicted of a state controlled substance offense in december,and therefore denied that he was removable.barakat counsel argued that,because barakat case was handled under.comp.laws,it was dismissed without an adjudication of guilt.the government,in turn,submitted as evidence the state court record of conviction.the ij ultimately concluded that,notwithstanding the state court dismissal of barakat criminal proceedings pursuant to.comp.laws,the conviction remained valid for immigration purposes and the government had proved removability with clear and convincing evidence.
in the meantime,barakat applied for withholding of removal,protection under the convention against torture,and voluntary departure.following a hearing at which the ij received testimony from both barakat and his son,the ij determined that barakat was not credible,denied his requests for relief from removal,and ordered him removed to lebanon.the bia later affirmed these rulings.barakat does not challenge the adverse credibility finding or the denial of his requests for relief from removal on his petition for review to this court.
while barakat appeal was pending before the bia,he moved the third judicial circuit court in wayne county,michigan,to withdraw his guilty plea.the state court granted his motion and,on june,dismissed the criminal case against him with prejudice and in best interests of justice.as a result of this change in the status of his criminal conviction,barakat moved the bia to terminate his removal proceedings,arguing that his conviction ha d been vacated for sound reason and not solely to avoid the consequences of an immigration order of removal.barakat included with his motion certified copies of the state court order granting his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and the order dismissing his criminal case.
in opposing barakat motion,the government asserted that barakat must proffer evidence to sustain his burden of proving that his conviction was not vacated solely for immigration purposes.the government then argued that the record sheds no light whatsoever on the reason for the state court vacatur of barakat conviction.the government therefore urged the bia to deny the motion.
the bia did just that.the bia discussed and disposed of barakat motion to terminate removal proceedings in a single paragraph of its decision on the merits of his appeal 
following the immigration judge decision,barakat obtained a dismissal of his criminal case,which was the underlying charge in his notice to appear.we find that barakat failed to provide evidence from which it may be reasonably inferred that his motion to withdraw his guilty plea was granted on any recognized legal ground.on this record,the only reasonable inference that can be drawn is that the conviction was vacated for the sole purpose of relieving barakat from his removal.
citing sanusi gonzales,cir other internal citations omitted.barakat now petitions for review of the bia denial of his motion to terminate removal proceedings.
barakat appended to his reply brief in this court a copy of his motion to set aside guilty plea and for new trial,allegedly filed in state court on june.barakat motion to withdraw his guilty plea was not submitted for the bia consideration and is therefore not part of the administrative record.barakat subsequently moved this court to take judicial notice of the state court filing and maintains that this court has the authority to do so pursuant to federal rule of evidence f.barakat contends that his motion to withdraw his guilty plea incontrovertibl y shows that he asserted grounds for a new trial that are valid for immigration purposes.he emphasizes that his motion to withdraw his guilty plea is accessible to the public because it was filed in state court and was not subject to any sort of protective or privacy order.in opposing barakat motion to take judicial notice,the government relies upon b a,which requires this court to decide petitions for review solely upon the administrative record.
although barakat had initially asked this court to terminate his removal proceedings outright,in the week before oral argument he moved this court for the alternate relief of remand in light of the united states supreme court recent decision in padilla kentucky.the government joins in requesting a remand for the bia to consider,in the first instance,the effect of the supreme court decision in padilla on t his case.
this court has jurisdiction to entertain barakat petition for review to the extent that it challenges the bia assignment of the burden of proof.pursuant to a c,n otwithstanding any other provision of law statutory or nonstatutory,and except as provided in subparagraph d,no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in,among other statutory provisions,a b i.subparagraph d provides that n othing in subparagraph c,or in any other provision of this chapter other than this section which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.id.a d.this court therefore lacks jurisdiction to conside
