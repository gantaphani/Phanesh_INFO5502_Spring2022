xia lin claims that the chinese government forced her to abort two pregnancies under its coercive family planning policies and will subject her to involuntary sterilization if she is forced to return to china.lin filed for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the united nations convention against torture.the immigration judge ij denied all relief because he concluded that lin was not credible,a ruling the board of immigration appeals bia summarily affirmed.we vacate the removal order and remand lin case for rehearing because the ij adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence.
lin is a native of wenzhou city in the zhejiang province of china.at the age of,she married her husband,who was at the time.because lin and her husband married before they had reached the legally permissible for women and for were unable to register their union for several years after the ceremony.to corroborate this fact,lin submitted to the ij an original copy of a marriage certificate issued in,five years after the wedding.lin and her husband both worked for enterprises,she as a store clerk and he as a factory laborer.several months after they were married,lin gave birth to a daughter.when she arrived at the hospital for the delivery,lin was unable to produce the required birth permit because her marriage had not yet been registered with the government.lin testified that she and her husband paid a fine of renminbi rmb to the hospital for failure to produce the birth permit and were assessed a fine of rmb for having a child before lin had turned years of age.she corroborated this claim by submitting a copy of a fine for rmb that gave as its stated reason no birth permission,see,and a copy of another fine in the amount of rmb which was assessed for marrying too early having child too early.id.
six months after her daughter was born,family planning officials inserted an intrauterine device iud in lin to prevent future pregnancies.because lin and her husband wanted more children,she paid a private doctor to remove the iud in february,and became pregnant for the second time in march.fearing that she would be forced to abort her pregnancy,lin fled to her brother house and did not show up for her quarterly iud checkup in may.although she tried to avoid detection by remaining indoors,lin believes that somebody reported her pregnancy to family planning officials.lin claims that eight people arrived at her brother house one night to take her to the hospital for an abortion.lin relatives fought with the officials and lin pleaded with them to allow her to bring her pregnancy to term.these protestations fell on deaf ears as the officials took her by force to the second people hospital of wenzhou city,where doctors aborted her pregnancy.
one month after the first abortion,lin was fined rmb and had another iud inserted.she attended her iud checkups without incident until may,when she again paid a private doctor to remove the contraceptive device.one month later,lin became pregnant for the third time.afraid to stay home while she was pregnant,lin left her job and went to stay with her sister.she was tracked down by family planning officials shortly after she missed her iud checkup in december.lin testified that the officials were very aware of her situation after the first abortion and that she believed someone had once again reported her unauthorized pregnancy to the government.this time about ten people arrived at her sister home,again at night.when lin refused to voluntarily submit,the officials took her to the dongfeng hospital for a second abortion.she was six months pregnant at the time.lin explained to the ij that she did not have evidence to show that the abortion was forced because such documentation is provided only for voluntary procedures.she testified if i could get evidence that would prove to you that that abortion was voluntary.because it was involuntary,i could produce that evidence.
lin returned home after the second abortion,for which she was fined rmb,and had an iud inserted again by family planning officials in january.she did not return to work.her husband employer threatened to dismiss him if lin had any further problems with the family planning officials or became pregnant again.despite this threat,lin paid a private doctor to remove her iud for the third time in september.when she became pregnant shortly thereafter,she decided that it was time to leave china.with the assistance of smugglers,a pregnant lin traveled through thailand,singapore,and japan before arriving in the united states on may.after landing at the los angeles airport,lin was detained and questioned by immigration officials.because lin did not have valid travel documents,the government instituted removal proceedings.lin conceded removability and requested asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the torture convention.with the assistance of counsel,lin case was transferred from california to new york,where lin had moved to live with friends.lin appeared briefly before an ij in new york but requested a second venue change to chicago after her move to illinois.the government did not oppose either venue change and lin asylum hearing occurred in chicago.
at her asylum hearing,lin testified that she was nervous during her interview with immigration officials at the los angeles airport.she was worried about being sent back to china while she was pregnant.in her sworn statement from that interview,lin said that she left china because it is against the law to have two children under the policy.she said that she was afraid to return to china because she would be arrested for leaving without permission.when asked about the purpose of her trip,lin responded economy is bad in china and i am pregnant months.i need to provide for my child in china.i am here to look for a job.
lin told the ij that her second child,a daughter born in the united states,had returned to china to live with lin parents while she worked in america to pay off her smuggling debt.lin also explained that after she left china in april,government officials informed her husband that their oldest daughter could not register for school until the hefty rmb fine imposed at the child birth was paid in full.to support this claim,lin submitted a copy of the fine which was dated july.
the ij denied lin request for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the torture convention based on an adverse credibility determination.on appeal,lin has abandoned her request for relief under the torture convention by failing to raise it in her opening brief.see,hentosh herman finch of health scis.the chi.med,cir arguments not raised in an opening brief are waived.citing wilson,cir.the ij determined that lin testimony was not believable and that she could not meet her burden of proof without necessary corroboration of the incidents in the past.specifically,the ij gave two reasons for disbelieving lin story.first,he concluded that lin sole motivation for coming to the united states was economic,rather than fear of china coercive population control policies.in the ij estimation,the fact that lin sent her second child back to china undercut her testimony that she was concerned about the consequences of having an unauthorized child.second,the ij decided that lin descriptions of her two forced abortions were implausible and were inconsistent with general background reports.the ij found it hard to believe that eight or ten people arrived to escort lin to the hospital for her abortions.after making this credibility determination,the ij further found that lin had not sufficiently corroborated her alleged persecution through affidavits.the ij thought that lin should have been able to produce this corroboration because she has remained in contact with her family in china.
when the bia affirms an ij ruling without opinion,see e,we review the ij decision directly.vladimirova ashcroft,wl,cir.july.to qualify for asylum,lin bears the burden of proving that she meets the statutory definition of refugee as provided in the immigration and nationality act ina.this definition generally provides that a refugee is any person who is outside any country of such person nationality who is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.see a a.this generally applicable definition has been amended to specifically account for applicants like lin who allege persecution based on coercive family planning policies.see a b.withholding of removal is governed by a more stringent standard because lin is required to show that there is a clear probability that her life or freedom would be threatened upon her return to china.see ins stevic,d b.
under the substantial evidence standard,we uphold the ij determination if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d ahmed ashcroft,cir.although we are mindful of the highly deferential standard applied to the ij credibility determinations,we will not automatically yield to the ij conclusions when they are drawn from insufficient or incomplete evidence.georgis ashcroft,cir.to withstand our scrutiny,the ij credibility determination must be supported by specific,cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.krouchevski ashcroft,cir quoting ahmad ins,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.we have explained that c orroborating evidence is essential to bolster an otherwise unconvincing case,but when an asylum applicant does testify credibly,it is not necessary for her to submit corroborating evidence in order to sustain her burden of proof.uwase ashcroft,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted see also a the testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.
because an applicant who fails to establish eligibility for asylum necessarily can not satisfy the more stringent requirements for withholding of removal,we begin with lin asylum claim.
congress has maintained an interest in asylum applicants like lin from the time china first implemented its controversial policy in.in,the house of representatives condemned the policy,and congress restricted appropriations to any organization that supported or participated in a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.see population inst.mcpherson,providing history of congressional action in the.noting these developments,the bia nonetheless determined that an asylum applicant subject to china policy could not allege persecution on one of the five permissible grounds enumerated in the ina.matter of chang.federal courts deferred to the bia interpretation despite subsequent legislative and administrative action that attempted to overturn chang.see chen ins,cir holding that chang had not been overruled by administrative action or executive order zhang slattery,cir,cert.denied,d upholding chang despite the seemingly purposeful efforts by the executive branch and the houses of congress to achieve the opposite outcome chen zhou chai carroll,cir finding that subsequent executive action does not prevent the board of immigration appeals from applying matter of chang as controlling precedent.
following a series of hearings in,congress finally succeeded in reversing the chang decision.see coercive population control in china hearings before the subcomm.on int l operations and human rights of the house comm.on int l relations,cong.statement of chris smith,chair i am proud to report that legislation drafted and marked up would make it clear once and for all that the united states will not send people back to forced abortions,will not send people back to forced sterilizations.the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira amended the statutory definition of a refugee by adding the following sentence 
for purposes of determinations under this chapter,a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization,or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program,shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion,and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure,refusal,or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.
a,stat.codified as amended at a b.
a careful reading of the amendment reveals that congress identified four separate conditions under which an asylum applicant may allege past persecution on account of political opinion a the applicant has been forced to abort a pregnancy,b the applicant has undergone involuntary sterilization,c the applicant has been persecuted for failing or refusing to undergo such a procedure,or d the applicant has been persecuted for other resistance to a coercive population control program.further,the amendment states that an asylum applicant can allege a fear of future persecution a if the applicant fears being forced upon return to undergo an abortion or sterilization procedure or b if the applicant fears persecution for failure,refusal or resistance.the bia acknowledged the legislative reversal of chang in in re,when it granted asylum and withholding of removal to a chinese alien who had been forcibly sterilized.it later extended these protections to the spouse of such an individual,in re.see also zhao reno,cir.
as we stated before,it is lin burden to establish that she is a refugee under the amended statutory definition.see a.in this case,she alleges that the two forced abortions,three iud insertions,and numerous fines assessed by the chinese government constitute persecution.taking our lead from the statute text,we first examine lin allegation that she was forced to abort two pregnancies,one in and the other in.lin concedes that she has no documentary evidence to corroborate her claim that the two abortions were forced.the fact of the abortions,as opposed to their voluntary or forced nature,is uncontested.in fact,she testified that she could not be expected to produce such evidence as documentation is provided only when the abortion is voluntary.thus,lin claim stands on her testimony,which the ij found to be incredible.
the ij concluded that lin descriptions of her forced abortions were inconsistent with general background reports concerning pressure on women to only have one child in urban areas.we can only understand this to mean that the ij believed that women from urban areas,like lin,are under pressure to have only one child.we are confused,however,by what the ij found to be inconsistent between lin account of her forced abortions and the ij understanding that women in urban areas are pressured to only have one child.furthermore,the ij reference to general background reports does not give us confidence that he consulted the state department report in the record,because that report corroborates,rather than undermines,several aspects of lin testimony.
the state department profile of asylum claims and country conditions for china profile reports that the policy remains officially in force and most heavily affects the urban population.most asylum claims come from three chinese provinces,including the zhejiang province where lin lived with her husband.chinese officials privately acknowledge that forced abortions and sterilizations still occur in areas where family planning personnel may be uneducated and.employees of enterprises,like lin and her husband,are subject to particularly strict controls.see also wang ashcroft,cir noting strict enforcement of population control policies against government employees.the profile further corroborates lin testimony that married couples from the zhejiang province are authorized to have a child only after the wife reaches the age of.most crucially,the profile confirms lin explanation that any evidence she might produce of an abortion would imply that the procedure was voluntary as opposed to forced 
the embassy and consulates are unaware of any abortion certificates,which often are presented as part of a
