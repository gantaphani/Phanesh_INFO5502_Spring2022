petitioner stefan antonov mihaylov,a native and citizen of bulgaria,seeks review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his application for asylum.petitioner ludmila georgeva naydenova is a derivative asylum applicant mihaylov argues that the evidence presented below compels a conclusion that he was persecuted in the past on account of his political opinion and is therefore entitled to a statutory presumption of a fear of future persecution.he further claims that the evidence of changed circumstances offered by the government is insufficient to overcome that presumption and that he is therefore eligible for asylum.
ordinarily,we review the bia decision under our deferential substantial evidence standard,upholding that decision if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d.in this case,however,we are unable to conduct a proper substantial evidence review of the bia decision because neither the bia nor the immigration judge explained with adequate clarity and particularity the grounds for rejecting mihaylov past persecution claim.in light of this legally insufficient explanation,see gailius ins,cir,we vacate the bia order and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
in july,petitioners stefan antonov mihaylov and ludmila georgeva naydenova entered the united states without inspection.the petitioners applied for asylum and withholding of removal on may.the immigration and naturalization service hearing officer determined that they were ineligible for asylum and withholding,and referred their case to the immigration judge.approximately five years later,on january,the ins issued mihaylov and naydenova notices to appear,charging them with unlawful presence in the united states in violation of section a a i of the immigration and nationality act ina.the petitioners conceded the charge but renewed their request for asylum and withholding of removal.they also submitted a petition for relief under the convention against torture cat,and requested voluntary departure in the event that removal was necessary on august,after hearing testimony on the merits of the petitioners claims,the immigration judge denied their applications and entered an order of removal to bulgaria.the bia issued a summary affirmance without opinion on march,see a.this petition followed.
we summarize the evidence that mihaylov presented to the ij and then discuss the ij evaluation of that evidence.stefan mihaylov was born in in sofia,bulgaria.mihaylov father was a member of the communist party,but his maternal grandfather,stefan todorov georgiev,was an outspoken critic of bulgaria communist regime.in,the government arrested georgiev on fabricated murder charges in retaliation for his political activities,and sentenced him to twelve years in prison.as a result of georgiev conviction and sentence,mihaylov and the other members of his family were stigmatized as dissidents and enemies of the bulgarian government.
by the time that he was thirteen years old,mihaylov began to have trouble with the communist authorities.in his last year of elementary school,he spoke out against the communist youth league dkms,which all secondary school students were expected to join.because of his opposition to the dkms,mihaylov received low conduct grades,which precluded him from attending his choice of secondary school.in,the district superintendent of schools ordered mihaylov to meet with him throughout the year for political education lessons.during those sessions,the school official frequently struck mihaylov and threatened to send him to reform school if he did not cooperate.
on april,when mihaylov was fifteen years old,a uniformed policeman appeared at the door of his family apartment and demanded that mihaylov accompany him to the police station.without notifying mihaylov parents,the policeman took mihaylov to an unfamiliar detention facility where he was locked up in a small,windowless cell.the cell contained only a bed,a bucket for a toilet,and a lightbulb which stayed on hours a day.on the day of his detention,mihaylov suffered a loss of consciousness and subsequently lost control of his bodily functions.the prison guard refused to allow him to bathe or clean his soiled clothes and denied his request to see a doctor.mihaylov was later interrogated by two officials who riduculed him for smelling badly,humiliated him,and compared him to his grandfather.they asked mihaylov where he had been on certain dates,whether he knew certain people,and whether he was a member of a political group.when his answers did not satisfy them,the officials struck mihaylov with clubs or their fists on his legs,back,arms,and face.
mihaylov was detained for six or seven days.during that time,he was interrogated and beaten frequently and was not allowed to wash or change his clothes.on two occasions,he was denied access to a toilet.mihaylov again requested to see a doctor,and again that request was refused.on april,mihaylov was ordered to sign a document stating that he had not been harmed,beaten,or subjected to force in any way while in custody,and that he had been held only for interrogation.he was then taken by van to a local sofia police station and was released.
in the weeks following his detention,mihaylov physical condition deteriorated.he began to lose sensitivity through the lower part of his body and eventually was unable to walk.he was diagnosed with acute inflammation of the nerves of his spinal cord and spent a month in the hospital and three more months in a rehabilitation center.he eventually regained his ability to walk with a cane,but remained permanently disabled.
in the years following his arrest,mihaylov was frequently harassed by government officials he was arrested more than ten times for minor offenses such as wearing long hair,blue jeans,and a crucifix ordered to pay fines because of his appearance and forced to sign an agreement to stay away from downtown sofia.on one occasion,mihaylov was arrested and detained on suspicion of dealing in foreign currency.
in,mihaylov was detained by a government security agent,hristo rachev,who questioned him about his visits to the united states embassy and referred to mihaylov prior detentions.rachev threatened to have mihaylov imprisoned on false charges if he did not agree to become a government informant.mihaylov reluctantly agreed,and he met with rachev about times over the next year.during those meetings rachev asked mihaylov to identify pictures of individuals and to provide information about political activities and specific people.mihaylov grew increasingly afraid for his safety.on january,he fled bulgaria with naydenova,who was by then his wife,and traveled to canada.he applied for asylum,but that application was denied.mihaylov and naydenova then entered the united states on july.
in her supporting testimony,naydenova stated that after she began to live with mihaylov,she was repeatedly warned by security officials and threatened with the loss of her job at the ministry of culture if she continued to associate with him because he was from a bad family.she explained that both her family and mihaylov were and were mistreated by the communist party,and noted that being was like a sticker on one back that follows you for the rest of your life.she described an unsettling phone call to her home in which a man demanded to know where mihaylov was and ordered her to tell him that his friend hristo rachev called.when naydenova gave her husband the message,he began shaking uncontrollably.later that year,mihaylov and naydenova were rounded up as part of a mass detention in a particular section of town.naydenova explained that she and her husband were pulled out of a group at the police station and ushered into an office,where she was introduced to rachev,whose name and voice she recognized.mihaylov and rachev engaged in a furtive conversation,and the couple was subsequently released.
mihaylov also submitted numerous documentary sources in support of his past persecution claim.those sources included the state department country report on human ri
