opinion of the court 
jose augustin torres appeals his conviction for unlawful into the united states after having been deported.on july,torres was indicted for illegal after deportation in violation of.the indictment also charged that,prior to his removal,torres had been convicted of an aggravated felony,making him subject to the enhanced penalties set forth in section b.torres filed a motion to dismiss the indictment,arguing that the underlying removal order was flawed and could not,therefore,support a conviction for unlawful.the district court denied the motion to dismiss.reserving his right to appeal,torres pled guilty on february.on may,the district court sentenced torres to months imprisonment,three years supervised release and a special assessment.torres appeals,maintaining that his removal order can not serve as a predicate to his conviction for unlawful.
this case presents a question concerning the scope of an alien right to collaterally attack the removal order that underlies a conviction for unlawful.
torres was admitted into the united states on july,as a lawful permanent resident from the dominican republic,his native country.on august,torres was convicted of a felony drug trafficking offense in the superior court of new jersey,middlesex county.torres voluntarily returned to the dominican republic but on may,he attempted to the united states.
torres conviction rendered him removable ins officials therefore detained torres at the point of his entry and placed him in removal proceedings.in july of,a hearing was held before an immigration judge ij at which torres was not represented by counsel.the ij informed torres of his rights during and after the hearing,including his right to appeal the outcome of his removal proceedings.the ij then found torres removable as charged,and ordered him removed to the dominican republic at torres request.torres accepted the ij decision,and did not appeal the ij determination.at no time during the hearing,however,did the ij inform torres that he was eligible for any form of discretionary relief from removal.torres was removed on september.despite his removal and without authorization,torres was found yet again in the united states on february.torres indictment under followed on july.
before the district court,torres moved to dismiss the indictment contending that the order of removal upon which it was based was flawed.torres argued that,during his removal proceedings,he was entitled to be considered for discretionary relief from removal under section c of the immigration and nationality act ina,c repealed by illegal immigrant reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,div.c,b,stat.torres attributed the ij belief that torres was not eligible for c relief as being based on an erroneous conclusion of law that was later corrected by the supreme court decision in ins cyr,d.further,torres asserted that the ij failure to inform him of his eligibility for discretionary relief rendered that removal proceeding therefore an inappropriate predicate for a conviction under.see united states,d.
after the district court held an initial hearing on torres motion,torres sought to admit expert testimony on his motion.the district court,finding the testimony to be irrelevant,denied torres request to admit expert testimony.simultaneously,the district court denied torres motion to dismiss the indictment torres then pled guilty to the indictment,subject to his right to appeal.the district court imposed sentence and,soon after,issued a written opinion explaining its decision to deny torres motion to dismiss.torres timely appealed.

torres removal order was an element of his offense of illegal reentry.see.according to torres,at the time of his removal proceeding,he was wrongly denied consideration for c relief from removal.in order to address torres challenge,it is necessary for us to briefly rehearse the recent history of the immigration laws.
the ina contained a provision excluding from the united states aliens convicted of the illicit traffic in narcotics.see stat.see also cyr,at.the same provision,which was section c of the ina,granted the attorney general discretion to waive removal in the case of lawful permanent residents who had resided in the united states for at least seven years,so long as they had served less than five years in prison for an aggravated felony separately defined at a 
aliens lawfully admitted for permanent resident who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of removal,and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years,may be admitted in the discretion of the attorney general the first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to an alien who has been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies and has served for such felony or felonies a term of imprisonment of at least years.
see stat.at codified at c see also cyr,at.thus,for aggravated felonies,the critical threshold for eligibility for c relief was a sentence below five years.
in,congress eliminated the attorney general discretion under ina section c to waive removal for aliens excludable for having committed even controlled substance offenses.see and effective death penalty act aedpa d,stat.illegal immigrant reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira b,stat.the threshold was also thereby eliminated.the question soon arose whether the elimination of the attorney general discretion operated retroactively.that is,in the wake of aedpa and iirira,did the attorney general retain discretion to grant c relief from removal for aliens whose removable offense occurred prior to the change in the law,but whose removal had not yet been effected 
the first challenge to retroactive application of this broader preclusion of c relief came from aliens who had pled guilty to aggravated felonies prior to the enactment of aedpa and iirira but who served less than five years imprisonment.this group of aliens would have maintained the possibility of c relief if they faced removal before the effective dates of aedpa and iirira.seeking to retain their opportunity for c relief after the new laws became effective,these aliens argued,in part,that they had entered pleas of guilty to the aggravated felonies in an effort to keep the sentence imposed below the prison term threshold enumerated in c.thus,they had pled guilty with the expectation under the former law that,despite their felony convictions,they would remain eligible for discretionary relief from removal.that being so,it would be unfair and unconstitutional to retroactively apply the elimination of c discretionary relief by aedpa and iirira against them.
the attorney general disagreed.see in re soriano,n,wl,int.bia.eventually,so did a number of the courts of appeals.see,desousa reno,cir pasquarell,cir.from,soriano and the courts of appeals decisions that followed it took the position that the elimination of c relief enacted by aedpa and iirira acted retroactively that is,c relief was not available to any criminal alien whose removal would be effected after the effective dates of aedpa and iirira.
in,the supreme court resolved the question through an appeal from a denial of a writ of habeas corpus.see cyr,at.the court reversed soriano,and held that the elimination of c relief effected by aedpa and iirira was not retroactive thus,the court explained,c relief remained available on the same terms after the effective dates of aedpa and iirira to aliens who pled guilty before aedpa and iirira.
because of the timing of torres narcotics convictions and subsequent removal,he was wrongly precluded from seeking c relief because of the view that aedpa and iirira applied retroactively.in,torres pled guilty to committing a drug offense and was sentenced to less than five years imprisonment.under the law at that time,torres was removable,see a a i ii,but also eligible to be considered for c relief.see c 
but torres removal proceedings did not begin until the effective dates of aedpa and iirira.at that time,the view binding on the ij adjudicating torres removal proceeding was that aliens like torres were subject to the rules,and therefore were not eligible for c relief.presumably for this reason,the ij did not inform torres that c relief from removal might be available to him.
torres argues that the ij failure to consider the availability of c relief was a fundamental error because cyr later established that,at the time he was ordered removed,torres was actually eligible to be considered for c relief.importantly,torres also asserts that the ij error of law denied him an opportunity for judicial review of his removal order.according to torres,his opportunity to seek judicial review of the ij decision was effectively precluded by the ij failure to disclose that torres would have been eligible for consideration for discretionary relief but for the reigning interpretation of aedpa and iirira.torres reasons that,acting pro se,he would have no reason to know that,but for soriano,he was eligible for discretionary relief.had the ij so informed him,he might have sought judicial the bia or in the federal an effort to change the law.torres therefore argues that he should be permitted,in this criminal action for illegal,to challenge the ij conduct during his removal proceeding.
may torres collaterally attack the removal order that satisfies an element of his conviction for illegal reentry 
an alien subject to illegal prosecution under may challenge the underlying removal order only under certain circumstances,at.in,two mexican nationals were separately arrested in nebraska,transported to colorado,and placed in a group deportation hearing where they appeared pro se.id.at.at the hearing,the ij did not inform them of their right to counsel discussed,at least to some extent,their right to seek suspension of deportation and accepted waiver of their appeal rights.see id.at.the aliens were ordered deported to mexico,and that deportation order was effected on november.id.at.at the time of their deportation,the two aliens were provided with a copy of an ins form informing them that a return to the united states without permission would constitute a felony.id.
just over a month later,both aliens were again separately arrested in nebraska.id.both were then indicted for criminally violating,and both responded by challenging their indictment on the ground that they were denied fundamentally fair deportation hearings.id.at.they alleged that their deportation proceeding was fundamentally unfair because the ij inadequately informed them of their right to counsel and accepted their unknowing waivers of the right to apply for suspension of deportation.id the district court and the eighth circuit agreed in part,permitting the aliens collateral challenge at the threshold.
the supreme court,at the government request,assumed that the deportation proceeding was fundamentally unfair,focusing instead on the threshold question of whether an alien indicted for criminally violating could collaterally challenge the deportation order satisfying an element of that offense.id.at.the court found that nothing in section permitted an alien to bring such a collateral attack.see id.at.
but,the court concluded,due process requires that a collateral challenge to the use of a deportation proceeding as an element of a criminal offense must be permitted when the underlying proceeding is fundamentally unfair and when the deportation proceeding effectively eliminates the right of the alien to obtain judicial review.id.at.applying that rule to the case at hand,the court concluded that the ij adequately explaining suspension of deportation and accepting a waiver of the aliens appeal right despite that inadequate denied the aliens their right to judicial review.id.at.coupled with the government concession that the proceedings were fundamentally unfair,the court concluded that the aliens collateral challenge must be sustained.id.at.
congress later codified the court holding in at d,which states 
d limitation on collateral attack on underlying removal order 
in a criminal proceeding under this section,an alien may not challenge the validity of the removal order described in subsection a of this section or subsection b of this section unless the alien demonstrates that 
the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order 
the removal proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and 
the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.
d.these three requirements are listed in the conjunctive,meaning that all three must be met before an alien will be permitted to mount a collateral challenge to the underlying removal order.see united states,cir united states wilson,cir united states,cir.
in,torres did not pursue his right to appeal the removal order underlying his current criminal conviction.the government does not argue that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies,as required by section d.the only questions for us,therefore,are whether,at the time of his removal,torres was denied his opportunity for meaningful judicial review and whether entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.see d.
torres contention that he was denied meaningful judicial review is threefold.first,he contends that all avenues of judicial than administrative legally foreclosed to him,presumably by the operation of either a b or c,which bars direct review of the removal proceedings of certain felons.second,he argues that,because the predominant view at the time of his removal was that c discretionary relief was not available to aliens in his situation,judicial review from his removal order was meaningless,even if technically available.third,torres argues that,even if avenues of meaningful review were available to him,he was denied review because,by not being informed that discretionary c relief might be available to him,he was denied the opportunity to exercise considered judgment in waiving his review rights.
with respect to torres first contention,the government does not contest that one of a b or c would have precluded torres from seeking direct review of his removal order in the fifth circuit where his removal proceedings took place.
those statutory provisions say 
b denials of discretionary relief 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,no court shall have jurisdiction to review 
i any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section h,i,or of this title,or 
ii any other decision or action of the attorney general the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general,other than the granting of relief under section a of this title.
c orders against criminal aliens 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section a or a a iii,b,c,or d of this title,or any offense covered by section a a ii of this title for which both predicate offenses are,without regard to their date of commission,otherwise covered by section a a i of this title.
id.in short,the two provisions act in concert to preclude direct judicial review of most discretionary immigration determinations of the attorney general,and all immigration determinations with respect to aliens removable for having committed certain criminal offenses,including controlled substance offenses.see bakhtriger elwood,cir.
the government argues,nevertheless,that torres absolute right to appeal his removal order to the bia.torres,for his part,argues that such an appeal would have been futile in light of soriano.at.
this difference of opinion is beside the point.even if bia review had been available,clearly contemplates that judicial review include review beyond the administrative context.at.unambiguously differentiated between an alien administrative removal proceeding on the one hand,and judicial review on the other,stating 
our cases establish that where a determination made in an administrative proceeding is to play a critical role in the subsequent imposition of a criminal sanction,there must be some meaningful review of the administrative proceeding this principle means at the very least that where the defects in an administrative proceeding foreclose judicial review of that proceeding,an alternative means of obtaining judicial review must be made available before the administrative order may be used to establish conclusively an element of a criminal offense depriving an alien of the right to have the disposition in a deportation hearing reviewed in a judicial forum requires,at a minimum,that review be made available in any subsequent proceeding in which the result of the deportation proceeding is used to establish an element of a criminal offense.
id.internal footnotes and citations omitted,additional italics added.torres right to appeal to the bia is,therefore,insufficient to establish that he was afforded meaningful judicial review.
the government contends alternatively that the availability to torres of habeas corpus afforded him the opportunity for judicial review required by d after all,the government argues,that is the path enrico cyr employed in the eponymous supreme court case to obtain the very relief torres now contends was denied to him.see st cyr,at.the district court here accepted the government reasoning,following a growing number of federal courts holding that the availability to an alien of habeas corpus relief affords meaningful judicial review.see,at united states,cir 
the district court adopted an eminently sensible reading of the statute.see,at,at.as a practical matter,the availability of habeas relief would have adequately accommodated torres interest in having his least those made on statutory or constitutional by a federal court.
the difficulty with the district court approach,however,is linguistic.for the term judicial review as used in another part of the ina has now been interpreted by the supreme court to be limited to direct review,and to exclude habeas review.see cyr,at.in cyr,the court confronted,several provisions of which literally proscribed judicial review of the removal proceedings of aliens convicted of certain crimes.at least in part to avoid invalidating that provision on constitutional grounds,see at,the court held that the judicial review precluded in section of the statute meant only direct review and not habeas review.
if that is the definition of judicial review in,does it follow that the identical term in d must mean the same thing,so that the availability to an alien of habeas review at the time of removal is not the sort of judicial review that bars collateral attack on the alien removal order in an action for criminal 
there is something to be said for reading the terms differently in these two parts of the same statute.see atl.cleaners dyers united states.as a matter of reality,section d,which sets forth the conditions under which an alien may collaterally attack his removal order,was a codification of the supreme court decision in.see united states grey,cir not precedential united states copeland,cir united states wilson,at motz,concurring citing to legislative history united states,cir united states,cir overruled on other grounds by united states,cir.expressly observed that any alien held in custody pursuant to an order of deportation may obtain judicial review of that order in a habeas corpus proceeding.at.where a congressional provision implements a supreme court ruling,there is a compelling reason to adopt an operative definition used in that ruling.see slack mcdaniel,d.
furthermore,realism compels us to acknowledge that when congress used the term judicial review in enacting section d,it may not have anticipated that five years later the supreme court would narrowly construe the same phrase in the context of section to exclude habeas review.see cyr,at.scalia,dissenting.thus,we can not confidently assert that congress intended that the term judicial review be defined identically in both sections.
in fact,the cyr court interpretation of the phrase judicial review in section was strongly affected by the canon of constitutional avoidance,see at,which impels a court to narrow statutory language when necessary to confronting a statutory clash with the constitution.see,crowell benson.united states bishop,cir.the court believed that if the preclusion of judicial review under section were read broadly to include preclusion of habeas review,the resulting bar might amount to an unconstitutional suspension of habeas corpus.see cyr,at.we need not import cyr s narrow interpretation of judicial review into another provision in the statute where there is no such issue of constitutional avoidance.
on the other hand,we acknowledge the argument in favor of construing the term judicial review in section d as we construe the same term in section after cyr.as a general canon of construction,the same words in the same statute are interpreted in the same way.see ridgeway estate,cir.and it is not nonsensical to interpret section d as requiring direct judicial not merely habeas foreclose a later collateral attack on the original removal.for,as we have held,the scope of direct review is broader than the scope of habeas review.see bakhtriger,at.congress could have intended that collateral review be foreclosed only by the fuller form of prior court review afforded by direct appeal,although frankly we see no evidence that congress had this distinction in view when it enacted section d see conf,at,reprinted in.
at any rate,we need not conclusively resolve what suffices to constitute judicial review under section d.torres collateral challenge suffers from a more obvious can not establish that his removal order was fundamentally unfair as required by section d.we will therefore assume,arguendo,that torres was denied a meaningful opportunity for judicial review.
of the seven published cases factually similar to this one decided by the courts of appeals in the wake of cyr,most have been decided on the ground that the alien failed to establish that the underlying removal proceeding was fundamentally unfair compare,at,and wilson,at,and,at,and,at,and united states,cir remanding for findings on whether alien had established prejudice and,therefore,fundamental unfairness,with,at dismissing indictment and holding that alien had successfully challenged underlying removal order and,at upholding conviction because alien was afforded meaningful judicial review.
this court has not yet had occasion to construe the term fundamental unfair ness as it is used in section d.we must determine,therefore,what must be shown in order to establish that a removal proceeding was fundamentally unfair within the meaning of d.
in measuring whether an alien removal proceeding was fundamentally unfair,most circuits ask whether the alien was denied due process.see,at,at wilson,at,at,at.we agree that f undamental fairness is a question of procedure,at.
as the supreme court and this court have repeatedly observed,removal proceedings are civil in nature.see harisiades shaughnessy.perez elwood,cir.aliens in removal proceedings are entitled to due process,though the procedural protections accorded to them in that context measure less than the panoply available to a criminal defendant.see dia ashcroft,cir en banc,at.the fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.mathews eldridge,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted see also dia,at.more specifically,in the removal context,due process requires that an alien who faces removal be provided notice of the charges against him,a hearing before an executive or administrative tribunal,and a fair opportunity to be heard,at citing kwong hai chew colding.torres does not contend he was denied any of these.
rather,torres contends that his removal proceeding was rendered fundamentally unfair by the ij erroneous accordance with the interpretation of the torres was not eligible for discretionary relief.torres essentially argues that the ij error of law ro
