daniel pleaded guilty to one count of being an illegal alien found in the united states after deportation,in violation of a and b.at the sentencing hearing,the district court departed downward from the applicable sentencing guideline range by reducing the offense level that would otherwise have resulted.because we find that the district court erred in departing downward when the defendant did not meet the sentencing commission enumerated requirements for such a departure,we vacate the sentence in this case and remand for resentencing.
daniel is a native and citizen of mexico who entered the united states in when he was years old.he remained in the united states and resided in the rockingham,north carolina area.in,was convicted in north carolina state court for,inter alia,misdemeanor death by motor vehicle,in violation of.a,and felony failure to stop after an accident and to remain at the scene,in violation of.a.the charges arose out of a motor vehicle accident in which attempted to pass the car in front of him at the same time that a third vehicle,which was behind,attempted to pass as well.vehicle collided with the third vehicle.that vehicle flipped over and the driver of that car,a deputy sheriff,was killed.fled the scene of the accident and was later arrested.received a five year sentence and was released from prison on october.
while incarcerated,married an american citizen.once he was released from prison,he remained in the united states.he applied for and received a work permit and found employment in north carolina.however,a change in the immigration laws required that any who,like,had a previous felony conviction be deported.the law applied retroactively and as a result,was deported in march.
at some point after his deportation,returned to the united states illegally.on june,ins agents arrested.he was charged with violating a and b,which made illegal the of a deported alien after conviction for an aggravated felony.he pleaded guilty to being an illegal alien found in the united states after deportation.a presentence report psr was then prepared for sentencing.
the psr classified the misdemeanor death by motor vehicle as a felony because it was punishable by a term of up to two years in prison and thus qualified as a felony for these purposes.see a defining aggravated felony.because his prior deportation arose from a conviction for an aggravated felony,the psr recommended that receive an offense level enhancement under sentencing guidelines manual b a.the addition of a level enhancement to the base offense level of,sentencing guidelines manual a,partially offset by a level credit for acceptance of responsibility,sentencing guidelines manual,resulted in a total offense level of.had a criminal history category of iii.therefore,according to the sentencing guidelines,the range for imprisonment was to months in prison.conceded that the psr properly calculated his offense level and the district court ratified the parties agreement on this issue.
although he conceded that the psr properly calculated his offense level under,requested a downward departure based,inter alia,on the alleged relative lack of seriousness of the offense that triggered the aggravated felony enhancement.argued that the district court could depart under a heartland theory.see sentencing guidelines manual ch,pt.a,introductory cmt.b.the united states opposed such a departure and argued that application note,sentencing guidelines manual,cmt,delineated the only circumstances under which a district court could consider a departure based on the seriousness of the underlying felony.application note allows a downward departure as follows 
if subsection b a applies the aggravated felony enhancement,and a the defendant has previously been convicted of only one felony offense b such offense was not a crime of violence or firearms offense and c the term of imprisonment imposed for such an offense did not exceed one year,a downward departure may be warranted based on the seriousness of the aggravated felony.
sentencing guidelines manual,cmt.the united states contended,and agreed,that he did not satisfy the criteria set forth in application note because his sentence for the underlying aggravated felony had exceeded one year.the district court,however,determined that the convictions that triggered the offense level increase under b a differed in kind from the offenses the sentencing commission intended to subject to the aggravated felony enhancement,notwithstanding the fact that failed to meet the criteria set forth in application note.the district court then departed downward eight offense levels,shifting the imprisonment range from months to months,and sentenced to months in prison.the united states appeals and challenges the authority of the district court to depart downward in this case.
contends that he was due a downward departure because his prior felony conviction was outside the heartland of aggravated felonies.he fails,however,to meet the criteria the sentencing commission commission set forth in application note for downward departures based on the seriousness of the aggravated felony.the commission has specifically set forth the criteria for when a downward departure should be made based on the seriousness of the prior felony conviction and we are not in a position to second guess that decision.
a sentencing court may depart and impose a sentence outside the range established by the applicable guidelines,if the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind,or to a degree,not adequately taken into account by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.sentencing guidelines manual quoting b.with the exception of a few factors that the guidelines specifically note may not be considered as grounds for departures by the sentencing court,the guidelines do not limit the kinds of factors,whether or not mentioned anywhere else in the guidelines,that could constitute grounds for departure in an unusual case.koon united states,d quoting sentencing guidelines manual ch,pt.a,introductory cmt.b.however,because the guidelines were established,inter alia,to create uniformity and regularity in the sentencing of similarly situated defendants,b efore a departure is permitted,certain aspects of the case must be found unusual enough for it to fall outside the heartland of cases in the guideline.id.at.this is often referred to as the heartland theory for departures.see sentencing guidelines manual ch,pt.a,introductory cmt.b.
a district court may determine that a case does not fall within the guideline heartland and exercise its discretion to depart downward only if the circumstances and consequences of a case are atypical or unusual.united states rybicki,cir citing b.a district court must decide what,if any,circumstances or consequences of the offense make the case atypical and identify those factors for consideration in sentencing.id.once the district court has identified factors which could potentially remove a case from the heartland,each factor must be identified according to the guidelines classification as a forbidden,encouraged,discouraged,or unmentioned basis for departure.id.encouraged factors are normally an appropriate basis for departure,unless the factors have been adequately taken into account by the applicable guideline.see koon,at.rybicki,at.conversely,discouraged factors may only be relied on for a departure in exceptional cases.koon,at.quoting sentencing guidelines manual ch,pt.h,introductory cmt.rybicki,at.departures based on unmentioned factors should be highly infrequent.koon,at.quoting sentencing guidelines manual ch,pt.a,cmt.b rybicki,at.finally,forbidden factors may not be considered at all.koon,at.
argues that the facts of his case were atypical and as such were not adequately considered by the commission.we disagree.given the comprehensive sentencing structure embodied in the guidelines,o nly rarely will we conclude that a factor was not adequately taken into consideration by the commission.united states weinberger,cir quoting united states jones,cir.in drafting the enhancement provision at issue in this case,the commission explicitly adopted the broad definition of aggravated felony contained in a.see sentencing guidelines manual,cmt.in so doing,the commission expressly recognized that the crimes that trigger the adjustment from subsection b a the level aggravated felony enhancement vary widely.sentencing guidelines manual,cmt.while appellant argues that the aggravated felony of which he was convicted,death by motor vehicle,did not involve any criminal intent and for that reason is distinguishable from the other aggravated felonies,the commission adopted a broad definition of aggravated felony that included this offense.the commission then dealt directly with potential problems that could result from such a broad definition.it established three criteria that must be met before a district court may consider a downward departure based on the seriousness of the underlying felony.appellant did not meet those criteria,and to excuse that failure now would simply be to substitute our judgment for that of the commission.
when the district court opted to depart based on a general heartland principle,sentencing guidelines manual,it did not address the commission directives in the commentary to.the commission,by establishing three criteria that must be met before a downward departure may be considered based on the seriousness of the underlying felony,defined the heartland of cases included in to be all those not covered by the criteria in application note.to allow courts to redefine the heartland of cases and then depart when they believe the sentence is outside this heartland ignores the goals of regularity and uniformity in sentencing that the guidelines were designed to promote.
this approach to the sentencing guidelines generally,and to specifically,has already been adopted by four other circuits see united states,cir united states,cir,cert.denied,d united states,cir,cert.denied,d united states tappin,cir,cert.denied,d.as the tenth circuit noted in,the commission had acknowledged the possibility that,because of the large number of qualifying aggravated felonies,the enhancement provision would apply frequently and may result in a disproportionately harsh sentence.at.however,the tenth circuit also found that the commission,in promulgating application note,implicitly defined the heartland of such cases to be all those not falling within the class delineated therein.id.at.thus,the tenth circuit concluded that a district court lack s discretion to depart under based on the seriousness of the underlying felony when the defendant fails to satisfy the requirements of application note.id.at.we agree with this reasoning.
the second circuit reasoning in tappin is similarly sound.see at.there,the court stated that t o permit a sentencing court in these circumstances to depart downwardly absent satisfaction of all three criteria in application note would render the note effectively meaningless.id.at.
contends that we should read application note as setting forth criteria that,when met,turn the seriousness of the aggravated felony into an encouraged factor for departure.and when the criteria in note are not met,a departure based on the seriousness of or lack of intent required for the aggravated felony is simply an unmentioned or even a discouraged factor for departure.in other words,argues that application note does not prohibit a downward departure when the criteria are not met,it just does not encourage such a departure.to begin with,urging a downward departure based on a discouraged or unmentioned factor would hardly resolve the matter in favor.as noted,the supreme court has emphasized that discouraged factors may be the basis for departure only in exceptional cases and departures based on unmentioned factors will be highly infrequent,koon,at,and it is anything but clear that a lethal automobile crash where someone flees the scene and is then sentenced to five years in prison represents the sort of circumstances that would warrant departing downward on that basis.in all events,like the second circuit in tappin,we find nothing in the sentencing guidelines,policy statements,and official commentary of the sentencing commission,b,to support appellant reading of application note.see tappin,at.
the commission took into account the varying severities of aggravated felonies when it promulgated application note and defined the heartland of by exclusion,at.because this factor was adequately taken into account by the commission when was promulgated,it is not the proper basis for a departure unless the defendant has met the criteria enumerated in application note.b.to find otherwise would reduce the criteria set forth in application note to a mere suggestion that sentencing courts may disregard as they see fit.
at heart this case is disarmingly simple.the sentencing commission set forth three criteria that must be satisfied before a downward departure may be warranted.did not meet those three criteria and thus was not eligible for a downward departure.because he received such a departure,we must vacate the sentence in his case 
vacated and remanded.
i respectfully dissent.the majority decision to deny daniel a downward departure diminishes the special power that the sentencing guidelines give district courts to determine whether a particular factor takes a case out of the heartland of typical cases covered by each guideline.because underlying crime of misdemeanor death by vehicle lacks the element of criminal intent found in other aggravated felonies,the district court properly determined that case is sufficiently atypical to warrant an downward departure.
who is an alien,pled guilty to reentering the united states illegally after he had been deported.see a.he was deported following a conviction in north carolina for misdemeanor death by motor vehicle.the guideline covering illegal reentry,calls for a enhancement if the defendant was deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony.b a.application note of the guideline incorporates the definition of aggravated felony appearing at a,cmt.misdemeanor death by vehicle qualifies as an aggravated felony under a f because it was a crime of violence that carried a prison term of at least one year.the district court departed downward from the enhancement on the ground that predicate offense the motor vehicle crime lacked the element of intent,thus placing it outside the heartland of aggravated felonies.the district court found that the sentencing commission in promulgating guidelines b a did not take into consideration those offenses classified as aggravated felonies where there was no criminal intent on the part of the defendant or the offense was committed unintentionally.in concluding that it was free to depart downward,the court emphasized that misdemeanor death by motor vehicle does not require any criminal intent,which distinguishes it from other aggravated felonies.
the majority contends that lack of criminal intent can never be a basis for downward departure under because application note provides the exclusive criteria for departing downward based on the seriousness of the underlying felony.application note reads as follows 
aggravated felonies that trigger the adjustment from subsection b a vary widely.if subsection b a applies,and a the defendant has previously been convicted of only one felony offense b such offense was not a crime of violence or firearms offense and c the term of imprisonment imposed for such offense did not exceed one year,a downward departure may be warranted based on the seriousness of the aggravated felony.
cmt.according to the majority,the commission defined the heartland of cases included in to be all those not covered by the three criteria in application note.ante at.because can not meet all of the criteria of application note,the majority concludes that his case is within the heartland,making him ineligible for a downward departure.i respectfully suggest,for the following reasons,that the majority is wrong.
the sentencing statute authorizes a district court to depart when it finds an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind,or to a degree,not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines.b.each guideline carve s out a heartland,a set of typical cases embodying the conduct that the guideline describes.ch,pt.a,introductory cmt.b.as the supreme court has said,b efore a departure is permitted,certain aspects of a case must be found unusual enough for it to fall outside the heartland of cases in the guidelines.koon united states,d.it is the atypical case,one to which a particular guideline linguistically applies but where conduct significantly differs from the norm,that may be outside the heartland and suitable for a departure.ch,pt.a,introductory cmt.b.the commission lists several factors that are never a basis for departure.these are race,sex,national origin,creed,religion,and socioeconomic status lack of guidance as a youth drug or alcohol dependence economic coercion and duress and rehabilitation.apart from these relatively few factors,the commission does not intend to limit the kinds of factors that could constitute grounds for taking a case out of the heartland and departing if the case is sufficiently unusual.ch,pt.a,introductory cmt.b.
the majority holds that lack of criminal intent,which is not mentioned in application note,can never be a factor that might take a case out of the heartland of aggravated felonies and provide a basis for departure under the catchall provision.the holding thus has the effect of categorically proscribing lack of criminal intent as a basis for departure.this result contradicts what the supreme court and our court have said.it also overlooks the commission formal practice of specifically listing any factor that can not provide grounds for departure.as the supreme court put it in koon,the commission has determin ed that,with few exceptions,departure factors should not be ruled out on a categorical basis.koon,at.we have said the same thing any factor not expressly forbidden by the guidelines potentially may serve as a basis for departure.united states debeir,cir quoting united states brock,cir emphasis added.when the guidelines intend to proscribe categorically a factor as a basis for departure,they do so expressly and clearly.see,stating that race,sex,national origin,creed,are factors that are not relevant in the determination of a sentence.all of this means that a federal court examination of whether a factor can ever be an appropriate basis for departure is limited to determining whether the commission has proscribed,as a categorical matter,consideration of the factor.koon,at.
application note does not categorically proscribe lack of criminal intent as a factor.the note is not written in absolute terms.it begins by recognizing that a ggravated felonies that trigger the adjustment from subsection b a vary widely,cmt.it then lists three criteria which,if present,may warrant a downward departure based on the seriousness of the aggravated felony.id.nowhere does the application note say that these criteria provide the only basis for taking a case out of the heartland and awarding a downward departure when the underlying crime is less serious than the typical one covered by b a.because the commission has not categorically proscribed lack of criminal intent as a factor that can be considered for taking a case outside of heartland and departing,the majority is wrong to hold that the district court could not consider that factor.
furthermore,the majority ignores the theory and structure of the guidelines when it contends that application note implicitly defines what lies inside the heartland of b a by listing criteria that might take a case outside the heartland.the majority concludes that the heartland of typical cases includes all cases not covered by the three listed criteria and that only those cases satisfying the three criteria are outside the heartland.to reach this conclusion,the majority attributes to the guidelines a comprehensiveness that they do not claim for themselves.the guidelines were written with the realization that a sentencing system tailored to fit every conceivable wrinkle of each case would quickly become unworkable.ch,pt.a,introductory cmt.thus,the commission never intended that the guidelines would exhaustively consider every factor that might take a case outside the heartland.the reason is simple it is difficult to prescribe a single set of guidelines that encompass the vast range of human conduct potentially relevant to a sentencing decision.ch,pt.a,introductory cmt.b.in other words,factors that might take a case outside the heartland and allow departure can not,by their very nature,be comprehensively listed and analyzed in advance.see also ch,pt.a,introductory cmt.stating that the list of possible permutations of factors is virtually endless.the sentencing commission gives district courts discretion to depart under precisely because it is impossible for the guidelines to account for every potential factor in advance.consequently,the decision about whether a particular factor takes a case outside the heartland and warrants departure rests with the sentencing court on a basis.this decision is due substantial deference for it embodies the traditional exercise of discretion by a sentencing court.koon,at.the deference principle is basic because d istrict courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts in making the determinations relevant to departure,especially as they see so many more guidelines cases than we do.id.indeed,the supreme court has warned us that t o ignore the district court special the ordinariness or unusualness of a particular risk depriving the sentencing commission of an important source of information,namely,the reactions of the trial judge to the circumstances of the case.id.at.internal quotations and citations omitted.
the district court found that when the sentencing commission formulated guidelines b a,the commission did not consider that the prescribed aggravated felony enhancement might apply to a crime that lacked the intent element.the structure of the guideline supports the district court finding.when was sentenced,the guideline simply said that if a defendant convicted of illegal reentry previously was deported after a criminal conviction for an aggravated felony,increase by levels.b a.the commission,quite understandably,did not provide a list of aggravated felonies that would trigger the enhancement.rather,it incorporated the definition of aggravated felony appearing in the immigration and nationality act,a.the definition of aggravated felony consists of paragraphs listing dozens of specific crimes for example,murder and rape and general classes of crimes for example,a crime of violence as defined in that carries a prison term of at least one year.a crime described in the definition is covered whether it violates federal or state law or the law of a foreign country.a.the universe of aggravated felonies covered by the definition,and hence the guideline,is virtually endless.it is thus a fair inference that the commission did not,it could not have of the factors,such as lack of intent,that might take a case outside the heartland of aggravated felonies.
the commission has acknowledged,in substantially amending guidelines,that it had not fully considered the wide variations in the seriousness of crimes swept in by use of the aggravated felony definition.see app,amd.the commission recognized that the version of b a the version that applies to alejo alejo sometimes result ed in disproportionate penalties because of the level enhancement provided in the guideline for a prior conviction for an aggravated felony.the disproportionate penalties result ed because of the breadth of the definition of aggravated felony.id.the commission noted that sentencing courts had addressed the inequity built into the guideline by increased use of departures.id.the new guideline adopts a more graduated approach,so that now only the most serious felonies merit a enhancement,other felonies merit twelve or eight additional levels depending on their severity,and misdemeanors three are required involving violence or drug trafficking merit only four.t
