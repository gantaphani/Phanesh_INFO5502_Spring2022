husam fakhri hamdan,a native of kuwait and former resident of jordan,petitions the court for review of two orders of the board of immigration appeals bia,one affirming without opinion an immigration judge decision to deny his application for adjustment of status and the other denying his motion to the bia to reconsider its summary affirmance of the immigration judge decision.in both petitions hamdan requests that we review the bia use of its streamlining procedure to affirm the immigration judge decision denying him relief and ordering his removal to jordan.hamdan argues that the immigration judge made a legal error in adjudicating his application and that the bia erred in streamlining his appeal and affirming the judge decision without issuing a written opinion explaining why it refused to correct the alleged errors.in a related argument,hamdan also claims that aggressive questioning by the immigration judge during his adjustment of status hearing violated the due process clause of the fifth amendment.for the following reasons,we deny hamdan consolidated petition.
background 
hamdan,a palestinian born in kuwait in,initially entered the united states on a student visa in and then returned to kuwait in.in,hamdan,his parents,and his brother fled to jordan.while in jordan,hamdan obtained a jordanian passport and a united states visa,allowing him to travel from jordan to the.in december of,hamdan the on a subsequent student visa.he did not leave the upon the expiration of his visa in.rather,on september,hamdan filed an application for asylum with the immigration and naturalization service ins seeking political asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.
hamdan asylum application 
in his asylum application,hamdan claimed to have been mistreated in kuwait and jordan because of his race,nationality,membership in a particular social group,and political opinion.in particular,hamdan alleged that the jordanian police beat him because he was a palestinian who was critical of the jordanian government mistreatment of palestinians and also because he was a member of a particular social group that was persecuted,namely,palestinian refugees from kuwait living in jordan.
during his asylum hearing,he stated that he was a member of a political organization which he did not identify by name that held rallies to create an awareness of the mistreatment of palestinians in jordan.hamdan alleged that he was detained by jordanian authorities on five occasions in due to his membership in the unidentified group.hamdan testified that during his first detention,jordanian authorities interrogated him for three hours and slapp ed and kick ed him.he also claimed to have been beaten during his second detention he testified that his treatment was less severe during the other three detentions however,he claimed that on those occasions the jordanian officers threatened him with torture and warned him upon his release from detention that they would continue to monitor his activities.hamdan claimed that he left jordan in for the because he feared further persecution from the jordanian government.hamdan also testified that he suffered from depression and paranoid schizophrenia.his attorney claimed that the medical records demonstrated that his psychological disorders would cause him to react to external stimulus in a fashion that is more severe than maybe other individuals would under the same circumstances he argued that hamdan exaggerated response would be an injury to him above and beyond the actual physical beatings.
on december,the immigration judge ij denied hamdan request for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.the ij found that state department reports established that since the end of,palestinians living in kuwait were no longer routinely assaulted by vigilante groups.as for palestinians in jordan,the judge assumed for the purposes of his analysis that hamdan testimony was credible and that hamdan had in fact been mistreated while detained.nonetheless,the judge concluded that the experiences hamdan described did not constitute past persecution.the judge credited hamdan testimony that he felt vulnerable in jordan due to his depression and his subjective fear of persecution should he be forced to return to jordan.however,the judge noted that hamdan must also demonstrate an objective,fear of persecution in jordan and,on this issue,he determined that hamdan had failed.finally,the judge adopted state department reports which opined,it would be impossible to argue that palestinians are a persecuted majority in jordan,and found that palestinian refugees from kuwait living in jordan were not members of a designated social group eligible for asylum.
hamdan appealed the decision of the ij to the bia however,before the board issued a decision,hamdan mother was granted citizenship in the united states,making him immediately eligible to apply for adjustment of status to that of a permanent resident.see i b.because a successful application for adjustment of status would allow hamdan to remain in the indefinitely and obviate any need for him to continue with his asylum application,he filed a motion with the bia seeking a remand to the ij which would allow him to apply for adjustment of status.see id.the bia granted hamdan motion and remanded his case to the same ij who had adjudicated his asylum application.
hamdan application for adjustment of status 
the ij held a second hearing,this time on hamdan adjustment of status application,on december.at the hearing,hamdan testified that he entered the in on a student visa but did not attend the university of as promised in his visa application.he explained that he had several family members legally residing in the,that he had maintained sporadic periods of employment since his arrival in,and that he had obtained an associate degree in applied science from the milwaukee area technical college in.in addition,hamdan disclosed that he was under the care of a psychiatrist and had been diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.he testified that on one occasion his family called the police and had him hospitalized for seven weeks due to his mental illness.although he was taking medication for his disorder,he testified that he was admitted to the hospital because his medication was ineffective,causing him to act out.when pressed on cross examination for more details on why he was hospitalized,hamdan only reiterated that it was due to the inadequacy of his medication.he further revealed that,while hospitalized,he was arrested after he broke a window and attempted to escape.
on cross examination by the government,hamdan declared that he had no political affiliation at all,a statement which directly contravened his previous testimony at the asylum hearing when he claimed membership in an unidentified political organization.hamdan also admitted that,when he entered the country on a student visa in,he had no money and knew that his uncle did not intend to pay for his education.
following the government questioning of the petitioner,the ij asked hamdan some questions.he questioned him about the procurement of his second student visa in,and hamdan admitted that his first priority in obtaining the visa was to leave jordan,not to attend school.the judge then asked if he was hospitalized after his first arrival in the in.after hamdan said that he had not been hospitalized,the judge asked if he recalled testifying during his december of hearing that he had been hospitalized during his initial visit.in response,hamdan changed his previous answer and acknowledged that he had been hospitalized for seven to ten days in,shortly after his first entry into the,because he had experienced hallucinations.
next,the ij asked hamdan to explain the inconsistency between his position at the asylum hearing that he was detained because he criticized the political situation in jordan and his testimony during the adjustment of status hearing that he had no political opinion.during his asylum hearing,hamdan repeatedly claimed he was persecuted on account of his political opinion.then,on direct examination at his adjustment of status hearing,hamdan attorney had asked,d o you have any type of membership in or any connection with any kinds of organizations hamdan replied,i have no political affiliation at all.following his direct and cross examinations,the judge asked hamdan to clarify his statement that he had no political affiliation,inquiring,s o are you saying that you never in any way opposed the jordanian government when you lived in jordan prior to in response,hamdan stated,i did not oppose,no.i just was to object to the internal conditions in jordan living conditions,unemployment,taxes imposed,and this has nothing to do with politics.the judge reminded hamdan of his testimony at his asylum hearing that he was mistreated by jordanian authorities because of his political opinion,but hamdan denied making this prior statement and explained,i was talking about the situation.i was talking about the economic situation,but sometimes politics and the economy intertwine.he went on to testify i was talking about political situation in jordan,only about the internal situation in jordan because we were supposed to receive assistance.we did get the assistance and things like these,but i do criticize the government of jordan.after this disconcerting line of questioning,the judge concluded his inquiry and continued the hearing to receive more information from hamdan regarding his psychiatric history,diagnosis,and progress.
on march,the ij denied hamdan request for adjustment of status.the judge found that hamdan relationship with his citizen mother and other family members as well as his having obtained an associate degree favored the relief sought.despite these factors in hamdan favor,he ultimately concluded that hamdan application presented significantly more adverse factors that the equitable considerations.the judge noted hamdan mental health history as a matter of concern,especially given his lengthy hospitalization and recent arrest.he also determined that hamdan had engaged in a clear pattern of immigration abuse in obtaining a student visa without any intention of actually initiating or completing a program of study at the university where he promised immigration authorities he would enroll.in addition,the judge expressed his view that,in light of the testimony hamdan had given at his adjustment hearing,his claim for asylum now appeared suspect and might have been filed for the sole purpose of delaying his removal proceedings until he became eligible to adjust his status.in support of this view,the judge noted his earlier finding that hamdan failed to offer any objective evidence at his asylum hearing to support his application.the judge also pointed out the contradiction between hamdan position at the asylum hearing that he was politically active in opposing the jordanian government treatment of kuwaiti palestinians and his statement at the adjustment of status hearing denying that he had any political affiliation or opinion that opposed the jordanian government.the ij stated that although hamdan may not have fabricated his testimony at the asylum hearing,his asylum application now appeared to be frivolous in the sense that it had no merit and was not intended really to obtain political asylum but rather to enable the respondent to stay in the united states until his mother was naturalized.the judge determined,based on the testimony presented at the adjustment of status hearing,that when hamdan left jordan he was not fleeing persecution of any kind but was simply engaging in a very common practice of using deception to obtain a visa for an alleged purpose which he had no intention of complying with.finding that hamdan presence in the united states since is almost entirely based on deception,the ij denied hamdan application for adjustment of status in the exercise of discretion,denied his request for voluntary departure,and ordered that he be removed to jordan.
hamdan appealed the decision to the bia,and on october,the bia affirmed without opinion the ij decision,making the ij decision the final agency determination.see e.on november,hamdan filed a petition for review with this court as well as a motion to reconsider with the bia.see b.in his motion to reconsider,hamdan argued that the bia should not have used its streamlining rule to dispose of his appeal the ij violated the principle of res judicata when,after finding hamdan testimony at his asylum hearing credible for the purposes of that analysis,he determined at his adjustment of status hearing that hamdan asylum application had been frivolous,and the ij violated his due process rights by aggressively questioning hamdan during the adjustment of status hearing.on february,the bia denied the motion to reconsider in a per curiam order,finding that no error of fact or law existed in its earlier decision.on march,hamdan filed a second petition for review of the bia decision,and on march,we consolidated the petitions for review.
ii.analysis 
in his petition,hamdan argues that the bia improperly employed its streamlining regulation to affirm the ij decision to deny his application for adjustment of status next,he argues that the ij violated the principle of re judicata by crediting hamdan testimony at the asylum hearing and then later finding,after the adjustment of status hearing,that hamdan engaged in a pattern of immigration abuse.finally,he contends that the ij violated his right to a fair hearing as guaranteed by the fifth amendment due process clause when questioning him at the adjustment of status hearing.before proceeding to the merits of hamdan petition,we address our jurisdiction to entertain his petition for review.
until recently,we would have dismissed hamdan petition for lack of jurisdiction however,the relevant law has changed due to the enactment of the real id act of,stat.review of hamdan petition continues to be governed by a b,which prohibits appellate courts from reviewing i any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section h,i,or of this title,or ii any other decision or action of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security,other than the granting of relief under section a of this title.however,section a a iii of the real id act,enacted on may,qualifies the provision found in a b with the enactment of a new provision,a d,which reads as follows 
judicial review of certain legal in subparagraph b or c,or in any other provision of this chapter other than this section which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.
a d.with this amendment,congress restored limited judicial review of constitutional claims and questions of law presented in petitions for review of final removal orders.furthermore,in the real id act,congress explicitly mandated that the amendment restoring our jurisdiction be retroactive.gonzales,cir see also ramos gonzales,cir.specifically,the act declares that a d shall take effect upon the date of the enactment of this division and shall apply to cases in which the final administrative order of removal,deportation,or exclusion was issued before,on,or after the date of the enactment.real id act b.thus a d,as added by the real id act,retroactively applies to hamdan petition.accordingly,we have now been vested with jurisdiction to review the constitutional claims and questions of law presented in hamdan petition.
a.the bia use of the streamlining procedure 
before we address the legal and constitutional questions presented by hamdan,whether the ij violated the principle of res judicata or hamdan due process briefly address his challenge to the procedural posture of this case.hamdan argues that his appeal was not appropriate for review and summary affirmance by the bia since the ij made a legal error in denying his application for adjustment of status.he further contends that this alleged legal error require
