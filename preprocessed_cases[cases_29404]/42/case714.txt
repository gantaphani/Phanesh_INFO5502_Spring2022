leonel rosario mijangos,a citizen of mexico,seeks review of a board of immigration appeals bia decision denying his application for cancellation of removal.to establish eligibility for cancellation of removal,rosario mijango must show,among other things,that he maintained at least ten years of continuous physical presence in the united states immediately prior to his application.see ascencio rodriguez holder,cir b a.he was able to demonstrate this continuous presence except for two encounters with border patrol in,each of which resulted in what the parties term rosario mijangos voluntary return to mexico.the question before us is whether those voluntary returns were the result of a formal,documented process in which rosario mijangos was found inadmissible,which would sever his continuous physical presence and render him ineligible for cancellation of removal.we hold that they did.
background 
on september,rosario mijangos was served with a notice to appear pursuant to a.the notice alleged that he had entered the united states on september,without being admitted or paroled after inspection by an immigration officer,and that he was therefore removable under a a i.in removal proceedings,rosario mijangos admitted these allegations,but he applied for cancellation of removal under b.that provision authorizes the attorney general to cancel removal of,and adjust to the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the united states where,inter alia,the alien has been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than years immediately preceding the date of such application,id.b,a.the government argued that rosario mijangos was not eligible for cancellation of removal because of what it deemed a break in the continuity of his physical presence in the united states that occurred in the summer of.an immigration judge ij conducted a hearing to determine whether rosario mijangos was eligible.
rosario mijangos testimony 
at the hearing,rosario mijangos testified that he had first entered the united states,illegally,in october,when he was years old.he has now,and had in the summer of,a wife and two children,all of whom are united states citizens.on july,rosario mijangos left the united states to visit relatives in mexico.he attempted to return on august,along with several other individuals,but he and his companions encountered immigration officials one day after crossing the border.the officials brought them to a processing center,where they took rosario mijangos photograph and fingerprints.
at the hearing,rosario mijangos was presented with two documents,a form,a record of alien,and a form i,a notice of rights and request for disposition.both forms were dated august.the latter was written in spanish,which rosario mijangos can read,and it bore his signature.above the signature,and under the heading,request for disposition,were three paragraphs of text.to the left of each paragraph was a box in which a checkmark might be placed and a space for initials.the first two paragraphs stated,respectively,in spanish i request a hearing before the immigration court to determine whether or not i may remain in the united states.and i believe that i would face harm if returned to my country.my case will be referred to an immigration court for a hearing.the third paragraph,also in spanish,read 
i admit that i am in the united states illegally.i do believe i will face harm if i return to my country.i wa i ve my right to a hearing before the immigration court.i wish to return to my country as soon as arrangements can be made for my departure.i understand that i may be held in detention until my departure.
the box to the left of the third paragraph contained an x,rosario mijangos initials,were written in the space next to it and a circle had been drawn around the checked box and the initials.no such markings appear next to the first two paragraphs.rosario mijangos acknowledged that he had signed the form i,but denied that he had read it before signing.he further testified that the circle was already on the paper when it was shown to him,and he was instructed to put his initials inside it.he said he did not draw the 
rosario mijangos also denied that he had provided the information contained on the form i,for example that he had entered the united states to seek employment,or that he was single.he claimed that the officials interviewed his companions before interviewing him,and that they had entered the same information on everyone forms.according to rosario mijangos,an agent explained only that he was being sent back to mexico and instructed him to sign the form i.
rosario mijangos testified that he had wanted a hearing before an immigration judge,but he did not ask for one.he explained that one of his companions had requested a hearing,and that he overheard an official telling this companion that he would be deported if he went before a judge.after a few hours in the processing center,the immigration officers took rosario mijangos to the border so that he could cross back into mexico.
several days later,on september,rosario mijangos again entered the united states and again encountered immigration officials.he was brought back to the processing center.an officer asked his name,took his photograph and fingerprints,and told him he would be sent back to mexico.rosario mijangos was presented at the hearing with a second set of documents,again a form i and a form i,both dated september.once again,the form i indicated that rosario mijangos had entered the united states seeking employment,which he denied telling the officers.also as before,the third paragraph on the form i was initialed and marked with an x,and the form bore rosario mijangos signature.as with the previous form i,rosario mijangos admitted writing the initials but not the x,which he claimed was on the paper at the time it was handed to him.
rosario mijangos testified that he was told he would be returned to mexico,and that he was instructed to sign and initial the paper without reading it,that no one informed him he could see an immigration judge,and that he never asked to see one.this time,rosario mijangos spent a day at the processing center before he was returned to the border and crossed back into mexico.on september,rosario mijangos successfully reentered the united states without encountering any immigration officials.
ii.agent braulio garza testimony 
two border patrol agents also testified at the hearing.the signature of the first,braulio garza,appears on the i and i forms dated august.garza acknowledged that he did not have any specific memory of the encounter with rosario mijangos or of completing the forms but testified that he must have filled them out because he recognized his own signature.garza said that his job in august was to respond to agents who had detained individuals such as rosario mijangos,and he testified to his usual practices during that time.
garza testified that,after responding to the agent who had detained rosario mijangos,he would have brought rosario mijangos back to the station and interviewed him individually to obtain biographical information,which he would then have used to complete the form i.garza explained that rosario mijangos must have told him he was single,because garza entered information to that effect on the form i.garza also noted that he must have informed rosario mijangos that he could make a phone call if he wanted to,because garza had placed his initials and the date next to a statement on the form i that read,alien has been advised of communication privileges.after the form i was completed,garza testified,he would have fingerprinted and photographed rosario mijangos and entered his information into ident,a computer database operated by the department of homeland security dhs,before moving on to complete the form i,which he referred to as the voluntary return form.
garza testified that it was his standard practice in august to ask any alien completing a form i if he wanted to take a voluntary return back to his country so that he could leave immediately,or if he would want a hearing before an immigration judge.garza said he would confirm that the individual could read and then give him a copy of the form i to review,and while they reading the form,i also explain each of the possible scenario s that he could take,as described on the form.he noted that there was an x on rosario mijangos form i next to the statement notice read by subject,which indicated that these procedures had been followed.after rosario mijangos had been given an opportunity to read the form and ask any questions,garza would have asked him which of the three options he wanted to select.he then would have circled the option rosario mijangos picked and instructed him to write his initials inside the circle and to sign the form.although garza testified that he would have given rosario mijangos five to ten minutes just to read the form i before making a decision,he also said that typically,if everything went smoothly,the entire process,including completion of both forms,took approximately five minutes in total.
iii.agent mario reyes testimony 
the second border patrol agent to testify was mario reyes,whose signature appears on the september,form i.like garza,reyes testified that he did not remember rosario mijangos,but he knew he prepared the form i because it bore his handwriting and his signature.again like garza,reyes testified to his usual practices upon apprehension of an individual during the relevant time period.he said that after arresting individuals thought to be in the united states illegally,he would transport them to the station.there,he and his fellow agents would collect the detainees biographical information,which would then be recorded on the top of each individual form i.
reyes testified that it was his practice to read to detainees the notice of rights printed on the form i.that notice states 
you have been detained because the immigration service believes that you are illegally in the united states.you have the right to a hearing before the immigration court to determine whether you may remain in the united states.if you request a hearing you may remain under custody or have the right to be released on bond until the date of the hearing.you have the option to request being returned to your country as soon as possible,without a hearing.
you have the right to contact an attorney or other legal representative to represent you at the hearing or to answer any questions regarding your rights,as provided by the united states laws.upon request,the officer who served you this notice will provide you with a list of legal organizations that may represent you for free or at low cost.you have the right to communicate with the consular or diplomatic officers of your country.you may use the telephone to contact an attorney or other legal representative or a consular officer,at any time prior to your departure from the united states.
after reading this statement,reyes would read the three options presented on the form and answer any questions the detainees might have.each detainee would then make his choice and initial and sign the form accordingly.reyes testified that the form signed by rosario mijangos indicated that this procedure had been followed,as it bore an x next to the statement,notice read to subject by service officer,in the spanish language.reyes further testified that another officer prepared a form i for rosario mijangos,that rosario mijangos was fingerprinted and photographed,and that he did not know what happened to rosario mijangos after he left the station.
iv.the immigration judge findings 
following the hearing,on march,the ij issued an oral decision.he found that rosario mijangos,was arrested shortly after entering the united states without inspection,interviewed,photographed,and fingerprinted by dhs officials in connection with those arrests,and returned to mexico under safeguards following his execution of a notice of rights and request for disposition form i,reflecting his acknowledgment of illegal presence,waiver of a hearing before an immigration judge,and request for immediate return to mexico.the ij acknowledged rosario mijangos testimony that he was not offered a hearing before an immigration judge,that he never had an opportunity to read either of the two i forms,and that he was told on each occasion where to place his signature and initials.nonetheless,the ij credited the agents testimony regarding their usual practices and determined that those practices had been followed in rosario mijangos case.
relying on the agents testimony and the documentary evidence,the ij found that rosario mijangos was advised of his illegal status in the united states,his right to a hearing before an immigration judge,his right to contact an attorney to represent him at such a hearing,his right to communicate with a counselor or diplomatic official from his home country,and that he voluntarily elected and requested immediate return to his home country in lieu of a hearing.the ij concluded that rosario mijangos knowingly waived these rights,choosing instead to return to mexico,not because he was uninformed or was unwilling,but because his only goal was to get back to his family and home as soon as possible.and the most expeditious way to accomplish this,given his options,was to ask for voluntary return to mexico and attempt to illegally because to do otherwise might have subjected him to detention miles away from his family and home.
based on these factual findings,the ij ruled that rosario mijangos august and september,departures from the united states were pursuant to a formal documented process in which he was determined to be subject to removal,and were sufficient to terminate his continuous physical presence in the united states for purposes of b.he therefore held that rosario mijangos was not eligible for cancellation of removal under that provision.
rosario mijangos administrative appeals 
on april,rosario mijangos,through counsel,filed a notice of appeal to the bia,arguing that the ij had erred in holding that rosario mijangos continuous physical presence in the united states was interrupted by his encounters with the border patrol agents.the notice of appeal also alleged that the ij decision was erroneous because rosario mijangos did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his rights to removal proceedings,nor was he asked to do so,nor was he informed of such rights.finally,rosario mijangos marked yes in response to the question,do you intend to file a separate written brief or statement after filing this notice of appeal however,no brief was filed.
on march,the bia dismissed the appeal.the bia concluded that the ij factual findings were not clearly erroneous and agreed with the ij legal conclusion that rosario mijangos did not demonstrate statutory eligibility for cancellation of removal as he failed to establish the requisite years of continuous physical presence.more specifically,the bia held that rosario mijangos two encounters with border patrol agents,during which time he was interviewed,photographed,fingerprinted,and advised of his rights before agreeing to a voluntary return to mexico in lieu of an immigration court hearing,interrupted his physical presence for purposes of b,as he was subjected to a formal documented process pursuant to which he was found to be inadmissible to the united states.on april,rosario mijangos petitioned this court for review of the bia decision.
while that petition was pending,on june,rosario mijangos moved to reopen the immigration proceedings.attached to the motion was a brief in support of rosario mijangos administrative appeal of the ij march,decision.rosario mijangos asked the bia to reopen the proceedings in order to consider the brief.in support of the motion,rosario mijangos attorney,who is not his counsel on this appeal,filed an affirmation acknowledging that she had not timely filed a brief in support of rosario mijangos appeal and stating that it was difficult to explain why she did not finish and file the brief.
the bia denied the motion to reopen on november.it held that rosario mijangos had not submitted new evidence with the motion as required by c,and that,to the extent rosario mijangos sought reconsideration of the bia march,decision,his motion was untimely under b.finally,the bia held that the case did not present an exceptional situation warranting sua sponte reopening under.a because even after reviewing rosario mijangos brief in support of his appeal,it was not convinced that the respondent has established eligibility for cancellation of removal.on december,rosario mijangos petitioned this court for review of the bia november,decision.rosario mijangos petitions were consolidated on february.
discussion 
rosario mijangos raises three issues on appeal.he argues,first,that the bia erred in denying his motion to reopen.he contends that the agency proceedings should have been reopened because his attorney was ineffective when she failed to file a brief in support of his administrative appeal.rosario mijangos acknowledges that in order to establish ineffective assistance of counsel,he must show that he was prejudiced by his lawyer alleged shortcomings.he also acknowledges that the bia reviewed the belatedly filed brief and concluded that it would not have affected its decision to dismiss his appeal.however,rosario mijangos argues that he was nonetheless prejudiced by his counsel ineffective assistance because he may find his current appeal to this court limited by a failure to adequately raise the issue before the administrative tribunal under d,which authorizes this court to review a final order of removal only if the petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies available to him as of right.pet r br.
rosario mijangos remaining arguments echo those advanced in his untimely brief in support of his administrative appeal.first,rosario mijangos challenges the ij factual findings,and in particular his conclusion that rosario mijangos knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appear before an immigration judge.second,rosario mijangos argues that the ij erred in holding,based on these factual findings,that rosario mijangos encounters with border patrol agents and his subsequent voluntary returns to mexico constituted formal documented process sufficient to interrupt his continuous physical presence in the united states for purposes of b.
we hold that the bia did not abuse its discretion when it accepted the ij factual findings,as those findings were supported by substantial evidence.in addition,we affirm the bia legal determination that rosario mijangos continuous physical presence in the united states was interrupted by the events of august and september,and that he is therefore not eligible for cancellation of removal.because we have considered and rejected all of rosario mijangos arguments on the merits,he has not been prejudiced by his attorney failure to file a timely brief below.accordingly,his appeal of the bia denial of his motion to reopen is denied.
i.the agency factual findings 
rosario mijangos challenges the ij decision to credit the agents testimony regarding their usual practices and the ij finding that those practices were followed throughout the agents encounters with rosario mijangos.because the bia adopted the factual findings of the ij,we review the latter directly.see lin zhong dep of justice,cir.we apply a substantial evidence standard and uphold the ij factual findings if they are supported by reasonable,substantial and probative evidence in the record.yan chen gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the ij factual findings here are supported by sufficient evidence to satisfy that standard.the ij concluded that rosario mijangos knowingly and voluntarily signed two i forms,thereby intelligently admitting his unauthorized presence in the united states,waiving his right to appear before an immigration judge,and electing to return to mexico.this account of the events of august and september,is consistent with and supported by garza and reyes testimony,and by the documentary evidence.neither garza nor reyes specifically recalled their interactions with rosario mijangos,but they testified in detail as to their usual practices,which in both cases involved reading the i forms to detainees or allowing them an opportunity to read the forms themselves before selecting an option.the ij found this testimony credibl e and persuasive.rosario mijangos contests this finding,but witness credibility is an issue for the agency,see lin zhong,at,and its determination will not be disturbed by this court solely because of inessential discrepancies in the agents generally consistent and rational testimony,diallo,cir.moreover,the ij reasonably concluded that the documentary evidence supported the agents testimony.the markings on both i forms indicated that rosario mijangos had read their contents,or had them read to him,and both bore his signature and his initials.
rosario mijangos also objects to the ij factual findings on the basis that they are inconsistent with his own testimony,and in particular his averments that he was not informed that he could see an immigration judge and was not given an opportunity to read the i forms before signing them.the ij explicitly considered rosario mijangos version of events and chose not to credit it to the extent it conflicted with the agents testimony.he explained,in part,that rosario mijangos claim that he had been deprived of an opportunity to appear before an immigration judge was discredited by his own testimony that he never asked for a hearing and was never specifically told that he could not have a hearing.because it was reasonable for the ij to accept the agents testimony,he was not required to believe rosario mijangos conflicting account.nor was he required,as rosario mijangos suggests,to explicitly discredit each portion of the testimony that he did not believe.see xiao ji chen dep of justice,cir an ij need not enumerate and evaluate on the record each piece of evidence,item by item diallo,at w e can not agree with the petitioner that the bia implicitly found his testimony credible or that its failure to make a negative assessment amounts to a finding of credibility.
accordingly,we find that the ij factual findings are supported by substantial evidence,and we accept those findings for the purpose of evaluating rosario mijangos legal arguments.
ii.the agency legal conclusions 
the ij concluded,and the bia agreed,that rosario mijangos was not eligible for cancellation of removal because his voluntary returns to mexico following the august and september,encounters with border patrol agents severed his continuous physical presence in the united states.we review this legal conclusion de novo,giving deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,to the bia published,precedential interpretations of the immigration and nationality act.baraket holder,cir.
applicable law 
an alien seeking cancellation of removal pursuant to b must show,inter alia,that he has been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than years immediately preceding the date of such application.b a.the continuous presence requirement,however,does not demand actual uninterrupted physical presence in the united states.rather,a n alien shall be considered to have failed to maintain continuous physical presence in the united states if the alien has departed from the united states for any period in excess of days or for any periods in the aggregate exceeding days.id.d.
rosario mijangos represents,and the government does not contest,that none of his absences from the united states exceeded days,and that he had not been physically outside the united states for an aggregate of more than days in the ten years before he was served with a notice to appear.however,the bia held that his continuous physical presence was nevertheless severed by those voluntary returns under a rule established in the bia precedential opinion in re romalez alcaide,bia en banc.
romalez alcaide was a mexican citizen who had been residing illegally in the united states since.in,and again in,he left the country under the threat of deportation for a period of one or two days pursuant to a statutory provision that no longer exists.that provision,former section b,provided
