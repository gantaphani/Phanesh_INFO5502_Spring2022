alexander litvinov and his wife,alena litvinava together the litvinovs,both citizens of belarus,petition for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia,affirming the immigration judge ij denial of their application for asylum and withholding of removal.for the following reasons,we deny the petition.
procedural background 
on april,litvinov entered the united states on a nonimmigrant temporary work visa with permission to remain in the united states until december.litvinava followed her husband to the united states on september,on a nonimmigrant temporary traveler visa.on may,litvinov filed an application with the united states citizenship and immigration services for asylum under section of the immigration and nationality act ina,the application included litvinava as a derivative applicant.the application alleged past persecution and a fear of future persecution due to the litvinovs political opinions and membership in a particular social group.in his affidavit in support of the asylum application,litvinov claimed that belarus is a dictatorship,and it has gotten even worse during the time we have been in the united states.
on march,the department of homeland security dhs commenced removal proceedings against the litvinovs through notices to appear in immigration court and charged them as removable pursuant to section a b of the ina,a b,as aliens who remained in the united states longer than authorized.the litvinovs conceded removability but renewed their requests for political asylum,requested withholding of removal under section b of the ina,b,and requested relief under article iii of the convention against torture cat.in the alternative,the litvinovs requested voluntary departure pursuant to.
after a merits hearing on june,the ij denied the litvinovs claims for political asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.the ij found the litvinovs credible in most of their testimony but determined that some portions of the testimony were inconsistent.the ij concluded that t he respondents failed to carry their burden of proving that they suffered or will suffer mistreatment that amounts to persecution under the ina.the ij granted the litvinovs request for voluntary departure.
on october,the litvinovs appealed the decision of the ij to the bia.the litvinovs conceded that they had not suffered past persecution and only argued that they had a fear of future persecution.the litvinovs did not appeal the denial of cat relief on may,the bia issued a decision adopting and affirming the ij determination and dismissing the appeal.the bia concluded that even assuming credibility,the litvinovs had not presented specific,direct,and objective evidence to establish a fear of persecution.id.at.furthermore,the bia stated that the litvinovs fear of persecution on account of actual or imputed political opinion is speculative and not adequate to establish a claim.id.the bia also found that,because the litvinovs had failed to demonstrate their entitlement to asylum,they had failed to satisfy the higher standard for withholding of removal.
factual background 
from affidavits attached to the asylum application and testimony during the merits hearing,we gather that the facts underlying the litvinovs petition began with the belarus election,when alexander lukashenko became president of belarus.lukashenko remains the president and since his election,numerous reports from the state department have discussed the deteriorating human rights record in belarus,especially regarding mistreatment of people who do not support the government.these reports reflect that belarusian citizens are forced to support the government and accept lukashenko ideologies.
the litvinovs have never supported lukashenko.in fact,during lukashenko election,litvinava was a member of the local election committee,and she objected to the management of the election.litvinava alleged that lukashenko was elected through the use of fabricated ballots and fraudulent voting.litvinava claims that,based on her objections,she was forced to perform additional work duties for no pay and required to complete tasks outside the scope of her employment.however,this claim was not reflected in the asylum application.litvinava,an artist,also claims that,when lukashenko became president,she was never allowed to display her art because her work contained political messages.litvinov alleges that he and his daughter,viktorya,were targeted and mocked for having jewish friends in belarus,and that viktorya teacher referred to her as a stinking jew,although viktorya did not mention this during her testimony at the merits hearing 
in her affidavit,viktorya stated that,when she was a high school student,she became a member of the malady youth organization promoting the traditions of belarus.under lukashenko,the belarusian government prohibited the malady front,viewing it as an opposition organization.when viktorya was years old,belarusian police arrested her and other members of the malady front at a meeting.because she was under years of age,viktorya was released and was excused from paying a fine.viktorya also worked as a writer for the local newspaper where she composed an article about a valentine day parade where people wore red and white headbands.red and white were the colors of the belarus national flag which had been prohibited by lukashenko.viktorya was eventually fired from the newspaper because her valentine day article,and several of her other articles were viewed as opposing the government.
as an active member of the malady front,viktorya participated in,and helped organize,numerous protests.viktorya stated that,when her high school principal learned of her involvement with the malady front,viktorya was forced to transfer to another school.although her parents filed several complaints regarding viktorya treatment at school,they received no support from educational administrators in the government.
after her parents moved to the united states,viktorya remained in belarus to attend college,visiting her parents during the summers.at the university viktorya attended,the students activities were closely monitored,and the students were pressured to vote in favor of lukashenko.in,viktorya was denied her scholarship to the university for no official reason.when viktorya objected,she began receiving b in school,although she had historically been a straight a student.the litvinovs allege that viktorya low grades and other unfair treatment at the university were based on disclosures to her teachers that her parents lived in the united states.
the litvinovs son,maksim came to the united states on a temporary visa like his parents.maksim returned to belarus in to register for the draft.the litvinovs allege that,when maksim was being examined for the draft,the examiner discovered that maksim had been living in the united states,and the examiner insulted maksim and threw him out of the room without his clothes.
the litvinovs also claim that their friends and relatives in belarus have been difficult to contact.they allege that,when they can reach their friends and relatives on the telephone,they do not discuss politics for fear that they are being monitored by the government.several letters between the litvinovs and their friends and family in belarus have either never been delivered or have been delivered opened.the litvinovs allege that family and friends have alerted them that authorities have been inquiring as to the litvinovs whereabouts,and that several people have warned the litvinovs that they should not return to belarus.after disclosing that the litvinovs lived in the united states,litvinov sister,who lives in belarus,was asked to leave her job without any explanation.furthermore,the litvinovs claim that belarus recently passed a law that criminalizes expressions of government opposition.however,the litvinovs have not produced any specific evidence of anyone arrested under such law.
in the litvinovs petition for review,they argue that the ij applied an inappropriately high legal standard to their asylum claim,and failed to consider relevant evidence and testimony at the merits hearing.the litvinovs als
