we are asked to decide whether a conviction for possessing child pornography in violation of california penal code a is an aggravated felony under a i.we conclude that a sweeps in a broader range of pornographic depictions than the federal child pornography statute and thus is not an aggravated felony.accordingly,we grant the petition for review.
oscar chavez solis is a native and citizen of mexico who was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident in.in,he pleaded nolo contendere to possessing or controlling child pornography in violation of california penal code a.he was sentenced to days imprisonment.
two months later,the department of homeland security dhs took chavez solis into custody and placed him in removal proceedings.the notice to appear charged chavez solis with removability under a a iii as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in a i.section a i defines the term aggravated felony to include an offense described in,or relating to child pornography.
in proceedings before the immigration judge,dhs took the position that penal code a is an aggravated felony under a i because it is described in both a receipt of child pornography and a b possession of child pornography.chavez solis disagreed.pointing to the california court of appeal decision in tecklenburg appellate division of the superior court,d,he argued that,unlike federal courts applying the federal statute,california courts have held that a defendant who accesses child pornography on the internet can be convicted under a for possessing images found in his computer temporary cache even if he is unaware of the cache.
in an oral decision,the immigration judge determined that chavez solis a conviction constituted an aggravated felony under a i.the immigration judge compared the statutes and reasoned that t he essential elements of california penal code section a,as well as those under a b are essentially the same.acknowledging that tecklenburg construed a broadly,the immigration judge responded,that is exactly the point b oth state and federal statues sic are so broad they are virtually identical the immigration judge concluded that chavez solis was ineligible for adjustment of status,cancellation of removal,and voluntary departure,and ordered him removed to mexico.
chavez solis appealed to the board of immigration appeals.reviewing de novo,the board concluded that t he offense defined by section a is described in because the essential elements of the california offense are the same as those described by a and a b.as for the tecklenburg decision,the board reasoned that the defendant in tecklenburg did knowingly possess or control images of child pornography,and thus could have been convicted under.the board thus agreed with the immigration judge that a violation of penal code a is an offense described in and accordingly dismissed the appeal.
chavez solis filed a timely petition for review with this court.we have jurisdiction to review questions of law decided by the board of immigration appeals,a,a d,and w hether an offense is an aggravated felony for removal purposes is a question of law that we review de novo,chuen piu kwong holder,cir brackets omitted quoting morales alegria gonzales,cir.
we determine whether a state law child pornography conviction is an aggravated felony as defined in a i by applying the categorical approach outlined in taylor united states.under that approach,we make a categorical comparison of the elements of the statute of conviction and the generic definition of an aggravated felony,as found in a.aguilar turcios holder,cir.here,that means we must compare the elements of california penal code a with those of a and a b.
the statute of conviction here,california penal code a,punishes a person who knowingly possesses or controls any matter,representation of information,data,or image,the production of which involves the use of a person under years of age,knowing that the matter depicts a person under years of age personally engaging in or simulating sexual conduct.sexual conduct,in turn,means actual or simulated 
sexual intercourse,oral copulation,anal intercourse,anal oral copulation,masturbation,bestiality,sexual sadism,sexual masochism,penetration of the vagina or rectum by any object in a lewd or lascivious manner,exhibition of the genitals or pubic or rectal area for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer,any lewd or lascivious sexual act as defined in section,or excretory functions performed in a lewd or lascivious manner.
the federal possession statute,a b punishes a person who knowingly possesses,or knowingly accesses with intent to view,any matter which contain s any visual depiction if i the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and ii such visual depiction is of such conduct.another section defines sexually explicit conduct as actual or simulated 
i sexual intercourse,including,or,whether between persons of the same or opposite sex 
ii bestiality 
iii masturbation 
iv sadistic or masochistic abuse or 
v lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.
the statutes overlap in many respects 
both statutes require knowing possession,including knowledge that the pornography depicts a minor engaged in sexual conduct.the california statute is somewhat more clear on its face,as it uses the word knowingly to qualify possesses or controls and then again uses the word knowing with reference to the fact that an actual minor is depicted engaging in sexual conduct.the federal statute,by contrast,uses the word knowingly only at the beginning,suggesting that it might modify only the verbs it precedes possesses and accesses.nevertheless,we have held that a b scienter requirement applies to all elements of the offense t he government must show that the defendant knew that the materials portrayed conduct and that he knew that the materials depicted minors engaged in such conduct.united states merino balderrama,cir citing united states x citement video.
both statutes require possession or control.chavez solis tries to make something of the fact that the federal statute says only possesses,not possesses or controls as a does.but there is no legally significant distinction between these terms.we have explained that a defendant possesses child pornography under the federal statute if he exercise s dominion and control over it.united states romm,cir citation,internal quotation marks,and brackets omitted.
both statutes require that the matter depict an actual minor and define minor as a person under the age of.compare code a the production of the matter involves the use of a person under years of age and the matter depicts a person under years of age personally engaging in or simulating sexual conduct with a b the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and such visual depiction is of such conduct and id.minor means any person under the age of eighteen years.
finally,both statutes define sexual conduct to include much but not all of the same conduct.both statutes encompass actual and simulated sexual intercourse,oral sex,anal sex,masturbation,bestiality,sexual sadism,sexual masochism,and lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.compare code d defining sexual conduct with a defining sexually explicit conduct.
we have previously determined that the essential elements of penal code section and those of a b are the same and that there is no meaningful distinction between the two statutes definitions of sexual conduct.armijo.mukasey,app x,cir.we must now reevaluate our prior nonprecedential conclusion in armijo in light of new arguments,to which we now turn.
chavez solis argues that a prohibits depictions of a broader range of sexual conduct than a b prohibits.we conclude that a is indeed broader in this regard.chavez solis also argues that penal code a has been applied more broadly than the federal statute in cases involving child pornography found in a computer cache.in light of our conclusion that a is categorically broader than a b,we decline to address this issue.
section a broader scope is readily apparent from its text.the federal definition of sexually explicit conduct includes only five types of conduct i sexual intercourse,ii bestiality,iii masturbation,iv sadistic or masochistic abuse,and v lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.a.california definition of sexual conduct includes the same five types of conduct sexual intercourse,masturbation,bestiality,sexual sadism,sexual masochism,and exhibition of the genitals or pubic or rectal area for the purpose of sexual stimulation of the viewer.code d.but the california statute does not stop there.
california definition of sexual conduct,unlike the federal statute,goes on to include any lewd or lascivious sexual act as defined in section.id section prohibits any lewd or lascivious act upon or with the body,or any part or member thereof,of a child who is under the age of years,with the intent of arousing,appealing to,or gratifying the lust,passions,or sexual desires of that person or the child.id.a.
section is quite broad.as the california supreme court has explained,n othing in restricts the manner in which the prohibited contact can occur or requires that specific or intimate body parts be touched.people martinez,cal.a ny touching of an underage child is lewd or lascivious within the meaning of section where it is committed for the purpose of sexual arousal.id.at.and,as the language of expressly states,a touching of any part of the victim body is prohibited.id.at quoting code a.
taken at face value,california definition of sexual conduct must be quite broad too,as it explicitly encompasses the full range of conduct proscribed by.see code d definition of sexual conduct includes any lewd or lascivious sexual act as defined in section emphasis added see also people wallace,d,ct.app since sections and cover the same subject matter,we should construe them together so as to harmonize them,and if possible,maintain the integrity of both statutes,overruled on other grounds by martinez,at.
no provision of the federal statute definition of sexually explicit conduct can be read to encompass any touching on any part of a child body with the intent of arousing sexual desires.california child pornography statute thus sweeps in depictions of a broader range of sexual conduct than the federal child pornography statute encompasses.on this basis,penal code a is categorically overinclusive.
the government argues that chavez solis has failed to show a realistic probability,gonzales duenas alvarez,that a defendant would ever be convicted under a for possessing a depiction of a lewd or lascivious sexual act as defined in.we disagree.
in duenas alvarez,the supreme court clarified how courts should apply the categorical inquiry 
t o find that a state statute creates a crime outside the generic definition of a listed crime in a federal statute requires more than the application of legal imagination to a state statute language.it requires a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that the state would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.
id.at.one way a petitioner can show the requisite realistic probability of prosecution for conduct that falls outside the generic definition is to point to his own case or other cases in which the state courts in fact did apply the statute in the special nongeneric manner for which he argues.id.
but that is not the only way.we have explained that if a state statute explicitly defines a crime more broadly than the generic definition,no legal imagination is required to hold that a realistic probability exists that the state will apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of the crime.united states grisel,cir en banc citation omitted see also united states vidal,f d,cir en banc.accordingly,when a state statute greater breadth is evident from its text,a petitioner need not point to an actual case applying the statute of conviction in a nongeneric manner.grisel,at.the petitioner may simply rely on the statutory language to establish the statute as overly inclusive.vidal,at.
the statute of conviction here explicitly prohibits possessing depictions of a minor engaging in or simulating sexual conduct,as defined in subdivision d of section.code a.and d explicitly includes conduct any lewd or lascivious sexual act as defined in section that is neither included in nor fairly encompassed by the federal definition of sexually explicit conduct.under grisel and vidal,there is thus a realistic probability that california will apply a to depictions that are not covered by the federal child pornography statute.chavez solis has no need to point to any actual prosecution.
in any event,people wallace,shows a reasonable probability of prosecution under d lewd or lascivious sexual act prong.see d at.wallace involved a prosecution for,among other crimes,the offense of using a minor to produce a film depicting sexual conduct in violation of penal code c.like a,c incorporates the definition of sexual conduct found in d.the defendant,wallace,videotaped two teenage girls taking off their clothes in a seductive manner.one of the girls,at wallace urging,revealed her breasts to the camera,and both girls pulled their bikini bottoms away from the skin to show their tanlines.id.at.based on the videotapes,a jury convicted wallace of violating c.id.at.
wallace argued on appeal that there was insufficient evidence that the videos depicted sexual conduct within the meaning of d.the california court of appeal disagreed.although the court determined that the girls did not actually exhibit their genital,pubic or rectal areas,id.at,there was credible evidence from which the jury could draw rational inferences that the defendant did commit two or three lewd acts on the body of the victims,id.at.for example,the court noted,the defendant encouraged the girls to expose their bodies while he filmed them and,as a result of that encouragement,tina exposed her breasts and jenny pulled down a portion of her underpants.id.this constituted a lewd or lascivious touching because,as the court explained,the necessary touching may be done by the child victim on the child own person at the instigation of the defendant.id.
although the evidence was sufficient to convict under d lewd or lascivious sexual act prong,the court ultimately reversed the c conviction because it concluded that the verdict was tainted by the trial court any touching jury instruction.see id.at.in the court view,the touching of the victims had to be lewd and lascivious,regardless of the defendant specific intent.id.at.this interpretation of was later overruled by the california supreme court in people martinez,which adhere d to the rule that section is violated by any touching of an underage child accomplished with the intent of arousing the sexual desires of either the perpetrator or the child.at.but martinez did nothing to cast doubt on wallace determination that sufficient evidence established that the videotapes in question depicted a lewd or lascivious sexual act but not a lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.if anything,martinez clarified that wallace c conviction was not tainted by erroneous instructions and thus,in retrospect,should have been upheld.wallace thus clearly shows a defendant can be prosecuted and convicted under california child pornography laws based on the lewd or lascivious sexual act prong of d definition of sexual conduct.
the government contends that wallace should be distinguished because it involved a c prosecution,not a a prosecution,and that state courts have distinguished c,and other offenses that target the actual use of minors to produce images,from the simple possession offense at a.but the two decisions the government identifies people haraszewski,d,and people shields,d distinguished a only with respect to the question of how many crimes a defendant can be charged with having committed these decisions say nothing about the meaning of sexual conduct in the statute,nor has the government identified any state court decision applying the term sexual conduct more narrowly in a possession case th
