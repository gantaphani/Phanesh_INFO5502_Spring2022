maria cecilia mata appeals the sentence imposed following her plea of guilty to a charge of transporting an undocumented alien for financial gain in violation of.mata contends that the district court committed error by enhancing her sentence pursuant to b.she also contends that the district court committed plain error by delegating to the probation officer the authority to determine whether mata would be required to participate in treatment as a special condition of her supervised release.we conclude that both contentions are without merit and affirm mata sentence.
at approximately on may,border patrol agents stopped a ford escape at the checkpoint miles north of laredo,texas.a ford escape seats five.six people were in the car.mata was driving,her son was in the front seat,and seated in the back were a friend of mata who was over the age of eighteen,her friend minor daughter,and mata daughter.in the cargo area behind the back seat,underneath a pile of blankets,luggage,and a stroller,was a mexican national named edgar.border patrol agents discovered while inspecting the vehicle at the checkpoint.the agents arrested mata,who admitted to them that she was being paid to drive,who she knew was illegally present in the united states,from laredo to san antonio.mata was charged in a indictment with transporting an undocumented alien for financial gain by means of a motor vehicle under.she pleaded guilty without a plea agreement.
at issue in this appeal are two sentence enhancements that the probation officer applied after calculating mata base offense level as twelve under the united states sentencing guidelines first,the probation officer enhanced mata offense level to eighteen on the ground that mata offense involved intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person.second,mata received a enhancement because the probation officer found that mata used or attempted to use a person less than eighteen years of age to commit the offense or assist in avoiding detection of,or apprehension for,the offense.mata also received a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,so her final offense level was eighteen.mata objected to both enhancements at her sentencing hearing.the district court overruled her objections,adopted the presentence report,and sentenced mata to a term of confinement.
the district court also placed mata on a term of supervised release following her release from custody.one of the conditions of mata supervised release is that she is required to participate in a program as deemed necessary by the probation department.mata did not object to this condition before the district court.on appeal,she contends that it was unconstitutional for the district court to delegate to the probation department the determination of whether she would have to participate in a program.
we review the district court interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines de novo a district court f actual findings regarding sentencing factors are entitled to considerable deference and will be reversed only if they are clearly erroneous.a factual finding is clearly erroneous if,after reviewing the entire evidence,the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.a factual finding is not clearly erroneous so long as it is plausible in light of the record as a whole.a court of appeals may not reverse a district court finding of fact based only on its belief that,had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently and reached a different conclusion 
the district court did not err by applying the enhancement under b of the sentencing guidelines.whether mata conduct in transporting qualifies as intentionally or recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person as required by b is a question of law,so our review is de novo but we review only for clear error the underlying factual findings on which the district court based its legal conclusion 
the application of b requires a inquiry because the enhancement is intended to apply to a wide variety of conduct.a single,test is not necessarily appropriate for a guideline that must be applied to the wide variety of factual settings in which defendants transport aliens for financial gain accordingly,we have articulated a nonexclusive list of five factors to guide district courts in their application of b the availability of oxygen,exposure to temperature extremes,the aliens ability to communicate with the driver of the vehicle,their ability to exit the vehicle quickly,and the danger to them if an accident occurs.only the fourth and fifth of those factors are pertinent to this case.
out of this area of the law a few guiding principles have emerged.as to the fourth factor,we have affirmed the enhancement in situations in which it would have been difficult for the alien to extricate herself from the vehicle in the event of an emergency because the alien was jammed into a compartment or wedged into a tight space we have also upheld the imposition of the enhancement where the aliens,who were being transported in a van,were completely surrounded by boxes practically piled up to the top of the van that were too big for the aliens to easily move as to the fifth factor,the enhancement is proper only if the aliens would be in greater danger if an accident occurred than an ordinary passenger not wearing a seatbelt in a moving vehicle.as a result,the mere fact that an alien is transported in a portion of the car that is not designed to hold passengers is not,without more,sufficient to support the enhancement 
in this case,the district court made two findings in support of its decision to apply the enhancement.first,the court found that the stroller under which the was hiding would impede his ability to exit the vehicle quickly because it was not lightweight,clunky,and not that easy to move out of the way.second,the court found that it was likely and highly foreseeable that,in the event of an accident,the stroller would cause more damage and the injuries to would be much more severe than if he were just in the back covered with blankets.had we been sitting as the trier of fact,we might have concluded that the stroller would not have significantly impeded the alien ability to exit the vehicle but the contrary as it was by its viewing of photos of the stroller and other items covering,photos which have not been made part of the record on certainly plausible in light of the record as a whole.so too is its finding that the presence of the stroller in the car created a substantial risk that would suffer serious injury in the event of an accident.we thus conclude that these findings of fact were not clearly erroneous.as a consequence,the district court did not err by enhancing mata sentence for reckless endangerment under b 
nor did the district court err by applying the enhancement under of the guidelines.a defendant who used or attempted to use a person less than eighteen years of age to commit the offense or assist in avoiding detection of,or apprehension for,the offense is subject to a sentence enhancement under.a defendant uses or attempts to use a minor within the meaning of if the defendant directs,commands,encourages,intimidates,counsels,trains,procures,recruits,or solicits the minor at issue in this appeal is the portion of that authorizes the enhancement if the defendant uses a minor to assist in avoiding detection of the offense.the determination of whether mata used or attempted to use a minor to assist in avoiding detection within the meaning of is a conclusion of law that we review de novo,while any findings of fact made in support of that determination we review for clear error 
we have suggested,but never held in a published opinion,that a defendant who makes a decision to bring a minor along during the commission of a previously planned crime as a diversionary tactic or in an effort to reduce suspicion is subject to having her sentence enhanced under we so hold today,consistent with our previous unpublished decisions in united states zertuch
