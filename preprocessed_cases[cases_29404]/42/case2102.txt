the petitioner,amadou sarr seeks review of a ruling of the board of immigration appeals board that affirmed an immigration judge decision denying sarr requests for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief pursuant to the united nations convention against torture.sarr contends that he proved by sufficient evidence that he had suffered past persecution in his native senegal and that country conditions have not changed sufficiently to alleviate the threat of future persecution if he is returned to senegal.sarr also contends on appeal that he was denied due process by the immigration judge adverse credibility finding and by the board refusal to adjudicate certain of his requests for relief.because we conclude that sarr has failed to satisfy the heavy burden imposed upon him to overturn the administrative decisions in question,we must deny sarr petition for review relating to those determinations.in addition,because there is no basis upon which to conclude that the petitioner has been denied procedural due process,we can not grant review on constitutional grounds,even though we reject the government argument that the board decision in in re,bia,confers upon the government the power to prevent the board consideration of an otherwise meritorious motion to reopen or remand a request for adjustment of status.
factual and procedural background 
after studying english at a university in senegal,sarr entered the united states in on a visa as an exchange scholar.while the visa was still valid,he filed an application for asylum,in which he indicated that he had been politically active in an opposition party in senegal,resulting in his arrest and mistreatment following the general election.he also indicated that he had been detained for participating in a peaceful march protesting the results of that election,but he did not allege that he had been physically harmed in any way.summarizing his reasons for seeking refugee status,sarr wrote,i believe in democracy and i think that people should have the right to express their political opinion regardless of race,religion,
not surprisingly,this application was not deemed sufficient to establish grounds for a grant of asylum,which was denied in.however,sarr filed a second application for asylum in,and this time he detailed a series of events that,if established to the satisfaction of the immigration court,would arguably have made out a case of past persecution under the applicable statute,a a.he also testified in support of his application that he had been a member of the senegalese democratic party youth division for years,from to,and had participated in marches and other peaceful demonstrations against the ruling socialist party.even though he was employed as a high school teacher by the senegalese government for much of that time,sarr claimed to have suffered serious retribution for the expression of his political beliefs.according to his testimony,sarr was arrested numerous times as a result of his opposition activities,beginning in february,when he was arrested,jailed for one week,and beaten with a leather whip called a gourdin for writing a newspaper article critical of the socialist rulers.he told the immigration judge that in march he was arrested again,this time for demonstrating peacefully in the capital city of dakar,that he was jailed for seven to ten days,and beaten,whipped,and kicked by his captors a lmost every day,and that he sought medical attention after his release from confinement.
the petitioner further testified that he was arrested again the following month,on april,senegal independence day,at another peaceful demonstration.he claimed that he was jailed for one week or two weeks on that occasion and that he was beaten by the police with the back of a rifle.similar arrests and incarcerations allegedly occurred on december,in march,and in december.the last arrest also involved various democratic party leaders,including abdoulaye wade,the current president of senegal,and idrissa seck,the country prime minister at the time of sarr hearing.sarr testified that after that arrest,he was tortured and beaten,one of his ribs was broken,he was bound hand and foot and hung from a pole suspended between two tables,and police burned him with cigarette butts.
sarr alleged that he was arrested again in april or may,jailed for two weeks,tortured,beaten,hit with a rifle,and kicked.during that incarceration,he testified,his captors also warned him that continued protesting would result in further physical punishment for him and harm to his family.finally,the petitioner said that he was arrested in dakar in may and accused of being a member of the rebel democratic forces of casamance,ironically the organization that supposedly had kidnaped sarr just prior to this last arrest.he testified that he was,on that occasion,detained for three weeks and beaten so severely that he lapsed into a coma.upon recovering from his injuries,sarr said,he managed to escape from the hospital and hide out until he was able to secure his visa and flee from senegal to the united states in august.
unfortunately for sarr,he offered virtually no corroboration for his testimony at the hearing finally held in before the immigration documentation of his arrests,no hospital records,no copy of the alleged newspaper article,nothing other than a single affidavit allegedly executed by sarr political comrade in senegal that,because of its similarity to sarr own affidavit,appears to have been prepared by his attorney in michigan and sent to senegal merely for signing.the omission of corroboration proved significant in light of the fact that sarr had a large number of family members still in senegal who,presumably,could have supplied documentary evidence of the events that sarr described in his second application and at the hearing.he was also unable to explain to the immigration judge satisfaction why the asylum application had omitted the myriad details later included in the application,saying only that he had not had assistance in filling out the form and that he had simply forgotten to include in it much of what he later remembered to set out in the application.
citing the discrepancies between the two applications and significant inconsistencies between the application and sarr testimony in,the immigration judge discredited the petitioner testimony,saying that t he inconsistencies and discrepancies present in sarr claim are more than incidental misstatements they involve material facts that go to the heart of the asylum claim,and held that he had failed to establish past persecution.the judge also ruled that even if sarr testimony were considered credible,dramatic changes in the country conditions in senegal in the years since sarr left were sufficient to rebut any claim of fear of future persecution.indeed,the record reflects that by the senegalese democratic party had taken over the government in dakar by means of peaceful elections,and that some of sarr former political cohorts were then the highest elected officials in the country.as a result of these findings,the immigration judge denied all forms of requested relief asylum,withholding of removal,protection under the united nations convention against torture,and voluntary departure.
the board dismissed the petitioner appeal,finding both that the immigration judge credibility determinations were not clearly erroneous and that the record supported the conclusion that the conditions in senegal have changed significantly since sarr departed in.the board further denied the petitioner motion to remand for consideration of adjustment of status on two grounds because the government opposed the motion and because the immigration judge had concluded that sarr testified falsely at his hearing the petitioner now seeks review of the board decision.
