the panel granted a petition for review,holding that the board of immigration appeals erred in applying the real id act one central reason nexus standard,rather than the a reason standard,to an application for withholding of removal,and improperly placed the burden on petitioner to prove that he could not safely relocate within mexico for purposes of convention against torture protection relief.
declining to afford deference to the board precedential decision in matter of,bia,the panel held that by amending the asylum statute to include the real id act one central reason nexus standard,but not similarly amending the withholding of removal statute,congress did not intend for the one central reason standard to apply to withholding of removal claims.the panel explained further that the a reason standard applicable to withholding of removal claims requires weaker motives than the one central reason standard.
the panel held that there is no rogue official exception for cat relief,and that an applicant need show a likelihood of torture at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of either a public official,or some other person acting in an official capacity.the panel explained that cat relief may be based on the actions of police officers,even where they were not acting in an official capacity,so long as they carried out the acts or knowingly acquiesced in the acts.
the panel held that although petitioner bore the ultimate burden to prove a likelihood of torture,the board erred by placing the burden on petitioner to establish that he could not safely relocate within mexico to avoid future harm.
the panel remanded for the board to reconsider the withholding claim applying the correct nexus standard,and to reconsider the cat claim under the relocation standard.
kleinfeld,senior circuit judge 
we address the principal reason standard for withholding of removal,and also the acquiescence and relocation standards for convention against torture relief.at issue is why raul was tortured and whether he can be returned to mexico without likely being tortured again.
came to the united states legally from mexico as a little boy.he grew up in san pedro,california.his mother,brothers,children,and grandchildren are american citizens,but he never became naturalized,and he remains a citizen of mexico.was deported in because of convictions for felony methamphetamine possession and receiving stolen property.
after he was removed from the united states in,got a house in santa clara,a village in the state of michoacan,where he had relatives.two years after he moved to the village,men attacked him and demanded his gold watch and everything in his pockets.he refused to hand them over,so the men hit him on the head,kicked him in the face,and threw him off a bridge.the assault left him with a broken nose,broken teeth,and a wound on his head requiring more than a dozen stitches and leaving a two or scar.the men identified themselves by announcing hey,puto,no one messes with the familia michoacana.political opinion did not come up in this first attack,just the familia michoacana drug cartel pride in its power.
reported the assault to the police when he got out of the hospital.he told them la familia michoacana were the attackers.the police did nothing.his cousin was kidnaped by la familia the following year.a couple of years after that,his next door neighbor,who had built a grand house,was murdered when he refused to pay extortion.
in,was doing construction work on his house in santa clara when the incidents directly giving rise to this case occurred.four local police officers arrived at his home.recognized them because he got off the bus daily at the police station stop,saw them frequently,and had frequently seen them following him.when he opened the door,the policemen forced him inside,locked the door behind them,and asked him for his money.said he had none,but they did not believe him,especially because they saw all the building materials he had purchased for his home.
the four policemen then locked in his own bathroom for two days while they deliberated about what to do with him.on the third day they took him out,told him to call his family for money,and began burning him with cigarettes.his leg was permanently scarred,and he later showed the twenty or so scars to the immigration judge.called his mother,who was in the united states,but she said she had no money she could send.the four policemen thought he could get money if they were more persuasive,so one of them began hitting him all over his body with the blunt side of a machete blade.begged them to stop and said his mother was going to try to get money from his brothers.
however,did not merely beg.he also made a remark that annoyed the four policemen and could be construed as expressing or manifesting an political opinion.testified that he got a little bold and told them even if i had the money i would give it to you guys because you guys are getting paid for the job,i do pay no corrupt cops,nothing.
the torture became much worse after corrupt cops remark.the four policemen threw him back in the bathroom,but this time they did not just leave him there.they lifted his pants and put two scorpions on his legs.both scorpions stung.became feverish,swollen,and had trouble breathing.
while the policemen tortured him with scorpions,they also rubbed a dried corncob back and forth on his forehead to make him bleed and cause a permanent scar.they told him that if he told anyone what happened,they would put a bullet through his permanent scar.when begged for mercy,the policemen responded by threatening to cut his head off with a machete and slashed his leg,causing a deep laceration.then they locked him in the bathroom again.could not move and passed out from pain,fever,and difficulty breathing.
the next morning the four policemen were gone,and stumbled out of his house.his neighbors tried to help him.a police officer arrived and asked what happened,and told him that his colleagues had done this.the police officer stopped preparing his report,stopped talking to,and dropped him off him at the local clinic without saying a word.the police never asked to come in to identify the officers who had attacked him or for any other information regarding their identities.the local clinic where he had been dropped off refused to treat him once they learned that his torturers were police officers.a second medical facility likewise refused to treat him out of fear.fortunately,a third hospital,one about an hour away from santa clara,did treat his injuries.he was hospitalized for two weeks.approximately a month after his release,fled mexico for the united states because he felt that he could not trust the police anywhere in mexico,and the mark on his forehead would be,as his torturers had told him,where a bullet would go if he returned.
reentered the united states with a false passport and was eventually caught in.was charged,convicted,and imprisoned for illegal reentry and then turned over to immigration and customs enforcement ice.ice commenced proceedings to reinstate his prior deportation order.these proceedings are the subject of the petition before us.was found statutorily eligible for withholding of removal and convention against torture relief.
at his hearing before the immigration judge in,provided medical evidence to support his claims.as one example,when lawyer showed the immigration judge leg,she said may the record reflect close to cigarette burns or more on respondent left leg.government counsel conceded that he saw perhaps circular scars of some sort.counsel then pointed to an exhibit,a physician report saying that the scars were typical purposeful cigarette burns resemb ling the cigarette burns caused by torture.similarly,a physician report also confirmed a centimeter inches scar on his leg consistent with a deep laceration,with consequential damage to the veins and chronic swelling of the leg.remains on medication for his physical injuries,and for the stress disorder caused by his torture.the immigration judge found to be credible,and none of the horrendous facts concerning torture are in question.the issues in this case have to do with right to remain in the united states because of his torture,not whether torture occurred.
the immigration judge denied withholding of removal claim on the ground that the persecution was solely an effort to extort money by rogue police officers and not because of an expressed or implied or imputed political opinion and the threat came solely from the,rogue officers themselves and not the government.he noted that mexico has laws against torture and corruption,and thousands of police officers have been dismissed for violating them.as for the convention against torture claim,the immigration judge determined that had the ability to find someplace acceptable to his standards of safety to live in mexico.
the bia agreed.while the bia did not disagree that testimony was credible,the bia held that withholding of removal claim failed because he failed to prove that the harm he suffered was fueled by any political motives,even though expressed to his attackers that he was against police corruption.rather,the attacks were designed to extort money.as for the convention against torture claim,the bia held that did not show that any particular officer actions or acquiescence would not be that of a rogue official.the bia also held that the country is aggressively targeting corrupt government elements and that could relocate out of the area.
petitions for review.first,he argues that the bia applied an erroneous standard to his withholding claim.second,he argues that the bia failed to consider the mexican government lack of success in its war on gangs,and corruption and the nationwide danger facing him if he returned to mexico.
ii.analysis 
withholding of removal.
the attorney general must,in general,withhold removal of an alien if the alien life or freedom would be threatened because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.argues that his life and freedom would be threatened,at least in part,because of his political opinion.there is ample evidence in the record that the local police and the local drug cartel targeted him without knowing anything about his political opinion,merely because they thought they could get money from him.there is also ample evidence that the police escalated their torture considerably,from confinement,beatings,and cigarette burns,to scorpions,slashing with a machete,and permanent conspicuous facial disfigurement,after he voiced his opposition to police corruption.the parties dispute the extent to which political opinion must be the basis for the threat for the threat to be because of the political opinion.
for purposes of asylum or withholding of removal,it is not enough that a person comes from a wretched place,where life will most probably be far worse than if he remains in the united states.for asylum,a person generally needs to face persecution in his home country on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.the person seeking asylum has the burden of proving not only the prospective persecution,but also that it would be on account of one of the five listed reasons a person seeking withholding of removal must prove not only that his life or freedom will be threatened in his home country,but also that the threat is because of one of the five listed reasons the list of reasons for which relief may be granted is identical for both asylum and withholding of removal.
the words on account of and because of address the persecutor motive for persecuting the victim for example,if the persecutor has no idea what the victim political opinion is and does not care what it is,then even if the victim does reasonably fear persecution,it would not be on account of the victim political opinion.but what if the persecutor does have some idea of the victim political opinion and feels quite hostile to that opinion,but also has other reasons for persecuting the victim people,including persecutors,often have mixed motives.when is the persecution,motivated only in part by hostility to the victim political opinion,because of or on account of that opinion 
we adopted the second circuit position in our en banc decision in borja v,holding that persecution on account of political opinion did not mean persecution solely for that reason the victim in that case sought asylum because communist guerrillas in the philippines had pointed a gun at her and threatened to kill her when she said she was,but were also upset that she could not pay the increased amount of monthly protection money they demanded they persecuted her partly because she was and partly just for the money we held that persecution was on account of political opinion if it was so motivated at least in part.
our at least in part standard is no longer the law with regard to asylum applicants.congress amended the statute,so that for asylum,the victim political opinion has to be one central reason.when we decided borja,the statute did not indicate the appropriate burden of proof for establishing that persecution was because of or on account of a protected ground however,the asylum statute now states 
the applicant must establish that race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant 
but congress did not similarly amend the withholding of removal statute,and seeks withholding of removal,not asylum.the withholding statute just says a reason,not at least one central reason 
in determining whether an alien has demonstrated that the alien life or freedom would be threatened for a reason described in subparagraph a race,religion,political opinion,the trier of fact shall determine whether the alien has sustained the alien burden of proof,and shall make credibility determinations,in the manner described in clauses ii and iii of section b b of this title 
congress decision to adopt the one central reason standard for asylum but not withholding of removal claims appears to have been the product of a deliberate choice,rather than a mere drafting oversight.when congress amended the withholding of removal statute to clarify the applicable burden of proof,it clauses ii and iii of the asylum statute provision,but not clause i clause i is the provision that imposed the one central reason standard for asylum claims.congress express incorporation of two of the three asylum provisions into the withholding of removal statute,but not the provision including the one central reason language,indicates that congress did not intend for the one central reason standard to apply to withholding of removal claims.see kucana holder,where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.
the government argues that one central reason and a reason mean the same thing.argues that the different words used in each statute mean different things we agree with.the phrase a reason includes weaker motives than one central reason.
a person may have a reason to do something that is not his central reason or even one central reason.ordinary english usage,and the ordinary canon of statutory construction reflecting the same premise that when people say one thing,they do not mean something else indicate that we should attribute some operative meaning to the congressional decision to use the phrase at least one central reason in one statute but not the other sometimes omission of a phrase implies a negative pregnant,and sometimes it does not considering how controversial the reason for persecution has been in the immigration law community,the express congressional narrowing of one statute but not the other to one central reason can not reasonably be read so to narrow both.
the bia in this case followed its own precedent in matter of held that the one central reason test for asylum applies to withholding,even though the withholding statute says merely a reason.the bia came to this conclusion because the withholding statute is silent on whether the one central reason standard applies,the general intent of the real id act was to correct what congress saw as an anomaly created by borja and briones in mixed motive cases,and before the real id act the immigration and naturalization service ins applied the same standard to asylum and withholding this analysis starts with a false premise that congress was silent.it was not.it explicitly said at least one central reason for asylum,and a reason,an expressly different standard,for withholding.
the government argues that we should accept the bia view in because we assumed in zetino holder that the one central reason standard applies to withholding as well as asylum claims.zetino does not so hold.the alien in that case sought asylum and withholding,but submitted no evidence that the feared persecution had anything to do with actual or imputed political opinion his evidence was that masked gunmen murdered his family members to steal his grandfather land and that his home country,el salvador,was infested with violent gangs we drew no distinction between the one central reason phrase in the asylum statute and the a reason phrase in the withholding statute,because there was no nexus at all between the feared persecution and political opinion 
we hold that a reason is a less demanding standard than one central reason.the statutory language is unambiguously different,with different meanings,so there is no ambiguity justifying deference to the administrative agency contrary view the different language should not be treated as though it means the same thing the withholding statute differs from the asylum statute in various ways,not just this one,so there is no reason to assume that congress meant for them to be the same in this respect.the withholding statute requires applicants to prove that it is more likely than not they will be persecuted,while the asylum statute requires only a fear of persecution,so the lighter standard for the strength of the nexus is offset by the more demanding standard of proof in the withholding statute.since in withholding the petitioner must show a probability,not just a fear,of persecution,congress may have diluted the nexus requirement in order to afford more protection against mistaken deportations where a protected ground played into that likelihood.
that is not the end of the withholding issue,though.the government argues that the police kidnaped and tortured to extort money,so his voicing of a political opinion on the third day of his kidnaping and torture could not mean that the torture was because of or on account of his previously unknown and irrelevant to the persecutors opinion.the evidence,though,is not unambiguous.the torture became much worse after voiced his opinion.because the bia accepted the government view under the wrong standard,we remand to the bia to decide the case under the correct standard a reason rather than one central reason.
convention against torture.
congress provided that it shall be the policy of the united states not to expel,extradite,or otherwise effect the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture.it directed that the appropriate agencies should adopt regulations to implement the provisions of the convention against torture cat the implementing regulations are at.
for cat relief,the alien must prove that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country.the torturers motivations need not relate to the five protected classifications for asylum or withholding of removal,so can establish entitlement to relief under cat even if he can not establish motivation related to his political opinion what matters is the probability of future torture,which under circuit law includes killing carried out or knowingly acquiesced in by a public official all evidence relevant to the probability of future torture must be considered,including past torture and country conditions 
neither the bia,the immigration judge,nor the government brief,puts at issue whether ordeal amounted to torture.the issue is that to be entitled to cat relief,the torture must be inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.acquiescence of a public official requires that the public official,prior to the activity constituting torture,have awareness of such activity and thereafter breach his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.
the bia rejected claim on the grounds that the police who tortured him were rogue officials and he had not proved that he could not avoid the threat by relocating.here is the entire portion of the opinion explaining rejection of the claim 
we find no clear error in the immigration judge finding that there are insufficient facts in this case to support the legal determination that mexican officials,acting under color of law,will more likely than not torture the applicant or acquiesce in his torture if he returns to mexico.the facts here are simply inadequate to show such pervasive corruption that any particular officer actions or acquiescence would not be that of a rogue official at.as noted by the immigration judge,the mexican government laws and enforcement policies make it clear that the country is aggressively targeting corrupt government elements.the immigration judge also observed that the respondent could relocate out of the area where the attack occurred at.accordingly,the applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating eligibility for protection under the cat.
the portions of the immigration judge opinion to which the bia refers say,regarding the rogue official issue,that although drug cartel violence and police corruption do exist in mexico,the national government aggressively seeks to eliminate them 
here there is evidence in the country report of both drug cartel violence and police corruption.as mentioned,police corruption has been identified and targeted by mexican authorities.there are laws on the books and verifiable efforts to root out corruption in government.still,rogue elements do operate however,the mexican government laws and enforcement policies make it clear the country is aggressive against such groups.the evidence does not establish that it is more likely than not if the respondent was returned to mexico he would suffer torture at the hands of the government or persons acting in an official capacity or aiding or acquiescing in his torture by others.wakkarv holder,cir.
regarding relocation,the immigration judge says that both california and mexico have dangerous communities,and could relocate to any region where he feels safe and that is populated by individuals,businesses,and employers acceptable to his standards 
respondent has painted the entire country of mexico as a potential threat to him from a incident.the court is not persuaded that is the case.respondent has the ability to locate in any region where he feels safe or where he has access to authorities should he be threatened or attacked.whether in california or mexico,each region has communities that are both dangerous and secure.the key for respondent would be to locate in an area populated by individuals,businesses and employers acceptable to his standards.
the statute and regulations do not establish a rogue official exception to cat relief.the regulations say that torture,for purposes of relief,has to be at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.the four policemen were public officials,even though they were local police and state or federal authorities might not similarly acquiesce since the officers were apparently when they tortured,they were evidently not acting in an official capacity,but the regulation does not require that the public official be carrying out his official duties,so long as he is the actor or knowingly acquiesces in the acts.the regulation uses the word or between the phrases inflicted by a
