background 
procedural background 
malonga,a native and citizen of the republic of congo congo,entered the united states in august as an exchange visitor.his visa entitled him to stay in this country until august.in july,malonga filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection,asserting that he had been persecuted on account of his ethnicity and political opinion in congo.in september,the immigration and naturalization service ins charged malonga with being removable in accordance with a b.at a hearing,malonga admitted the allegations in the charging order and conceded removability.
in october,malonga appeared before an immigration judge ij and provided oral and documentary evidence in support of his requests for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection.in an oral decision in october,the ij found that malonga was removable as charged and denied all relief.the ij denied malonga application for asylum because it was untimely filed and because malonga explanation for the untimely not an extraordinary circumstance.alternatively,the ij denied malonga asylum because he had not shown that he had suffered past persecution and failed to show that he had a fear of future persecution.the ij also concluded that the kongo ethnicity was not a particular social group and that malonga had not been persecuted on account of his political opinion.next,the ij denied malonga motion for withholding of removal because he failed to establish a clear probability of persecution for the same reasons that the ij had denied asylum.finally,the ij found that malonga was not entitled to protection under the cat because he was not more likely than not to be tortured if returned to congo.the ij made no express findings regarding malonga credibility.
malonga appealed the ij decision to the bia,which affirmed without opinion in april.malonga filed his initial petition for review in this court in may and subsequently moved for an order remanding the case to the bia in light of a change in the bia policy in similar affirm without opinion cases.this court granted the motion,remanding the case to the bia with instructions to indicate the grounds upon which it affirms the ij decision.
in september,the bia again affirmed the ij decision,stating that malonga asylum application was untimely and that he had not established extraordinary circumstances necessary to excuse the untimely application.the bia also stated that it adopted and affirmed the ij findings with respect to malonga ineligibility for withholding of removal and protection under the cat.in october,malonga filed this petition for review of the bia final order of removal.
factual background 
at malonga hearing with the ij,he introduced evidence that he is a member of the lari ethnic group of the kongo tribe,which is a group identifiable by accent,dialect,home region,and surname.malonga further contended that he has a long history of supporting democratic reforms in congo and that he is or has been a member of various social and professional groups that oppose the congolese government,including the congolese movement for democracy and integral development and the collective of congolese scholars native from pool.
in,when malonga was fourteen,he participated in a demonstration against president marlen ngouabi.malonga stated that government forces beat him as they attempted to break up the demonstration and that he sustained injuries that required hospital treatment.in,malonga participated in another demonstration that the military forcibly disrupted.malonga claimed that police arrested him in for attending an opposition political meeting,detained him for hours,and beat him.
in,malonga,who had become a director of a farm,ordered his employees to strike as part of a larger national strike.malonga testified that officials in the administration of president denis demoted him,transferred him to congo capital of brazzaville,and ordered him to sit at a desk all day doing nothing.
in,malonga took part in an demonstration against the newly elected president pascal lissouba,which soldiers dispersed with violence.four protestors were killed and malonga received bruises as a result of the protest,but he testified that he was not seriously hurt.that evening,soldiers came to malonga house in search of him.when the soldiers could not find malonga,they marked his house with a cross allegedly indicating that it should be destroyed and wrote we will get your skin as a threat.malonga also received threats from lissouba supporters at work.
malonga testified that he had difficulty obtaining travel documentation in because a supervisor refused to sign his departure papers,telling him that he was a trouble maker and that he should be required to stay in congo and face the consequences of what he was doing.ultimately,malonga obtained the necessary signatures and traveled to the united states to study under a program funded by the united states agency for international development.malonga completed his master degree at southern illinois university in.
after his arrival in the united states,malonga claims that government forces destroyed his house.malonga also testified that he lost contact with his wife,child,and parents in congo civil war and that he believes that his parents are dead.malonga testified that he feared returning to congo because he believed that he would be persecuted.malonga also introduced reports from the state department and amnesty international,which generally describe the poor conditions in congo.
ii.discussion 
only the bia order is subject to our review,including the ij findings and reasoning to the extent they were expressly adopted by the bia.osonowo mukasey,cir.but we review both decisions when the bia adopts the ij decision but adds its own reasoning,as here.see setiadi gonzales,cir.
we review questions of immigration law de novo.tang ins,cir.we review an ij factual determinations under the test,which requires that those determinations be supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence.perinpanathan ins,cir.we will not reverse factual findings unless the petitioner demonstrates that the evidence was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find in favor of the petitioner.turay ashcroft,cir.
timeliness of malonga application for asylum 
malonga first challenges the ij refusal to excuse his untimely application for asylum.an applicant for asylum must demonstrate by evidence that the applicant filed the application within one year of the applicant arrival or april,whichever is later.see a b.the period may be excused only if the applicant can demonstrate changed circumstances or extraordinary circumstances.a d.
here,malonga does not dispute the fact that his application was untimely filed,and the ij determined that malonga excuse,his depression,was insufficient to qualify as an extraordinary circumstance.the ins argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the ij decision because of a,which provides that n o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the attorney general under paragraph.malonga attempts to avail himself of appellate review by arguing that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard in determining whether extraordinary circumstances excused his untimely application and that recent amendments to federal law confer this court jurisdiction over this issue.
we conclude that we are precluded from reviewing the ij refusal to excuse malonga untimely application.this circuit has routinely held that whether an untimely application should be excused involves the discretionary judgment of the attorney general and,as such,is unreviewable.see,mouawad gonzales,cir jallow gonzales,cir ignatova gonzales,cir.furthermore this court has already rejected malonga argument that the real id act of,stat,may,granted this court the ability to review such claims see mouawad,at.because the decision to excuse an untimely filed asylum application is discretionary and because this court has already determined that the real id act did not confer jurisdiction to this court to review the propriety of an ij refusal to excuse an untimely petition,we do not have jurisdiction to review malonga asylum claim.
withholding of removal 
to qualify for withholding of removal,an applicant has the burden of showing a clear probability,zhuang gonzales,cir,that his life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b b.the clear probability standard for withholding of removal is more onerous than the fear standard for asylum.see zhuang,at.
an applicant may make the requisite showing for withholding of removal in two ways.first,the applicant may show past persecution on the basis of one of the five protected grounds listed above,thus creating a rebuttable presumption that removal would threaten his life or freedom.b.second,the applicant may qualify for withholding of removal if he or she establishes that it is more likely than not that the applicant would be persecuted upon removal on account of one of the protected grounds.b.persecution is the infliction or threat of death,torture,or injury to one person or freedom,on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.ins,cir.persecution is an extreme concept and does not include intimidation and harassment.zakirov ashcroft,cir.
malonga challenges the bia affirmance of the ij refusal to withhold removal,claiming that the ij applied an incorrect legal standard in defining past persecution and,under the correct standard,a reasonable fact finder would be compelled to conclude that malonga suffered past persecution in congo the ij failed to recognize the nexus between each incident of malonga past persecution and two of the five statutorily protected grounds and the ij wrongly found that malonga did not possess fear of future persecution when he established past persecution,the service did not rebut the presumption of future persecution and the evidence of record confirms that individuals similarly situated to malonga are persecuted in congo.the ins responds that the ij findings are supported by substantial evidence and,therefore,the record does not compel reversal of any of the ij findings.
standard for persecution under 
because we agree that the ij applied the incorrect legal standard in defining past persecution as uses that term,we conclude that a remand for new findings under the correct standard is necessary.in denying malonga requested relief,the ij cited the bia cases,in re chen,bia,and in re,bia,as establishing the standard for past persecution.in re chen is the seminal case in which the bia described the standard for humanitarian asylum.unlike a typical claim for asylum or withholding of removal,which requires an applicant to establish his fear of persecution,humanitarian asylum may be granted in cases involving particularly atrocious past persecution alone.see cigaran heston,cir.humanitarian asylum,therefore,is more difficult to establish than ordinary asylum or withholding of removal.consequently,the ij measured malonga evidence of persecution for purposes of establishing withholding of removal against the heightened standard for humanitarian asylum.
the ij analysis further supports malonga argument that the ij applied an incorrect,heightened standard when analyzing his claim to withhold removal.the ij stated the following 
the mistreatment on which malonga relies is the period of political activity.that political activity gave rise to severe beatings in the when he was a student at a lycee,namely,in and later in when he was arrested and beaten by the police.i have considered this mistreatment and have concluded that it is not at the same qualitative level of severity as that which the applicants in in re and in re chen experienced.
addendum at emphasis added.thus,the ij compared the facts of this case,which raise ordinary asylum and withholding of removal claims,with the facts of in re chen,which involved humanitarian asylum.we recognize that the ij also cited in re,which did not involve humanitarian asylum.but we nonetheless conclude that a remand is appropriate because we are unable to determine from the record whether the ij or the bia applied the correct legal standard in analyzing whether to withhold removal.hailemichael gonzales,cir stating that an ij must describe his reasoning with sufficient specificity to facilitate appellate review.
on remand,the bia should evaluate,under the correct legal standard,whether malonga has established past persecution on account of his membership in a particular social group or political opinion,thereby raising a presumption of future persecution and if so,whether the ins has rebutted that presumption or shown that,if returned to congo,it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted on account of membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b,b.
particular social group 
because the issue will arise again on remand,we also address the ij erroneous conclusion that the lari ethnic group of kongo tribe is not a particular social group for purposes of withholding removal because it is a substantial minority of the population of congo whether a group is a particular social group presents a question of law,which we review de novo.see ngengwe mukasey,cir engaging in de novo review of whether female cameroonian widows are a particular social group.but we accord substantial deference to the bia interpretation of the statutes and regulations it administers.bushira gonzales,cir.
malonga introduced evidence that he is a member of the lari ethnic group of the kongo tribe,a group which is identifiable by accent,dialect,home region,and surname.the ij rejected malonga argument,stating that he certainly did not think that malonga is a member of a particular social group.as far as we can tell,the ij based this conclusion on one consideration evidence that indicates that the kongo ethnic tribe comprises of the population of congo.the ij concluded that the kongo ethnic group comprises a substantial minority,of the population in congo.simply being a member of that group does not place the respondent in any greater risk than any members of the rest of that group which comprise almost half of the population.
the ij reasoning conflicts with the bia own precedent,which defined particular social group as a group of persons all of whom share a common,immutable characteristic such as sex,color,or kinship ties,or in some circumstances shared past experience.see,in re acosta,bia,overruled on other grounds by in re mogharrabi,bia.recently,the bia has affirmed the in re acosta definition,underscoring the importance of the social visibility of the alleged particular social group.see in re,bia.that is,the more likely that the society at large recognizes the alleged group by,for example,linguistic or kinship commonalities,the more likely that the group is a particular social group for purposes of withholding of removal.see id.this circuit has affirmed this understanding of a particular social group.see,mukasey,cir.
by myopically focusing on size,the ij here failed to consider the other relevant factors in determining whether the lari ethnic group of the kongo tribe is a particular social group.applying the uncontroverted record evidence to the standard adopted by the bia in in re acosta and in re,we conclude that the lari ethnic group of the kongo tribe is a particular social group for purposes of withholding of removal.members of the tribe share a common dialect and accent,which is recognizable to others in congo.members also are identifiable by their surnames and by their concentration in southern congo pool region.our conclusion is consistent with other decisions of this court and of the bia,in which applica
