on remand from the united states supreme court 
opinion of the court 
this case is before us on remand from the united states supreme court.the city of hazleton previously appealed the district court judgment permanently enjoining enforcement of two hazleton ordinances that attempt to prohibit employment of unauthorized aliens and preclude them from renting housing within the city in a precedential opinion and judgment filed on september,we upheld the permanent injunction.thereafter,the supreme court granted hazleton petition for a writ of certiorari and remanded this case so that we could reconsider our analysis in light of chamber of commerce whiting,d.see city of hazleton lozano,d.subsequently,the court also decided arizona united states,d.both whiting and arizona address the extent to which federal immigration law various state laws pertaining to the treatment of unauthorized aliens.on remand,we asked for supplemental briefing on whether either of those decisions alter our original analysis upholding the district court injunction.
having thoroughly considered the additional submissions of the parties and the court decisions in whiting and arizona,we again conclude that both the employment and housing provisions of the hazleton ordinances are by federal immigration law.accordingly,we will again affirm the district court order enjoining enforcement of these provisions.
background 
the factual and procedural background underlying this case have been extensively described in the district court decision,lozano city of hazleton,d lozano i,and our earlier decision,lozano city of hazleton,cir lozano ii,vacated and remanded,d.accordingly,we need not reiterate that history as thoroughly as we otherwise would.however,context and clarity require that we first set forth those facts underlying our analysis on remand.
this litigation involves a series of immigration ordinances enacted by the city of hazleton between july and march.the two ordinances at issue are the illegal immigration relief act ordinance iirao,which consists of ordinance,as amended by ordinance,and ordinance and the rental registration ordinance ro,which consists of ordinance these ordinances attempt to regulate the employment of unauthorized aliens,and the provision of rental housing to aliens lacking lawful immigration status,within hazleton.
the relevant employment provisions make it unlawful for any person to knowingly recruit,hire for employment,or continue to employ,or to permit,dispatch,or instruct any person without work authorization to perform work in whole or in part within the city.iirao.the iirao also provides for public monitoring and prosecution,and sanctions violators by suspending their business permits.id.safe harbor from the iirao sanctions is available for businesses that verify work authorization using the federal e verify program.id.the iirao also requires city agencies and certain businesses to enroll in the e verify program.id.b.
the disputed housing provisions are found in both the iirao and the ro.the iirao makes legal immigration status a condition precedent to entering into a valid lease.id.the iirao also provides that it is unlawful for any person or business entity that owns a dwelling unit in the city to harbor an illegal alien in the dwelling unit,knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien is unauthorized.id.harboring is broadly defined to include let ting,leas ing,or rent ing a dwelling unit to an illegal alien.id.
the provisions in the iirao operate in conjunction with the rental registration scheme established in the ro.the ro requires that prospective occupants of rental housing over the age of eighteen obtain an occupancy permit.ro.the application for an occupancy permit requires submission of p roper identification showing proof of legal citizenship residency.id.g.landlords are prohibited from allowing anyone over the age of eighteen to rent or occupy a rental unit without an occupancy permit.id.violators are subject to fines and possible imprisonment.ro.
as explained in lozano ii,numerous plaintiffs sued alleging the ordinances were invalid and the district court permanently enjoined enforcement of the ordinances after a bench trial.the court concluded that the ordinances are by federal law and contrary to the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,as well as a number of state laws limiting the authority of municipalities in pennsylvania.see lozano ii,at 
we thereafter affirmed the ultimate judgment of the district court,although we differed in our reasoning in short,we held that the employment provisions in the iirao,though not expressly,are conflict because they stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of federal law.lozano ii.we also held that the housing provisions in the iirao and ro are invalid because they impermissibly regulate immigration and are both field and conflict by federal immigration law.id.at 
as we noted at the outset,after we issued our decision in lozano ii,the supreme court granted the city petition for a writ of certiorari,vacated our decision,and remanded for reconsideration in light of that court intervening decision in chamber of commerce whiting,d.in whiting,the supreme court affirmed the decision of the court of appeals for the ninth circuit in chicanos por la causa,napolitano,cir.there,the court of appeals for the ninth circuit had upheld the legal arizona workers act against claims of express and implied.chicanos por la causa,at.after the decision in whiting,the supreme court decided arizona united states,d.there,the court held that three of four challenged provisions of arizona immigration law,known as,were.however,the court overturned a preliminary injunction with respect to the fourth provision and remanded for additional fact finding.
the question before us on remand remains whether federal law the employment housing provisions of the hazleton ordinances.

nothing the court said in whiting or arizona altered this framework for analysis.the court,did,however provide important guidance for our application of the doctrine to the hazleton ordinances.the court upheld arizona efforts to regulate the employment of unauthorized aliens through a business licensing law in whiting,but largely rejected arizona efforts to enact its own immigration policies,both within and outside of the employment context,in arizona.with those cases as our compass,we now reconsider our prior ruling upholding the district court permanent injunction.
a.the employment provisions 
the relevant employment provisions of the iirao regulate and prohibit a broad range of economic interactions with unauthorized aliens.section of the iirao renders it unlawful for any business entity to knowingly recruit,hire for employment,or continue to employ,or to permit,dispatch,or instruct any person without work authorization to perform work in whole or in part within the city.iirao.work is defined to include any job,task,employment,labor,personal services,or any other activity for which compensation is provided,expected,or due,including but not limited to all activities conducted by business entities.id.the iirao prohibitions also apply to any agreement to perform any service or work or to provide a certain product in exchange for valuable consideration.id.every business entity that applies for a business permit must sign an affidavit affirming that they do not knowingly utilize the services of or hire any person who is an unlawful worker.id.
any city resident may submit a complaint to hazleton code enforcement office hceo alleging a violation of the employment provisions.id.upon receipt of such a complaint,the hceo requests identifying information about the alleged unlawful worker from the employing or contracting business entity.that business entity must then provide the requested information within three business days,or hazleton will suspend its business license.id.the hceo then submits the identity information to the federal government,pursuant to,for verification of the immigration status of such person s.id 
if the hceo confirms that the worker lacks authorization to work in the united states,the business must terminate that worker within three business days or the city will suspend its business license.id.a business whose license has been suspended under the iirao regains its license one business day after it submits an affidavit affirming that it has terminated the unauthorized worker.id.after a second or subsequent violation of the iirao,hazleton suspends the business license for a minimum of twenty days and reports the violation to the federal government.id.
safe harbor from the iirao sanctions is available for businesses that verify the work authorization of their workers using the federal e verify program.id.in addition,the iirao requires that city agencies and businesses that contract with the city for amounts greater than must enroll in e verify.id.those business entities found to have utilized the work of two or more unlawful workers at one time must enroll in e verify in order to recover their license.id.b.
we previously held that the iirao employment provisions,though not expressly,are conflict preempted.lozano ii.however,in chamber of commerce whiting,the supreme court upheld an arizona statute that allowed state courts to suspend or revoke the business licenses of employers who knowingly or intentionally employ unauthorized aliens and required that all arizona employers use e verify.accordingly,we will first consider whether our analysis in lozano ii,concluding that the iirao conflicts with federal law,survives whiting.
in whiting,the supreme court considered whether the employer sanctions provisions of the legal arizona workers act lawa were by the immigration reform and control act of irca,stat.codified at.the court held that those provisions were not expressly because they fell squarely within the confines of irca savings clause.that provision of irca expressly preempts states from imposing civil or criminal sanctions on those who employ unauthorized aliens,other than through licensing and similar laws.whiting.at quoting h emphasis added the court also held that arizona licensing law did not conflict with federal law,and therefore was not impliedly.whiting.at.the court noted that the arizona statute simply implement ed the sanctions that congress expressly allowed arizona to pursue through licensing laws,and arizona went the extra mile in ensuring that its law closely tracks irca provisions in all material respects.id.at 
the court in whiting also held that the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat.codified as amended in various sections of,which established the optional program now known as e verify,did not arizona requirement that all employers use e verify.whiting.at.the court reasoned that the iirira provision setting up e verify contains no language circumscribing state action,id.at,and arizona use of e verify in no way obstructs achieving congress aims,id.at.
the plurality opinion in whiting rejected or otherwise undermined several aspects of our analysis in lozano ii insofar as we held that the iirao employment provisions were conflict.
first,whiting contradicts our conclusion that the employment provisions in hazleton ordinance impede congressional objectives by creating a separate and independent process for determining whether an employer is guilty of employing unauthorized aliens.compare whiting.at rejecting the chamber argument that congress intended the federal system to be exclusive and therefore any state system necessarily conflicts with federal law with lozano ii,at the crux of this conflict is rooted in the fact that hazleton has established an alternate system at all.since congress expressly allowed states to pursue sanctions through licensing laws,the whiting plurality reasoned that congress did not intend to prevent the states from using appropriate tools to exercise that authority.whiting.at.
second,in lozano ii,we reasoned that,by imposing additional sanctions on employers who hire unauthorized aliens without including an express provision,the iirao would create the exact situation that congress feared a system under which employers might quite rationally choose to err on the side of discriminating against job applicants they perceive to be foreign.lozano ii,at.however,the whiting plurality rejected a similar argument.those justices reasoned that lawa did not displace irca provisions,and that other federal and state laws provide further protection and strong incentive for employers not to discriminate.whiting.at.thus,the court believed that,even without an express provision in the state law,t he most rational path for employers is to obey the law both the law barring the employment of unauthorized aliens and the law prohibiting discrimination.id.
finally,the whiting plurality undermined our reasoning in lozano ii to the extent that we found preemption because the city employment provisions coerce the use of e verify.lozano ii,at.that conclusion is now foreclosed by whiting approval of arizona requirement that all employers use e verify.whiting.at.there,the court concluded that the requirement does not conflict with the federal scheme because the consequences for failure to use e verify under both the arizona law and federal law were the same the employer forfeits an otherwise available rebuttable presumption of compliance.id.the court further reasoned that the requirement does not obstruct federal objectives because the federal government has consistently expanded and encouraged the use of e verify.id.at.
nevertheless,plaintiffs here argue that even after whiting,hazleton employment provisions remain impliedly.plaintiffs point first to the fact that the iirao restrictions apply to a much broader range of actors and activities than congress intended under irca.according to plaintiffs,this basis for our prior finding of conflict preemption was not disturbed by whiting.we agree.
section of the iirao makes it unlawful for any business entity to knowingly recruit,hire for employment,or continue to employ,or to permit,dispatch,or instruct any person who is an unlawful worker to perform work within the city.iirao.the iirao defines business entity to include any person engaging in any activity,enterprise,profession,or occupation for gain,benefit,advantage,or livelihood,whether for profit or not for profit.id.the term specifically includes individuals,partnerships,corporations,contractors and subcontractors,id,and any entity that possesses a business permit,is exempt from obtaining such a business permit,or is operating unlawfully without such a business permit.id.
in sharp contrast to the iirao,the federal prohibition in irca reaches only hir ing or recruit ing or refer ring for a fee,for employment in the united states.a a emphasis added.in striking the intricate balance that lead to the enactment of irca,congress deliberately excluded independent contractors and other from the scope of the restrictions contained in the statute.arizona.at.congress enacted irca as a comprehensive framework for combating the employment of illegal aliens.emphasis added quoting hoffman plastic compounds,nlrb,d.as we explained previously 
in drafting irca,congress explicitly declined to sanction employers based on the work authorization status of casual hires,those that do not involve the existence of an relationship,at.this was not an unreasoned choice,but part of the crafting of the statute to minimize the burden placed on employers.as the court explained in edmondson,e mployers are not required under federal law to verify the work eligibility of independent contractors because it would increase the burdens on business.at.businesses utilize independent contractors,in part,to reduce the costs and liabilities associated with procuring labor when an enduring and structured relationship is not needed.compelling businesses to concern themselves with the work authorization status of contractors alters this relationship,and also raises costs.
lozano ii,at alterations in original.
under irca,employers are not required to verify contractors work eligibility,as they must with employees.see b requiring employers to verify work eligibility of employees.f excluding independent contractor and those engaged in casual domestic employment from the definition of employee id.g excluding those who use contract labor from the definition of employer given the intricate framework of irca,we can not assume that the distinction is immaterial.rather,it appears to be a deliberate distinction that congress included as part of the balance it struck in determining the scope and impact of irca employer sanctions.however,hazleton ordinance does not distinguish between employees,on the one hand,and independent contractors or casual hires,on the other.
the breadth of the reach of the iirao sanctions operates in tandem with the fact that the iirao provides a safe harbor only if prior to the date of the violation,the business entity had verified the work authorization of the alleged unlawful worker s using the e verify program.iirao.accordingly,the hazleton scheme compels employers to verify the status of independent contractors and casual hires in order to obtain a safe harbor.in lozano ii,we determined that although the iirao only coerces,without directly requiring,verification of work authorization,the coercion is equally problematic for preemption purposes because the iirao subjects employers to sanctions if those lack work authorization.lozano ii,at 
moreover,we must assess the extraordinarily broad definition of the persons and entities covered by the iirao together with the equally broad definition of the activities covered by the iirao.the iirao defines work to include any job,task,employment,labor,personal services,or any other activity for which compensation is provided,expected,or due,including but not limited to all activities conducted by business entities.iirao.the iirao prohibitions also apply to any agreement to perform any service or work or to provide a certain product in exchange for valuable consideration.id.moreover,there is no requirement that the alleged unauthorized work be performed at the location associated with an entity business license,or even in connection with the activities for which an entity has a business license,for it to be considered a violation of the iirao thus,under a literal reading of the iirao,the hceo may revoke the business license of any person or entity if,for example,purchases used items at a yard sale from an unauthorized alien,buys a glass of lemonade from an undocumented child lemonade stand,or pays an undocumented neighbor to mow her lawn even if such conduct is entirely unrelated to the actor licensed business activity.
indeed,it is difficult for us to conceive of any activity that is even remotely economic in nature,conducted by any person or entity in hazleton,that would not be swept into the broad expanse of the iirao.we believe that prohibiting such a broad array of commercial interactions,based solely on immigration status,under the guise of a business licensing law is untenable in light of congress deliberate decision to limit irca reach to the relationship.
whiting is not to the contrary.the city argues that the court in whiting was not troubled by the fact that arizona law applied to independent contractors.however,the provisions to which the city refers were added as part of a amendment to lawa,and as the supreme court expressly noted,the amendments were not part of the statute when the suit was brought,they are not before us and we do not address their interaction with federal law.whiting.at see also arizona contractors ass candelaria,d,l ike irca,lawa restrictions apply only with respect to those persons who have an employment relationship with an employer,so it does not include casual hires,aff sub nom.chicanos por la causa,napolitano,cir,aff sub,chamber of commerce whiting,d.
thus,unlike the iirao,the arizona law upheld by the supreme court closely track ed irca provisions in all material respects,whiting.at,including irca precisely tailored reach thus,whiting alone does not support the proposition that an ordinance that diverges from federal law to the extent the iirao does is similarly sheltered from the reach of federal.
the supreme court more recent decision in arizona united states,d,further undermines the contention that the iirao should be upheld as a protected business licensing law.the court in arizona affirmed that the existence of an express provisio n does not bar the ordinary working of conflict principles or impose a special burden that would make it more difficult to establish the preemption of laws falling outside the clause.arizona.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted alteration in original.moreover,the court reasons for finding that c of arizona law conflicted with irca apply with equal force to the iirao attempt to extend its regulations beyond the relationship.section c of made it a state crime to seek or engage in work without federal authorization.in concluding that that provision was,the supreme court stated,congress enacted irca as a comprehensive framework for combating the employment of illegal aliens,and irca,by design,does not impose federal criminal sanctions on the employee side,penalties on aliens who seek or engage in unauthorized work.arizona.at.thus,the court concluded that a lthough c attempts to achieve one of the same goals as federal law the deterrence of unlawful employment it involves a conflict in the method of enforcement and is therefore.id.at.just as purposely as congress limited the scope of irca coverage to exclude independent contractors,hazleton purposely stretched the iirao to include them.the result is a local ordinance that conflicts with congress intent to limit irca application to the relationship.see arizona.at a c onflict in technique can be fully as disruptive to the system congress enacted as conflict in overt policy.citing motor coach employees lockridge,d.accordingly,like c of arizona,the iirao employment provisions conflict with irca.
in lozano ii,we also concluded that the iirao conflicts with irca because it does not provide an affirmative defense to employers who comply with the i process to verify immigration status.lozano ii,at plaintiffs argue that this conclusion was also not disturbed by whiting because the arizona law at issue there provided a safe harbor for i compliance.once again,we agree.
as we have explained 
congress paid considerable attention to the costs irca would impose on employers,see,at,considerable discussion was generated during the processing of this bill to the effect the employer sanctions provisions were placing an undue burden on employers in requiring them to do the paperwork and keep records on employees,and drafted the legislation in a manner that would minimize those burdens,see,cong.rec.daily ed,statement of bryant irca has been carefully designed for the minimum burden necessary to be effective.
lozano ii.as part of this effort,congress created the i process as a uniform federal system by which employers must verify the work authorization of new hires.under irca,compliance with the i process provides an employer with an affirmative defense if charged with a violation of.a.i,at.however,hazleton scheme does not provide any safe harbor for employers who use the i process.the iirao employment provisions thus contravene congressional intent for the i process to serve as an acceptable way of protecting against sanctions and congress desire to avoid placing an undue burden on employers.as we previously explained 
by making the i system a uniform national requirement,congress limited the compliance burden on interstate corporations while facilitating uniform enforcement.a uniform system reduces costs for employers with multiple locations throughout the country by ensuring that the same human resources procedures can be used in all locations.hazleton scheme denies interstate employers who use the i process the benefits of uniformity.interstate employers with locations in hazleton who wish to ensure safe harbor in all locations would either have to adhere to different regulations in different locations,or use e verify in all locations.
lozano ii,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
although the supreme court in whiting upheld arizona requirement that all employers enroll in e verify,the court holding did not negate the importance of the i process to the federal scheme.rather,the court holding was based upon its conclusion that the consequences of not using e verify under the arizona law are the same as under the federal law,whiting.at and t he arizona law provides employers with the same affirmative defense for compliance with the i process as does the federal law,id.at.thus,although arizona required employers to use e verify,that requirement was exactly the same as the federal law treatment of e verify,and similarly,arizona treated i compliance the same way that federal law treated i compliance.
the city argues that the lack of an affirmative defense for i compliance is irrelevant given the structure of the hazleton scheme,which does not rely on a judicial process for proving that an employer knowingly hired an unauthorized alien and assessing a penalty.in addition to highlighting procedural due process concerns,this assertion elevates form over function and misses the point.the significance of the i affirmative defense is the safe harbor it provides for employers.we are therefore not impressed with a distinction between judicially imposed sanctions and administratively imposed sanctions.the resulting impact on a given business appears indistinguishable.whether a judicial officer or an administrator is charged with imposing sanctions is irrelevant.the city insists that the drafters of hazleton ordinances attempted to construct a parallel regulatory scheme that would comply with irca savings clause.however,the city decision to omit a safe harbor for i compliance,while providing one for those who use e verify,see iirao,is not as inconsequential as the city would have us believe.a scheme providing a safe harbor for both verification procedures would have been much closer to the parallel regulatory scheme that the court upheld in whiting.absent that,an important aspect of the federal scheme is undermined.
geier american honda motor,d,further illustrates how hazleton disregard of the i process impedes federal objectives.there,alexis geier suffered serious injuries when the honda she was driving crashed into a tree.she sued the auto company alleging that her injuries resulted from the absence of airbags,which she claimed was a design defect.id.at.however,geier car had automatic belts and thus complied with applicable federal safety standards,which,rather than requiring airbags,allow ed manufacturers to choose among different passive restraint mechanisms,such as airbags,automatic belts,or other passive restraint technologies.id.at.the applicable federal statute,however,also stated that c ompliance with a federal safety standard does not exempt any person from liability under common law.id.at internal quotation marks omitted,bracket in original.nonetheless,the manufacturer argued that the plaintiff claim for damages was by federal law.the court had to decide whether the act a state tort action in which the plaintiff claims that the manufacturer,who was in compliance with the standard,should nonetheless have equipped her automobile with airbags.id.at.
the supreme court held that the tort action conflicted with federal law and was thus.id.at.the court reasoned that federal regulations sought a variety and mixture of safety devices and deliberately imposed a gradual passive restraint phase in.id.at.notwithstanding the savings clause,allowing the action to proceed when plaintiff car complied with the applicable federal safety standard would have stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of those important federal objectives.id.quoting hines,at.similarly,permitting hazleton to impose sanctions on employers who have complied with,and relied upon,the i process would obstruct important federal objectives.congress wanted to make the i process available as a uniform means of protecting against such sanctions and minimizing the burden on employers.see also fid.fed.sav.loan ass de la cuesta,d finding conflict where state law limited the availability of provisions in loan instruments,which federal regulators deemed essential to the economic soundness of the thrift industry.
the iirao lack of procedural protections presents yet another obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of federal law.see arizona.at quoting hines,at.the iirao provides substantially fewer procedural protections than irca,which circumscribed sanctions with a detailed hearing and adjudication procedure.under irca,only complaints with a substantial probability of validity are investigated.e l b.in contrast,under the iirao,any superficially valid complaint is investigated.iirao.in addition,when enacting irca,congress mandated that an employer be provided with notice and an opportunity for a hearing,e a,and an administrative law judge must find the employer guilty of violating irca by a preponderance of the evidence before any sanctions can be imposed,id.e c.that employer also has a right to an administrative appeal and judicial review.id.e.in marked contrast,the iirao requires the hceo to immediately suspend the business license of any entity that fails to provide requested information about alleged unlawful workers within three business days.iirao if a business entity does not terminate an unauthorized worker within three days of being notified that the worker is not authorized,the city immediately suspends that entity business license.id.thus,the burdens imposed on businesses under the hazleton scheme are greater than those congress elected to impose under the similar,but distinct approach of irca.
the procedures in lawa the arizona statute upheld in whiting,substantially track the procedures congress established under irca.in contrast to the immediate suspension of business licenses authorized by the iirao,sanctions under lawa,like under irca,could only be imposed after the attorney general or county attorney brings an enforcement action in state court.d effective,to.the state court was directed to provide a hearing at the earliest practicable date,id.e,and sanctions could only be imposed by the court after determining that there had been a violation,id.f 
conversely,the lack of procedural protections in the iirao employment provisions undermines the delicate balance congress erected for enforcing the prohibition on hiring unauthorized aliens.congress was clearly concerned with avoiding undue burdens on employers.see,at describing desire for employer sanctions to be implemented in a manner that would be the least disruptive to the american businessman,at expressing concern regarding harassment against innocent employers and noting that s pecific protections have been included to minimize the risk of these undesirable results.as the supreme court noted,congress did indeed seek to strike a balance among a variety of interests when it enacted irca.whiting.at it is therefore apparent that the lack of minimal procedural protections in hazleton ordinance further undermines the express congressional objective of minimizing undue burdens on,and harassment of,employers.
accordingly,although the court recent decisions in whiting and arizona alter some of our previous analysis,neither opinion alters the outcome of this dispute.for the reasons we have set forth above,we again hold that the employment provisions of the iirao are because they stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of irca objectives,hines,at,and were properly enjoined by the district court 
b.the housing provisions 
the housing provisions at issue in this litigation are found in both the iirao and the ro.the ro sets up a rental registration scheme that operates in conjunction with provisions in the iirao to prohibit unauthorized aliens from residing in any rental housing within the city.
the ro requires any prospective occupant of rental housing over the age of eighteen to apply for and receive an occupancy permit.ro.to receive the permit,the prospective occupant must pay a fee and submit certain basic information and p roper identification showing proof of legal citizenship residency to the hceo.id.landlords must inform all prospective occupants of this requirement,and landlords are prohibited from allowing anyone over the age of eighteen to rent or occupy a rental unit without registering with the city and receiving a permit.id.a landlord found guilty of violating these requirements must pay an initial fine of per unauthorized occupant.id.that landlord is also subject to an additional fine of per day,per unauthorized occupant,until the violation is corrected.authorized occupants of rental housing who allow anyone without an occupancy permit to reside with them are subject to the same fines.id.
as we mentioned earlier,the provisions in the iirao make legal immigration status a condition precedent to entering into a valid lease.iirao.a tenant lacking lawful status who enters into such a contract shall be deemed to have breached a condition of the lease.id.the iirao makes it unlawful for any person or business entity that owns a dwelling unit in the city to harbor an illegal alien in the dwelling unit,knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to,entered,or remains in the united states in violation of law.id.harboring is broadly defined to include let ting,leas ing,or rent ing a dwelling unit to an illegal alien.id.an illegal alien is defined as an alien who is not lawfully present in the united states,according to the terms of united states code title,section et id.
we previously found the housing provisions in the iirao and the ro on three separate grounds no part of whiting or arizona considered provisions of a state or local ordinance that,like the housing provisions here,prohibit,and define harboring to include,allowing unauthorized aliens to reside in rental housing.moreover,nothing in whiting or arizona undermines our analysis of the contested housing provisions here.on the contrary,the court language reinforces our view that hazleton attempt to prohibit unauthorized aliens from renting dwelling units in the city are.
the housing provisions constitute impermissible regulation of immigration and are field.
we begin this part of our analysis by noting that the supreme court was careful in arizona to stress the important national interests that are implicated when local governments attempt to regulate immigration and the concomitant need to leave such regulation in the hands of the federal government.
the federal power to determine immigration policy is well settled.immigration policy can affect trade,investment,tourism,and diplomatic relations for the entire nation,as well as the perceptions and expectations of aliens in this country who seek the full protection of its laws.
arizona.at.in finding three of the four challenged provisions in arizona,the court reiterated the primacy of the federal government concern for the treatment and regulation of aliens in this country.
in lozano ii,we held that the housing provisions impermissibly regulate immigration in contravention of the supreme court pronouncement that a state or locality may not determine who should or should not be admitted into the country,and the conditions under which a legal entrant may remain.lozano ii,at quoting de canas,at in concluding that the housing provisions constituted impermissible regulation of immigration,we recognized that the fact that aliens are the subject of a state statute does not render it a regulation of immigration.de cartas,at.we did not hold that the housing provisions were a regulation of immigration simply because aliens are the subject of those provisions.rather,we determined that t hrough its housing provisions,hazleton attempts to regulate residence based solely on immigration status.lozano ii,at emphasis added.thus,we concluded that enforcement of the housing provisions must be enjoined because d eciding which aliens may live in the united states has always been the prerogative of the federal government.id.the housing provisions of hazleton ordinances are nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to regulate residency under the guise of a regulation of rental housing.by barring aliens lacking lawful immigration status from rental housing in hazleton,the housing provisions go to the core of an alien residency.states and localities have no power to regulate residency based on immigration status.
for these same reasons,we also concluded that the housing provisions are field by the ina.that statute is centrally concerned with the terms and conditions of admission to the country and the subsequent treatment of aliens lawfully admitted.id.quoting de canas,at.the ina comprehensive scheme plainly precludes state efforts,whether harmonious or conflicting,to regulate residence in this country based on immigration status.id.we noted that although hazleton housing provisions do not control actual physical entry into,or expulsion from,hazleton or the united states,in essence,that is precisely what they attempt to do.id.at internal quotations marks and citation omitted.again,we see nothing in the supreme court decisions in whiting or arizona that undermines these conclusions.
since our decision in lozano ii,a number of courts have concluded that state or local laws proscribing the harboring of aliens lacking lawful status are also field preempted because they intrude on the field of alien harboring.see.latino alliance for human rights governor of,cir glahr concluding that federal law occupies the field with respect to the entry,movement,and residence of aliens within the united states and state law proscribing,inter alia,harboring is field united states alabama,cir same,cert.denied,d united states south carolina,d,concluding that provisions of state law proscribing transporting or sheltering aliens lacking lawful status infringe upon a comprehensive federal statutory scheme,aff,wl cir.july,valle del sol whiting,wl,at,concluding that state law proscribing,inter alia,harboring of aliens lacking lawful status is field.
as the eleventh circuit court of appeals explained 
the ina provides a comprehensive framework to penalize the transportation,concealment,and inducement of unlawfully present aliens.pursuant to a l a ii iv,it is a federal crime for any person to transport or move an unlawfully present alien within the united states to conceal,harbor,or shield an unlawfully present alien from detection or to encourage or induce an alien to come to,enter,or reside in the united states.section c permits local law enforcement officers to arrest for these violations of federal law,but the federal courts maintain exclusive jurisdiction to prosecute for these crimes and interpret the boundaries of the federal statute.see id.subsection d of further dictates evidentiary rules governing prosecution of one of its enumerated offenses,and subsection e goes so far as to mandate a community outreach program to educate the public in the united states and abroad about the penalties for bringing in and harboring aliens in violation of this section.
glahr,at.we agree with the eleventh circuit and other courts that have held that the federal government has clearly expressed more than a peripheral concern with the entry,movement,and residence of aliens within the united states and the breadth of these laws illustrates an overwhelmingly dominant federal interest in the field.id.at citation omitted.
the city argues that,by authorizing state and local officials to arrest individuals guilty of harboring,see c,congress specifically invited state and local governments into this field.according to the city,this invitation along with the requirement in that federal agencies respond to inquiries from states and localities regarding any alien immigration status forecloses any argument that the housing provisions are field.however,while c allows state officials to arrest for violations of crimes enumerated in that section,the federal statute does not authorize states to prosecute those crimes.instead,under federal law,the prosecution of such violations must take place in federal court and is at the sole discretion of federal officials.see.in the absence of a savings clause permitting state regulation in the field,the inference from these enactments is that the role of the state is limited to arrest for violations of federal law.glahr,at.
for the reasons explained above,we again hold that the housing provisions in the iirao and ro constitute an impermissible regulation of immigration and are field preempted because they intrude on the regulation of residency and presence of aliens in the united states and the occupied field of alien harboring.
the housing provisions are conflict.
in lozano ii,we concluded that the housing provisions are also conflict because they interfere with the federal government discretion in,and control over,the removal process.the exercise of that discretion implicates important foreign policy considerations.arizona.at.we also concluded that the housing provisions are inconsistent with federal law.again,the subsequent decisions of the supreme court have not undermined our reasoning.in fact,as suggested above and explained below,the court subsequent decisions reinforce our prior conflict analysis with respect to the housing provisions.
in arizona,the court emphasized that a principle feature of the ina removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials.arizona.at.federal officials must decide whether it makes sense to pursue removal at all and,i f removal proceedings are commenced,whether aliens may seek discretionary relief allowing them to remain in the country or at least to leave without formal removal.id yet,by prohibiting the only realistic housing option many aliens have,hazleton is clearly trying to prohibit unauthorized aliens from living within the city.as we explained in lozano ii,the housing provisions,in effect,constitute an attempt to remove persons from the city based entirely on a snapshot of their current immigration status.accordingly,the housing provisions interfere with the federal government discretion in deciding whether and when to initiate removal proceedings.see lozano ii,at 
indeed,interference with the federal removal process and the discretion entrusted to the executive branch are key reasons for the supreme court conclusions that and of arizona law are conflict.the court reached that conclusion even though neither provision purports to physically remove any aliens from arizona or the united states.in affirming an injunction against,which would have given arizona police authority to arrest an individual based on probable cause to believe the individual has committed a removable offense,the court determined that the provision would allow the state to achieve its own immigration policy,which could result in unnecessary harassment of some aliens whom federal officials determine should not be removed.arizona.at.the court also found that b y authorizing state officers to decide whether an alien should be detained for being removable,violates the principles that the removal process is entrusted to the discretion of the federal government.id.similarly,in invalidating,which criminalized failure to carry an alien registration document in violation of federal law,the court noted that,in addition to intruding on a field occupied by congress,the provision also conflicts with federal law because it would give arizona the power to act even in circumstances where federal officials determine that prosecution would frustrate federal policies.id.at.
the same infirmities are evident here.like the preempted provisions in arizona,the housing provisions constitute an attempt to unilaterally attach additional consequences to a person immigration status with no regard for the federal scheme,federal enforcement priorities,or the discretion congress vested in the attorney general.congress has not banned persons who lack lawful status or proper documentation from obtaining rental or any other type of housing in the united states.hazleton decision to impose this distinct,unusual and extraordinary burden upon aliens impermissibly intrudes into the realm of federal authority.hines,at.through the housing provisions,hazleton is seeking to achieve its own immigration policy,one which will certainly result in unnecessary harassment of some aliens whom federal officials determine should not be removed.arizona.at.
hazleton may not unilaterally prohibit those lacking lawful status from living within its boundaries,without regard for the executive branch enforcement and policy priorities.if every other state enacted similar legislation to overburden the lives of aliens,the immigration scheme would be turned on its head.united states alabama,at.accordingly,the housing provisions conflict with federal law.
in addition to undermining the comprehensive procedures under which federal officials determine whether an alien may remain in this country,hazleton housing provisions would create significant foreign policy and humanitarian concerns.as the court in arizona emphasized,federal decisions in this arena touch on foreign relations and must be made with one voice.id.at.one of the most important and delicate of all international relationships has to do with the protection of the just rights of a country own nationals when those nationals are in another country.arizona.at quoting hines,at.it is fundamental that foreign countries concerned about the status,safety,and security of their nationals in the united states must be able to confer and communicate on this subject with one national sovereign,not the separate states.id.at.in addition,p erceived mistreatment of aliens in the united states may lead to harmful reciprocal treatment of american citizens abroad.id.accordingly,s ome discretionary decisions in the enforcement of immigration law involve policy choices that bear on this nation international relations,and the exercise of such discretion embraces immediate human concerns.id.at.returning an alien to his own country may be deemed inappropriate even where he has committed a removable offense or fails to meet the criteria for admission.id.
the supreme court recognition of the primacy of the national interest in regulations directly affecting aliens in this country reinforces our holding in lozano ii that hazleton attempt to regulate where aliens can live implicates strong national interests and must be done with a single voice other federal courts that have addressed this issue agree that attempts to proscribe harboring or restrict certain forms of housing for aliens lacking lawful immigration status are conflict.similarly,when the issue has been presented in the context of a preliminary injunction,courts have found a substantial likelihood of conflict for reasons similar to those we have described.see,villas at parkside partners farmers branch,wl,at,cir.july,en banc concluding that local housing ordinance analogous to hazleton housing provisions conflicts with federal law and federal removal procedures glahr,at concluding that state law proscribing,inter alia,harboring aliens lacking lawful status presents an obstacle to the execution of the federal statutory scheme and challenges federal supremacy in the realm of immigration united states alabama,at same united states south carolina,d at concluding that provisions of state law proscribing transporting or sheltering aliens lacking lawful status would interfere with federal enforcement discretion,aff,wl cir.july,valle del sol,wl,at concluding that state law proscribing,inter alia,harboring of aliens lacking lawful status conflicts with federal law because it interferes with federal enforcement discretion keller city of fremont,d,rev,wl cir.june,concluding that city ordinance penalizing harboring or the lease or rental of dwelling units to aliens lacking lawful status would impair the structure congress has established for classification,adjudication,and potential removal of aliens.
despite the obvious trespass into matters that must be left to the national sovereign,the city continues to insist there is no conflict because it is merely engaging in concurrent enforcement of federal immigration laws.under that theory,virtually any local jurisdiction could prohibit activity that is also prohibited by federal law as long as the local prohibition is not expressly and the locality is not acting in a field that is occupied by federal law.the city cites to a decision from the ninth circuit court of appeals in support of its contention where state enforcement activities do not impair federal regulatory interests concurrent enforcement activity is authorized.gonzales city of peoria,cir,overruled by hodgers durgin de la vina,cir.however,that argument collapses under its own weight.it requires that local enforcement activity not impair federal regulatory interests.it says nothing about the propriety of concurrent enforcement when the local enforcement does impair federal regulatory interests yet,that is the situation here.
moreover,the city argument simply can not be reconciled with the supreme court holding in arizona.there,the court reasoned that a lthough c attempts to achieve one of the same goals as federal law the deterrence of unlawful employment it involves a conflict in the method of enforcement.arizona.at.the court went on to explain that it had previously recognized that a c onflict in technique can be fully as disruptive to the system congress enacted as conflict in overt policy.id.quoting motor coach employees,at.thus,the court found c even though the provision imposed sanctions only on conduct already prohibited under federal law 
furthermore,it must be remembered that the housing provisions are not concurrent with federal law,despite hazleton argument to the contrary.in addition to interfering with federal removal discretion,the housing provisions conflict with federal law because they define harboring to include simple relationships.although the supreme court has yet to define harboring as that term is used in a a iii,we have found that culpability requires some act of concealment from authorities.see lozano ii,at.we define harboring as conduct tending to substantially facilitate an alien remaining in the united states illegally and to prevent government authorities from detecting the alien unlawful presence.id.quoting united states ozcelik,cir emphasis added see also united states kim,cir harboring encompasses conduct tending substantially to facilitate an alien remaining in the united states illegally and to prevent government authorities from detecting his unlawful presence.renting an apartment in the normal course of business is not,without more,conduct that prevents the government from detecting an alien unlawful presence.thus,it is highly unlikely that renting an apartment to an unauthorized alien would be sufficient to constitute harboring in violation of the ina 
the city also argues that whiting held that a verification under c is an accurate assessment of an alien immigration status and a sufficient basis for state or local action with respect to that alien.the city overlooks,however,that the state or locality must first have authority to take the underlying action with respect to an alien.only then is verification under c relevant to support permissible state or local action.because the whiting plurality held that arizona employer sanctions law was a valid licensing law not by irca,it followed that a federal verification of immigration status is a proper basis upon which arizona may impose its licensing sanctions.that is not the case with respect to the housing provisions in hazleton ordinances.
as we have explained,the housing provisions are themselves.it is therefore irrelevant that they would be imposed pursuant to a valid status verification under c.hazleton simply does not have the legal authority to take that action even if done pursuant to a valid determination of status under federal law.see arizona.at explaining why c of arizona law,which attempted to impose sanctions on unauthorized workers,was conflict e providing that i n the enforcement of c,an alien immigration status may be determined pursuant to c.
for the foregoing reasons,we again hold that the housing provisions conflict with federal law and are thus preempted.
the rental registration provisions in the ro are field even when divorced from the harboring provisions in the iirao.
the approach throughout this litigation has been to consider the relevant housing provisions in the ro in conjunction with those in the iirao.nonetheless,it is theoretically possible that the rental registration scheme in the ro may not conflict with federal immigration law if divorced from the harboring provisions and sanctions in the iirao however,we conclude that the housing provisions in the ro,even if considered separately from the provisions in the iirao,are because they intrude upon the field occupied by federal alien registration law 
as we have explained,the ro requires those seeking to occupy rental housing to register with the city and obtain an occupancy permit.to obtain an occupancy permit,the applicant need only pay the requisite registration fee and submit the name and address of the prospective occupant,the name of the landlord,the address of the rental unit,and proof of legal citizenship residency.ro.as the city itself points out,under the terms of the ro alone,all applicants are issued an occupancy permit upon providing the required information and the requisite fee even if the applicant indicates that she lacks legal status.those who occupy rental housing without complying with this registration scheme are subject to fines of to,or imprisonment for up to days in default of payment.ro.thus,the rental registration scheme of the ro standing alone operates as a requirement that a subset of hazleton population those residing in rental housing register their immigration status with the city.
it is beyond dispute that states and localities may not intrude in the field of alien registration.arizona.at reiterating holding in hines,at,that the federal government has occupied the field of alien registration.thus,in arizona,the supreme court found of arizona law,which forbade willful failure to complete or carry an alien registration document in violation of federal law.arizona.hazleton rental registration scheme similarly intrudes into the field of alien registration.one of the rental registration scheme primary functions is to require rental housing occupants to report their immigration status to the city of hazleton and penalize the failure to register and obtain an occupancy permit pursuant to that requirement.this attempt to create a local alien registration requirement is field.
in arguing that the ro is nothing like an alien registration system,the city claims the most notable difference is that the ro applies equally to citizens and aliens alike while the federal alien registration act applies only to noncitizens we are not persuaded.it is highly unlikely that the local registration laws invalidated on field grounds in hines or arizona would have been upheld if they applied to citizens and aliens alike.the ro registration scheme can not avoid merely because it requires both citizens and noncitizens to declare their immigration status the city also argues that a finding that the ro constitutes an alien registration system is implausible because it would require the invalidation of laws limiting drivers licenses to lawfully present aliens.this argument is also unpersuasive.basing eligibility for certain state privileges on immigration status is distinct from requiring aliens to register.the ro rental registration scheme serves no discernible purpose other than to register the immigration status of a subset of the city population.it can only be viewed as an impermissible alien registration requirement 
iv.conclusion 
for the reasons set forth above,we conclude that the employment provisions in the iirao are distinguishable from the arizona law upheld in whiting,and the supreme court reasoning in whiting and arizona does not otherwise undermine our conclusion that both the employment and housing provisions in the iirao and ro are by federal law.accordingly,we will again affirm in part and reverse in part the district court order permanently enjoining hazleton enforcement of the iirao and ro.
