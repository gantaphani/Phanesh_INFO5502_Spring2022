petitioner samir bracic,a native of the former yugoslavia and a citizen of montenegro,petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals board denying his claims for asylum and withholding of removal.bracic contends that the board violated his fifth amendment right to due process by limiting the case on remand to entry of a ministerial order,but then citing lack of additional evidence as the basis for the board decision to dismiss his appeal.he further argues that the board wrongfully upheld the immigration judge determination that bracic did not prove past persecution or a clear possibility and fear of future persecution.bracic petitions this court for review of the denial of his applications for asylum and withholding of removal,and we grant the petition.
bracic is a muslim albanian.after the breakup of the civil wars in bosnia and kosovo,bracic testified that serbian authorities began to issue general propaganda labeling albanians as muslim terrorists,which he attributes to the discrimination against muslim albanians.bracic high school expelled him for not studying hard enough.during his high school years,police frequently stopped him on the street,asking him for identification and briefly detaining him.
bracic joined two political parties,the liberal party in and the albanian union in.as a member of the albanian union,he distributed pamphlets but did not hold an official position.the albanian union urged democracy for montenegro with fair representation for muslim albanians,and it voiced opposition to the war in kosovo because its members believed the government was killing innocent people and committing war crimes.bracic attended albanian union meetings but then stopped for fear of being arrested or being sent to the front lines of the war.the government sent secret police to the meetings,who would follow members home and harass them.
the serbian army sent bracic several draft notices.he responded to the first notice and reported for a physical examination,which he passed.he did not respond to any further notices.bracic testified that the serbian government sent muslim albanians to the front lines of the war in kosovo to fight other muslim albanians.they were essentially victims,as they were sent without sufficient ammunition.he believed that he would have been forced to commit war crimes as well.after the war ended,the government continued to send him draft notices and started to call his house,saying that he had to conscript or it would be the last he would see of this world.
bracic also recounted an incident where he and a friend were on a bus that was stopped by a group of people who checked identification documents.after seeing that several of the bus passengers were muslim albanian,they threatened and verbally abused them,saying this is the last time for albanians to be in the area.six months later,an incident occurred that caused bracic to leave montenegro.around sunset,when he was on the street,five men dressed in black civilian clothes asked bracic his name and attacked him.the men called him a traitor and beat and kicked him until he temporarily lost consciousness.when he arrived at his home,his mother called an ambulance,which transported him to the emergency room at a nearby hospital.he spent three days in the hospital recovering from injuries to his head and bruises all over his body.bracic did not report the incident to the police because he was afraid.
in september,a group of men dressed in police uniforms came to his home.through the keyhole of the front door,he recognized that one of the men was part of the group that had assaulted him.he did not answer the door and escaped out the back window of his house.he never returned home.in november,bracic entered the united states by illegally crossing the mexican border.even after he had left montenegro,the military police went to the homes of bracic two sisters to look for him.during one incident,the police searched the home of one of his sisters,hit her in the stomach with a rifle,and telephoned her later that night to say that this was not the end of it.
following his entry into the united states,removal proceedings were commenced against bracic.he conceded removability but claimed asylum,withholding of removal,relief under article of the united nations convention against torture and,in the alternative,voluntary departure on the grounds of past persecution and fear of persecution as a muslim albanian.the immigration judge who heard bracic case found him to be generally credible but denied his application on two grounds.first,the immigration judge held that bracic failed to establish that he suffered past persecution on account of a protected ground.second,the immigration judge held that bracic had not shown a fear of future persecution upon his return to montenegro.the immigration judge denied all of bracic applications for relief in a written decision and order.however,the judge failed to enter an order of removal against the petitioner.
bracic appealed only his applications for asylum and withholding of removal the board adopted and affirmed the immigration judge decision.in its written decision,the board noted that the immigration judge decision lacks an order of removal.therefore,we find it appropriate to remand the record to the immigration court for entry of an order of removal.on march,the immigration judge held a telephonic hearing with bracic,who was represented by counsel,and counsel for the government.during the hearing,the immigration judge asked,d o the parties have anything further to present on this case at this time to which bracic counsel answered,no,your honor.the immigration judge entered an order of removal against bracic,and an appeal was timely filed.after the order of removal was issued,the board issued its final decision on july,dismissing the appeal.the board noted that neither party had anything further to present during the remanded hearing.additionally,the board commented that bracic appellate brief was not substantially different from the one filed on appeal,on march,and declined to remand the case yet again,in the absence of new and material evidence relating to the respondent potential eligibility for relief.bracic timely filed his petition for review with this court.
bracic argues that his due process rights were violated because he had no meaningful opportunity to be heard when the board remanded the case solely for entry of an order of removal but then dismissed the appeal because he did not submit new and material evidence or raise new issues before the immigration judge.we review bracic due process challenge de novo,as the question of whether an immigration hearing violates due process is a purely legal issue.al khouri ashcroft,cir.
as a preliminary matter,we observe that bracic did not raise a due process claim in the administrative proceedings.generally,as a condition to judicial review,a petitioner must have exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.d frango gonzales,cir stating that congress likely intended exhaustion requirement to mean that an alien not only pursue all stages of administrative review but also raise all issues before the agency.nonetheless,we have jurisdiction over aliens unexhausted constitutional claims unless the claims concern procedural errors correctable by the administrative tribunal.geach chertoff,cir.bracic due process claim does not concern procedural errors correctable by the administrative tribunal because the issue first arose after the board issued its order of removal.see id.thus,bracic is not precluded from raising this claim.
to establish a due process violation,bracic must demonstrate both a fundamental procedural error and that the error resulted in prejudice.lopez heinauer,cir.prejudice requires a showing that the outcome of the proceeding may well have been different had there not been any procedural irregularities.tun gonzales,cir holding that alien due process rights were violated by exclusion of expert report and testimony,exclusion of a second expert corroborating report,and unreliable translations al khouri,at holding that alien due proce
