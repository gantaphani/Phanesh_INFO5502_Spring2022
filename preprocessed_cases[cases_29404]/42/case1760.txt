if you do not submit form and do not otherwise provide an address at which you may be reached during proceedings,then the government shall not be required to provide you with written notice of your hearing.if you fail to attend the hearing at the time and place designated on this notice,or any date and time later directed by the immigration court,a removal order may be made by the immigration judge in your absence,and you may be arrested and detained by the ins.
the nta certified that received oral notice in spanish of the time and place of the hearing,in his case a time and place to be set,as well as the consequences of failure to appear as provided in section b of the act.acknowledged receipt and understanding of the nta by signature,and he was released on his own recognizance.he reported his address as callen street,apartment b,vacaville,california.
on march,a notice of hearing noh was mailed to at the provided address,advising him that his removal hearing would take place on september.the noh was returned with a stamped notation on the envelope,no such number.the hearing nevertheless took place,and,on september,was ordered removed to honduras based on the charge in the nta.however,on july,the immigration judge sua sponte reopened the proceedings,finding that had provided a change of address specifying his correct address as callen street,apartment b,vacaville,ca,and stating that correspondence should be addressed in care of idalia castillo.
on august,the immigration court mailed an noh to the corrected address notifying that a hearing on his removal proceedings would be held on april,on april,another noh was mailed to,informing him that his hearing would be held on august.the noh was addressed to at the last known address he provided,but it was returned to the immigration court stamped attempted,not known.
failed to appear at the scheduled removal hearing on august.at that hearing,he was ordered removed in absentia.
more than four years later,on september,filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings on the grounds that the required statutory notice of the removal hearing was not provided.the ij denied the motion on the basis that had failed to demonstrate that his failure to appear was through no fault of his own,stating that had been told to notify the immigration court of any change in his address,that the noh was sent to the most recent address provided to the court,and that had not explained why he failed to provide his current address each time he relocated as he was required to do,reflecting the immigration court apparent finding that had not received the noh because he had relocated.

ii.the standard of review 
in reviewing the denial of a motion to reopen,this court applies a highly deferential standard,regardless of the basis of the alien request for relief.lara trominski,cir.accordingly,this court must affirm the bia decision as long as it is not capricious,without foundation in the evidence,or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.see singh gonzales,cir.
while questions of law are reviewed de novo,this court accords deference to the bia interpretation of immigration statutes unless the record reveals compelling evidence that the bia interpretation is incorrect.mikhael ins,cir.the bia factual findings are reviewed under the test,meaning that this court may not overturn the bia factual findings unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion.chun ins,cir.this court reviews the order of the bia and will consider the underlying decision of the ij only if it influenced the determination of the bia.see ashcroft,cir.
