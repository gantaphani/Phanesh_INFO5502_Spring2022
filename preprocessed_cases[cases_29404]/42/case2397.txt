abdul hussain,a native and citizen of pakistan,contends that he did not receive a fair hearing because the immigration judge denied him the opportunity to file an application for asylum.we reject this argument,as hussain in fact filed an asylum application but later withdrew it in exchange for a longer period of voluntary departure.hussain also argues that his obligation to register pursuant to the national security registration system led to the initiation of removal proceedings against him and violated his right to equal protection of the laws.we lack jurisdiction to consider his argument that the government improperly commenced the removal proceedings against him.and even if the removal proceedings commenced before he registered,the fact remains that the immigration judge found him removable because he overstayed his visa.therefore,we deny the petition for review.
background 
abdul hussain entered the united states on a visitor visa in june.he remained in the united states after his visa expired.in late,the united states government instituted the national security registration system nseers,a program that required males over the age of sixteen from certain countries,including pakistan,to register with the department of homeland security dhs.hussain voluntarily appeared at a dhs office in april,where he gave information about his whereabouts in accordance with the nseers program.that same day,he alleges,he was placed in removal proceedings.
the government charged hussain with removability as an alien who had remained in the united states longer than permitted.the first hearing in hussain removal proceedings took place on august.there,hussain counsel asked for a continuance to allow hussain time to consider the relief he would seek.in response,the immigration judge stated that any application for asylum should have been filed no later than june,as asylum applications must normally be filed within one year of an alien arrival in the united states.see a b.the immigration judge told hussain that if he chose to file for asylum,he might be from doing so unless he could show changed circumstances,that the time bar did not apply to requests for withholding of removal or relief under the convention against torture cat,and that hussain might still be eligible for voluntary departure.the immigration judge then advised hussain counsel that if hussain intended to apply for withholding of removal or cat protection,he expected hussain to have a prepared form ready for filing at the next hearing.finally,the immigration judge stated that at the next hearing,counsel could advise the court whether hussain was eligible for any other relief.
the next hearing occurred on october.hussain was represented by the same counsel.through counsel,hussain conceded he was removable as charged.the immigration judge then asked hussain what relief he sought.after hussain counsel explained that he planned to file an asylum application within thirty days,the immigration judge responded that he would consider the asylum claim only if hussain could show a change of circumstances or exceptional circumstances justifying his failure to timely file the claim.hussain counsel responded,all right.the immigration judge then asked how much time hussain wanted to file the application.after requesting thirty days,the immigration judge agreed and stated,and on the application please strike the word asylum and enter this phrase,put cat,convention against torture.hussain counsel responded,all right.i certainly will.
on november,hussain filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection.at the next hearing,hussain counsel stated that hussain had agreed to withdraw his applications for relief in exchange for a voluntary departure period of days instead of days.hussain told the immigration judge that he wanted to take the extended voluntary departure if that is the only option.the immigration judge responded,well,you have to tell me.are you willing,are you in agreement with your attorney that you wish to apply for voluntary departure days hussain answered,okay,and his counsel also stated that he recommended that hussain accept the longer voluntary departure period.the immigration judge then issued an oral decision accepting hussain withdrawal of his requests for relief and granting a voluntary departure period of days.
with new counsel,hussain filed an appeal from the immigration judge decision,claiming that the immigration judge had barred him from making an asylum claim.he also filed a motion to reopen in light of a class action lawsuit on behalf of aliens who had registered under the nseers.the bureau of immigration appeals bia rejected hussain arguments,and hussain subsequently filed a petition for review with this court.
ii.analysis 
asylum claim 
hussain first maintains that he did not receive a fundamentally fair immigration hearing.although hussain styles his claim as a violation of due process,we have said that t here is no need to invoke the constitution when the immigration statute itself guarantees a fair hearing.kadia gonzales,wl,at cir,citing b b the alien shall have a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against the alien,to present evidence on the alien own behalf,and to witnesses provided by the government see also rehman gonzales,cir.an alien must demonstrate prejudice to succeed on his claim that he did not receive a fair hearing.see rehman,at.
hussain principal argument is that the immigration judge barred him from filing an asylum application.at bottom,this claim fails because the record is clear that hussain filed an asylum application.he later withdrew his application in exchange for a longer voluntary departure period,but that was a choice he made with counsel present and after the immigration judge questioned him to ensure he wished to do so.united states carroll,cir upholding guilty plea.
in any event,the immigration judge was not wrong to warn hussain that he could only consider an asylum application from him under limited circumstances.in general,an alien may not file an application for asylum unless he demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within year after the date of the alien arrival in the united states.a b.by the time the government charged hussain with removability,more than a year had passed since he entered the united states.and he has never disputed that he filed his asylum application more than one year after his arrival.
the time bar does not apply,however,if the alien demonstrates either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing.a d.consistent with this law,the immigration judge reminded hussain on multiple occasions that he would not consider hussain untimely asylum application unless hussain showed changed circumstances or some other justification for the belated filing.for instance,at the august,initial hearing,the immigration judge first stated that any application for asylum should have been filed by june.he then instructed hussain and his counsel that if hussain chose to file an application for asylum,he might be unless he could show changed circumstances the time bar did not apply to requests for withholding of removal or relief under the convention against torture and hussain could still be eligible for voluntary departure.these directives conform to the statute mandate that only changed or extraordinary circumstances allow an immigration judge to consider an untimely asylum application.see a b,d see also.
at the next hearing approximately two months later,hussain conceded he was removable as charged.after hussain counsel explained that he planned to file an application for asylum within thirty days,the immigration judge stated that he would consider the asylum claim only if hussain could demonstrate changed circumstances or exceptional circumstances justifying his failure to file the claim within one year.once again,this directive was consistent with the law,and the immigration judge did nothing improper in giving it.hussain also takes issue with
