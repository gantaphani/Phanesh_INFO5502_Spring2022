pelivan ceta,a citizen of albania,conceded removability at his most recent hearing with an immigration judge ij,and he attempted to apply for adjustment of status based on his marriage to an american citizen.alternatively,ceta requested termination of the proceedings without prejudice or a continuance pending the approval of his petition for alien relative.the ij concluded that ceta was categorically ineligible under a regulation to apply for adjustment of status,and therefore the ij also denied ceta request for termination or a continuance.
ceta then appealed the decision of the ij to the board of immigration appeals board or bia and submitted an approved.while ceta appeal was pending,the regulation that categorically had prevented him from eligibility for adjustment of status was repealed.in a brief,per curiam order,the bia explained that,because of the regulatory change,ceta now was eligible to apply for adjustment,but he had to pursue his adjustment application with the united states citizenship and immigration service uscis.the board therefore affirmed the ij decision that the ij did not have jurisdiction to consider the adjustment application.the bia also affirmed the ij denial of ceta request for termination or a continuance.
ceta now petitions for review of the decision of the bia denying his application for adjustment of status and his motion for termination of the proceedings or a continuance.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we grant ceta petition for review.
background 
ceta,a citizen of albania,arrived at chicago international airport in and immediately requested asylum or withholding of removal on the ground that he had been persecuted in albania for supporting the democratic party.the immigration authorities ultimately charged ceta as removable on the alternative grounds that he had attempted to gain entry into the united states by fraudulently or willfully misrepresenting a material fact did not have a valid,unexpired immigrant visa did not have a valid passport and did not have a valid visa ceta conceded removability under charges and because he did not have a valid visa of any kind nevertheless,he denied attempting to enter the united states by means of a fraudulent or willful misrepresentation and also denied not being in possession of a valid passport.
after a hearing,an ij found that ceta was not credible and that he was removable on each of the four different grounds,including that he had tried to enter the united states by using a fraudulent passport.the ij also denied ceta request for asylum.ceta appealed.the bia subsequently concluded that the ij adverse credibility determination was not sustainable,but it nonetheless upheld the denial of relief and the finding of a fraudulent or willful misrepresentation.
in his petition for review to this court,ceta challenged both determinations.although we sustained the denial of ceta asylum application,we overturned the determination of removability for attempting to gain entry through fraud or willful misrepresentation.see ceta ashcroft.cir unpublished.we remanded the case to the bia,which,in turn,remanded to the ij.
on october,ceta appeared before the ij,and he conceded that he was inadmissible.ceta then attempted to file for adjustment of status,pursuant to,based on his marriage to an american citizen.ceta recognized that a regulation,c the regulation categorically prohibited him from applying for adjustment of status.this regulation provided that a ny alien who seeks to adjust status based upon a marriage which occurred on or after november,and while the alien was in exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings was ineligible to apply for adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident under section of the act.c.ceta argued that this regulation was inconsistent with the immigration and nationality act ina or the act.in support of this argument,ceta relied on succar ashcroft,cir,and bona gonzales,cir,which had struck down the regulation as inconsistent with the act.alternatively,ceta requested that the ij terminate the proceedings without prejudice or grant him a continuance to give him time to pursue his the department of homeland security dhs opposed ceta application on the ground that the regulation,which was valid under seventh circuit precedent,categorically denied arriving aliens,such as ceta,eligibility for adjustment of status.the dhs further submitted that the ij did not have jurisdiction to consider arguments about the validity of this regulation.
the ij determined that the regulation conclusively established that ceta was ineligible to apply for adjustment of status.although ceta contended that the regulation was contrary to the act,the ij determined that he did not have jurisdiction to consider such an argument.the ij also denied ceta request for termination without prejudice or a continuance on the ground that ceta was not eligible for adjustment of status before the immigration court.at.
ceta appealed the ij decision to the bia.while ceta appeal was pending but before he filed his brief with the board,the secretary of homeland security the secretary and the attorney general issued an interim rule amending the regulation that had made arriving aliens,such as ceta,categorically ineligible for adjustment of status.see eligibility of arriving aliens in removal proceedings to apply for adjustment of status and jurisdiction to adjudicate applications for adjustment of status.may,hereinafter interim rule notice.the interim rule notice recognized that four courts of appeals had struck down c as inconsistent with ina a,a and it stated that the interim rule was intended to resolve the conflict.the interim rule,accordingly,repealed c and substituted a ii hereinafter amended regulation.the amended regulation provides that an ij generally does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate an application for adjustment of status filed by an arriving alien in removal proceedings a ii.these aliens,instead,must file their application for adjustment of status with the uscis,independent of the removal proceedings.a.the amended regulation is applicable to all cases pending on administrative or judicial review on or after may.interim rule notice.at.the notice also explained that 
w hile it will ordinarily be appropriate for an immigration judge to exercise his or her discretion favorably to grant a continuance or motion to reopen in the case of an alien who has submitted a prima facie approvable visa petition and adjustment application in the course of a deportation hearing,the bia has recognized that this is not an inflexible rule and that an immigration judge has discretion in an appropriate case to deny a continuance even if the alien is the beneficiary of a visa petition or labor certification that,if approved,could render the alien eligible for adjustment of status.
id.at citing matter of garcia,bia.the secretary and attorney general then explained that their respective agencies were soliciting comments on the standards for the granting of continuances to arriving aliens in removal proceedings while applications for adjustment of status are pending with uscis.id.
in his brief before the board,ceta attached a notice showing that his had been approved as of january.relying on the decisions of the courts of appeals that had struck down the former regulation ceta contended that the amended regulation was inconsistent with ina a,a,because,as applied to his case,it achieved precisely the same result as the former regulation that is,he was prevented from applying for adjustment of status.ceta also argued that the ij erred in failing to terminate the proceedings without prejudice or to grant him a continuance.the dhs,without mentioning the amended regulation,opposed ceta appeal,arguing that the ij had concluded correctly that ceta,as an arriving alien,was ineligible to apply for adjustment of status,and,on that basis,the ij also had correctly denied his motion for termination or a continuance.
in a brief,per curiam order,the bia affirmed the ij decision in all respects.the board explained that the amended regulation provided that ijs generally do not have jurisdiction to adjudicate an application for adjustment of status filed by an arriving alien in removal proceedings and that the limited exception to this general rule was inapplicable in ceta case.at citing a ii.the bia,however,did not discuss the interim rule notice issued with the amended regulation,in which the secretary and attorney general explained that it will ordinarily be appropriate for an immigration judge to exercise his or her discretion favorably to grant a continuance in the case of an alien who has submitted a prima facie approvable visa petition and adjustment application in the course of a deportation hearing.see interim rule notice.at.nonetheless,the board did note that,under the amended regulation,ceta must pursue any application for adjustment of status with the uscis independent of the removal proceedings.based on this determination,the board concluded,we find no error in the immigration judge denial of ceta motion for a continuance or the immigration judge denial of ceta request for termination of the proceedings.at.the board dismissed ceta appeal.
ceta timely petitions for review of the bia decision.on april,ceta filed in this court an emergency motion for a stay of removal,which the government opposed.that same day,we issued a temporary stay of removal pending resolution of ceta motion.on may,this court issued an order directing that ceta emergency motion be taken up with the case for determination by the merits panel and further directing that the temporary stay would remain in effect until the court orders otherwise.on june,we continued the stay of ceta removal pending our final resolution of the case.
discussion 
ceta challenges the bia decision on two grounds,which really are two sides of the same coin.first,he claims that the amended regulation,as applied by the ij and bia here,is inconsistent with ina a,a.in support of this contention,ceta adopts the reasoning articulated by the four courts of appeals that struck down the regulation essentially,ceta contends that the amended regulation,as applied in his case,achieves precisely the same result that these courts found to conflict with the act.second,ceta submits that the,by affirming the ij decision,the in denying his motion for a continuance.the denial of his motion for a continuance,ceta contends,effectively denies him the ability to apply for adjustment of status before the uscis.
the government claims that we do not have jurisdiction over the case because ceta has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.additionally,the government contends that we do not have jurisdiction to consider the ij denial of ceta request for a continuance.as authority for this assertion,the government invokes the statute,a b and our recent decision in ali gonzales,cir.the government also opposes ceta claim that the amended regulation conflicts with the ina it notes that two circuits have approved of and applied that regulation.see scheerer attorney,cir hereinafter scheerer ii brito mukasey,cir acknowledging succar,noting that the attorney general and the secretary had sought to resolve the circuit split by amending the regulation,and applying the amended regulation without questioning its validity.
we begin with the government contention that we do not have jurisdiction to consider ceta argument that the ij improperly denied his motion for a continuance.under the statute,a b,and our interpretation of that statute,ali,at,the government contends,this court does not have jurisdiction to consider the ij refusal to continue ceta removal proceedings.
the statute,entitled d enials of discretionary relief,provides,in relevant part notwithstanding any other provision of law no court shall have jurisdiction to review any other decision or action of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security,other than the granting of relief under section a of this title.a b ii.in ali,we interpreted this statute to strip this court of jurisdiction to consider an ij refusal to continue removal proceedings.ali,at.as the government acknowledges,however,our precedent specifically recognizes that the statute does not operate as a bar to judicial review where the decision to deny a motion for a continuance has the effect of nullifying the statutory opportunity to adjust status.id.at citing subhan ashcroft,cir.indeed,since our decision in ali,we consistently have preserved the subhan exception and its applicability in determining whether we have jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion for a continuance.see,wood mukasey,cir 
in subhan,we concluded that,despite the statute,we had jurisdiction to review the denial of a continuance when such a denial would nullify an alien statutory opportunity to adjust status.specifically,we found it untenable that congress,intending,as it clearly did,to entitle illegal aliens to seek an adjustment of status upon the receipt of certain required certificates,at the same time also intended section a b ii to place beyond judicial review decisions that nullif y the statute.subhan,at.in benslimane gonzales,we explained that subhan applies when the denial of a continuance request has the effect of a substantive ruling on the application to adjust status,cir an immigration judge can not be permitted,by arbitrarily denying a motion for a continuance without which the alien can not establish a ground on which congress has determined that he is eligible to seek to remain in this country,b a i,a,to thwart the congressional design.consequently,despite the general rule announced in ali,we retain jurisdiction to review a denial of a continuance if that denial operates to nullify some statutory right or leads inescapably to a substantive adverse decision on the merits of an immigration claim.boyanivskyy gonzales,cir citing subhan,at,and benslimane,at see also ali,at examining whether the exception noted in subhan applies.because a court has jurisdiction to determine whether there is jurisdiction,montrose chem.epa,see also ins,cir,we proceed to the question of whether the subhan exception to ali applies here.
ceta case fits squarely within the subhan exception.the ij specifically,the bia affirmation of that ceta request for a continuance amounts,under the circumstances of this case,to a denial of his statutory right to apply for adjustment of status.before the ij,ceta requested a continuance to allow him to obtain an,a prerequisite for filing an application for adjustment of status.the ij denied the continuance request because,under regulations,ceta was categorically ineligible to apply for adjustment.at concluding that ceta is not eligible for adjustment of status before the immigration court.ceta appealed the ij decision to the bia,and,while his appeal was pending,the regulations that categorically had prohibited him from applying for adjustment were repealed.ceta notified the board that his had been approved.he also requested that the board remand the case with instructions to continue the proceedings,in order to enable him to pursue his adjustment application with the uscis.despite describing the amended regulation at some length and recognizing that the new regulatory regime allowed ceta to pursue an application for adjustment of status with the uscis independent of these removal proceedings,the board affirmed the ij denial of ceta motion for a continuance.at.
the bia ruling has the effect of a substantive ruling on ceta application to adjust his status.see benslimane,at.under the ina,in general,an administratively final order of removal,unless appealed,must be executed within a period of days.see a a.moreover,once an alien has been removed,he no longer may obtain adjustment of status based on marriage.see subhan,at a djustment of status based on marriage to a citizen can not be pursued once the alien has been removed from the united states.see also a a,a.because of the denial of the continuance,therefore,ceta statutory right to apply for adjustment of status is trapped within a regulatory interstice section and the amended regulation,a,
