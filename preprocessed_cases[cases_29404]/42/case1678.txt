marie deloras jean petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia denying her motion to reconsider the bia denial of her applications for cancellation of removal and for a waiver of inadmissibility.we dismiss her petition for lack of jurisdiction to the extent that it challenges the bia refusal to reconsider the denial of a waiver of inadmissibility.finding no abuse of discretion by the bia as to the remainder of jean claims,we deny them.
in april,the immigration and naturalization service ins,now known as the department of homeland security,placed jean,a native and citizen of haiti,in removal proceedings as a n alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled.a a i west.although jean conceded removability,she applied for discretionary relief in the form of cancellation of removal,see b west supp,or,alternatively,voluntary departure,see west supp.the immigration judge,however,concluded that jean was statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal for failure to establish the requisite good moral character,based on his factual determination that jean was not truthful during the proceedings about her criminal history.see b b 
specifically,the immigration judge noted that jean indicated on her application for cancellation of removal and during direct examination that she was not arrested or convicted of any crimes but then admitted during cross examination that in fact she had been arrested for petty larceny and ultimately convicted of disorderly conduct.jean also admitted that she had been arrest ed during the pendency of these proceedings for multiple charges of credit card fraud.id.the immigration judge concluded jean failure to make full disclosure of her criminal history both in her application and direct testimony were material omissions under oath made to avoid discovery of facts adverse to her application that preclude d a finding of good moral character.see f west supp precluding a finding of good moral character for an alien who has given false testimony for the purpose of obtaining benefits under the ina.the immigration judge further suggested that a finding of good moral character was prohibited because jean admitted committing crimes of moral turpitude.see f a a.alternatively,the immigration judge concluded that jean was ineligible for cancellation of removal because she failed to establish that her removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.b d.finally,the immigration judge refused to grant voluntary departure and entered an order of removal in june.
jean appealed to the bia,arguing that the record did not support the immigration judge finding that jean testified falsely.jean argued that a t worst,her testimony was equivocal and convey ed a tremendous amount of confusion and could not be construed as intentionally false.while the appeal was pending,congress enacted the haitian refugee immigration fairness act of hrifa,stat,which allows certain haitian nationals to seek lawful permanent resident status without having to surmount the standard barriers faced by other immigrants.ordinarily,for example,an immigrant seeking to adjust his status must have been inspected and admitted or paroled into the united states.a west supp see b.a haitian national,however,may be eligible for an adjustment of status even though he was never officially inspected and admitted into the united states.see b.one of the biggest advantages is that an applicant for permanent resident status under hrifa is relieved of the burden of proving that he is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the united states for permanent residence.a see a west supp listing classes of aliens ineligible for immigrant visas or admission to the united states.
under hrifa,many inadmissibility grounds that render other aliens ineligible for visas do not apply to qualified haitian nationals.for example,qualifying applicants under hrifa are not inadmissible on the grounds that they entered illegally or that they are likely to become a public charge.see a a,a i west e.while certain grounds for inadmissibility still apply to hrifa applicants,the applicant may seek a waiver of inadmissibility under section of the immigration and nationality act ina,as would any other alien seeking to establish visa eligibility.see e.for example,an applicant seeking relief under hrifa is inadmissible,and thus not eligible for an adjustment of status,if he has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.a a i i see e.the attorney general has the discretion to grant a waiver of this particular ground of inadmissibility,provided certain statutory requirements are established to the satisfaction of the attorney general.h a west supp.
before the bia had ruled on the merits of her appeal,jean moved to have her status adjusted under hrifa.in november,the bia remanded the case to the immigration judge for consideration of jean application for relief under hrifa.on december,during the time that her appeal to the bia was pending,jean was convicted of petty theft in prince george county,maryland,for which she received probation.because this offense qualified as a crime involving moral turpitude,a a i i,which constitutes grounds for finding jean inadmissible and therefore ineligible for relief under hrifa,see b,e,the parties agreed jean was required to seek a waiver of inadmissibility in order to be eligible for an adjustment of status.
at the hearing on jean request for a waiver of inadmissibility,evidence of jean criminal history included an april arrest for possession of stolen property and forgery the december conviction for theft and december charges for theft,forgery,and credit card fraud.in light of this evidence,the immigration judge continued the case to afford jean an opportunity to demonstrate good moral character and rehabilitation from her criminal past.ultimately,after continuing the case for a second time,the immigration judge held a final hearing in june.in the interim,jean had been charged with three counts of leaving a child unattended.
on august,the immigration judge entered an order denying jean application for waiver of inadmissibility.although the immigration judge found that jean introduced sufficient evidence to establish extreme hardship,and was therefore eligible for a waiver,the judge concluded that jean failed to demonstrate that she merits relief as a matter of discretion.applying the factors articulated by the bia in matter of marin,bia,the immigration judge concluded that the factors adverse to the favorable exercise of jean record of criminal activity and failure to rehabilitate favorable factors including jean lengthy presence in the united states from an early age,her traumatic childhood,and the likelihood that her removal would result in hardship for her children.
on april,the bia issued a decision adopting and affirming both the june,decision of the immigration judge denying cancellation of removal and voluntary departure and the august,decision denying a waiver of inadmissibility.the bia summarized its decision as follows 
we note that several equities are present in this case,including the length of the respondent residence in the united states,as well as the presence of her three united states citizen children.nonetheless,we agree that the respondent has failed to demonstrate good moral character required for cancellation of removal and voluntary departure,and that she does not merit a favorable exercise of discretion in adjudicating her application for a waiver of inadmissibility so as to allow her to adjust status under hrifa.
jean did not petition for judicial review of this decision.instead,she filed a motion for the bia to reconsider its decision of april.with respect to the bia denial of cancellation of removal,jean essentially restated her original argument to the bia that she did not lie under oath about her criminal history and that the immigration judge simply misunderstood the testimony in so concluding.jean also argued that the bia erred in adopting the immigration judge refusal to grant a third continuance for jean to find representation.on september,the bia denied this motion as it could find no new legal argument or particular aspect of the case which was overlooked and no ground upon which to reconsider our previous decision.
jean then petitioned this court for review of the bia denial of her motion to reconsider.jean raises two arguments.first,she contends that the bia erred in adopting the immigration judge original denial of relief which,according to jean,rested on misstatements of fact.second,jean contends that she suffered a constitutional deprivation to the extent that the bia refused to reconsider its adoption of the immigration judge denial of a continuance.
because the underlying bia decision involved the denial of discretionary relief from removal,we are obliged to verify our jurisdiction to review jean claims.under the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,congress sharply circumscribed judicial review of various categories of bia decisions,including denials of discretionary relief under certain enumerated provisions of the ina 
matters not subject to judicial review 
b denials of discretionary relief 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,no court shall have jurisdiction to review 
i any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section h,i,or of this title,or 
ii any other decision or action of the attorney general the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general,other than the granting of relief under section a of this title.
a b west.because decisions under sections h and are included,this provision precludes judicial review of any judgment regarding the granting of waivers of inadmissibility,see h,and cancellation of removal,see b.although section a b appears,by its terms,to create an unqualified bar to judicial review of decisions involving the specified types of discretionary relief,many courts concluded that the statute was intended to eliminate judicial review of agency decisions resting on the exercise of discretion,but that legal determinations regarding an alien eligibility for such relief fell outside of the language of section a b and were thus subject to direct review by the courts of appeal.moran ashcroft,cir see ashcroft,cir ashcroft,cir.this court has not weighed in on the scope of subsection a b in the present context,but recently enacted legislation amending the judicial review provision makes it unnecessary to do so.
in may,congress enacted the real id act of,stat,essentially confirming the prevailing view on the scope of jurisdictional limitations imposed by section a b.the new language provides that n othing in subparagraph b or c,or any other provision of this chapter other than this section which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.a d.following the enactment of the real id act,therefore,direct judicial review is available for constitutional questions or questions of law arising from the agency decision to deny discretionary relief.see higuit gonzales,wl at cir,see also gonzales,cir.to the extent that a petition asks us to review a discretionary or factual determination,however,we still lack jurisdiction.see vasile gonzales,cir explaining that discretionary or factual determinations continue to fall outside the jurisdiction of the court of appeals entertaining a petition for review see also schroeck gonzales,cir grass gonzales,cir.accordingly,it is critical for us to determine whether the petition for review presents a legal or constitutional challenge to the agency decision or whether the petition seeks review of a discretionary determination by the bia.
motion to reconsider denial of a waiver of inadmissibility 
to the extent jean petition for review challenges the bia refusal to reconsider the denial of a waiver of inadmissibility,we lack jurisdiction.as explained above,the bia unquestionably denied jean relief under section h as a matter of discretion.jean does not contend that the bia applied the wrong standard or made an error of law in refusing to grant a waiver of inadmissibility.jean argues only that the immigration judge drew the wrong factual conclusions from the evidence and then determined these conclusions outweighed any factors supporting a favorable exercise of discretion.in turn,jean contends the bia perpetuated this error by adopting the immigration judge inaccurate view of the evidence.these are discretionary decisions,however,that we have no jurisdiction to review.
we realize,of course,that the merits of the underlying denial of a waiver of inadmissibility are not before us.ordinarily,we review the bia decision to grant or deny a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.see zhong guang sun united states dep t of justice,cir stewart ins,cir applying abuse of discretion standard to review of denial of motion to reopen.and,although the decision on a motion to reconsider is itself discretionary,the jurisdictional limitations imposed by section a b do not preclude judicial review.see obioha gonzales,wl cir.
in this case,however,the fact that we are technically reviewing the bia denial of the motion to reconsider certainly does not afford us jurisdiction to consider jean argument.when the bia refuses to reconsider the discretionary denial of relief under one of the provisions enumerated in a b a decision which is not subject to review in the first court will not have jurisdiction to review that same denial merely because it is dressed as a motion to reconsider.it is important to remember that jean is in a less favorable posture now than if she had timely sought judicial review of the bia original denial,which was unreviewable in any event.as the fifth circuit reasoned,i t is axiomatic that if we are divested of jurisdiction to review an original determination by the bia that an alien has failed to establish that he merits a favorable exercise of discretion for a waiver of inadmissibility,we must also be divested of jurisdiction to review the bia s denial of a motion to re consider on the ground that the alien still does not merit the favorable exercise of discretion.rodriguez ashcroft,cir per curiam.otherwise,there would exist a loophole through which we would thwart the clear intent of congress that the courts not review the discretionary decisions of the bia.id.by contrast,when the bia denial of a motion to reconsider ha s the effect of affirming the bia previous decisions denying cancellation of removal based on statutory ineligibility,we do not lack jurisdiction.sepulveda gonzales,cir emphasis added see id.explaining that the court of appeals has jurisdiction to review the bia decision on a motion to reconsider that is sufficiently connected to the final order of removal based on nondiscretionary factors.
in this case,jean petition for review reasserts the same arguments she raised in her motion for reconsideration and in her appeal to the bia that the immigration judge drew the wrong conclusions from the evidence and the bia,in adopting these conclusions,erroneously decided not to exercise its discretion to grant a waiver of inadmissibility.jean opening brief includes a heading that suggests she is seeking review of the bia fail ure to address her claims in denying the motion to reconsider.brief of petitioner at.see casalena ins,cir explaining that the bia must explain its decisions in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted internal quotation marks omitted.jean fails to develop this argument further,however,reverting to her basic contention that the record does not support the discretionary refusal to grant relief under section h.thus,we lack jurisdiction to review jean petition to the extent it challenges the refusal to reconsider the denial of a waiver of inadmissibility.
motion to reconsider denial of cancellation of removal 
to the extent that jean motion for reconsideration challenges the bia denial of her request for cancellation of removal,we conclude that we have ju
