this is an appeal from a final order of removal of the board of immigration appeals bia,denying petitioner application for withholding of removal because i she failed to establish a clear probability of persecution and ii she could not assert a claim based on a fear that her old citizen daughter would be subjected to female genital mutilation fgm if petitioner were removed to senegal and her daughter accompanied her.we affirm on the record presented.
petitioner,mame fatou niang niang,is a native and citizen of senegal.in august,she was admitted to the united states as a visitor authorized to remain in the until november.
soon after her arrival in the,niang became romantically involved with papa samba ane ane,a senegalese native who has nearly completed the process of adjusting his status in the on july,niang gave birth to the couple first child,a daughter named fatime ane fatime.two years later,on february,niang gave birth to the couple second child,a son named mohamed ane mohamed.
several months after the birth of mohamed,in august,niang filed an asylum application with the department of homeland security dhs,seeking relief from removal based on her religion and her membership in a particular social group.in an affidavit appended to her application,niang stated that she is from northern senegal and is a member of the toucouleur ethnic group,a group that,as she put it,practices fgm at an alarming ly high rate.indeed,niang stated she was subjected to fgm at a young age,causing her to suffer health and psychological problems.niang further stated that fatime paternal grandparents have been requesting,in intimidating and threatening letters,that niang take fatime to senegal to undergo fgm moreover,niang stated ane is indifferent to his parents request and t his indifference means ane tacitly accept s their request.as a result of ane indifference and his parents request,niang stated she feared that if she were removed to senegal,her daughter would be forced to undergo fgm there.
on october,dhs charged niang with removability,pursuant to a b,for remaining in the beyond the time permitted by her visa.in response to this charge,niang,represented by counsel,appeared before an immigration judge ij and admitted the charges against her,conceded removability,but sought relief from removal in the form of asylum,withholding of removal,protection under the convention against torture cat,or,alternatively,voluntary departure.
at a december,hearing on her various requests for relief from removal,niang testified that she is a citizen of senegal and a member of both the mandingo and toucouleur tribes and that while in the she gave birth to fatime and mohamed,who,at the time of the hearing,were years old and months old,respectively.initially,niang testified that ane lives with her,but later testified that ane does not live with her,but that he around sometimes.she further testified that the toucouleur tribe is traditionalist and continues to practice fgm and that although the senegalese government has made fgm illegal,people continue to practice excision in hiding and she saw many violations of that law.she also testified that in she read a letter from fatime paternal grandfather asking that fatime be sent to senegal to undergo fgm and learned that ane agrees with his family.niang asylum application was,in part,prompted by this letter.
in support of her application and testimony,niang submitted i medical documents indicating that she had been subjected to fgm and that in december,she suffered from fibroids ii her senegal passport and her children birth certificates iii the june,letter,purportedly from ane father and iv a department of state report concerning fgm in senegal,released june.this report states,inter alia,
a that studies estimate between and of the female population has been subjected to fgm 
b that up to of females among the minority halpularen peul and toucouleur in rural areas of eastern and southern senegal practice fgm and 
c that in january,the senegalese government made fgm illegal,but there have been no convictions as of the report.
the government also submitted documentary evidence,namely the country report on human rights practices for senegal,prepared by the department of state and released on february.this report states,inter alia,
a that fgm is not practiced by the wolof,the largest ethnic group,constituting of the senegalese population 
b that one of the most extreme forms of fgm is sometimes practiced by the toucouleur,particularly in rural areas 
c that fgm is most prevalent in eastern senegal 
d that fgm is a criminal offense,carrying a jail term of months to years for those practicing fgm or ordering that it be carried out.as of the report,trials in a and a case were still pending 
e that the government has established programs to educate women about the dangers of fgm and there are national and local government action plans against fgm and 
f that since,villages,including in northern senegal,have prohibited fgm,constituting over of the villages that had previously practiced fgm.
following this hearing,the ij denied all of niang applications for relief and ordered her removed to senegal.specifically,the ij found niang asylum application untimely,as it was filed more than three years after her arrival in the.the ij also found that circumstances did not warrant tolling.despite this finding,the ij went on to address the substance of niang asylum claim and found it meritless because niang had not established that she would be persecuted on the basis of any protected ground if removed to senegal,nor had she established any valid derivative claim given that her daughter,a citizen,was entitled to remain in the the ij also denied niang claim for withholding of removal based on a fear of persecution for the same reasons,noting correctly that this result follows from the fact that the standard applicable to a withholding claim is more rigorous than the standard applicable to an asylum claim.see camara ashcroft,cir.the ij further concluded that niang cat claim failed and that she was ineligible for voluntary departure.
niang appealed the ij decision to the bia,which affirmed the ij factual findings and specifically concurred with the ij conclusions that niang asylum application was untimely and that niang had failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a clear probability of future persecution.
niang now appeals only two aspects of the bia decision,thereby presenting two questions for review i whether niang can assert a claim for withholding of removal based on the psychological harm she will suffer if her daughter accompanies her to senegal and is there subjected to fgm and ii whether niang can assert a derivative claim for withholding of removal based on the alleged persecution her daughter will face if she accompanies niang to senegal and is there subjected to fgm 
at the outset,it is important to note that barbaric practice unbecoming of a civilized prohibited by law in this and many other countries,including senegal accordingly,we and our sister circuits have appropriately recognized that fgm constitutes persecution within the meaning of the immigration and nationality act ina,et,and thus the threat of fgm may serve as a basis for asylum or withholding of removal claims.see barry gonzales,cir.this settled principle is not at issue here.instead,the essential question presented in this appeal is whether the record in this case compels reversal of the bia determination that niang is not eligible for withholding of removal on the grounds she asserts.
the question is appropriately framed in this fashion because an alien asserting a claim for withholding of removal on persecution grounds must show that it is more likely than not that her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal because of her race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.haoua,at more precisely,an applicant for withholding bears the burden of demonstrating a clear probability that she will face persecution in the country of removal.rusu ins,cir citing ins stevic,d see.it follows from these principles that where,as here,the bia has found that the petitioner has not met this burden,we will affirm the bia determination if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d.thus,the ij or the bia factual findings are conclusive unless the evidence before the bia was such that any reasonable adjudicator would have been compelled to conclude to the contrary.haoua,at emphasis added.and significantly,where the record plausibly could support two results the one the ij chose and the one the petitioner advances,reversal is only appropriate where the court find s that the evidence not only supports the opposite conclusion,but compels it.balogun ashcroft,cir emphasis added citing,at.
in sum then,the specific questions presented,distilled to their essence,are whether the record compels reversal of the bia determinations i that niang can not assert a claim for withholding of removal based on the psychological harm she will suffer if her daughter accompanies her to senegal and is there subjected to fgm and ii that niang can not assert a derivative claim for withholding of removal based on the alleged persecution her daughter will face if she accompanies niang to senegal and is there subjected to fgm.
niang first claim for withholding of removal focuses on the psychological harm she claims she will suffer if her daughter accompanies her to senegal and is there subjected to fgm.this claim fails as a matter of law because it is that p ersecution involves the infliction or threat of death,torture,or injury to one person or freedom.li gonzales,cir emphasis added.this settled principle is firmly anchored in the statutory language stating that withholding of removal is warranted where the alien life or freedom would be threatened on the basis of a protected ground.b a emphasis added.thus,to establish a claim for withholding an applicant can not rely solely on psychological harm or a threat of such harm to others,but must also establish injury or a threat of injury to the applicant person or freedom see osigwe ashcroft.cir finding petitioners could not establish an asylum claim based solely on their daughter risk of being subject to fgm if she is returned to nigeria the record reflects that niang has not met this requirement.
niang hopes to avoid this conclusion by relying on abay ashcroft,cir.there,the sixth circuit,relying on bia decisions suggesting a governing principle in favor of granting parents refugee status where their child faces physical torture,held that an alien mother was eligible for asylum,in her own right,based upon her fear that her minor daughter,also an asylum applicant,would be forced to undergo fgm if the daughter were removed.id.at.significantly,abay is the only federal decision permitting a parent to seek relief,in her own right,based solely on the psychological suffering she will endure if her daughter will be subjected to fgm upon removal.we do not find abay persuasive here,both because it is factually distinguishable and because psychological harm,without any accompanying physical harm,does not constitute persecution.first,abay is clearly distinguishable because,unlike the asylum applicant in abay,niang daughter is a citizen accordingly,there is no clear probability that niang daughter will be subjected to fgm as she could remain in the,albeit without niang,and avoid any potential persecution.second,abay is unpersuasive because its holding is an unwarranted expansion of the statutory definition of persecution.see b a li gonzales,at.
in sum then,because persecution can not be based on a fear of psychological harm alone,niang withholding claim fails as a matter of law because it focuses solely on the psychological harm she claims she will suffer if her daughter accompanies her to senegal and is there subjected to fgm.accordingly,we affirm the bia determination in this respect.
niang also asserts a derivative claim for withholding of removal based on the alleged persecution her daughter will face if she accompanies niang to senegal and is there subjected to fgm.while niang concedes that the ina does not provide for a derivative withholding of removal claim she argues that we should nonetheless recognize a derivative claim in this case because of the barbaric nature of fgm.while we have not previously addressed whether such a claim may be asserted,other circuits have done so and declined to recognize this derivative claim.oforji ashcroft,cir holding that a n alien parent who has no legal standing to remain in the united states may not establish a derivative claim for asylum by pointing to potential hardship to the alien united states citizen child in the event of the alien deportation.olowo ashcroft,cir same axmed united states ag,cir upholding bia decision to deny motion to reopen asylum application,sought because petitioner feared that if she were removed her citizen daughter would join her and be subjected to fgm,agreeing with circuits declining to find a derivative claim where petitioner daughter is a citizen because asylum is only available to aliens who are personally at risk.
the ina compels this result because the statutory text is establish eligibility for withholding of removal the alien must demonstrate that the alien life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal.b emphasis added.thus,the statute permitting withholding of removal does not encompass derivative withholding claims,that is,claims for withholding of removal based on persecution to another person instead,an alien seeking withholding of removal must establish that they will suffer harm if removed.the one exception to this general rule is provided by,which provides that the attorney general may cancel removal of an alien if the alien i has been physically present in the for ten years or more before seeking cancellation of removal ii has been of good moral character during such period iii has not been convicted of certain statutory offenses and iv establishes that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien spouse,parent,or child,who is a citizen of the united states.thus,the ina provides that hardship to citizen children may be a basis for cancellation of removal in certain specific circumstances not present here.indeed,niang counsel conceded at oral argument that niang is not entitled to relief under,presumably because she can not satisfy the ten year physical presence requirement.
as does not apply here,niang may be entitled to relief from removal only if she satisfies the standard set forth in,that is,by demonstrating that she will suffer persecution if removed to senegal.see b requiring that the alien life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal emphasis added.she has not done so on this record,choosing instead to rely on the alleged persecution her daughter will face if the daughter accompanies niang to senegal.where,as here,an alien is not eligible for relief under,there is simply no statutory or regulatory authority for her to claim withholding of removal based on threatened hardship to her citizen minor daughter as congress has not provided for such a derivative withholding claim,we will not judicially amend the statute to create one.
we are,of course,mindful that the result reached here presents niang with a dilemma either allow fatime to remain in the with her father but without her mother,or take fatime to senegal where niang fears fatime will be forced to undergo fgm.the tragic nature of this choice is undeniable,but it does not warrant that we recognize a derivative claim where congress has not seen fit to provide for it see oforji,at recognizing the difficult choice faced by petitioner,but explaining that congress has foreseen such difficult choices,but has opted to leave the choice with the illegal immigrant,not the courts.accordingly,consistent with the other circuits that have considered this question,we conclude that niang may not assert a derivative claim for withholding of removal based on the potential persecution of her citizen daughter if niang is removed to senegal and her daughter accompanies her see oforji,olowo,axmed.
for the foregoing reasons,we dismiss the petition for review and affirm the bia decision.we do so reluctantly because we recognize that removal places niang on the horns of a terrible dilemma.while it is entirely reasonable to believe that the law ideally should not present mothers with such dilemmas,the existing law does.thus,the state of the law and the contents of this record require that we affirm the bia.
i concur in the majority analysis of niang derivative claim of withholding of removal based on harm to her daughter i disagree,however,with the majority disposition of niang claim of based on the psychological harm niang claims she will suffer if she is removed to senegal and forced to subject her daughter to female genital mutilation fgm.for the reasons that follow,i believe that the majority,by independently creating a per se rule that psychological harm alone can not constitute persecution,without considering the board of immigration appeals bia interpretation of the term persecution and without remanding the case for the bia to address the issue in the first instance,oversteps its bounds and fails to afford appropriate deference to the bia.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
although the majority opinion purports to apply the substantial evidence standard,it in fact conducts a de novo inquiry into the meaning of the term persecution in west.from this de novo inquiry,the majority derives a broad and potentially legal psychological harm,without any accompanying physical harm,does not constitute persecution.ante at.this holding stands in tension with the bia decision in in re,bia en banc,which held that an applicant for asylum and withholding of removal could establish persecution by virtue of his wife forced sterilization.neither the statute nor its implementing regulations define persecution,and the majority,by ignoring the bia interpretation of the term persecution in in re and independently establishing such a broad precedent without remanding for the bia to consider the question in the first instance,fails to afford appropriate deference to the agency.
although we review de novo questions of law determined by the bia,blanco de belbruno ashcroft,cir,we must afford appropriate deference to the bia interpretation of the immigration and nationality act ina or the act and any attendant regulations,christensen harris county,d stating that chevron deference should be afforded to an agency interpretation of an ambiguous statute and auer deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulation.because the bia adopted,affirmed,and supplemented the immigration judge ij decision,we review the decision of the ij as supplemented by the bia.chen gonzales,cir 
under chevron,a court reviewing an agency construction of the statute it administers must first determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,natural resources def.council,d.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.pursuant to auer,an agency interpretation of its own regulations is controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.auer robbins,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the majority does not suggest that the term persecution,which both the ina and its implementing regulations leave undefined,is unambiguous.nevertheless,the majority declines to afford deference to,or even address,the bia interpretation of the term.the bia,however,has not interpreted persecution to require a physical assault.to the contrary,in in re,the board,sitting en banc,held that an applicant for asylum and withholding of removal could establish persecution by virtue of his wife forced sterilization.the board reversed the ij determination that the applicant was in effect seek ing to ride on his wife coattails and had not himself been persecuted.id.at.board member rosenberg wrote a separate concurring opinion noting that it is not unusual in asylum cases for an applicant to demonstrate a fear of persecution although the harm experienced was not by him,but by a family member,and that it constitutes persecution for the asylum applicant to witness or experience the persecution of family members.id.at rosenberg,concurring.
also,we have previously stated that torture may constitute persecution.see li gonzales,cir stating that p ersecution involves the infliction or threat of death,torture,or injury to one person or freedom internal quotation marks omitted.the majority,however,does not consider legal and definitions of torture,which indicate that torture may be purely mental.the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat,defines torture as involving an act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person cat,article emphasis added.section of title,which implements the cat,provides that torture means an act committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions upon another person within his custody or physical control.west supp emphasis added.similarly,dictionary definitions of torture include anguish of body or mind.see,collegiate dictionary ed.
prior to,the ina authorized the attorney general to the deportation of any alien within the united states to any country in which in his opinion the alien would be subject to physical persecution,stat,codified at ina h,h emphasis added.in,congress amended ina h by striking out physical persecution and inserting in lieu thereof persecution on account of race,religion,or political opinion.an act to amend the immigration and nationality act,stat.thus,it appears that when congress has intended to restrict the availability of withholding of removal only to aliens who face persecution that is physical in nature,it has done so explicitly.
accordingly,i believe that the majority has established an interpretation of persecution that the bia might well consider too narrow.the majority expansive holding is in tension with,and makes no attempt to distinguish,the most analogous bia decision available,in re.this conflict has occurred because the majority,rather than reviewing an interpretation of persecution advanced by the ij or bia,has independently established a judicial interpretation of the term that is unnecessary for the resolution of this case.
neither the ij nor the bia purported to base its decision on the interpretation of persecution established by the majority.because the bia did not address whether the psychological harm niang alleged could constitute persecution within the meaning of,i believe that we are required to remand niang claim to the bia for the agency to address the issue in the first instance.see ins ventura,d per curiam a court of appeals is not generally empowered to conduct a de novo inquiry into the matter being reviewed and to reach its own conclusions based on such an inquiry rather,the proper course,except in rare circumstances,is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.internal quotation marks omitted sec chenery.holding that an administrative order can not be upheld unless the grounds upon which the agency acted in exercising its powers were those upon which its action can be sustained.
the ij premised his ineligibility determination on the finding that niang ha d not shown that anything would happen to her because of the action that may be performed against her daughter,and therefore ha d not made a case for herself in regards to persecution.at.in concluding that niang had not shown anything would happen to her,the ij did not address the evidence in the record that niang would be prevented from protecting her daughter from fgm,an experience that would cause niang severe mental suffering that she claimed would compound the psychological harm she had already suffered from enduring fgm as a young girl.the ij also did not address evidence demonstrating the child relatives readiness to employ mystical and social means of making niang regret her resistance to subjecting her daughter to fgm.at.
niang described the toucouleur ethnic group,to which she belongs,as very traditional or traditionalist.at.she explained that,for a toucouleur girl,fgm represents an essential initiation ceremony,and although the government has made the practice illegal,family has more weight than the laws,and she saw many violations during her time in senegal.at.niang testified that,as a result,she will have no means of protecting her daughter in senegal,where she will have no power and would have any choice in whether her daughter was subjected to fgm.at.
niang also supplied a letter from her daughter paternal grandparents urging the child father,papa samba ane,to bring the child to senegal for fgm.niang testified that ane agrees with his family and wants his daughter to undergo fgm.at.niang parents also believe that niang ha s no right to refuse to have the child circumcised,and that,if she refuses to subject her daughter to fgm,it will be a shame on them and they will be a target for insults from other members of the society.at.
niang further claimed that this mental suffering would be compounded by the lasting effects of the fgm that was performed on niang as a child.when niang was seven years old,her parents took her to a family circumciser for excision,which the world health organization classifies as type ii fgm.this form of fgm involves the excision removal of the clitoral hood with or without removal of all or part of the clitoris.at.niang affidavit provided that,as a result of this abuse,she developed health complications ranging from vaginal infections to difficulty in conceiv ing to vaginal bleeding.at.a doctor in gabon diagnosed niang with primary sterility and informed her that she would be unable to have children.nevertheless,niang,fought all her life to have children.at.she was fortunate to have the benefit of the excellent gynecological and obstetrical assistance available in the united states,and,in,at age,she gave birth to her daughter.in,when niang was,her son was born.niang had difficult pregnancies with both children.during her first pregnancy,she experienced fibroids and bleeding and had an exam that was monitored as an emergency because she had a condition known as placenta previa medical records submitted with her application also reveal that she required a cesarean section to deliver her second child 
niang also asserted that her psychological development was considerably hampered,at,by the physical trauma that she experienced as a young girl.she stated that t he pains that i went through and the blood that was shed on the day she was mutilated keeps on revisiting me up until today.at.while in senegal,niang witnessed young girls and at times women die due to complication s resulting from fgm.at.she opposed excision,and because of this resistance,became estranged from her parents,who considered her as a rebel against established rules and customs of the toucouleur society.at.the ij recognized that niang had been a victim of fgm and did not make an adverse credibility finding or otherwise indicate that he disbelieved niang.and,as niang asserts,no reasonable could deny that a devoted mother who continues to experience health and psychological problems as a result of fgm would experience severe mental suffering if she were forced to allow her daughter to suffer the same type of persecution.the ij finding that niang ha d not shown that anything would happen to her because of the action that may be performed against her daughter,at,is irreconcilable with the record,which reveals that niang would experience considerable mental suffering if her relatives prevented her from sparing her daughter the same persecution she endured as a child.thus,i believe the record compels the conclusion that niang would suffer an actual and concrete psychological harm if she were prevented from protecting her daughter from fgm.accordingly,the ij conclusion that she would be unaffected is not supported by substantial evidence.
finally,i note that,after finding that nothing would happen to niang as a result of her daughter persecution,the ij reached another conclusion.the ij found that,a dditionally,there no showing that the daughter would have to go back to senegal,because the father,ane,seemingly wa s getting ready to be able to adjust his status through his employment,and niang could allow the children to remain with him.at.that the child would not have to return to senegal to live,however,does not resolve the issue of whether the child would be sent to senegal to undergo fgm.the ij noted that although niang feared that ane would acquiesce and see that his daughter suffered fgm,ane had not previously made any effort to take the child to senegal.it is unclear,however,whether the ij viewed ane past indifference as sufficient to support a finding that there was no clear probability ane would acquiesce to his parent demands if niang opposition were no longer an impediment to sending the child to senegal 
moreover,the ij conclusion that the child would not have to return to senegal ignores niang definitive statement that she would take her children with her to senegal,where she would be sent if removed.niang seems to face a leave her daughter with a father who believes the child should undergo fgm,or take her daughter with her to senegal,where she will be powerless to prevent her daughter relatives from subjecting her to fgm.
because the ij assumed that niang would be unaffected by her daughter persecution,the ij did not consider whether the harm niang would suffer constituted persecution within the meaning of the ina and its implementing regulations.and,as a result,the ij did not fully consider whether the harm niang would suffer was more likely than not to occur.because the ij findings contradict the record and do not take into account all of the evidence submitted by niang,and because neither the ij nor the bia fully considered whether the type of harm niang alleges can constitute persecution,the best course of action would be to remand to allow the bia to address these issues.
in sum,i believe that the majority,by independently establishing a per se rule that psychological harm alone can not constitute persecution,without considering the bia decision in in re and without remanding the case for the bia to address the issue in the first instance,oversteps its bounds and fails to afford appropriate deference to the agency.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
fgm refers to a group of surgical procedures involving the removal of some or all of the external genitalia,performed primarily on girls and young women in africa and asia.haoua gonzales,fn.cir.these barbaric surgical procedures constitute an extreme form of child abuse and are an insult to human dignity and an affront to any civilized people.as we have previously noted,fgm is o ften performed under unsanitary conditions with highly rudimentary instruments and results in the painful,permanent disfigurement of the female genitalia,and exposes victims to a myriad of serious and potentially complications.id.listing as possible complications bleeding,infection,urine retention,stress,shock,psychological trauma,and damage to the urethra and anus.
citations to the refer to the joint appendix filed in this appeal.
fatime maternal grandparents in senegal do not appear to be a factor in the fgm equation,as niang reports that they believe a daughter belongs to her father family and that niang has no right to refuse to have the child circumcised.if she does refuse,niang believes it will be a shame on niang family and they will be a target for insults from other members of society.
the ij noted that niang was not eligible for a grant of humanitarian asylum because the fact that she was subjected to fgm years ago was not sufficiently compelling under in re chen,bia,which held that an ij,in his discretion,may grant asylum in the absence
