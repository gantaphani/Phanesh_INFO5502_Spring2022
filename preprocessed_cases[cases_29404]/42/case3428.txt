following a conditional guilty plea,willis reyes bonilla reyes appeals his conviction for being a deported alien found in the united states without permission in violation of.reyes contends that the district court should have granted his motion to dismiss the indictment because it was based on a removal order that was entered in violation of his due process right to counsel,prejudicing his ability to obtain immigration relief.
almost twenty years ago,our circuit held that a defendant seeking to exclude evidence of a prior removal order in a prosecution for illegal reentry must do more than demonstrate a violation of due process rights t he defendant also bears the burden of proving prejudice.united states proa tovar,cir en banc see also d requiring an alien to show that entry of the order was fundamentally unfair in order to succeed on a collateral attack.in so doing,the proa tovar court recognized that the defendant was effectively denied his right to direct review of the removal order,but affirmed his conviction for illegal reentry because he could identify no plausible grounds of relief that would have precluded his removal.at.accordingly,we did not attempt to delineate the boundaries of the prejudice element because w hatever they might be,proa tovar did not show that he suffered even the possibility of prejudice.id.at.
in this appeal,we are faced with two more variations in what has become an ongoing debate over the boundaries of prejudice resulting from due process violations during removal proceedings.first,we address whether prejudice should be presumed where an alien was not advised of his right to counsel and did not waive this right.we hold that such a violation does not by itself establish per se prejudice for the purpose of a collateral attack on a final removal order under d.second,we address what constitutes a plausible claim to deferral of removal under the convention against torture cat,in light of the absence of counsel at the time of removal proceedings.for the reasons that follow,we hold that reyes has not established that he had a plausible claim to relief at the time the removal order was issued.accordingly,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
reyes removal in 
a citizen of guatemala,reyes first entered the united states without permission in at the age of twenty.in,reyes was convicted in los angeles county of carjacking and assault with a firearm in violation of california penal code a and a and sentenced to seven years in prison.prior to his release,reyes was investigated by immigration authorities.
finding that reyes was not a legal permanent resident and had been convicted of an aggravated felony,immigration authorities processed his removal from the united states through expedited proceedings.pursuant to b,the attorney general has the discretion to determine the deportability of a resident alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony and issue a final order of removal without a hearing before an immigration judge.see outlining requirements for expedited removal proceedings under 
on august,deportation officer joel mata served reyes with a notice of intent to issue a final administrative removal order notice of intent.the first page of the notice of intent charged reyes with being deportable under a a iii,identified the allegations supporting this charge,and listed reyes statutory rights and responsibilities.it also stated that pursuant to b,the government intended to issue the final order without a hearing before an immigration judge,although reyes could seek judicial review of any final administrative order by filing a petition for review.among his rights,the notice of intent states that reyes may be represented at no expense to the united states government by counsel,authorized to practice in this proceeding.
the notice of intent is entirely in english.reyes has testified,however,that he can not speak or read english.at the bottom of the first page,the section of the notice attesting to service indicates that officer mata explained served it to reyes in spanish.while there is a signature block for an interpreter,it was left blank.
on the second page of the notice of intent,reyes acknowledged receiving it and indicated that he did not wish to contest the charge by signing a preprinted waiver section,which was also entirely in english.this preprinted section states 
i admit the allegations and charge in the notice of intent.i admit that i am deportable and acknowledge that i am not eligible for any form of relief from removal.i waive my right to rebut and contest the above charges and my right to file a petition for review of the final removal order.i wish to be deported to guatemala.
while officer mata signed this section as a witness,there is no additional indication that he explained or read the preprinted admissions and waivers to reyes in spanish.the waiver section also makes no mention of reyes waiver of his right to counsel.
based on the uncontested allegations in the notice of intent and reyes waiver of his right to file a petition for review,a final administrative removal order was issued on august.reyes was subsequently removed to guatemala on october.
reinstatement of the removal order in 
reyes reentered the united states without permission in.in,reyes was arrested in san diego county and pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol.while on probation for this charge,reyes was again arrested for driving under the influence and sentenced to nine days in jail.following completion of this sentence,reyes was detained by immigration and customs enforcement ice in november 
during an interview conducted in spanish on november,reyes told an ice agent that he fear ed persecution or torture should he be removed from the united states,explaining that g angs in guatemala have threatened my life.nine days later,however,reyes filed a form withdrawing his request for a reasonable fear determination.completed with the assistance of a spanish translator,this form states that reyes was withdrawing his prior request because i never intended to apply for asylum and want to return to guatemala as soon as possible.i am not afraid to return to guatemala.this form further indicates that reyes had been advised of his right to seek protection from removal based on fear of torture or persecution,that he was represented by counsel,and that he had discussed the matter with his counsel.finally,the form includes an english translation of questioning about his prior statements in which reyes says the officer who interviewed me asked me if i was afraid and i just said gangs were bad in guatemala.i did not mean that i was afraid to return because of the gangs or that i would be harmed.that is not the case.while reyes now contends that he was not represented by counsel and did not consult with an attorney at the time he withdrew his request,he does not dispute the accuracy of the statements attributed to him.
following reyes withdrawal of his request for a reasonable fear determination,the removal order was reinstated.reyes was subsequently removed to guatemala on december.
proceedings before the district court 
in less than twelve months,reyes again returned to the united states and was again arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.after serving a year in jail,he was released to ice on may.on july,reyes was indicted on one count of being an alien found in the united states following removal in violation of a and b.
reyes moved to dismiss the indictment,arguing that the august,final removal order was invalid because he was never advised of his rights in a language he could understand and therefore did not validly waive them.in support,reyes testified that at the time of his initial removal in i was told by the immigration officer that i was going to be deported and that i should just sign so i could go i was never advised by the immigration officer of my right to consult with an attorney,my right to appeal,or that i might be eligible for immigration relief.
reyes argued that he was prejudiced by this due process violation because with the help of counsel he could have sought some form of relief,including deferral of his removal based on his fear of gang violence in guatemala.he testified that i never had the opportunity to tell the immigration officer about the dangers of returning to guatemala.reyes contends that p eople who return from the united states are frequently targeted by gangs because the gangs believe that they have money.further,he alleges that m embers of the gang ms beat me and tried to kill me in guatemala between and.
as to the statements he made in when he withdrew his request for a reasonable fear determination,reyes testified 
in,i told the immigration officer about my fear of returning to guatemala.i was then referred to an asylum officer.i spoke with the asylum officer for only a few minutes.he did not explain my rights to me,and at no time did i consult with an attorney.i was told that i did not have a chance,and that i should initial a form so they could send me out.
following a hearing,the district court from the bench denied reyes motion to dismiss the indictment.based on the language in the notice of intent,the court found that reyes was advised of his right to counsel and that he waived it.the court stated that some deference and some validity has to be given to these official documents it just seems the document here is so clear cut,and there is no evidence to the contrary other than reyes own declaration.accordingly,the district court did not address reyes claim to prejudice.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction to review a final judgment of the district court pursuant to.we review de novo a claim that a defect in a prior removal proceeding precludes reliance on the final removal order in a subsequent proceeding.united states ramos,cir quoting united states lopez vasquez,cir a claim that a defect in a prior deportation order precludes reliance on the deportation in a prosecution for violation of presents mixed questions of law and fact requiring us to exercise judgment about legal principles.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.id.at.we may affirm a district court denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment on any basis supported by the record.united states davis,cir.
iii.discussion 
reyes contends that his indictment for illegal reentry should be dismissed because the removal order was entered in violation of his due process rights.because the underlying removal order serves as a predicate element of an illegal reentry offense under,a defendant charged with that offense may collaterally attack the removal order under the due process clause.united states pallares galan,cir citing united states mendoza lopez,d our cases establish that where a determination made in an administrative proceeding is to play a critical role in the subsequent imposition of a criminal sanction,there must be some meaningful review of the administrative proceeding.
to succeed in such a challenge,however,an alien must demonstrate that the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.d under our case law,a predicate removal order satisfies the condition of being fundamentally unfair for purposes of d when the deportation proceeding violated the alien due process rights and the alien suffered prejudice as a result.united states arias ordonez,cir citing united states ubaldo figueroa,cir.
reyes argues that his due process rights were violated because he was not advised of his right of appeal or his right to counsel in a language that he could understand,making any waiver of these rights invalid.further,he claims that the denial of his right to counsel inherently prejudiced his ability to obtain immigration relief,satisfying the fundamental unfairness requirement under d without a further showing of actual prejudice.reyes also argues that he was actually prejudiced by the denial of his right to counsel because with such assistance,he would have been able to present a plausible claim for deferral of removal under cat.
due process violations 
right to appeal 
a n alien is barred from collaterally attacking the validity of an underlying deportation order if he validly waived the right to appeal that order during the deportation proceedings.united states gonzalez,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.accordingly,we must first determine whether reyes validly waived his right of appeal by signing the waiver section of the notice of intent.if reyes did not validly waive his right of appeal,the first two requirements under d will be satisfied.see ubaldo figueroa,at.
even in expedited removal proceedings conducted under,an alien waiver of the right of appeal must be both considered and intelligent in order to be valid.see gonzalez,at united states arrieta,cir.the government bears the burden of proving valid waiver in a collateral attack of the underlying removal proceedings,ramos,at,and it must do so by clear and convincing evidence.pallares galan,at quoting gete ins,cir.
based on the language of the notice of intent,the district court found that reyes had validly waived his right of appeal.this conclusion would be sound if reyes had not contested his understanding of the notice.w here the government introduces official records which on their face show a valid waiver of rights in connection with a deportation proceeding,the burden shifts to the defendant to come forward with evidence tending to prove the waiver was invalid.united states galicia gonzalez,cir affirming waiver where the defendant failed to even suggest that his rights were improperly explained or that he was coerced into waiving them.
yet reyes specifically testified that he can not read english and that officer mata did not advise him of the rights detailed in the notice of intent.while dismissing reyes declaration as,the district court failed to address the key factual issue of whether reyes was actually advised of the contents of the notice of intent in a language he could understand see cfr b v ice must either provide the alien with a written translation of the notice of intent or explain the contents of the notice of intent to the alien in the alien native language or in a language that the alien understands.
a waiver of rights can not be found to have been considered or intelligent where there is no evidence that the detainee was first advised of those rights in a language he could understand.see ramos,at we can not conclude that waiver of rights,including the right to appeal,was considered or intelligent without evidence that a detainee was able to understand the questions posed to him when put to the choice of foregoing all rights or remaining in detention until he could appear before an ij.quoting perez lastor ins,cir it is that a competent translation is fundamental to a full and fair hearing.if an alien does not speak english,deportation proceedings must be translated into a language the alien understands.
the language of the notice of intent falls far short of clear and convincing evidence that reyes was advised of his right of appeal in a language he could understand.the only indication that reyes was advised of his rights in spanish is the notation that officer mata explained served it to reyes in spanish.this language can be read to mean that reyes was only served with the notice of intent in spanish,and the government failed to adduce evidence suggesting that the notice was in fact explained in spanish.because the record is unclear on this point,we can not simply presume that reyes was advised of his rights in a language he could understand.see ramos,at every reasonable presumption against waiver,and do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.quoting lopez vasquez,at.
even if we were to assume from this notation that some explanation was given,there is no evidence as to the extent of the explanation given or officer mata ability to communicate in spanish.further,there is no indication that such an explanation extended to the waiver on the second page of the notice.see pallares galan,at explaining that evidence of a detainee understanding of his right of appeal is not sufficient to establish a considered and intelligent waiver of that right.in ramos,we rejected a waiver given after an immigration officer who was not fluent in spanish attempted to explain to the detainee in broken spanish the rights specified in a stipulated removal form.at the government argues that ramos waiver was considered and intelligent because ramos failed to give any indication to the deportation officer that he did not understand or appreciate what he was signing.however,a deportation officer feeling that a detainee understood her broken attempts to speak spanish is insufficient to meet the government burden.we concluded that ramos waiver of appeal and of the due process rights specified in the stipulated removal form was not considered or intelligent because he did not receive a competent spanish language translation of his right to appeal when he signed the form.id.at see also id.at moreover,we can not conclude that ramos waiver was considered and intelligent because the government has not established by clear and convincing evidence that he received adequate advisement of the consequences of his waiver of appeal.citing pallares galan,at.there is even less evidence here of a competent translation because the government has proffered no evidence that officer mata made any attempt to explain to reyes his rights before he waived them.
under these circumstances,the government has failed to meet its burden of proving that reyes waiver of his right of appeal was considered and intelligent.because he did not validly waive his right of appeal,reyes is exempted from the requirement under d that he exhaust all administrative remedies before collaterally attacking the removal order.see ubaldo figueroa,at w e hold that although ubaldo figueroa did not exhaust his administrative remedies by appealing his removal order to the bia in,he is exempted from the exhaustion bar because his waiver of his right to appeal was not sufficiently considered and intelligent under the due process clause of the fifth amendment.further,reyes has met the requirement under d that the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived him of the opportunity for judicial review because he was not advised of his right to appeal the final removal order.id.w e find that ubaldo figueroa was deprived of the opportunity for meaningful judicial review because the ij did not inform him of his right to appeal his deportation order.
right to counsel 
although reyes has satisfied the first two prongs of based on his right of appeal,we briefly address the due process violation related specifically to his right to counsel because his claim to prejudice under the third prong rests squarely on the impingement of this right.although there is no sixth amendment right to counsel in an immigration hearing,congress has recognized it among the rights stemming from the fifth amendment guarantee of due process that adhere to individuals that are the subject of removal proceedings.tawadrus ashcroft,cir citing rios berrios ins,cir.while t he right to counsel in immigration proceedings is rooted in the due process clause,biwot gonzales,cir,the right to counsel in expedited removal proceedings is also secured by statute.b b t he alien shall have the privilege of being represented at no expense to the government by such counsel,authorized to practice in such proceedings,as the alien shall choose.b i the notice of intent shall advise that the alien has the privilege of being represented,at no expense to the government,by counsel of the alien choosing,as long as counsel is authorized to practice in removal proceedings see also b iv requiring ice to provide aliens facing expedited removal with a list of available free legal services programs.
as discussed previously,the record fails to show that reyes was advised of any of his due process rights,including his right to counsel,in a language he could understand.such an explanation of the due process rights outlined in the notice of intent is required under b v.see ramon sepulveda ins,cir it is a maxim that agencies must comply with their own regulations.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.this procedural error in reyes expedited removal constitutes a violation of his due process right to counsel.see ramos,at holding that failure to receive a competent explanation of his rights in a language he could understand invalidated ramos express waiver of the right to counsel and thereby violated his due process right to counsel.
further,the district court erred in finding that reyes waived his right to counsel.the notice of intent signed by reyes includes no express waiver of the right to counsel accordingly,the district court finding that he did waive his right to counsel was clearly erroneous because no such affirmative waiver is stated in the record or could be assumed.see hinkson,at tawadrus,at in order for a waiver to be valid,an ij must generally inquire specifically as to whether petitioner wishes to continue without a lawyer and receive a knowing and voluntary affirmative response.emphasis added and internal citations omitted ramos,at noting that we do not presume waiver of fundamental rights.therefore,reyes was not properly advised of his due process right to counsel nor did he waive this right.
as noted,a predicate removal order satisfies the condition of being fundamentally unfair for purposes of d when the deportation proceeding violated the alien due process rights and the alien suffered prejudice as a result.arias ordonez,at citing ubaldo figueroa,at.having established that the removal proceedings here violated reyes due process right to counsel,we turn to his claim of prejudice resulting from this violation.first,reyes argues that a due process violation of an alien right to counsel during removal proceedings establishes per se no further showing of actual the purpose of a collateral attack on a final removal order under d second,he argues that he was actually prejudiced because with the assistance of counsel,he could have presented a plausible claim to deferral of removal under cat.
per se prejudice 
in establishing a fifth amendment right to collaterally attack a removal order,the supreme court in mendoza lopez held that t he fundamental procedural defects of the deportation hearing in this case rendered direct review of the immigration judge determination unavailable to respondents.at.while declining to enumerate which procedural errors are so fundamental that they may functionally deprive the alien of judicial review,the court recognized that some procedural abuses could operate,under some circumstances,to deny effective judicial review of administrative determinations.id.at.based on mendoza lopez,the initial proa tovar panel adopted a rule that violation of an alien due process right to judicial review of a removal order made that order inadmissible in a subsequent illegal reentry case,regardless of whether actual prejudice could be shown.united states proa tovar,cir reading mendoza lopez as a rule,in order to encourage the ins to make certain that every person deported as the result of an administrative hearing was adequately apprised,on the record,of his right to appeal,overruled en banc by proa tovar,cir.
taking proa tovar en banc,our circuit held that mendoza lopez did not support this approach and affirmed prior circuit cases that required a showing of prejudice at.our court stated 
we are satisfied that the supreme court has not eliminated prejudice from the equation.our cases required a showing of prejudice when collateral attacks on immigration orders were made in prosecutions under section.see,united states nicholas armenta,cir united states calles pineda,cir colindres aguilar ins,cir on direct appeal,due process challenge to ins proceeding requires showing of actual prejudice.we hold that the rule established in those cases also applies when the attack is on the ground that there has been a deprivation of the right
