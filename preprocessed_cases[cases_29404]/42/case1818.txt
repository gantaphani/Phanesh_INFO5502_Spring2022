in this immigration case,the petitioner challenges the immigration and customs enforcement ice reinstatement of a previous removal order under a as impermissibly retroactive.
we affirm the decision to reinstate the removal order,because the application of a is not impermissibly retroactive in this case.the statute does not impair any rights the petitioner possessed when he acted,increase his liability for past conduct,or impose new consequences with respect to past conduct already completed.
facts and procedural background 
petitioner alexis silva rosa a citizen of honduras,entered the united states without inspection in.he was apprehended and,after a deportation hearing,ordered to be removed by the immigration and naturalization service ins a few months later.silva rosa was deported to honduras on may.in june,he again entered the united states without inspection.in january,silva rosa married julia garza,a mexican national and lawful permanent resident of the united states.in august,garza filed an immigrant relative visa petition on silva rosa behalf this petition was approved in march of,but the visa was not immediately available to him.based on certain priority factors and preferences for different classes of applicants,his visa would only be immediately available to him at some indefinite point in the future.
on september,congress passed,and the president signed into law,the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat.section of iirira created section a in the immigration and naturalization act,codified at a,which authorizes the attorney general to reinstate a prior removal order of an illegally reentered alien and to remove the alien without additional administrative proceedings and limits the opportunity for relief.the effective date of this statute was april.iirira reinstatement provision extended previously inapplicable reinstatement procedures to aliens,like silva rosa,who illegally reentered after being previously deported solely based on their entry into the united states without inspection.ashcroft,cir.for this class of aliens,iirira reinstatement provision also eliminates previously available discretionary relief,such as an adjustment of status,when they are subject to reinstated removal proceedings.see gonzales,cir.
his visa became immediately available to him in february after iirira effective date.in october,silva rosa filed an application for adjustment of status.in,after hearing nothing about his case,he went to an ice office to inquire about his case.at this point,ice realized that silva rosa had been previously deported and had illegally reentered the united states.on february,ice reinstated silva rosa prior order of removal pursuant to a.
silva rosa now petitions for review of the reinstatement of the removal order under a.he argues that applying section a to him is impermissibly retroactive,because he married a lawful permanent resident of the united states and obtained an approved immigrant relative visa petition before iirira enactment.he argues he is now entitled to and had reasonably expected an adjustment of status as relief against removal,which was available to him under the state of the law.such relief,he asserts,is a vested right or settled expectation that,by virtue of section a,has now been impermissibly taken away.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
this court has jurisdiction to review the reinstatement of a deportation order,at.whether the reinstatement provision of iirira may be applied retroactively to silva rosa is an issue of law that this court reviews de novo.see pasquarell,cir citing graham johnson,cir.
discussion 
the question before this court is whether iirira is impermissibly retroactive as applied to silva rosa.to determine whether a statute has an effect that is impermissibly retroactive,we apply a test.first,the court determines whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.landgraf usi film,d.this court,in,conclude d that it is unclear whether congress intended that a apply retroactively.at see also gonzales,d common principles of statutory interpretation fail to unsettle the apparent application of a to any reentrant present in the country,whatever the date of return.
since the first step does not resolve the question,we proceed to the second step,which analyzes whether the statute,if applied retroactively,would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed,at quoting landgraf,at.the supreme court has described the imposition of new duties on completed transactions also as the imposition of new burdensome consequences or disabilities on past conduct.at.we have also noted that any retroactive effect on settled expectations and vested rights may be impermissible.see,at griffon dep of health and human,cir see also.at.appellant makes two arguments regarding impermissible retroactive effects the combination of his marriage to a lawful permanent resident and an approved immigrant relative visa petition would constitute a vested right or settled expectation that he is still eligible to adjust status as relief from removal and that new consequences,the application of removal proceedings to his class of aliens,are imposed on an already completed past transaction,his illegal reentry into this country without inspection.see.at noting the two types of retroactivity claims.
petitioner marriage to a lawful permanent resident and approved immigrant relative visa petition does not create a vested right or settled expectation.
the petitioner argues that the combination of his marriage to a lawful permanent resident and an approved immigrant relative visa petition constitutes a vested right or settled expectation.
as background,the process to obtain an adjustment of status includes several steps.first,an alien has to establish his eligibility and then he must actually apply.for the situation here,an alien married to a lawful permanent resident,his spouse must first file an immigrant relative visa petition.the petition must then be approved.once approved,the alien must wait until the visa is available.due to numerical limitations,visas are made immediately available on a certain date based on several priority factors and preferences.the alien is prima facie eligible for the adjustment of status when his visa becomes immediately available and the alien then applies for adjustment.see generally b a i,a,a,i diarra gonzales,cir per curiam unpublished.once an application is submitted,the attorney general can then decide whether to adjust the alien status.a.the question before this court is at what stage can an alien obtain a vested right or settled expectation that he can adjust his status as relief from removal.
the eighth circuit,in ashcroft,concluded that the retroactive application of iirira impermissibly impacted the reasonable expectation that an illegal alien could defend against later removal by seeking an adjustment of status,where the alien married a united states citizen,cir.the appellant heavily relies on to argue that marriage to a lawful permanent resident would suffice to create a reasonable expectation protected from iirira retroactive effect.
while the supreme court has not explicitly rejected the court opinion in casts doubt on its continued validity.in fact,the eighth circuit recently noted that effectively overruled conclusion that marriage to a citizen by itself creates a reasonable expectation of relief from removal that is protected from iirira reach.see gonzalez chertoff,cir see also gonzales,cir.
in,the court noted that any expected relief from removal under a reasonable expectation or vested rights theory must be something more substantial than inchoate expectations and unrealized opportunities.at.this court has never determined whether a marriage to a lawful permanent resident and an approved immigrant relative visa petition give rise to any vested right or settled expectations of relief from removal.nevertheless,for continuances of removal proceedings based on an alien petition for adjustment of status,we note that the righ
