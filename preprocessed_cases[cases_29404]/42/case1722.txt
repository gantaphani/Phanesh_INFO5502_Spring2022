appellant german appeals his sentence.for the reasons set forth herein,we vacate sentence and remand for resentencing.
pleaded guilty to one count of being unlawfully present in the united states following deportation,in violation of.under the guidelines applicable to this case,the presentence report psr recommended a base offense level of eight.see a.the psr also recommended a enhancement pursuant to b a ii,after concluding that prior texas conviction for injury to a child,under.penal code ann.a,qualified as a crime of violence.the psr included a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,but indicated that the government did not plan to pursue an additional reduction pursuant to b.resulting offense level of,combined with a criminal history category of iii,resulted in a guidelines range of months imprisonment.
requested a downward variance on the basis that he originally believed that his prior conviction would result in a enhancement under case law finding that injury to a child by omission does not constitute a crime of violence.however,admitted that his prior conviction was for intentionally and knowingly causing bodily injury to a child by striking her with a weedeater,which is not an injury caused by omission.the government requested a sentence,noting that had a history of family violence and returned to the united states shortly after his prior deportation.
also argued that he was entitled to an additional reduction under b simply for entering a timely guilty plea.however,the government refused to move for the reduction because would not waive his appellate rights.at sentencing,the district court overruled objection,finding that the government had authority under this circuit precedent to refuse to move for the additional reduction.the district court declined to grant a downward variance.
the district court considered all the arguments of counsel and concluded that a sentence would satisfy the a factors.the court sentenced to months in prison,to be followed by a term of supervised release.
at the outset,we must address the government argument that waived the right to appeal his sentence because he specifically addressed the enhancement under b a ii and conceded that it was proper under his understanding of the case law.in particular,the government points to the following statements by defense counsel 
the predicate offense in this case was injury to a child there is case law that says that injury to a child by omission is not a crime of violence and would only garner a enhancement.
however,there is case law p articularly,i looking here at keisler,cir,which finds that if injury to a child stems from an intentional act,then it definitely is a crime of violence.your honor,my client position throughout has been that the injury was the result of an accident.
now,the fact remains that he pled to the offense as charged in the indictment which charged an intentional offense 
based on this colloquy,the government contends that knew of the sentencing guidelines issue and that he consciously chose to forego it.contends that the statements,in fact,show that defense counsel misunderstood and failed to account for precedent indicating that the texas offense of injury to a child is not a crime of violence.
waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right.united states olano.a waiver occurs by an affirmative choice by the defendant to forego any remedy available to him,presumably for real or perceived benefits resulting from the waiver.united states dodson,cir.in contrast,forfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right.olano,at.
we have found only one case in this circuit that suggests that counsel statements,here,might constitute a waiver.see united states,cir.in,the court sua sponte considered whether the defendant waived his appeal of the application of a enhancement for his prior conviction on the basis that the prior crime was not a crime of violence.id.the court acknowledged that a defendant does not waive review simply by fail ing to object to the characterization of his prior offense as a crime of violence.id.quoting united states alfaro,cir,cert.denied,alteration in original.but it found that the defendant did more than fail to object he affirmatively recognized the enhancement was being applied and indicated it was proper.id.the court concluded that these statements did not rise to the level of waiver,but arguably constituted invited error.in an abundance of caution,the court nonetheless reviewed for plain error.id.
although we recognize the factual similarity counsel acknowledged that the enhancement was did so on the basis of a misunderstanding of this court precedent.the statements regarding the propriety of the enhancement do not constitute a waiver because they do not evidence an intentional and knowing relinquishment of a right.counsel failure to object below because he did not recognize the argument now being made on appeal is not a waiver.see united states,app x,cir unpublished see also united states,cir finding no waiver of sentencing guidelines issue even though defense counsel stated that other than the blakely objection,he had no problem with the psr.accordingly,we review for plain error.
following united states booker,this court reviews sentences for reasonableness in light of the factors in a.united states mares,cir.pursuant to gall united states,the court determines whether the sentence is procedurally sound and whether it is substantively reasonable.this court reviews a district court interpretation of the guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error.united states,cir.because did not object below,he must establish that the district court plainly erred in applying the guidelines,at.under plain error,the appellant must show an error,that is clear or obvious,and that affected his substantial rights.see puckett united states,united states villegas,cir.if these requirements are met,this court may remedy the error if it seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.puckett.at quotation omitted alteration in original.
the guidelines provide for a increase in a defendant base offense level if he was previously deported after being convicted of a crime of violence.b a ii.a crime of violence is defined as either one of a list of enumerated crimes or any other offense under federal,state,or local law that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,comment.b iii emphasis added.the crime of injury to a child,for which was previously convicted,is not one of the enumerated crimes.thus,to qualify for the enhancement,the statute of conviction must have as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force.texas penal code a provides that a person commits an offense if he intentionally,knowingly,recklessly,or with criminal negligence,by act or intentionally,knowingly,or recklessly by omission,causes to a child serious bodily injury serious mental deficiency,impairment,or injury or bodily injury.
in determining whether an offense is a crime of violence,this court looks to the elements of the crime,not to the defendant actual conduct in committing it.united states,cir en banc.the elements come from the statute of conviction,not from the particular manner and means that attend a given violation of the statute.id.however,where,as here,a statute lists alternative methods of committing a crime,a court may look to charging papers to see which of the various statutory alternatives were involved in a particular case.id.at see also,at holding that.penal code ann.a may be pared down by reference to charging documents because a defendant can be convicted either for an intentional act or an omission.notwithstanding protests that he accidentally caused injury to a child,it is clear that he was convicted of causing injury by an act,rather than an omission.specifically,pleaded guilty to the charge that he did intentionally and knowingly cause bodily injury to a child younger than years of age,by striking her with a weedeater.
the question is whether a conviction for causing injury to a child
