maciasowicz,and appeal from decisions of either the ins in the case of or the bia in the case of maciasowicz and finding them removable.we will briefly discuss the background of each petitioner appeal.
a citizen of mexico,entered the united states without inspection in.he applied for temporary resident alien status in,but his application was denied because he did not submit information about his criminal record,which up to that point included four convictions for driving while intoxicated dwi.subsequently,on october,bazan reyes was paroled into the united states.eleven years later,in april,bazan reyes pleaded guilty to a class d felony,operating a vehicle while intoxicated,in violation of section of the indiana code as a result,he was sentenced to three years imprisonment.in june,the ins commenced expedited removal proceedings against bazan reyes pursuant to ina section.see b.the ins issued a notice of intent to issue a final removal order,charging bazan reyes with removability based on his april felony conviction for dwi.in the notice of intent,the ins alleged that bazan reyes was guilty of an aggravated felony and removable on that basis.in october,the ins issued a final administrative order finding removable.
maciasowicz 
maciasowicz,a citizen of poland,was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident in december.in february,he pleaded guilty to two counts of homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle under wisconsin statute section he was sentenced to consecutive terms of five years on the first count and ten years on the second count however,the sentence on the second count was withheld and probation ordered.in february,the ins issued maciasowicz a notice to appear nta charging him with removability pursuant to a a iii based on his conviction for homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle.at the hearing,the immigration judge ij found that homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle under wisconsin statute section is an aggravated felony and ordered maciasowicz removed on that basis.maciasowicz appealed to the bia,but his appeal was dismissed on october.the bia found that the ij correctly determined that maciasowicz was deportable under because he had been convicted of a crime of violence.
a citizen of mexico,was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident in november.in june,was arrested for driving under the influence dui.because he had two previous drunk driving convictions,he was charged with aggravated driving under the influence.see.comp.stat.d pleaded guilty and was sentenced to months in prison.the ins commenced removal proceedings against on march,by issuing a nta.the nta alleged that was removable because he was guilty of an aggravated felony under a f.at his hearing before the ij,admitted that he had been convicted for aggravated driving under the influence and sentenced to months imprisonment.the ij found that aggravated driving under the influence is a crime of violence as defined in b,and therefore is an aggravated felony.on that basis,the ij ordered removed.appealed the ij determination that he was guilty of an aggravated felony to the bia,but the bia dismissed his appeal on october.
petitioners,maciasowicz,and all filed timely petitions for review of the ins and bia decisions finding them removable.on appeal,petitioners argue that the ins and the bia erred in their determination that bazan reyes and prior convictions for dwi and maciasowicz conviction for homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle are aggravated felonies rendering them removable under a a iii.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat,limits our review of orders of removal.under a c,as amended by the iirira,no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section a a iii.nevertheless,the government concedes that we retain jurisdiction in order to determine jurisdiction and may thus review the threshold issue of whether petitioners convictions for driving while intoxicated are indeed aggravated felonies as defined by a a iii.see solorzano patlan ins,cir xiong ins,cir.here,the jurisdictional question and the merits collapse into one because the issue of whether petitioners convictions were aggravated felonies also provides the basis for their challenges to removal.see guerrero perez ins,cir.thus,we must decide whether the state drunk driving convictions of,maciasowicz,and can be considered aggravated felonies under a.
was properly placed in expedited removal proceedings 
before turning to the question of whether petitioners have committed aggravated felonies,we must first address bazan reyes claim that the ins lacked subject matter jurisdiction to issue a final order of removal against him because he was improperly placed into expedited removal proceedings under section of the ina.unlike petitioners maciasowicz and,bazan reyes was not a lawful permanent resident at the time the ins commenced deportation proceedings against him because he was paroled rather than admitted to the country.therefore,the ins placed bazan reyes in expedited removal proceedings pursuant to.section b allows the attorney general to issue an order of removal for a resident alien if the alien is deportable under a a iii,if the alien has committed an aggravated felony.bazan reyes claims that he is not deportable under a a iii because the language of that provision forbids its application to parolees.
argument that parolees may not be placed in expedited removal proceedings is based on the introductory paragraph to a which provides any alien in and admitted to the united states shall be removed if the alien is within one or more of the following classes of deportable aliens.bazan reyes argues that,since he has not been admitted to this country,he does not fall under,and thus may not be placed in expedited proceedings.we disagree.section b of title of the united states code,entitled removal of aliens who are not permanent residents,allows the attorney general to utilize expedited proceedings to remove certain aliens who are not lawful permanent residents,including those who have been convicted of aggravated felonies.nothing in that section prohibits its application to parolees,and,as the government points out,construing the statute to forbid its application to parolees would provide more favorable treatment for parolees than for lawfully admitted aliens.we can not believe that congress intended such a result.we find it more plausible that the reference to a a iii simply operates to incorporate the definition of aggravated felony set out in that section to elucidate which resident aliens may be placed in expedited proceedings.therefore,we reject argument that he was improperly placed in removal proceedings and will consider whether his prior well as the prior convictions of petitioners maciasowicz and properly found to be an aggravated felony.
is driving while intoxicated an aggravated felony 
statutory framework 
section a a iii of the ina provides that a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony is deportable.a a iii.petitioners dispute neither the fact of their convictions nor their alien status.therefore,the only remaining issue in these consolidated appeals is whether the petitioners convictions may be deemed aggravated felonies under a a iii.although we review de novo the determinations by the ins and the bia that petitioners are removable because they committed aggravated felonies,see xiong ins,cir,the bia interpretation of the statute it administers is entitled to deference.see,cir.
the ina provides that the term aggravated felony includes,inter alia,a crime of violence as defined in section of title,but not including a purely political offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.a f all of the petitioners were sentenced to a year or more of imprisonment.thus,in order to determine whether,maciasowicz,and were properly found to have committed aggravated felonies,we must determine whether their state convictions for driving while intoxicated are crimes of violence as defined in.see ins,cir.
categorical approach 
in order to determine whether congress intended the term crime of violence as defined in to encompass conduct prohibited under a specific state statute,we generally employ a categorical approach.see lara ruiz ins,cir.in other words,we ask only whether the generic elements of the statute under which the alien was convicted together with the indictment constitute a crime of violence.see id.in using such an approach,however,we will not categorize all conduct covered by a statute as crime of violence conduct if the statute covers both conduct that constitutes a crime of violence and conduct that does not.see xiong ins,cir.we will look past the charging documents to the aliens specific conduct if it i s otherwise impossible to determine the proper classification of the offense and such an inquiry would not require evidentiary hearings into disputed issues of fact.id.quoting united states shannon,cir see also taylor united states,d determining that an offense constitutes burglary under the armed career criminal act,e,if either the statutory definition or the charging papers and jury instructions actually required the jury to find all of the elements of burglary.
do petitioners convictions qualify as crimes of violence under 
as is evident from the case at hand,the bia has interpreted the definition of crime of violence set out in to include crimes of as drunk pose a substantial risk that one object will exert a force upon another.see in re,interim decision,wl bia in re,interim decision,wl bia matter of alcantar,wl,bia see also in re sweetser,interim decision,wl bia finding that petitioner conviction for criminally negligent child abuse was not a crime of violence because although a parent who negligently leaves a young child unattended near a body of water may risk serious injury to the child,there is no risk that force will be used in the commission of the offense.according to the bia,the term crime of violence as articulated in b is not limited to crimes of specific intent,but also includes offenses that involve reckless and possibly negligent behavior.petitioners challenge this interpretation they argue that a requires intentional force and that b requires a substantial risk of intentional force.because the offenses of which they were convicted do not normally involve intentional force or a substantial risk of intentional force,petitioners claim that they are not guilty of crimes of violence and are therefore not removable.
the circuits are split on the issue of whether a prior conviction for dwi is a crime of violence under.compare united states,cir holding that b requires recklessness with respect to the risk that intentional force may be used in the course of committing the offense,and united states parson,cir suggesting,in dicta,that dwi is not a crime of violence because b requires a willingness to risk having to commit a crime of specific intent,with park ins,cir holding that a reckless mens rea is sufficient to constitute a crime of violence under a and b,ins,cir relying on sentencing guidelines cases interpreting the term crime of violence to uphold the bia determination that drunk driving is a crime of violence under b,and le attorney,cir holding that petitioner conviction for causing serious bodily injury while driving under the influence satisfies the definition of a crime of violence under a because one element of the offense includes the actual use of physical force.
we have never directly addressed the issue of whether drunk driving is a crime of violence for the purposes of.in united states rutherford,cir,however,we examined the related issue of whether a conviction for causing serious bodily injury while driving under the influence qualified as a crime of violence for the purposes of section of the united states sentencing guidelines id.in rutherford,the defendant argued on appeal that the district court impermissibly enhanced his sentence as a career criminal because the court erred in finding that his prior conviction qualified as a crime of violence under section.see id.at.he argued that both prongs of section require,and that the sentencing court therefore erred in finding that he had committed a crime of violence because drunk driving does not involve specific intent.see id.at.we accepted the defendant argument with respect to the first prong,section i,but not with respect to the second prong,section ii.see id.at.
although both parties agree that our decision in rutherford is central to the issue at hand,they vigorously dispute its proper application.because our analysis depends in part on a comparison of the language defining the term crime of violence in b with the language of section of the sentencing guidelines,we set out the language of both provisions here.crime of violence is defined by section of title of the united states code to include the following 
a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,or 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
section of the sentencing guidelines provides that 
the term crime of violence means any offense under federal or state law,punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,that 
i has an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,or 
ii is burglary of a dwelling,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
initially,these two provisions were identical because the guidelines defined crime of violence by simply incorporating the definition found in b.see sentencing guidelines manual,app.c at.this changed in,however,when the sentencing commission adopted the definition of crime of violence now found in section.see id.a comparison of the current provisions reveals that the language of the first prongs of both definitions is nearly identical while the language of the second prong of the is distinct from the second prong of.
in rutherford,we found that the term use of physical force in section i implies an intentional act rather than the mere application or exertion of force.rutherford,at.but see id.at easterbrook,concurring arguing that section i does not require intent to use force because the word use refers not to mens rea of the actor,but rather to the actus reus.our finding was based on the dictionary definition as well as the common understanding of the word use.see id.at.in making this determination,we noted the following 
force is exerted in many instances where it is not employed for any particular purpose.for example,earthquakes and avalanches involve the exertion of a tremendous amount of force referring to a randomly occurring avalanche as a use of force would torture the english language a drunk driver who injures a pedestrian would not describe the incident by saying he used his car to hurt someone.in ordinary english,the word use implies intentional availment.no availment of force in order to achiev
