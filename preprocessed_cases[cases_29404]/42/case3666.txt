factual and procedural background 
on december,poghos kazarian,a native and citizen of armenia,filed an application for an immigrant visa for aliens of extraordinary ability form contending that he was an alien with extraordinary ability as a theoretical physicist.
kazarian received a in theoretical physics from yerevan state university ysu in yerevan,armenia,in.from to,he remained at ysu as a research associate,where,among other things,he reviewe d the diploma works of the department graduates.
at ysu,kazarian specialized in theories of gravitation.according to a colleague,t his work offered a mechanism for the control of solutions accuracy,which guarantees the accuracy of calculations in many theories of gravitation.kazarian solve d the more than year old problem of construction of the theory,satisfying the cosmogony conception of worldwide acknowledged scientist,academician hambartsumian.
since,kazarian has served as a physics math programming tutor,an adjunct physics and mathematics instructor,and a science lecture series speaker at glendale community college gcc.between and,however,kazarian work at gcc was on a volunteer basis.
in support of his application,kazarian submitted several letters of reference.the first reference was a letter from kip thorne,the feynman professor of theoretical physics at the california institute of technology.thorne,who worked in the same research group as kazarian,stated that he had formed a good opinion of kazarian research.it is of the caliber that one would expect from a young professor at a strong university in the united states.kazarian also provided letters from professors at ysu,stating that kazarian possesse d great ability and considerable potency in science,was a young scientist with enough scientific potential,had high professionalism,and had displayed himself as exceptionally diligent,and highly qualified.finally,kazarian submitted three letters from colleagues at gcc praising his hard work and active participation at gcc.

discussion 
a.the extraordinary ability visa 
pursuant to b a,aliens may apply for a visa on the basis of extraordinary ability.an immigrant is an alien with extraordinary ability if 
i the alien has extraordinary ability in the sciences,arts,education,business,or athletics which has been demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim and whose achievements have been recognized in the field through extensive documentation,
ii the alien seeks to enter the united states to continue work in the area of extraordinary ability,and 
iii the alien entry into the united states will substantially benefit prospectively the united states.
only the first factor is at issue in this appeal.extraordinary ability means a level of expertise indicating that the individual is one of that small percentage who have risen to the very top of the field of endeavor.h.
an alien can prove an extraordinary ability in one of two ways.the first is evidence of a achievement that is,a major,international recognized award.id.h.receipt of the nobel prize is the quintessential example of a major award.i ii,reprinted in.kazarian concedes that he has won no such prize.
the second way to prove extraordinary ability is to provide evidence of at least three of the following 
i documentation of the alien receipt of lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor 
ii documentation of the alien membership in associations in the field for which classification is sought,which require outstanding achievements of their members,as judged by recognized national or international experts in their disciplines or fields 
iii published material about the alien in professional or major trade publications or other major media,relating to the alien work in the field for which classification is sought.such evidence shall include the title,date,and author of the material,and any necessary translation 
iv evidence of the alien participation,either individually or on a panel,as a judge of the work of others in the same or an allied field of specification for which classification is sought 
v evidence of the alien original scientific,scholarly,artistic,athletic,or contributions of major significance in the field 
vi evidence of the alien authorship of scholarly articles in the field,in professional or major trade publications or other major media 
vii evidence of the display of the alien work in the field at artistic exhibitions or showcases 
viii evidence that the alien has performed in a leading or critical role for organizations or establishments that have a distinguished reputation 
ix evidence that the alien has commanded a high salary or other significantly high remuneration for services,in relation to others in the field or 
x evidence of commercial successes in the performing arts,as shown by box office receipts or record,cassette,compact disk,or video sales.
the extraordinary ability visa can be better understood in context.under the immigration act of,thousands of visas were created according to three employment preferences,stat.aliens with extraordinary ability are priority workers and have the first preference.b.
extraordinary ability is distinct from exceptional ability,however,which receives second preference.compare id.b a emphasis added,with id.b emphasis added to qualify for the exceptional ability visa,a petitioner must make a lesser showing of ability,and need only show three of the following 
a an official academic record showing that the alien has a degree,diploma,certificate,or simila
