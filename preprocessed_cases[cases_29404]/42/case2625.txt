we have consolidated for decision two petitions to review decisions by the board of immigration appeals denying asylum.the petitions reflect the continuing difficulty that the board and the immigration judges are having in giving reasoned explanations for their decisions to deny asylum.see,niam ashcroft,cir,and cases cited there,plus such subsequent decisions as muhur ashcroft,cir kourski ashcroft,cir,and mengistu ashcroft,cir.
guchshenkov,with whom we begin,testified as follows.he is a citizen of kazakhstan,formerly part of the soviet union but now an independent nation with a kazakh majority which controls the new nation and a russian minority to which guchshenkov belongs.there is great enmity between the two groups,in part because of religious kazakhs are muslims,the russians in part because in the soviet era the russians were the top dogs and the roles have now been reversed.guchshenkov married a kazakh woman,and this provoked three nighttime attacks on him by kazakh thugs.the first occurred the night of his wedding.the thugs beat him and told him he should leave the country because he was not supposed to marry somebody from a different nationality.he complained to the police all of whom are kazakhs,but they told him that these things happen every day.we have more important things to take care of.in the next attack,a year later,the thugs asked guchshenkov what are you doing here with your russian faith,reminded him that his wife was of a different faith,and told him to get out of here.they beat and stabbed him.he was afraid to complain to the police.
the third attack was the worst.the attackers told him we warned you,you knew it,and now your time has come you do belong here,it not your place,and you just spoiling our blood.he was hospitalized with a lacerated liver,and his gall bladder had to be removed.while he was in the hospital,his father went to the police station to file a complaint on his son behalf and was turned away on the ground that he was not the victim.released from the hospital after two weeks,guchshenkov went to the police went seven times,never receiving satisfaction,although on one occasion the police gave him a photo album of criminals to look through.a year after the attack,the police wrote guchshenkov that his case was lost from the archive,that they had no suspects,and that they were overloaded with other cases.
a year after that,guchshenkov,leaving his wife and two children in kazakhstan,went to russia,where he paid someone to smuggle him in a russian ship to the united states.after landing in the he traveled to canada and sought asylum there,but was turned down,returned to the,and sought asylum here.there is nothing in the briefs or record concerning canada standards for granting asylum or the basis on which guchshenkov application for canadian asylum was rejected.the immigration judge rejected guchshenkov application for asylum in an oral opinion and ordered him removed deported to kazakhstan.the board of immigration appeals affirmed in a very brief opinion that essentially just summarizes the immigration judge opinion.
the immigration judge acknowledged that the kazakh majority,which controls the government of kazakhstan,is hostile to the russian minority and that guchshenkov description of the attacks was truthful.much of the opinion is given over to the question whether guchshenkov was attacked because he is a russian or because as he had testified he is a russian married to a kazakh.it is unclear why it should matter,unless he abandoned his family we do know in which event it might be critical whether as a russian not married to a kazakh he would still face persecution.but in any event the ground on which the immigration judge concluded that the marriage had not been a factor in the beatings makes no sense.it that if the marriage had been a factor,guchshenkov attackers would know him by name,would call him by name and would most likely say things during these encounters which indicated that they were aware that he had married an ethnic kazakh woman.guchshenkov had testified that his attackers did not know him by name,they did not mention his spouse or family.guchshenkov of course did not know whether they knew his name or not all he knew was that they had called him by name.they had referred to the marriage,contrary to the immigration judge,telling guchshenkov that he was not supposed to marry somebody from a different nationality.it is impossible to follow the immigration judge reasoning process.
but because his attackers were private individuals rather than state actors,guchshenkov was not persecuted within the meaning of the law unless the authorities either condoned the attacks or are unable to protect him,bace ashcroft,cir.the immigration judge noted that guchshenkov had complained to the police,had followed up with a number of subsequent visits,the police had shown him the photo album,they did take his complaint and made attempts to investigate the complaints,and his case was ultimately closed because it was lost and because the police could not devote more time to the investigation because it was overloaded with cases.on the basis of this summary of the evidence,the immigration judge concluded that guchshenkov had not been persecuted even if the attacks had been motivated by his marriage.but the immigration judge summary of the evidence is hopelessly incomplete.there is no reference to guchshenkov testimony that the police are all kazakhs not necessarily the best evidence,but neither contradicted nor disbelieved,that their reaction to his first complaint was that these things happen every day.we have more important things to take care of,and that his father was turned away by the police after the third assault because he was the victim of the assault the victim was in the hospital because of the gravity of his injuries.in light of this evidence,the claim made by the police after the third and most serious assault that they had simply lost guchshenkov file required more careful scrutiny than the immigration judge gave it.if guchshenkov testimony that we summarized earlier was the immigration judge did not suggest that it was the natural inference is that guchshenkov could not expect any police protection from a further,and eventually fatal,assault should he be returned to kazakhstan.
the immigration judge conclusion that guchshenkov filing of various complaints and visiting the police station numerous times are inconsistent with the notion that the government of kazahkstan had approved of these beatings manages the difficult trick of being at once truthful and absurd.guchshenkov repeated visits to the police station were signs of desperation rather than confidence,singh ins,cir,and while doubtless the government did not know of the beatings and so could not have approved of them,the question is whether it either can or wants to rein in the police when they deny russians the elementary protections of the law guchshenkov testimony suggests not,as in andriasian ins,cir,and surita ins,cir.
the board of immigration appeals in its characteristically perfunctory opinion affirming the immigration judge added that guchshenkov claim for asylum was further undermined by the fact that his wife and children had remained in kazakhstan without encountering persecution.but it was guchshenkov whom the thugs were after.his wife is a kazakh and,for all we know,his children are being brought up as muslims.once he left the country,therefore,there was no reason for his family to be persecuted.
guchshenkov may or may not have a meritorious claim for asylum.as noted earlier,this may turn on his family status,which the record does not illuminate.all we know at this stage is that the decision denying him asylum was unreasoned.
we move on to the dimitrovs claim.they are bulgarian citizens of macedonian descent macedonian in the sense of the people who live in the nation of macedonia,rather than of the people of the part of greece known as macedonia,which gave the world alexander the great.before coming to the united states they belonged to an organization called also known as or,which seeks to remind such citizens of their m
