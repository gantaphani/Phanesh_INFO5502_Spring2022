opinion of the court 
rwandan citizens jean bosco ndayshimiye and his wife speciose murekatete sought asylum in the united states in,alleging that they had suffered persecution at the hands of ndayshimiye aunt in rwanda.they now petition for review of the board of immigration appeals bia decision rejecting their application for asylum.petitioners asserted before the bia that although their mistreatment was precipitated by a land dispute with ndayshimiye aunt,it was also caused by their status as recent immigrants to rwanda from burundi,where they had been born after their rwandan parents fled there in the.based on the fact that ndayshimiye had a relatively peaceful relationship with his aunt for the eight years following petitioners return to rwanda in,the bia concluded that any persecution occurring after was motivated solely by the land dispute.although the bia interpretation of the statutory standard for analyzing possible mixed motives persecution was partially in error,its rationale that petitioners burundian background was at most incidental to other reasons for their persecution does support the board ultimate conclusion even under the corrected standard.therefore,we will deny the petition.
petitioners ndayshimiye and murekatete were born in burundi,but are rwandan citizens since their parents were originally rwandan but fled from that country in the.they are of tutsi ethnicity.in they both returned to rwanda along with several hundred thousand other rwandan refugees who are known as old refugees.these former refugees have different social status in rwandan society depending on the country from which they have repatriated those from burundi apparently have very little influence or power and are resented by rwandans who did not flee.
when petitioners returned to rwanda,ndayshimiye made contact with some relatives who had remained in the country.one of them,his uncle frederick karuranga,deeded ndayshimiye a parcel of land on which to build a home.ndayshimiye put off construction for financial reasons.
in,two years after karuranga death,petitioners began building a home on the lot.ndayshimiye aunt,primitive musabwasoni,contested their right to the land,telling ndayshimiye that he was not a member of the family and that he should go back to burundi.she also attempted to sell the land to someone else for a significant sum of money.musabwasoni is in rwandan society among her children are reverien claude rugwizangoga reverien,a major in the rwandan national police,john fayinzoga,the chairman of a commission to demobilize the rwandan army,and gilbert twgirunukiza,an executive in the president office.
ndayshimiye filed a complaint concerning the land dispute before a community tribunal,which resolved the matter in his favor in november.around march,ndayshimiye began receiving anonymous phone calls several times a week on his work phone in which he was told that he was not rwandan,was stealing land that did not belong to him,and must return to burundi.ndayshimiye recognized the voice on some of the phone calls as his aunt son,reverien.in one call,the speaker said that if ndayshimiye family did not return to burundi on their own they would be thrown into the akagera river to return there.petitioners construe this threat as a reference to the rwandan genocide,during which massacred tutsis were dumped into the akagera.these phone calls lasted through june.murekatete also received calls in june,at petitioners home,on which she identified reverien voice.
frightened of the possible consequences,ndayshimiye did not resume construction on the land despite his legal victory.nor did he seek protection from the authorities,believing that the influence of musabwasoni and her sons in the government,along with his own low social status,would render that attempt futile.ndayshimiye and murekatete remained in a rental property about thirty minutes away from the disputed land.
despite their inaction regarding the land,on three occasions in may and june reverien came to petitioners residence at night in his police uniform,armed and accompanied by other armed police officers.each time,he identified himself as a member of the police and asked for ndayshimiye.upon being told that ndayshimiye was working,reverien told murekatete that her husband was burundian,not rwandan,and must go back.on the third visit,reverien said,if you do want to go back when it good,you going back badly.
because of these threats,petitioners sought to leave rwanda.they did not want to return to burundi because of ongoing ethnic tensions there and the possibility of civil conflict.ndayshimiye,who worked as a driver at the united states embassy,was invited by a citizen to visit his home in virginia and obtained tourist visas for himself,his wife,and their children to go to the united states.during reverien second visit to petitioners house,he searched murekatete purse and found her american visa.at that point reverien asked murekatete if she had told ndayshimiye yet that he must return to burundi.
petitioners entered the united states on september.upon arrival,they were informed that their visas had been cancelled in june,apparently because a of ndayshimiye at the embassy in rwanda had told the state department that petitioners were selling off their belongings and were not planning to return to rwanda when their visas expired.that reportedly also worked with the rwandan national police.ndayshimiye and murekatete believed musabwasoni and reverien had orchestrated the cancellation of their visas through the.they were afraid to return to rwanda because of the possibility of further persecution and thus sought refuge in the united states.they applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.
to be granted asylum,petitioners were required to show that they were unable or unwilling to return to rwanda because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a.after a merits hearing,an immigration judge ij denied petitioners applications on january.that ruling rested primarily on the ij finding that ndayshimiye and murekatete had failed to show that musabwasoni past persecution was motivated by their imputed nationality or social group.the ij reviewed petitioners case under the statutory standard of the immigration and nationality act ina b b i,b b i.that provision was enacted in as part of the real id act to permit asylum for an applicant who could establish that,even if a persecutor had more than one motive,race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.id.the ij concluded that nationality social group had played no part in the threats against petitioners.she found that the land conflict alone,a simple family dispute,instigated the friction between ndayshimiye and his aunt.the ij opinion included no conclusion as to ndayshimiye or murekatete credibility.
petitioners appealed this decision to the bia on january.the bia affirmed in a published precedential opinion.in re.in interpreting,the bia reasoned that,though central may be defined as having dominant power,influence,or control,congress use of the phrase one central reason rather than the central reason indicated that under a protected ground need not be the single dominant reason for an applicant persecution.id.at.next,the bia turned to the conference report for the real id act,which states that a protected ground is not a central reason if it is simply incidental or tangential to the persecutor motivation.id.at quoting,at.relying on dictionary definitions of incidental and tangential,the bia construed to require an applicant for asylum to show that a protected ground is more than incidental,tangential,superficial,or subordinate to another reason for harm.in re,at.
based on this reading of the statute,the bia held that,even taking petitioners testimony as true,ndayshimiye conflict with his aunt was fundamentally a personal dispute motivated by musabwasoni desire to obtain ndayshimiye land and sell it for a profit,with any prejudice related to petitioners burundian background playing an incidental role.id.at.therefore,the bia dismissed petitioners appeal as to the asylum ruling,also concluding that they were not entitled to withholding of removal or relief under cat.id.at.on july,petitioners timely filed a petition for review of the bia decision with this court,arguing that their asylum application should have been granted 
review of the bia interpretation of is de novo,though we must defer to its reading of the statute where appropriate under chevron natural resources defense council,d.wang ashcroft,cir.we review the bia factual determinations under the substantial evidence standard,affirming them unless the record evidence would compel any reasonable factfinder to conclude to the contrary.dia ashcroft,cir.
an alien will be granted asylum in the united states only if he or she is a refugee who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her native country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a see also immigration naturalization serv,d holding that persecution on account of a protected category must be because of that category.therefore,a key task for any asylum applicant is to show a sufficient nexus between persecution and one of the listed protected grounds.
prior to the passage of the real id act in,there was no statutory standard for judging whether persecution was on account of a protected characteristic where other,unprotected motivations might explain an applicant persecution.the bia and the courts,however,interpreted a to allow for persecution,as long as the applicant protected status was at least one of the causes of the persecution.see singh gonzales,cir in re.along with other circuits,we resolved that an applicant need only show that his or her persecution was caused at least in part by membership in a protected group.see chang immigration naturalization,cir see also deloso ashcroft,cir mihaylov ashcroft,cir.
in,congress passed the real id act.among other things,the act amended the ina to include a standard for evaluating evidence of persecution based on mixed motives.as noted above,the paragraph inserted into provides that an applicant must establish that race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant.b b i,ina b b i.petitioners now call into question the bia interpretation of that one central reason standard as requiring an asylum applicant to show that a protected characteristic was more than incidental,tangential,superficial,or subordinate to another reason for his or her persecution.
in examining the bia interpretation of,we must apply the inquiry set out in chevron.the first step requires us to decide whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.at.if the plain language of the statute is ambiguous,we proceed to the second step and determine whether the bia reading of the provision is a reasonable one.id.at.if so,we must let the interpretation stand.
we conclude that the bia interpretation of the one central reason standard is in error only to the extent that it would require an asylum applicant to show that a protected ground for persecution was not subordinate to any unprotected motivation.that particular term is inconsistent with the plain language of the statute,cutting off our chevron analysis at step one.
section use of the phrase one central reason rather than the central reason,which,as amicus points out,was a deliberate change in the drafting of this provision,demonstrates that the analysis should not depend on a hierarchy of motivations in which one is dominant and the rest are subordinate.see amicus br.in re,at.this plain language indicates that a persecutor may have more than one central motivation for his or her actions whether one of those central reasons is more or less important than another is irrelevant.the bia acknowledged this in refusing to define a central reason within the meaning of as a dominant motivation.id.at.the same logic forbids an interpretation that would impose a mirror image of the rejected dominance test the requirement that a protected ground,even if a central reason for persecution,not be subordinate to any other reason.
it is true that some cases have already cited the bia interpretation of without objection to its form.see singh mukasey,cir att y,cir parussimova mukasey,cir gonzales,cir.however,of these cases,only parussimova discussed the standard at any length,and it implicitly supports the excision of the word subordinate.in parussimova,though judge briefly referred to the bia construction of,he went on to state 
a n asylum applicant need not prove that a protected ground was the only central reason for the persecution she suffered.the act requires that a protected ground serve as one central reason for the persecution,naturally suggesting that a persecutory act may have multiple causes.second,an applicant need not prove that a protected ground was the most important reason why the persecution occurred.the act states that a protected ground must constitute at least one of the central reasons for persecutory conduct it does not require that such reason account for of the persecutors motivation.
at emphasis added.though our disapproval of the term subordinate is based on a plain reading of the language of,congress goal of resolv ing conflicts between fora by enacting this provision also weighs in favor of a standard that is consistent with this passage from parussimova,at.
once the word subordinate is removed,we are left with the bia reading of as dictating that asylum may not be granted if a protected ground is only an incidental,tangential,or superficial reason for persecution of an asylum applicant.this corrected definition is consistent with the language of the statute central is relevantly defined as of primary importance,essential,or principal.see parussimova,at citing collegiate dictionary ed american heritage dictionary ed.these definitions are a reasonable foundation for the bia conclusion that congress,in including the term central,meant to preclude asylum where a protected ground played only an incidental,tangential,or superficial role in persecution.see also collegiate thesaurus listing peripheral as antonym of central roget century thesaurus ed listing incidental,tangential,and superficial as synonyms of peripheral.in fact,the bia derived its interpretation from congress own words the conference report for the real id act stated that the language of was almost identical to a previously proposed regulation that would require a protected characteristic to be more than incidental or tangential to the persecutor motivation,at citing.
by contrast,the plain meaning of this provision and the accompanying conference report contradict petitioners suggestion that simply adopts the requirement that persecution have been motivated at least in part by a protected ground.foremost,the word central would be rendered superfluous if asylum could be granted where a protected ground played any part,no matter how small,in motivating the persecution of the applicant.see united states cooper,cir c ourts should construe statutory language to avoid interpretations that would render any phrase superfluous.
additionally,the conference report cites only cases going beyond the at least in part threshold as consonant with the new statutory standard,at referring to opinions requiring that persecution be motivated in meaningful part or primarily by a protected ground and another case denying asylum where persecution stemmed mainly from some other motivation quoting girma immigration naturalization,cir ambartsoumian ashcroft,cir useinovic immigration naturalization,cir.while the report does note that the statutory standard of is in keeping with decisions of reviewing courts,at,the same paragraph states that before the enactment of the real id act,there was no uniform standard for assessing motivation,and goes on to make clear that only certa
