our circuit has wisely recognized the abhorrence of the practice of female genital mutilation.defined as an act that involves the cutting and removal of all or some of a girl or a woman external genitalia,the procedure is extremely painful and permanently disfigures the female genitalia expos ing the girl or woman to the risk of serious,potentially complications.mohammed gonzales,cir alterations in original quoting in re kasinga,bia.like forced sterilization,the damage is done at the outset,but the medical and psychological consequences of female genital mutilation linger for a lifetime.our recognition of the severity of female genital mutilation,even in its ostensibly least intrusive form,guides our decision in this troubling case.
bob benito benyamin benyamin,a native and citizen of indonesia,petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia denial of his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.benyamin wife,anabella rodriguez rodriguez,is a native and citizen of venezuela.rodriguez and the couple three children,annisa sofia benyamin annisa,anakarina benyamin anakarina,and bobby amin benyamin bobby,are listed as derivative beneficiaries of benyamin application.
benyamin asserted that his daughter,annisa,suffered persecution in indonesia by enduring female genital mutilation as a infant,without his consent or that of his wife benyamin further claimed that he fears that his younger daughter,anakarina,may face the threat of female genital mutilation if the family is forced to return to indonesia.finally,benyamin argued that he faced past persecution and the threat of future persecution on the basis of his membership in a particular social group,defining the group as muslim men married to roman catholic women in indonesia.
reasoning that female circumcision practices in indonesia appear to be of a less extreme variety than those described in a case involving ethiopia,the bia affirmed the immigration judge ij decision that benyamin had not established that he suffered persecution or that he had a fear of future persecution.the bia also rejected benyamin argument of persecution based on his membership in a particular social group.
the bia determination concerning the persecution annisa suffered when she was forced to undergo female genital mutilation and the dismissal of that procedure as a lesser form of circumcision was erroneous.female genital mutilation constitutes persecution sufficient to support an asylum claim.abebe gonzales,cir en banc.the bia conclusion to the contrary is at odds with ninth circuit law and represents a misunderstanding of the bia own precedent.the bia also erred in failing to consider whether the threat that anakarina would be forced to undergo female genital mutilation in the future could be a ground for relief in this matter.substantial evidence supports the rejection of benyamin other proffered basis for relief.we grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
benyamin and rodriguez were residing in the united states under visas when they married in.when their visas expired,the couple moved to jakarta,indonesia.their daughter,annisa,was born in indonesia in.soon after annisa birth,the family moved to venezuela,where anakarina was born.in december,the family returned to indonesia,where bobby was born in.the family remained in indonesia until september,when they lawfully entered the united states.benyamin returned to indonesia for a short period and entered the united states for the last time in june under a business visa.his visa expired in june,and benyamin filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal in august.benyamin listed rodriguez,annisa,anakarina,and bobby as derivative applicants.
in his application,benyamin alleged that he and his family suffered persecution while they lived in indonesia.benyamin is muslim,and his wife,rodriguez,is catholic.while benyamin described the mistreatment of rodriguez at the hands of his family,alienation and humiliation from friends,societal restrictions on his wife activities,and discrimination on the basis of religion perpetrated by the indonesian government against rodriguez,the crucial allegation in his application was that his daughter,annisa,endured forced female genital mutilation ordered by benyamin stepmother when annisa was a newborn.annisa suffered through this procedure without the consent of her parents.
during the hearing before the ij,rodriguez confirmed her husband allegations about the female genital mutilation that annisa suffered.rodriguez described that when annisa was old and still in the hospital,benyamin stepmother ordered annisa circumcision without the couple consent.benyamin testimony corroborated his application and his wife testimony,including the fact that he did not consent to the procedure.rodriguez further explained that annisa has continually experienced pain as a result of the procedure,most notably when she washes her genitals.these complications were at their worst when annisa was four years old,but were still ongoing as of the time of the hearing before the ij.
rodriguez reported that the couple other daughter,anakarina,is not circumcised,as she was born in venezuela,not indonesia.both rodriguez and benyamin testified,however,that they fear that if the family is forced to return to indonesia,anakarina may become a victim of female genital mutilation.
in reviewing benyamin application,the ij concluded that she could only consider whether benyamin himself had suffered past persecution or had a fear of future persecution,as none of the other respondents have specifically applied for asylum by submitting their own application.the ij determined that benyamin suffered no specific harm in indonesia as a result of his marriage to a catholic woman.
as to circumcision,the ij found that the procedure performed on annisa was a harm,but nevertheless determined that neither benyamin nor rodriguez has alleged that any particular harm has come to them or would come to them for opposing annisa circumcision the ij further noted that a state department report submitted with the asylum application discussed female genital mutilation as practiced in indonesia and detailed that the physical harm of the operation appear s to be minimal.with respect to the possibility that anakarina would be forced to undergo female genital mutilation if the family were returned to indonesia,the ij found there was no evidence to support the couple fear.as a result,the ij determined that benyamin failed to establish statutory eligibility for asylum and denied benyamin application,along with his request for relief under the cat.notably,however,the ij did not make an adverse credibility finding in her decision.
the bia dismissed benyamin appeal.first,the bia determined that the ij correctly found that benyamin did not suffer past persecution in indonesia and agreed with the ij finding that the discrimination and ill treatment rodriguez endured in indonesia did not rise to the level of persecution.second,by comparing the procedure that annisa underwent to the female genital mutilation described in kasinga,i n,the bia determined that annisa circumcision did not rise to the level of persecution,as it was less severe than the procedure described in kasinga and fgm as practiced in indonesia involves minimal pain,suffering,and complications.third,the bia affirmed the ij determination that benyamin failed to establish that there was a risk of future persecution because the record did not indicate that individuals in marriages are persecuted in indonesia or that parents who oppose female genital mutilation are persecuted.finally,the bia agreed with the ij denial of benyamin request for withholding of removal and relief under the cat.
the bia did not state whether it conducted a de novo or abuse of discretion review in this matter.where the standard of review the bia employed is unclear,we may look to both the bia decision and the ij oral decision as a guide to what lay behind the bia conclusion.ins,cir.because the ij made no adverse credibility dete
