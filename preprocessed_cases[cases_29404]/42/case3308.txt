sama abdiaziz abdisalan,a native and citizen of somalia,petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia or board decision dismissing her asylum claim for lack of timeliness.in its original decision,the bia determined that abdisalan neither satisfied her burden that she applied for asylum within one year of arrival,nor established extraordinary circumstances sufficient to excuse untimely filing of her application.however,the bia remanded the case to the ij to complete updated background checks related to the ij unchallenged grant of withholding of removal.following successful completion of another round of background checks,abdisalan filed a second appeal to the bia seeking review of the denial of her asylum claim.the bia dismissed that appeal as an untimely motion to reconsider,and again remanded the case for a third set of updated background checks because her clearance had once more expired.
abdisalan has now filed two petitions for review before us from the bia second decision denying the motion to reconsider,and following the ij confirmation of successful completion of the third set of background checks.despite their untimeliness,the sole focus of both petitions is to challenge the bia original decision dismissing her asylum claim.
because abdisalan waited nearly two years to petition for review of the bia original november,dismissal of her asylum claim exceeding the deadline to file an appeal in our court we lack jurisdiction to review this case now.accordingly,we dismiss her petition 
abdisalan filed an application for asylum on march.the ij held a merits hearing on july,to hear her claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.abdisalan had an opportunity to present her case through witness testimony,submitted background materials on country conditions,and declarations.in an oral decision announced august,while abdisalan background checks were still current,the ij granted withholding of removal to somalia,but denied asylum as,and found she had not shown a clear probability of torture for protection under cat.on appeal to the bia,abdisalan only challenged the denial of her asylum claim.the board dismissed the appeal finding abdisalan statutorily ineligible for asylum on november.in two separate line entries,the bia dismissed the asylum appeal and remanded the record to the ij to complete updated background checks abdisalan chose not to file a petition for review before us of the bia decision at that time.
on june,the ij once again determined that the background checks were satisfactory,confirming abdisalan continued entitlement to withholding of removal.abdisalan filed a second appeal to the bia,and on september,the board found that any attempt to use this appeal to reach issues resolved in the november,order is,at bottom,an untimely motion to reconsider that will be denied.the bia summarily dismissed the appeal finding that it did not challenge an issue of fact or law material to the immigration judge june,order.in conclusion,the bia again remanded the case to the ij to enter the same relief granted previously on august,when background checks and security investigations were complete and current.abdisalan filed a petition for review of this bia decision with us on october.
on march,her background checks cleared a third time,and the ij reentered the same determination he originally made on august,granting continued entitlement to withholding of removal.abdisalan bypassed any attempt to appeal this decision to the bia and instead filed a second petition for review directly with us on april.the two petitions for review were later consolidated here.
we have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal pursuant to a.we review de novo the bia interpretation of purely legal questions.zheng ashcroft,cir.
this case turns on when an order of removal is considered final for purposes of judicial review and revisits our precedent on how to treat a mixed decision that grants one form of immigration relief while denying another.abdisalan appeals to the bia and petitions for review before us focus only on the ij denial of asylum.the bia upheld that decision on november,and no petition for review was filed within thirty days from the board decision as the law requires.see b.therefore,the bia resolution of that claim necessarily became final.see a b ii.abdisalan failure to file a timely petition for review of the bia decision denying her claim for asylum precludes our jurisdiction now.
in her original application,abdisalan sought asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under cat.see,b.the merits hearing to adjudicate these claims,held july,provided abdisalan a full and fair hearing of h er claims and a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on h er behalf.colmenar,cir see also b.on appeal,the bia found abdisalan statutorily ineligible for asylum 
a petition for review must be filed within thirty days of the final order of removal.b.an order becomes final upon the earlier of the bia affirmance of the ij order or the expiration of the period in which an alien may seek review of the ij order.a b.this time limit is mandatory and jurisdictional.yepremyan holder,cir per curiam internal quotation marks removed.when granting relief pursuant to b,such as withholding of removal,the bia shall not issue a decision affirming relief or protection from removal if the results of the prior background checks are no longer current under the standards established by dhs and must be updated.d i b.
the dissent attempts to conflate the prior decisions regarding abdisalan claims,but the granting of withholding of removal and related remand to update background checks is an issue distinct and apart from the denial of her asylum claim.each comes with its own finality determination,timing,and statutory context.abdisalan never appealed the ij grant of withholding of removal,nor the bia remand for updated background checks because that relief was awarded in her favor.accordingly,we may not review that issue here.our jurisdiction to review the asylum claim expired long ago when abdisalan failed to file a petition for review within thirty days of the bia decision affirming the ij adverse determination.failure to seek review of that final order of removal in a timely manner prevents our review on appeal.
the dissent looks to the executive office for immigration review guidance regarding remands for background checks,but that guidance focuses on the much simpler question of the agency obligation to have current background checks prior to confirming the grant of relief from removal,codified at d.background and security investigations in proceedings before immigration judges and the board of immigration appeals.it does not speak to the specific scenario of a mixed decision,such as abdisalan,in which one form of relief is granted while another is denied.this is because the board is not required to remand or hold a case under d if the board decides to dismiss the respondent appeal or deny the relief sought.id.at.this guidance is simply inapplicable and does not speak to the finality of abdisalan asylum claim,the dispositive issue before us now.
abdisalan inconsistent arguments regarding the finality of the asylum claim highlight her failure to timely appeal.in her opening brief for case,she first argued that the bia september,decision constitute d a final order of removal for purposes of judicial review that was unaltered by its remand to the ij because nothing was currently pending before the board.but that was true at the time of the board original november,determination,which was,and remains,the final order of removal.in supplemental briefing to us,which we ordered following oral argument in the consolidated appeals,abdisalan switched position and now argues that only one order the ij ultimate order of march,is strictly a final order of removal.analysis of our current precedent forecloses both of the arguments advanced by the petitioner.the bia decision was final and started the clock to petition for review.
our dissenting colleague chooses to ignore the procedural posture of this case and the fact that our conclusion is consistent with the bia treatment of it.by considering abdisalan subsequent appeal as an untimely motion to reconsider,the bia,too,understood that the adjudication of her asylum claim was final in.
to take our colleague analysis to its logical conclusion,there might never be finality based on an endless cycle of remands necessitated by updating expired background clearances.here,they have had to be redone on three separate occasions.there could be no end to this process under the dissent view of the law.the appropriate interpretation of our precedent is that a petitioner must challenge the substance of the bia decision on a timely basis.therefore,we lack jurisdiction to review her asylum claim now.
li holder,cir,dealt with similar questions of finality of a removal order and jurisdiction,however li timely petitioned for review of the bia decision,establishing our jurisdiction.in li,the ij granted withholding of removal or alternative protection under cat,but denied asylum.id.at.as in abdisalan case,the bia affirmed the ij denial of asylum the only question on appeal but remanded li case to await current background checks pursuant to d.id.at.despite the remand,li filed a timely petition for review within days of the bia denial of asylum.id.
we held that where the bia denies relief and remands pursuant to d for background checks required for alternative relief,we have jurisdiction to consider an appeal of the final order denying relief.id.at annachamy holder,wl,at cir.august,quoting the same language from li.li order of removal was final because the bia decided all the matters before it,and there was nothing pending before the board.li,at.the ij had already held the merits hearing and determined that li was eligible for withholding of removal or alternative protection under cat,but ineligible for asylum.id.at.
the only outstanding issue for the ij to review upon remand was the procedural requirement of successful completion of background checks pursuant to d.see.at describing remand for background checks as a procedural requirement.the limited right to appeal following remand is contingent on whether the background checks reveal new evidence.id.at li,at.and,if new evidence raises a legal or factual issue,review of that evidence is necessarily limited to its potential impact on the grant of relief,because remand is not required for denial of relief.d iv,h li,at.any new evidence would not open up the case for reconsideration of other separate and distinct substantive claims that had previously been denied 
in this case,abdisalan unsuccessful asylum claim was necessarily final at the time of the bia remand.the only portion of her case in question at the time of remand related to confirming the agency grant of withholding of removal,a determination she has never challenged.the same reasons that established our jurisdiction to review li asylum claim at the time of remand now foreclose our ability to review abdisalan asylum claim.rather than timely petitioning for review of the bia november,final order of removal,she waited until after completion of the background checks.her delay unfortunately deprives us of jurisdiction over her asylum claim on appeal.
go holder,cir,also considered the question of jurisdiction and the finality of a removal order.there,the bia affirmed the denial of asylum and withholding of removal in,but remanded the ij denial of cat protection for further proceedings.id.at.after the bia issued a second order denying cat protection in,we found jurisdiction to review the merits of both the earlier decision and the decision.id.at.
although at first blush our jurisdiction over both decisions in go might appear inconsistent with li,jurisdiction is a question determined individually for each case on petition for review.go held that there was no final removal order until all forms of relief were denied,whereas,li held that the final removal order was not contingent on the denial of all forms of relief.ortiz alfaro holder,cir.however,the li decision distinguished go on three grounds to explain the difference in our jurisdictional analysis,and each equally apply to abdisalan case.li,at.
most importantly,in li,as well as in this case,the bia had already decided all the matters before it prior to remand.id.at.the record had been fully developed,and the bia had considered all of the petitioner arguments.id.at.by contrast,in go,the bia found that the ij may not have considered various country reports and expressed concern that testimony was improperly excluded.go,at.the ij accordingly held additional proceedings to further develop the record.id.at.if go had petitioned for review of the bia decision at the time of remand,as li did,it would have been premature because go cat claim was still under consideration,and therefore he was still challenging a pending substantive issue.thus,in go,it was only after the bia denied the cat claim that a final order of removal existed to serve as the basis for our jurisdiction over both of the bia decisions.
in contrast,this case is equivalent to li because no substantive challenges remained at the time of the bia remand.the bia specifically noted that i n light of the immigration judge unappealed grant of withholding of removal it would remand the record,but the bia made no reference to remanding the entire case.the bia found abdisalan statutorily ineligible for asylum and clarified that she did not appeal the denial of protection under cat.the only outstanding issue upon remand was whether the background checks would clear again to support continued withholding of removal.the bia highlighted this point when it dismissed abdisalan second appeal.the board concluded abdisalan sole purpose on appeal was to challenge the november,asylum decision,which was not an issue of fact or law material to the ij order on remand.consequently,abdisalan asylum claim would have been ripe for our review in,but is now foreclosed.
li points to two additional differences to support a finding that a final order of removal existed differences that were not present in go,but which are present in abdisalan case.first,go contested removability,while li and abdisalan conceded removability.li,at.we have recognized that where removability is conceded,a final order that the petitioner is removable necessarily exists,and we have jurisdiction.id.second,the ij in go originally denied all forms of relief,whereas the ij granted withholding of removal for li and abdisalan,and the bia upheld that decision.id.we have held that the granting of relief implies that a final determination of removability has been made.id.citing lolong gonzales,cir.therefore,no tension exists between our holdings in li and go.rather,it was the distinct facts of each case that determined whether or not a final order of removal existed,and consequently whether we had jurisdiction to review the claim.
in ortiz alfaro,like go,we determined that we lacked jurisdiction to review the petitioner claim because he still had an unresolved possible avenue for relief,and no final order of removal existed.at.ortiz alfaro was charged with illegal reentry under a.id.at.in illegal reentry cases,the alien may contest the reinstatement of the prior order of removal by asserting a fear of returning to the country designated.id.the case is then referred to an asylum officer.id.if the asylum officer determines the alien has not established a reasonable fear,the alien may appeal that determination to an ij.id.at.however,in ortiz alfaro,the r eview of the asylum officer determination by an ij ha d yet to take place.id.at.unlike here,ortiz alfaro withholding of removal claim remained undeveloped at the time he filed his petition for review.id.the ij had not reviewed the reasonable fear determination,developed the record for that claim,or denied withholding of removal.id.accordingly,we found that we lacked jurisdiction because no final order of removal existed,as substantive issues remained.id.at.
our analysis in these cases also coincides with the bia decision in in re m d.the bia there held that on remand for background checks the ij had authority to consider new evidence if it would support a motion to reopen the proceedings,but that holding did not allow the petitioner to use the remand as a venue to challenge orders denying relief that the bia ha d affirmed.li,at.to the contrary,the board explicitly instruct ed that on remand the ij may not reconsider the bia prior decisions.m d,at.although the petitioner could file a motion to reopen for possible new forms of relief,that action did not alter the already existing final order of removal.li,at.
our dissenting colleague invokes the words of felix frankfurter to suggest that in the name of justice,we should ignore the law for this case.but the character of sir thomas more in robert bolt a man for all seasons answers the dissent call as chancellor more describes his resistance to an entreaty to swear an oath of allegiance to king henry viii and approve an unlawful act.act,random house printing.this country planted thick with laws from coast to coast man laws,not god and if you cut them down really think you could stand upright to the winds that would blow then id.the law can not be bent to accommodate every desired exception merely by invoking the word justice.
our precedent is consistent.petitioners must file their petitions for review within thirty days of the bia determination of their applicable claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under cat.judicial economy and a preference for finality underpin this requirement.if these steps have been followed,a final order of removal exists,and we have jurisdiction.where the bia denies relief and remands pursuant to d for background checks required for alternative relief,and no other substantive issues affecting the merits are pending,jurisdiction exists at that time to consider a petition for review of the final order denying relief.li,at.in this case,abdisalan had a full and fair hearing of h er claims and a reasonable opportunity to present evidence on h er behalf.colmenar,at.a final order of removal existed regarding the asylum claim following the bia decision on november,triggering the rule to petition for judicial review.she does not get a second or third bite at that apple now.accordingly,her and petitions before us are untimely.
petitions for review dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
everyone appears to agree that petitioner sama abdisalan has a meritorious asylum claim.it would be hard to conclude otherwise,given what she has been through enduring female genital mutilation when she was three or four years old witnessing the murder of her aunt and uncle by members of a rival clan at the outset of somalia civil war when she was twelve or thirteen and being held captive afterward by those same rival clan members for two or three weeks,an ordeal during which she was repeatedly raped and subjected to constant verbal and physical abuse.
based on these facts,the immigration judge ij granted abdisalan withholding of removal,which means she necessarily established the fear of persecution required to qualify for asylum relief.see khunaverdiants mukasey,cir.but the ij and the board of immigration appeals bia denied abdisalan asylum claim on the ground that her application was untimely.that ruling is unquestionably wrong no one disputes that abdisalan arrived in the united states in either february or march of,and under either scenario her march,application for asylum was timely.see id.at.we would ordinarily have jurisdiction to correct this error,since it turns on application of law to undisputed facts.lin holder,cir.
the majority holds that we lack jurisdiction to review the bia erroneous ruling because the bia november order denying abdisalan asylum claim was a final order of removal,which triggered the mandatory day deadline for seeking review in our court.b.in that same order,however,the bia upheld abdisalan claim for withholding of removal and remanded her case under d for completion of the background checks required under.abdisalan had no reason to believe in november that she could petition our court for review of the bia order.the agency had taken the position as it continues to do today that orders in which it remands for completion of background checks are not final orders because administrative proceedings remain ongoing.see in re m d,bia.the majority concludes that abdisalan forfeited her right to obtain judicial review based primarily on a case li holder,cir not decided until almost three years after the deadline for seeking review of the november order had expired.even if we ignore the unfairness of applying li retroactively to abdisalan,and simply analyze the majority holding on its own terms,that holding can not be squared with the language of the controlling statute,the regulations governing remand orders of the sort at issue here,or the bia own understanding of the finality of its orders.
the best place to start is with the language of the controlling statute,which defines when an order of removal becomes final.see a.the statute defines when an order of deportation becomes final,but it applies to removal orders as well.singh gonzales,cir.section a defines an order of deportation as an order by an ij concluding that the alien is deportable or ordering deportation.a a.it then states that such an order shall become final upon the earlier of two events a determination by the board of immigration appeals affirming such order,or the expiration of the period in which the alien is permitted to seek review of such order by the board of immigration appeals.a b.
determining finality under this definition is easy when the ij orders an alien deported or removed and the bia then affirms the order.the language of a is framed with that scenario foremost in mind.but what about the scenario we face in this case where,instead of ordering the alien removed,the ij grants relief from removal on one ground,denies relief from removal on other grounds,and the bia then upholds that order although the statutory language does not cover this scenario as neatly as the first,i think the most natural reading is that the ij order becomes final when the bia issues a determination affirming such order.a b i.if the bia affirms the ij order,thereby ending administrative proceedings,that is the logical point at which the right to judicial review is triggered.
does the bia november decision constitute a determination affirming the ij order denying abdisalan asylum but granting her withholding of removal no.the answer is clear because,under the regulations governing this scenario,the bia could not issue a decision affirming the ij grant of withholding of removal in november.at that point,the required background checks had not been completed,and abdisalan was barred from receiving withholding of removal until that occurred.see b,g.as the regulations make clear,when the completion of background checks is necessary,the bia shall not issue a decision affirming any relief from removal that requires completion of identity,law enforcement,or security investigations or examinations.d i.instead,the bia must either remand the case to the ij for completion of the required background checks,as the bia did here,or issue an order stating that the appeal will be placed on hold until those background checks are completed.d ii.
construed in light of a,this regulation forecloses any contention that the bia november decision constituted a final order of removal.the bia did not issue a determination affirming the ij order of removal for the simple reason that it lacked the authority to do so.but if there were any doubt about the decision lack of finality,we have definitive guidance on that score from the agency that issued the regulations in question.the executive office for immigration review has unambiguously stated that when the bia remands the case to the ij for completion of background checks under.d,the bia order is not final 
in any case that is remanded to the immigration judge pursuant to.d,the board order will be an order remanding the case and not a final decision,in order to allow dhs to complete or update the identity,law enforcement,and security investigations or examinations of the respondent s.the immigration judge will th
