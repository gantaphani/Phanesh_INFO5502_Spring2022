we must decide whether the taking of guilty pleas at a large group plea hearing violated a criminal defendant rights protected by federal rule of criminal procedure and the fifth and sixth amendments.
on december,ameyalli escamilla rojas escamilla was arrested and charged with illegal entry into the united states,pursuant to.a citizen of mexico,escamilla was apprehended near sasabe,arizona,and was charged with having entered the united states at a time and place other than that designated by immigration officials.the next day,she appeared at a group plea hearing in the united states district court for the district of arizona,as part of the district operation streamline.
as we have previously explained,t o accommodate the enormous number of prosecutions for illegal entry into the united states,the district court for the district of arizona tucson has adopted a procedure for the taking of pleas en masse,known as operation streamline.united states roblero solis,cir.under the procedure,a magistrate judge is assigned to preside over a group hearing of fifty to seventy defendants charged with petty misdemeanor violations of illegal entry.the hearing combines the defendants initial appearances,guilty pleas,and sentencing hearings into one proceeding.
escamilla appeared before a magistrate judge,along with other defendants who had been charged with illegal entry fifteen different attorneys represented the defendants,with each attorney representing between four and six defendants.escamilla attorney represented a total of four defendants,and because the defendants sat in order of case number,he was unable to stand near all of his clients at once.escamilla,like most other defendants,listened to the proceedings through headphones that broadcast the court translation.
after roll call,the magistrate judge introduced himself to the defendants collectively and instructed them to stand and get his attention if they experienced any difficulty with their headphones.he then explained to the defendants how the hearing would proceed first he would address them collectively,and thereafter he would call them up individually to speak about that address and about their pleas.he advised the defendants to listen carefully and again to let him know if something happens to your headphones.the magistrate judge proceeded to inform the defendants collectively of their rights,their charges,the elements of the offense,and the consequences of pleading guilty.throughout his advisement,he repeatedly asked the defendants to stand if they could not hear or understand what he was saying.
after the general address,the magistrate judge called the defendants individually to the front of the court room.there,each defendant was asked individually whether he understood the information that had earlier been conveyed to the group as a whole.specifically,each defendant was asked whether he understood the crime with which he was charged understood the elements of such offense understood his rights,namely the right to proceed to trial and the right to have an attorney and understood the maximum possible penalty he faced.each defendant then stated whether he wished to give up the described rights by pleading guilty to his charge and answered whether the alleged factual basis for his charge was true.
when she was called to the front,escamilla individually affirmed that she understood her rights and pleaded guilty to the charge of illegal entry.she was sentenced to time served and ordered to be returned to mexico.
escamilla appealed her conviction to the district court,arguing that the group hearing violated federal rule of criminal procedure and her constitutional rights to due process and assistance of counsel.the district court rejected her arguments and affirmed the judgment against her,concluding that the individual questioning of escamilla sufficiently closed the loop as far as what was required to make certain that she did knowingly,intelligently,and voluntarily waive her rights before entering a plea of guilty.
escamilla timely appeals to this court and raises the same challenges that she presented to the district court.
escamilla first argues that the group hearing violated federal rule of criminal procedure rule.she asserts both that the group hearing violated rule b requirement that the court personally address her and that the court failed to ensure that her plea was given voluntarily and without coercion,as required under rule b.we address both arguments in turn.
rule b states that before a court may accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere from a criminal defendant,it must address the defendant personally in open court.b emphasis added.during this address,the court must inform the defendant of,and determine that the defendant understands his rights,the nature of his charges,the possible penalties he faces,and the effect of his plea.id.escamilla contends that rule personally address provision required the court to inform her individually of her rights and to determine that she understood them.she argues the court group advisement failed to do so.
the adverb personally,as used in rule,indicates that the judge speech is to be person to person.roblero solis,at.as the advisory committee note explains,this language was added to the rule to clarify that the court must address the defendant,rather than his counsel,in person.see,advisory committee note amendment.although,the rule speaks only of the defendant in the singular,it is not rigid,and we have previously held that it does not strictly require the court to address each defendant individually.roblero solis,at citing cases where small groups of have been addressed at once.
nevertheless,in united states roblero solis,we rejected the idea that the number of may be indefinitely expanded without violation of rule.id.in roblero solis,a magistrate judge both advised a group of defendants en masse of their rights and questioned the defendants en masse to determine whether they understood the advisement.see id.at.there,the transcript denoted only general yes answers to the magistrate judge questions,and the only question posed to the defendants individually was how each defendant would plead to his charge.id.we held that such procedure violated rule b,because no judge,however alert,could tell whether every single person in a group of or affirmatively answered her questions when the answers were taken at the same time.id.at.instead,the court must erect a more individualized procedure sufficient to show that each defendant pleaded voluntarily and understood the consequences of such plea.id.emphasis added 
here,as in roblero solis,the court advised the defendants en masse of their rights and of the consequences of their charges.as our analysis in roblero solis made clear,however,such group advisement alone does not constitute rule error.rather,we look also to the court questioning of the defendants to determine whether the court ensured personally that each defendant understood the rights he was waiving by pleading guilty.the hearing in this case was far more individualized than that we disapproved in roblero solis.stating that he intend ed to take roblero solis to heart and apply it as best he could,the magistrate judge extensively questioned each defendant regarding his understanding of the rights that had been earlier described to the group.specifically,he individually asked each defendant whether he understood the charge against him whether he understood the elements of the charge whether he understood the maximum possible penalty he was facing whether he understood the rights that had been described whether he wished to give up those rights by pleading guilty whether he is a citizen of mexico whether he entered the united states at the place and time alleged by the government and how he chose to plead.the transcript includes specific and individual answers to these questions for each defendant,including escamilla.unlike in roblero solis,the record leaves no doubt that escamilla affirmatively answered the court questions.id.
in general,this process of a collective advisement followed by individual questioning may be sufficient to deter
