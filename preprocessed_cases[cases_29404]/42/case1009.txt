tatyana serafimovich applied to the united states immigration and naturalization service for withholding of her deportation to belarus.the controlling statute requires a petitioner to establish by a clear probability that her life or freedom would be threatened upon deportation because of her political opinion.b a.an immigration judge denied serafimovich application,and the board of immigration appeals the board summarily affirmed.the immigration judge concluded that her life or freedom would not be threatened he did so at least in part by coupling the fact that she had not suffered past persecution in belarus with his finding that t here nothing in the record to establish that president lukashenko was any more authoritarian in the year when serafimovich applied for withholding of deportation than he was in when she first entered the united states,oral decision tr.at,ja.in fact,however,the country reports on belarus,prepared by the united states department of state,for the years,and each note an increasingly authoritarian president lukashenko.see below at subsection ii b.in light of this evidence in the record that was not addressed by the immigration judge and,by extension,the board and that has an obvious bearing on a central and potentially outcome determinative finding,we grant serafimovich petition for review,vacate the denial by the board of her request for withholding of deportation,and remand with direction that the decision of the immigration judge be vacated and the case be further remanded to that judge for reconsideration of the record.we also direct that,in light of the passage of nearly five years since the decision of the immigration judge,the record on remand be reopened for further development on the issue of withholding of deportation.

ii.analysis 
the immigration judge and the board of immigration appeals overlooked record evidence that has an obvious bearing on a potentially finding central to the ruling below.

whether the immigration judge and board of immigration appeals erred in denying serafimovich application for withholding of deportation 
the immigration judge and board of immigration appeals misapprehended the record and relied on that misapprehension.
the decision of the immigration judge and,by extension,the board of immigration appeals contains several errors.most prominently,that decision largely depends on the conclusion that serafimovich does not face a clear probability of persecution because she did not suffer persecution while in belarus and t here nothing in the record to establish that president lukashenko was any more authoritarian in the year when serafimovich applied for withholding of deportation than he was in when she first entered the united states,oral decision tr.at,ja.
the quoted finding,however,is not supported by substantial evidence and is,in fact,demonstrably incorrect.annual united states department of state country reports recount that,between and,the civil rights climate in belarus deteriorated and president lukashenko became increasingly authoritarian.the report summarized the belarus government human rights record worsened significantly as president lukashenko continued to lead belarus back toward authoritarian practices.dep t of state country reports on human rights practices for at ja.according to the report,the human rights record of the lukashenko regime again worsened significantly.dep t of state country reports on human rights practices for at ja.the report stated the government human rights record again worsened significan
