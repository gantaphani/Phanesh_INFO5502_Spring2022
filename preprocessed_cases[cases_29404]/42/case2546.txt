during world war ii joseph wittje was a member of the waffen ss,the paramilitary component of the nazi party.in he obtained a visa and entered this country.he became a citizen in.he now appeals from a decision of the district court for the northern district of illinois revoking his united states citizenship.we affirm.
joseph wittje,an ethnic german,was born in and grew up in deutsch michael,an ethnic german enclave in romania prior to world war ii,wittje attended school until he was fourteen and then worked as a bricklayer.
romania began world war ii as a neutral state a period of political unrest in and that included the forced cession of romanian territory to hungary,bulgaria,and the soviet union brought about political leaders who were strongly sympathetic to the axis powers.by october,several hundred thousand german troops had crossed into romania.a month later,romania joined the tripartite pact and became a member of the axis.
in,wittje was drafted into the romanian army and took part in the invasion of russia romania contributed a significant number of troops to the invasion of russia.wittje was wounded near stalingrad and was eventually returned to his home in romania.after recuperating from his wounds,in july,wittje was drafted by germany pursuant to an agreement between germany and romania that permitted germany to draft ethnic germans living in romania.
wittje was not assigned to the german army,the wehrmacht,but was instead assigned to the militarized branch of the schutzstaffel the ss,the waffen ss literally,the armed ss.the ss was the paramilitary component of the nazi party and was distinct from the had its own command including,for the bulk of its existence,one of the principal architects of the holocaust,heinrich himmler.it also had a separate organizational structure,discipline,insignia,and uniforms.originally conceived of as a cadre of bodyguards for hitler schutzstaffel translates to protection guard,by the onset of world war ii,the ss virtually controlled german state security one of its principal offices was the gestapo and,most infamously,was responsible for the operation of the concentration camps.the ss was,therefore,ultimately charged with the responsibility for carrying out the final solution the murder of the vast majority of european jewry 
wittje principal assignment during his service in the waffen ss was to the company ss death head guard battalion at the sachsenhausen concentration camp sachsenhausen sachsenhausen,located approximately twenty miles from berlin,was one of the original nazi concentration camps.from the when the camp was constructed to when the camp was liberated by the soviet army,people were imprisoned at the camp.
prisoners at sachsenhausen were forced to engage in slave labor including heavy construction and excavation work.some prisoners were forced to test the durability of combat boots used by the wehrmacht by wearing the boots on forced marches of thirty to forty miles in all weather.prisoners at the camp were also farmed out to,often near armaments plants to work in factories as part of the german war effort.the death of a prisoner at labor was of no were simply worked until they died annihilation through labor.
conditions at the camp were hellish.food was scarce and malnourishment and disease,including cholera and typhus,swept through the often overcrowded camp weakening and killing many.to the extent there was medical care,it often included ghoulish medical experiments subjecting the patient to extreme pain and often death.
tens of thousands of prisoners were killed during the camp operation.the life span for a prisoner was approximately three months.in addition to the death toll attributable to disease,exhaustion,starvation,and medical experiments,arbitrary executions were common.guards would often beat or kill a prisoner for sport,sometimes using dogs turned loose on the prisoner.the camp also had a special facility for executing prisoners.prisoners were taken one at a time to a room and told to undress for a medical examination.a doctor examined the prisoner mouth under this pretense but really for the purpose of determining if the prisoner had any gold teeth that would be removed and melted down.once the examination was over,prisoners were shot.the body was removed and the room was cleaned to remove all traces of the another patient was brought in.
wittje was assigned to sachsenhausen from to.at all stages of this litigation,wittje has acknowledged that he was stationed for this period of time at the ss barracks near sachsenhausen and that this barracks is where camp guards lived.the parties differ,however,on wittje role at the camp.the united states claims he was a guard at the camp,while wittje claims he was a member of a track and field sports competition unit stationed near the camp for part of the time he was stationed in the company.wittje also claims that he was later assigned work as a bricklayer and helped construct air raid shelters and bunkers.wittje claims he never set foot in the prison camp proper.
in february,wittje was transferred from the death head guard battalion to the ss armored division,a recently formed combat unit sent to the eastern front as part of an attempt to stern the russian advance.wittje service in this unit was brief.he was wounded in combat on march,and sent to a military hospital where he remained for the rest of march.he was discharged from the hospital on march,but apparently did not return to his unit or take further part in what little remained of the german war effort.sometime after the conclusion of the war in,wittje traveled with his family to wels,austria where he worked for a construction company until.
in february,wittje applied for a nonpreference immigrant quota visa to enter the united states at the united states consulate in salzburg,austria.wittje based his claim for this type of visa on the fact that he was a volksdeutscher an ethnic german born in rumania.he listed his nationality as stateless and stated that he resided in wels,austria.in an area of the application that required the applicant to list his residences since turning fourteen years old,wittje stated that he was in michael,rumania in,haindorf,germany in,and wels,austria from to the date of the application.wittje did not mention his membership in the ss or his assignment to sachsenhausen from.
wittje application was processed by ralph mcmahon,one of the two vice consuls in the salzburg consulate assigned to review visa applications of ethnic germans.mcmahon approved wittje application the same day it was filed and wittje,with his wife and son,traveled to,and arrived in,this country shortly thereafter.
wittje settled in chicago,and in applied for united states citizenship.the petition for naturalization wittje completed required a petitioner to list his membership in any organizations,clubs,or societies in the united states or in any other country before the last years.wittje listed membership in a roman catholic youth organization.he did not mention his membership in waffen ss.wittje petition was granted and he became a united states citizen on august.
on september,the united states filed a complaint seeking to revoke wittje citizenship.the first count and the only count at issue here alleged that wittje unlawfully procured a visa by failing to disclose his membership in a movement hostile to the united waffen ss.
at the conclusion of significant discovery including the deposition testimony of wittje,on june,the united states moved for summary judgment as to count one.three days later,on june,wittje moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,and on the ground that the united states efforts to revoke his citizenship constituted a violation of his rights to due process and equal protection.the district court denied the motion and subsequently granted the united states motion for summary judgment and revoked wittje certificate of naturalization.this appeal followed.
wittje raises three issues on appeal.first,he argues that the district court lacked the jurisdiction to reconsider a visa eligibility determination by consular officers.second,he argues that denaturalization violates his constitutional right to equal protection.third,he argues that the united states was not entitled to summary judgment because it was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law and there are genuine issues as to material facts.
statutory background 
section a of the immigration and nationality act of the ina directs the united states acting through the united states attorney in the appropriate district to seek the revocation of a certificate of naturalization when that certificate was illegally procured a.in order to be eligible for a certificate of naturalization,a person must have been lawfully admitted into the united states for permanent residence.a.lawful admission into the united states in turn requires entry pursuant to a valid visa.a.read together,these provisions make it clear that a person can not become a citizen by naturalization if his visa was illegally obtained and that a district court must revoke the citizenship of a person who illegally obtained a visa.fedorenko united states,d o ur cases have established that a naturalized citizen failure to comply with the statutory prerequisites for naturalization renders his certificate of citizenship revocable as illegally procured under a.united states tittjung,cir see also united states stelmokas,cir united states koziy,cir.
the principal immigration law in place in when wittje was issued a visa was the immigration act of,pub,ch,stat.the act.the act contained quotas on the number of aliens of any one nationality that were admissible to this country,stat.at.
following world war ii and in light of the upheaval in europe,congress amended the act with the displaced persons act of,pub,ch,stat.the dpa.the dpa suspended the act quotas for eligible displaced persons,stat.at.the dpa adopted the definition of displaced person from annex i to the constitution of the international refugee organization of the united nations the iro b,stat.at.that definition excluded many ethnic germans.iro,annex i,part ii,reprinted at,at.
the dpa contained two provisions of critical importance in this case.first,of the dpa amended the act to require of the quota for german immigrants to be made available to ethnic germans born in poland,czechoslovakia,hungary,romania or yugoslavia and who,on the effective date of this act,reside in germany or austria,stat.at.this provision had the effect of allowing ethnic germans,who would otherwise not be eligible for visas to enter the united states because they were not covered by the iro constitution,to take advantage of the quotas available to those born in germany.
the second important provision is.section provides that n o visas shall be issued under the provisions of this act to any person who is or has been a member of,or participated in,any movement which is or has been hostile to the united states or the form of government of the united states,stat.at.
subject matter jurisdiction 
wittje first argument concerns the jurisdiction of the district court to revisit a decision by a consular officer that an immigrant is eligible for a visa.wittje argues that a district court does not have such jurisdiction.
wittje is asking this court to reconsider and overrule our decision in tittjung in that case we were faced with the precise argument raised here.tittjung,at tittjung puts forth that article iii courts are without jurisdiction to proceed in reviewing visas and cancelling certificates of naturalization based on their findings of visa ineligibility.we rejected that argument as without merit.id.nothing has changed.
the district court had all the jurisdiction necessary to consider whether wittje was eligible for a visa.the district court had and has jurisdiction to hear all civil claims brought by the united states,and the district court had specific jurisdiction to consider a claim by the united states that wittje certificate of naturalization should be revoked,a.
as we have explained above,a prerequisite to such a certificate is lawful admission into this country.lawful admission requires,in turn,a valid visa.the determination that a person citizenship should be revoked necessitates,therefore,a review of the visa process.see united states dailide,cir.we stand by what we wrote in tittjung 
while tittjung is correct that our system does delegate specific powers to specific branches of government,he fails to acknowledge that ours is a system of checks and balances.under article,section of the united states constitution,congress is empowered to establish standards for immigration.the act delegates to the executive branch,and specifically the attorney general,the powers of administration and enforcement.in such a situation,t he courts,when a case or controversy arises,can always ascertain whether the will of congress has been obeyed and can enforce adherence to statutory standards.see immigration and naturalization service chadha,d citing yakus united states.and youngstown sheet tube sawyer.
tittjung,at.as it was in tittjung,wittje argument that we do not have subject matter jurisdiction is without merit.
equal protection 
wittje next argument is that his denaturalization violates the equal protection clause of the constitution.his argument is premised on the fact that he was naturalized pursuant to a of the ina.wittje posits that the ina,unlike the dpa,had no hostile movement restriction for immigrants.wittje then asks us to explore the hypothetical situation where two former members of the waffen ss were both naturalized in.one of these men entered the country in while the other entered the country after the effective date of the ina.wittje first notes that the determination of whether an immigrant has been lawfully admitted is based on the laws in place at the time an immigrant enters the country.fedorenko,at.tittjung,at l awful admission is based on the circumstances as they existed at the time of initial entry.see also dailide,at the question of whether an alien was lawfully admitted is answered,not by the law at the time of naturalization,but by the law at the time of entry.because they arrived at different times,the two men in his hypothetical would be treated differently the immigrant who entered the country in would be subject to denaturalization,while the immigrant who entered after the effective date of the ina would not.wittje suggests that such a situation would be a violation of the equal protection clause because it would treat similarly situated persons two former members of the waffen ss applying for citizenship at the same time differently.
we disagree.at the time wittje entered this country,he was not eligible for a visa as a former member of a group hostile to the united states.it can not be seriously disputed that congress had a rational basis all that is needed in this case for such a restriction when it enacted the dpa or even now.immigration to this country is a privilege,not a right,and certainly there can be no class of persons less deserving of that privilege than those who are,or were,a member of a group hostile to this country,particularly a and organized group that had helped oversee a reign of terror and murder on a scale.that congress let this restriction expire with the dpa or enacted new legislation the ina that did not contain such a restriction or significantly modified the restriction does not make the original restriction any less rational.
summary judgment 
wittje final series of arguments is that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the united states.our review is de novo.mcpherson city of waukegan,cir.a party is entitled to summary judgment in its favor when there is no genuine issue of material fact and that he or she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c celotex catrett,d.
wittje admission statute.
wittje first takes issue with the district court conclusion that he was admitted to this country pursuant to the act and the dpa.wittje argues that he was admitted pursuant only to the act,and consequently,there was no hostile movement restriction on his admission.recall that it is the dpa and not the ac
