congress officially sanctioned the use of departure programs in,with its enactment of the prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end the exploitation of children today act of protect act,m b,stat.in conjunction with authorizing the attorney general to create and implement such programs,congress directed the sentencing commission to promulgate a policy statement authorizing a downward departure of not more than levels if the government files a motion for such departure pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the attorney general and the united states attorney.id.pursuant to this directive,the commission adopted of the sentencing guidelines,providing that u pon motion of the government,the court may depart downward not more than levels pursuant to an early disposition program authorized by the attorney general of the united states and the united states attorney for the district in which the court resides.united states sentencing guidelines manual.
the attorney general provided guidelines for programs in a memorandum to all united states attorneys.under these guidelines,the programs are to be reserved for exceptional circumstances,such as where the resources of a district would otherwise be significantly strained by the large volume of a particular category of cases.the memorandum goes on to describe the criteria to be used in determining whether such exceptional circumstances exist the district must face an exceptional local circumstance with respect to a specific class of cases that warrants expediting their disposition declination of such cases in favor of state prosecution must be unavailable or unwarranted the cases must be highly repetitive and present similar fact scenarios and the cases must not involve an offense that the attorney general has designated a crime of violence.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the memorandum further specifies that any program must require the defendant to enter into a written plea agreement and to waive his rights to file pretrial motions,to appeal,and to challenge the resulting conviction under west supp,except on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel.these requirements apply to programs as well as protect act programs involving downward departures.
acting pursuant to authority delegated by the attorney general,the deputy attorney general approved programs in districts for illegal reentry offenses under.no such program has been approved for the eastern district of north carolina,however.
a citizen of mexico,illegally entered the united states in.in july,he was convicted in florida of the felony of committing a lewd,lascivious,or indecent act upon a child.conviction was based on his having had sexual intercourse with a girl on several occasions in late,when he was.he was sentenced to two years of house arrest,to be followed by three years of probation,and he was deported on july.
reentered the united states without permission in early.a little more than a year later,he was arrested in greenville,north carolina following a traffic stop.as a result,was indicted on a single count of reentering the united states after having been deported.see a,b.he pleaded guilty to the indictment without a plea agreement.
at sentencing,the district court began by calculating sentencing guideline range.because had been convicted of a felony crime of violence prior to his indecent act district court applied a increase to his base offense level of.see a,b a ii.application of a adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,see,reduced the total offense level to.with a criminal history category of i,guideline range was to months.the district court then heard argument on a request by for a sentence.contended that such a sentence was necessary to avoid an unwarranted sentence disparity with defendants who had received sentences.these defendants included not only defendants in other districts but also a group of illegal immigrants who maintained had been arrested on a single occasion the prior month in the eastern district of north carolina and had been allowed to plead guilty to illegal entry under west,rather than face possible prosecution for the more serious offense of illegal reentry.also argued that failure to impose a sentence would create a disparity with at least one other similarly situated defendant in the eastern district of north carolina who had received a reduction from a different district court judge on the basis of disparity.further argued that his prior conviction was for sexual conduct to which the victim consented,and that he was sentenced only to two years of house arrest followed by three years of probation.for these reasons,requested a sentence.
in contrast,the government sought a sentence,the low end of the applicable guideline range.the government denied that any disparity produced by such a sentence would be unwarranted since did not participate in any program and was not similarly situated to the illegal immigrants who had recently received expedited treatment in the eastern district of north carolina because they were not known to have had any prior convictions.the government also emphasized that the victim of prior crime was only years old.
at the close of arguments,the court imposed a sentence of months,which was months less than the low end of the guideline range and the equivalent of a downward departure.as justification for sentencing below the applicable guideline range,the court cited the sentencing disparity issues with defendants both within and outside the eastern district of north carolina.the court also noted total lack of criminal record with the exception of the predicate offense which was committed some seven years ago with the alleged consent of both parties.
the government first argues that the district court erred to the extent that it imposed a sentence to account for sentences received by defendants participating in programs.we agree.see united states,cir per curiam vacating as unreasonable defendant sentence that was reduced the equivalent of four levels below guideline range to avoid disparity with sentences of defendants united states,cir affirming as reasonable refusal by district court to impose sentence based on alleged unwarranted disparity with defendants united states,cir same united states,cir en banc same united states sebastian,cir same.
in united states booker,d,the supreme court held that the sixth amendment right to a jury trial is violated when the district court,acting pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system,imposes a sentence greater than the maximum authorized by the facts found by the jury alone.to remedy this problem,the court severed and excised the provisions of the sentencing reform act that mandated sentencing and appellate review in conformance with the guidelines.see booker,at.severing and excising b west supp and e west supp.this excision rendered the guidelines effectively advisory,id.at,and replaced the previous standard of review with review for reasonableness,see id.at.
that the guidelines are in the wake of booker does not mean that they are irrelevant to the imposition of a sentence.to the contrary,remaining provisions of the sentencing reform act require the district court to consider the guideline range applicable to the defendant and pertinent policy statements of the sentencing commission.see a,a west supp booker,at.stating that district courts must consult the guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.in addition to th
