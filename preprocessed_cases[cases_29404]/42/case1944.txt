this appeal requires this court to examine the family business exemption from the migrant and seasonal agricultural worker protection act awpa,et.appellants,two migrant farmworkers,alleged that appellee,the owner of a family farm,deliberately discouraged them from accepting employment so he could import workers under a program that requires farmers first to attempt to hire american workers before receiving visas for foreign workers.appellants alleged that appellee conduct violated the awpa and that his misrepresentations of the terms and conditions of employment at his farm constituted fraud under texas law.the district court granted appellee motion for summary judgment,dismissing the awpa claim based on the family business exemption from the statute and dismissing the state law fraud claim based on a failure to raise a fact issue as to injury.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment.
background 
russell garber and his wife own and operate a farm in ohio.beginning in,garber recruited migrant workers from brazil,where he also owns a farming operation.garber applied for visas for these farmworkers under the program administered by the united states department of labor dol.under this program,the dol grants foreign workers temporary work visas,but only if the employer first demonstrates that he has made a good faith,active attempt to recruit american workers but could not find sufficient able,willing,and qualified workers for his needs.a a.when garber sought visas for brazilian workers in,he submitted a report to the dol stating that he had unsuccessfully attempted to find american migrant workers by spread through neighbors and acquaintances by requesting help from the farm bureau,a local farm supply organization,and the agricultural extension service,a statewide agricultural organization and by filing a job order with the ohio state employment services agency.before agreeing to issue the visas,the dol required garber to publish job advertisements in texas,which has traditionally been a source of farmworkers for ohio,and to use the services of the texas workforce commission twc.the advertisements told prospective workers interested in work opportunities at garber farm to contact the twc.when prospective workers responded,the twc relayed to them garber terms and conditions of employment.the twc did not interview prospective applicants or make any job offers.rather,the twc served as a clearinghouse,where a prospective employer could post information about available work and prospective applicants could learn about the job opportunities.
ovidio malacara and david rincones,both residents of mcallen,texas,contacted the twc after learning about job opportunities on garber farm through the texas advertisements.garber flew from ohio to texas to interview malacara,rincones,and several others who had contacted the twc.garber conducted the interviews in the twc office.the twc provided an interpreter for malacara and others who spoke no english.malacara and rincones alleged that in the interviews,garber tried to discourage them from taking a job by misrepresenting the terms and conditions of the work.malacara and rincones claimed that garber told them the work would be done in cold snow and offered to fly them to ohio in a manner that suggested garber hoped they were afraid of flying.rincones,who spoke only english,alleged that garber warned that the inability to speak spanish could be a problem in the workplace.despite these alleged efforts at discouragement,malacara and rincones both expressed interest in taking the jobs.garber promised to contact them shortly.
garber responded that he accurately described the work at his farm during the interviews.garber claimed that,in response to rincones inquiry about the language that would be spoken on the job and in the living quarters,he informed rincones that he and his spoke running the show in the fields.garber contended that rincones obviously knew that garber spoke english and should have assumed that garber son did as well.garber told rincones that he might be the only in the living quarters.garber asserted that he believed he had hired rincones and malacara at the interview that rincones had accepted and that malacara had not firmly accepted.
garber telephoned rincones to arrange his transportation to ohio.rincones alleged that during the telephone conversation,garber emphasized the problem rincones inability to speak spanish could present at the work site,as well as the safety risks of the job.garber alleged that he answered rincones prior question about the language spoken in the living quarters and notes that,during the telephone call,there was some confusion over whether the statement by garber about rincones being the only person related to the job or the living quarters.rincones claimed that this conversation dissuaded him from traveling to ohio to work for garber.rincones told garber that he had reconsidered and would not be accepting employment with him.
garber also telephoned malacara.malacara claimed that during this conversation,he understood only the words bus ticket and never communicated to garber any lack of interest in coming to ohio.garber disputed this version of events,claiming that malacara said that he had decided not to take the job in ohio.malacara asserted that when he did not hear from garber again or receive a ticket for travel to ohio,he ultimately believed that garber either had not really hired him at the interview,or that he had decided to reject him after the interview.
malacara and rincones sued garber,alleging violations of the awpa and the immigration and nationalities act ina and fraud under texas law.after discovery,garber moved for summary judgment on all three claims.the district court granted garber motion in its entirety.the court found that garber fell under the family business exemption from the awpa requirements,available if a farmer solicitation,recruitment,or furnishing of farmworkers is performed solely by the farmer or by immediate family members.as to the second cause of action,the court found that the plaintiffs had no private right of action under the ina.as to the fraud claim,the court found that,in response to the summary judgment motion,rincones had failed to present or point to evidence raising a fact issue as to whether he was damaged,an essential element of the fraud cause of action.
malacara and rincones appeal the district court dismissal of the awpa claims,and rincones appeals the district court dismissal of his fraud claim.
ii.analysis 
this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.bgha,llc city of universal city,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.celotex catrett,d rule c mandates the entry of summary judgment against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party case,and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.worthy new orleans ass.longshoremen ass n,pension plan,cir.in deciding a summary judgment motion,a court must review the facts drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.anderson liberty lobby,d calbillo cavender oldsmobile,cir.
a.the awpa and the family business exemption 
the awpa is designed to assure necessary protections for migrant and seasonal agricultural workers.the awpa imposes requirements on labor contractors,agricultural employers,and agricultural associations.farmers must disclose the terms and conditions of employment at the time of recruitment,a must make the disclosures in a language the worker will understand,g may not convey false or misleading information,f and must comply with the parties work arrangements,c.malacara and rincones alleged that garber violated each of these provisions.
family farmers who meet certain criteria are exempt from the statute.the awpa provides 
a the following persons are not subject to this chapter 
family business individual who engages in a farm labor contracting activity on behalf of a farm which is owned or operated exclusively by such individual or an immediate family member of such individual,if such activities are performed only for such operation and exclusively by such individual or an immediate family member,but without regard to whether such individual has incorporated or otherwise organized for business purposes.
a.the term farm labor contracting activity is defined as one of six types of acts recruiting,soliciting,hiring,employing,furnishing,or transporting any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker.if a member performs any labor contracting activity,that spoils an agricultural employer claim to the exemption.flores rios,cir.
it is undisputed that garber and his wife are the sole owners of the ohio farm and that garber recruited workers exclusively for the family farm.the issue is whether garber used members to recruit farmworkers,so as to make garber ineligible for the family farm exemption from the awpa.appellants contend that garber use of the state employment agencies to locate prospective employees and his use of friends and neighbors to spread information about job opportunities through makes him ineligible for the family business exemption.garber responds that neither his use of the state agencies nor of friends or neighbors makes him ineligible for the exemption,arguing that he did not delegate to others any of the farm labor contracting activities set out in the statute.
one appellate court has considered whether a farmer use of a state employment service to help locate prospective workers makes that farmer ineligible for the family business exemption.in flores,a tomato farmer located in ohio hired texas farmworkers referred by the ohio bureau of employment services obes.at.the defendant interactions with obes we re a street.id.administrators from the obes would contact the defendant in an effort to place particular workers,and the defendant would contact the obes to post job listings.id.the court held that this use of the state agency did not defeat the family business exemption because the agency did not conduct contracting activity under the awpa.id.at.the court explained that all the practices listed by congress as examples of farm labor contracting activity are distinctly contractual in nature and that the statutory language of the awpa exemption could not be defined without regard for the contractual context in which the exemption applies.id.
the flores court relied on calderon witvoet,cir,which emphasized the context in which farm labor contracting activities are defined 
this definition collects a number of contractual endeavors making a contract of employment hiring,maintaining a worker in the labor force employing,preparing to do these things recruiting and soliciting,and doing them for others furnishing.the final term in this sequence,transporting,can be understood as still another contractual activity obtaining and paying for a ticket that brings the worker to the farm or sends him to the next one.
flores,at quoting calderon,at finding that defendants were entitled to the awpa exemption despite the fact that members drove farm bus,trucks,and cars.the flores court explained that the obes is a state agency that merely provides the worker with a chance to find a job at a farm in need of labor.id.noting that the agency activities were gratuitous the agency represented neither the employee nor the employer and the employer alone had the power to hire workers,the flores court held that the agency did not recruit,solicit,or furnish workers within the meaning of the awpa.id.the farmer use of the agency did not make him ineligible for the family business exemption.id.
malacara and rincones do not argue that the twc performed services materially different from the obes.in this case,as in flores,the state agency told workers of job opportunities and identified interested workers to prospective employers.neither the obes in flores nor the twc in this case made job offers.rather,malacara and rincones contend that flores is incorrectly decided.they contend that under the awpa,such a use of a state agency to look for workers forfeits the family business exemption.
garber responds that no case has disagreed with flores in the years since it issued.garber emphasizes that the position appellants advocate would create a hobson choice for a farmer who chooses to avail himself of the visa program and otherwise qualifies for the family business exemption from the awpa.under the visa program,the dol requires farmers to use state employment agencies to locate domestic workers before allowing visas to issue to foreign workers.malacara and rincones argue that surrender of the family farm exemption should be viewed as a price of admission into the and programs,requiring a farmer to choose between the family business exemption under the awpa and the opportunity to hire foreign workers under the visa program.
the definition of farm labor contracting activities under the awpa adopted in flores and calderon is consistent with the statute language and structure.the approach that malacara and rincones advocate would divorc e the statutory term from its context.calderon,at.in drafting the awpa,congress defined recruiting,soliciting,hiring,employing,furnishing,and transporting within the scope of contracting activities.it is a fundamental principle of statutory construction and,indeed,of language itself that the meaning of a word can not be determined in isolation,but must be drawn from the context in which it is used.deal,d see also flores,at laws can not be interpreted by snatching single words out of statutory sentences and matching these regard for against one of the many definitions of that word found in the advocate dictionary of choice.
the record is undisputed that garber did not use state job agencies to recruit in any contractual sense.flores,at.like the obes in flores,the state employment agencies that garber used charged no fee for their services and did not purport to represent either the employer or employee.both garber and the workers remained free at all times to accept or reject any agency recommendation.an agency referral provided the worker with no assurance of employment.garber did not delegate any authority to hire to the twc,but rather flew to texas personally to interview applicants.no one at the state employment offices offered a job to applicants instead,garber personally extended job offers to them.garber did not delegate statutory contracting activities to the twc or other state agencies.
malacara and rincones rely on a dol opinion letter stating that the use of a state employment service agency to locate workers vitiates the family business exemption.they argue that the letter is entitled to deference under skidmore swift.in the opinion letter,issued on april,the dol asserted that the family business exemption by its plain terms,does not apply to any business or person using the services of a state employment service agency to obtain workers.interpretations contained in opinion letters are not controlling and should be followed only insofar as they have power to persuade.christensen harris county,d moore hannon food,cir see also salinas rodriguez,cir.the dol opinion letter is not persuasive.that letter was based upon a reexamination of the legislative history,the statute,the regulations issued thereunder,and recent judicial interpretations concerning the intent of congress.significantly,the letter was issued before the sixth circuit ruling in flores and cited recent judicial interpretations that were rejected in flores.the basis of the dol opinion letter is no longer valid after flores.indeed,if the dol were to prevail on both its requirement that farmers work through state agencies and the position espoused in its opinion letter,the dol would,in effect,be repealing the family farm power enjoyed exclusively by congress and not available to an executive branch department.
malacara and rincones argue that the family business exemption should be construed narrowly because congress intended the awpa to be remedial in nature.see,at,cong.and admin.news at the committee intends that
