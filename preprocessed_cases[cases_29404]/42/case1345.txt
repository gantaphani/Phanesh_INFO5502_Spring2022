if the supreme court has determined that the repeal of a law has an impermissible retroactive effect on a particular group,does that determination render the law impermissibly retroactive in its application to other groups affected by the repeal that is the question before us in this appeal.
factual background and procedural history 
claudius atkinson is a citizen of jamaica who entered the united states as a visitor in january.he adjusted his status to that of lawful permanent resident two years later on january.on december,following a jury trial in the court of common pleas for philadelphia county,atkinson was convicted of criminal conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance.atkinson was sentenced to not less than six or more than twelve months imprisonment to run concurrently with a sentence of not less than eleven or more than months of work release.in addition,he was given three years of probation.
atkinson finished serving his sentence and,according to the record,lived an uneventful existence with his family in philadelphia until june,when he received a notice to appear,initiating removal proceedings,from the immigration and naturalization service ins according to the notice,atkinson was removable from the united states pursuant to sections a b i and a a iii of the immigration and nationality act ina because he was an alien convicted of a controlled substance offense and because he was an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.
in march,an immigration judge ij held that atkinson was removable and ineligible to apply for a waiver of deportation under former section c of the ina,c repealed,which permitted deportable aliens,who had accrued seven years of lawful permanent residence in the united states,to request discretionary relief from deportation if the equities weighed in favor of their remaining in the country.the ij ruled that the repeal of section c applied retroactively.in,however,when atkinson was convicted,even aliens who had been convicted of an aggravated felony were eligible to seek such relief provided that they had served a sentence of less than five years imprisonment.see a a iii c.
atkinson appealed the decision to the board of immigration appeals bia,which,on june,affirmed the ij decision without a written opinion.less than one month later,atkinson filed a motion to reconsider with the bia,based on the supreme court decision in ins cyr,d.the court held in cyr that the provisions of aedpa and iirira,eliminating the possibility of discretionary relief under former section c,could not be applied retroactively to a lawful permanent resident alien who had pled guilty to an aggravated felony charge 
while atkinson motion for reconsideration was pending,he was detained by the ins on october.on october,atkinson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a stay of removal.the stay of removal was granted,and,on the same day,atkinson was released from custody pending the resolution of his habeas petition.on july,the bia issued a short opinion denying atkinson motion for reconsideration on the ground that cyr applied only to aliens who had entered into plea agreements and not to aliens who,like atkinson,had been tried and found guilty.
the district court referred atkinson petition to a magistrate judge who,on april,issued a report and recommendation,advising the district court to grant the habeas petition.the magistrate judge reasoned that,with respect to the retroactive elimination of section c relief,there was no principled distinction between aliens who had pled guilty and aliens who had gone to trial.after the magistrate judge issued her report and recommendation,but before the matter was considered by the district court,we decided ponnapula ashcroft,cir.in ponnapula,we held that it was impermissible to apply aedpa and iirira retroactively to aliens who had been offered pleas but had rejected them.the district court interpreted our decision as creating a requirement that,in order to render a statute impermissibly retroactive,aliens must show that they had reasonably relied on the state of the law.in ponnapula,the had been offered a plea agreement.atkinson was not offered an agreement.moreover,in ponnapula,we stated in dictum that we doubted that aliens in atkinson situation could show sufficient reliance on the of the law to render iirira repeal of section c impermissibly retroactive.id.at.based on its understanding of ponnapula,the district court denied atkinson petition for a writ of habeas corpus.atkinson filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
atkinson petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied on december.subsequently,congress passed the real id act,which became effective in may,stat.section a of the act eliminated the district courts habeas jurisdiction over final orders of removal in nearly all cases.a francois gonzales,cir.where,as here,we are faced with an appeal from a district court id act decision on a habeas petition,we vacate the district court opinion and review de novo constitutional claims and questions of law in the habeas petition as if they had been filed with us in the first instance as a petition for review of an immigration decision.a.
this petition for review presents us with a question of law the bia legal conclusion that atkinson was ineligible to apply for relief under former section c.
iii.discussion 
statutory framework 
because the statutory schema in place prior to aedpa and iirira bears on retroactivity,a brief history is helpful 
section of the ina excluded from the united states several classes of aliens,including aliens convicted of offenses involving moral turpitude or illegal trafficking in drugs.however,the attorney general was given discretion to admit otherwise excludable aliens although section c by its terms applied only to exclusion proceedings,it was interpreted by the bia also to permit a permanent resident alien with a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years to apply for a discretionary waiver of deportation.cyr,at.citing matter of silva,wl francis ins,cir.because of the large class of convictions that triggered removability,section c was frequently called upon to enable permanent resident aliens to remain in the country 
the first significant change in section c occurred in,when congress amended it to preclude aliens convicted of aggravated felonies,who had served a term of imprisonment of five years or greater,from applying for a waiver of deportation.stat.amending c.then,when congress enacted section d of aedpa in,it set forth certain offenses for which convictions would preclude resort to c regardless of sentence length.stat.amending c.that same year,congress passed section b of iirira,which repealed section c and replaced it with a provision that grants the attorney general the ability to cancel removal for a narrow class of inadmissible or deportable aliens.cyr,at.that narrow class does not include those who,like atkinson,were previously convicted of an aggravated felony.id.citing a,supp.v.
retroactivity analysis 
we begin our retroactivity analysis with the supreme court decisions in landgraf usi film,d,which sets out the procedure for assessing whether a civil statute should apply retroactively.the first question is whether congress has expressly provided that the statute should be retroactive.landgraf,at.if the answer is yes,our inquiry is over.mathews kidder,peabody,cir.if the statute lacks such an express statement,we ask whether the normal rules of statutory construction unequivocally remove the possibility of retroactivity mathews,at.if congress did not expressly provide for retroactivity and if a court applying normal rules of statutory construction would not find an intent to apply the statute only prospectively,then we must determine whether applying the statute to events that antedated its enactment would have a retroactive effect.id.at.if we find a retroactive effect,we employ the strong presumption against applying such a statute retroactively.id.at.
resolving whether a statute has a retroactive effect demands a commonsense,functional judgment about whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.cyr,at.quoting martin hadix,d quoting landgraf,at.a statute has retroactive effect when it takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws,or creates a new obligation,imposes a new duty,or attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past id.quoting landgraf,at.quoting soc y for propagation of the gospel wheeler,cas.the judgment whether a statute has retroactive effect is informed and guided by familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.id.quoting martin,at.quoting landgraf,at.
the retroactivity of the repeal of section c was considered by the supreme court in cyr.applying the landgraf analysis,the court concluded that congress did not expressly provide for the temporal reach of the repeal.the court then moved on to the issue of whether the repeal produced an impermissible retroactive effect on aliens like cyr who had pled guilty in reliance on a plea agreement.cyr,at.the court held that iirira removal of discretionary relief could not be applied to an alien who had negotiated a plea to an aggravated felony charge during the time when section c relief was available.at.the court focused on the quid pro quo nature of a plea agreement and stressed that an alien who had pled guilty to aggravated felony with the expectation that he would be eligible for section c relief would suffer a new disability if that relief were subsequently eliminated.id.at.
the court did not clarify whether it understood reliance by the person affected to be the condition of finding impermissible retroactivity or merely the factor,in the context of that case before the court,that demonstrated an impermissible retroactive effect.nor did the court consider whether,beyond the reliance factor,there were other indicia that the repeal of section c attached new legal consequences to completed events.however,since the court decision in cyr,courts of appeals in other circuits have understood the court discussion of reliance and quid pro quo as requiring that there be reliance on the prior state of the law in order to make a finding that the elimination of section c relief is impermissibly retroactive.see,rankine reno,cir focusing on lack of reliance in rejecting alien claim that iirira repeal of section c was impermissibly retroactive as to aliens who went to trial and were convicted of aggravated felonies chambers,at same dias ins,cir same sonchik,cir same.
such a reading of cyr,however,runs contrary to our understanding of prior supreme court law.as we noted above,landgraf teaches that,in determining if a statute applies retroactively,a court must begin with the statute.if the statute is ambiguous as to its temporal reach,the question is whether it attaches new legal consequences to past events.at.if the court determines that the statute has retroactive effect because of such consequences,that determination is applied across the board.
the court has never held that reliance on the prior law is an element required to make the determination that a statute may be applied retroactively.see ponnapula,at noting that the supreme court has never required actual reliance in any case in the landgraf line.in landgraf,for instance,the plaintiff,barbara landgraf accused her employer of violating title vii of the civil rights act of,et.after a bench trial,the district court found that plaintiff had been sexually harassed,causing her to suffer mental anguish.landgraf had,however,resigned from her employment for reasons that the district court found to be unrelated to the sexual harassment.for that reason,the district court dismissed her complaint because she was no longer entitled to equitable relief and title vii did not then authorize any other form of relief.landgraf,at.
while landgraf appeal was pending,title vii was amended to permit recovery of compensatory and punitive damages for certain violations and to provide for a jury trial if such damages were sought.see stat.a,a ed.supp iv as added by of the act,stat.the supreme court granted certiorari to decide whether the amendments applied to a title vii case which was pending when the statute was amended.id.at.
in determining that the amendment did not apply to pending cases,the court did not base its decision on the specific conduct of landgraf employer or on any reliance that either landgraf or her employer may have had on the state of the law when discriminatory conduct occurred.instead,the court made a general analysis of the impact of the amendment,finding retroactivity improper because the amendment instituted a legal change that attached a new legal burden to the proscribed conduct.id.at.see also ponnapula,at.since the court found the impermissible impact,the amendment has been applied prospectively by the courts of appeals without the need for any reexamination of the basis for denying a passing citation to landgraf.see,jonasson lutheran child family services,fn,cir.
similarly,in hughes aircraft schumer,d,the false claims act fca had been amended in to partially remove the bar to suits based on information which was already in the government possession.the former division contracts manager for hughes division brought an action in based on alleged mischarges made by hughes against northrup,and ultimately against the government.hughes moved to dismiss,contending that the amendment was not retroactive and that the action against it was precluded by the fca because the information upon which the action was based was already in the possession of the government.the district court denied the motion.hughes then moved for summary judgment on the merits.the district court granted this motion and the plaintiff appealed.hughes the denial of its motion to dismiss.the ninth circuit court of appeals rejected the,finding the amendment should be applied retroactively in suits based on conduct.at.
the supreme court granted certiorari to consider,among other issues,whether the amendment was applicable to conduct.the court held that the amendment should not have been applied retroactively.id.at.in doing so the court concluded that by eliminating a defense to an fca action,the amendment attached a new disability to transactions already past.id.at.there is,however,no consideration in hughes of whether hughes aircraft,in particular,or any defendant,in general,in an fca action might have relied on the former law in conducting business with the government.see ponnapula,at olatunji ashcroft,cir.it was the new legal burden imposed on events past,rather than the reliance on the former law by the person affected,which was the basis for holding that the amendment would not be applied retroactively.
again,in hadix,the question of retroactivity was the issue.here,the prison litigation reform act of plra,stat,d,supp.iii had placed a limit on the fees that might be awarded to attorneys who litigate prisoner lawsuits.the supreme court was asked to decide whether the limit on fees applied to monitoring of defendants compliance with the remedial decrees that had been performed before the plra became effective.the district court had ruled that plaintiffs were entitled to fees at the prevailing rate,which had been set by the court at per hour.under the plra,fees would be limited to per hour.at.
the supreme court determined that the limitation on fees would apply to monitoring performed after the effective date of the plra but not to services performed prior to that date.at.in coming to this conclusion,the court noted that the attorneys had worked in reasonable reliance on the fee schedule and that,before the effective date of the plra,they reasonably expected to receive compensation according to this schedule.id.at.a reduction in the rate of compensation would attach new legal consequences to completed conduct.id.citing landgraf,at.
in hadix,this reliance on a set fee was the expectation which convinced the court that a new legal burden had been imposed on past events.nevertheless,reliance on law has not been interpreted by our sister courts of appeals as an element in determining across the bo
