opinion of the court 
imelda laurencia lie,her husband,soyono liem,and her minor son,andre yulius suyono,petition for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia denying their application for asylum and withholding of removal this case tracks a now familiar fact pattern lie is an indonesian citizen who alleges that she and her husband were persecuted because they are ethnically chinese and christian.more specifically,lie alleges,as is common in these cases,that she and her husband were robbed on separate occasions by unknown individuals who targeted them because of their ethnicity and their religion.
however,substantial evidence supports the bia conclusion that these robberies were not motivated by religion or ethnicity,and that,at all events,such robberies were not sufficiently severe so as to rise to the level of persecution.moreover,we agree with the bia conclusion that lie has not established a fear of persecution if she were to return to indonesia.therefore,we will deny the petition for review.
facts and procedural history 
lie became a naturalized indonesian citizen around the time she married her husband in.lie and her husband lived separately for work reasons in towns about four hours apart.as noted above,both lie and her husband are ethnically chinese and are christians.in the late,indonesia chinese christian population became the target of widespread attacks perpetrated by muslim indonesians.the united states state department country report for indonesia noted that i nterreligious violence and violence against ethnic minorities continued.attacks against houses of worship continued,and the lack of an effective government response to punish perpetrators and prevent further attacks led to allegations of official complicity in some incidents.dep t of state,country reports on human rights,country report.in may,there were serious and widespread attacks on businesses and homes by muslim indonesians,which led to the deaths of over one thousand people.id.thus,represented a period of significant violence and rioting against individuals of chinese origin throughout indonesia.
lie alleges that at the start of this tumultuous period,in,several native,muslim indonesians entered her husband store,threatened him with a knife,called him a chinese pig,and then robbed him.traumatized as a result of the robbery,her husband left for the united states in december.
lie further claims that in july,two people knocked on the door of her home,called her a chinese pig,and demanded entry.they knocked down the door brandishing a knife,threatened to burn down her house,and demanded that she give them money.the intruders took some of lie money and jewelry and struck her in the left forearm with the knife when she tried to defend herself.when they left,lie called the police,but claims that no one at the police station answered the phone.lie received several stitches for the knife wound.however,for the next months,lie and her son continued to live in the same house without incident.
lie and her son did not leave indonesia until march,when they came to the united states as visitors.on august,lie filed an asylum application with her husband and son as derivative applicants.on september,the ins commenced removal proceedings against lie,her husband,and her son.the immigration judge ij initially indicated he would grant asylum subject to the admission of additional evidence from both parties,including evidence confirming that lie is a catholic.because lie did not provide the information in time,the ij denied her asylum application.lie filed a timely motion to reopen the case and produced evidence that she is a catholic and attends mass every sunday.the ij then reopened the case and granted the motion for asylum.
the ij made credibility findings in lie favor,including that the ij had no reason to dispute the veracity of the claim that lie and her husband are ethnically chinese and that lie was in fact catholic.the main issue addressed by the ij was the motivation of the individuals who robbed lie husband and lie.while finding that the attackers had some interest in simple robbery,the ij concluded that,taking into account the context in which the respondent claim arises,it is reasonable to conclude that those who robbed the respondent and her husband were motivated at least in part by a desire to punish them because of their ethnicity.in addition to lie testimony about the incident,the ij relied on evidence of the riots and other violence directed against ethnic chinese during this period documented in the country report.therefore,the ij found that lie and her husband had suffered past persecution,and that the presumption of future persecution had not been rebutted by evidence of changed conditions in indonesia.
the government appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia,which overturned the ij grant of the lies asylum petition.the bia found that with regard to the single incident of abuse lie has described,a robbery of her store,there was no evidence that it was motivated by her religion.as for her claim that the robbery was motivated by her chinese ethnicity,the only evidence to support that claim was her testimony that her attackers said you chinese pig,i want your money,which the bia found to be insufficient 
the bia further reasoned that even if the ethnic slur was sufficient to establish that the intruders were motivated by lie ethnicity or religion,the robbery incident did not constitute persecution.see fatin ins,cir holding that persecution denotes extreme conduct.the bia found significant that lie chinese neighbors were not robbed,that lie tried only once to contact the police,and that she lived for nearly two years after the attack without incident before fleeing to the united states.it therefore rejected the ij finding that lie had suffered past persecution.
similarly,the bia concluded that lie lacks a fear of future persecution.in its view,the fact that she remained in indonesia for nearly two years after the robbery because her son was in school undermined her claim that her primary motivation for requesting refuge in the united states is fear,a genuine apprehension or awareness of danger in another country.matter of acosta,wl bia.in addition,the bia noted that all of lie and her husband siblings remain in indonesia and have been unharmed during this factor which the bia had previously held would reduce the reasonableness of alien fear of future persecution.see matter of,wl bia.
concluding that lie had failed to establish past persecution or a fear of persecution,the bia overturned the ij decision and denied asylum,withholding of removal,and lie cat claim.lie now petitions for review on her asylum and withholding of removal claims.we set forth the by now familiar principles governing our jurisdiction and scope and standard of review in the margin 
ii.discussion 
under b,the attorney general may grant asylum to an alien who is a refugee within the meaning of a.generally speaking,an applicant must show that he or she 
is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of the country of such person nationality or in which such a person last habitually resided,because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion 
a a.a showing of past persecution gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of a fear of future persecution.b.
lie challenges the bia finding that she did not suffer past persecution and its conclusion that she has failed to establish a fear of future persecution.
past persecution 
lie claims that the intrusion into her home and the robbery of her husband store constituted past persecution on account of her chinese ethnicity and christian religion.as noted above,the bia concluded that lie had not established the intruders were motivated by her ethnicity or religion,and that,even if they had such motivation,the incident was not sufficiently severe so as to rise to the level of past persecution.we agree with the bia conclusion and similarly hold that lie has not established her claim
