petitioner shobinder gill petitions for review of a board of immigration appeals bia opinion finding gill removable based on a conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude cimt under a a i.gill argues that his crime of conviction,attempted reckless assault under new york penal law,is not a cimt because it requires only a reckless state of mind,whereas some positive intent is required for a cimt.gill does not specifically argue that his conviction for attempted reckless assault does not demonstrate the requisite mental state for a cimt because it incoherently combines the specific intent element of criminal attempt under new york law with the recklessness standard of.nonetheless,we exercise our discretion to consider this subsidiary issue sua sponte and find that the bia committed clear error in ordering gill removal based on a crime that,because it is legally impossible,demonstrates no clear mental state.
the legal incoherence of gill crime of conviction was not argued in the administrative proceedings below.however,this argument is subsidiary to the general argument gill did make before the bia that his crime of conviction did not reflect a sufficiently culpable mental state to be designated a cimt.therefore,we hold that our basis for reversing the bia decision is not precluded by the exhaustion requirement for immigration appeals,d,which provides that a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right,or by any judicial exhaustion doctrine.accordingly,we reverse the bia order of removal,and remand with instructions to close gill removal proceedings.
background 
gill,whose father is a united states citizen,was admitted to the united states as a visitor in,at age nine,and later granted lawful permanent resident status in.on june,gill pleaded guilty to attempted assault in the second degree in violation of new york penal law,which proscribes recklessly caus ing serious physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument.he was sentenced to nine months imprisonment.on august,the immigration and naturalization service ins filed a notice to appear,charging gill as removable based on his attempted assault conviction,which the ins characterized as a cimt gill argued that his crime was not a cimt because requires only a reckless state of mind,whereas some positive intent is required for a cimt.
the ij agreed with gill in a decision dated october,then reversed himself on february,after the ins moved for reconsideration.in his later order,the ij found that,under new york law,reckless conduct involves a conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk of harm,and that this disregard can,in certain circumstances,constitute a sufficiently culpable mental state to render the offense a cimt.the bia affirmed by a decision issued september,holding that,although not all crimes of recklessness constitute cimts,gill crime did so because it involved two aggravating factors the serious physical injury which resulted from gill conduct and his use of a deadly weapon.although neither the bia nor the ij found any significance in the fact that gill conviction was for attempted assault,both noted this fact in their opinions.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
because the specific argument on the merits which we discuss in section iii infra was not raised before the bia,we must decide at the outset whether we have jurisdiction to consider it.
section d of title of the united states code provides,in pertinent part,that federal courts may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.while there is no question that this exhaustion requirement,being statutory,is mandatory,a question does arise as to the level of specificity at which a claim must have been made to have been exhausted under d.
various decisions by this court have spoken to this question obliquely.in beharry ashcroft,for example,we held that the district court had lacked jurisdiction under d to consider beharry claim for relief under h h relief because he had not previously sought h relief from the ins,cir.because beharry involved a habeas petition and the law was unclear as to whether d applies to such we also considered whether the less stringent judicial exhaustion requirement prevented the consideration of beharry h claim.we found that it did,in part because beharry failure to claim h relief below left sizable gaps in the factual record presented to us on appeal such that this court would be to decide the merits of his legal claim.id.at see also theodoropoulos ins theodoropoulos ii,cir holding that d barred habeas review where petitioner,in open court,had expressly waived his right to appeal the ij decision,cert.denied,d.similarly,we held in foster ins that,under d,an alien generalized protestations that his removal was improper did not allow him to argue on appeal that his crime of conviction first degree manslaughter was not a crime of violence or aggravated felony under immigration law,cir.in so holding,we explained that a petitioner must raise issues to the bia in order to preserve them for judicial review.id.at internal quotation omitted.
while we held in beharry that the exhaustion requirements preclude a petitioner from raising a whole new category of relief on appeal,in foster that a petitioner must have raised an issue below to present it on appeal,and in theodoropoulos ii that the statutory exhaustion requirement precludes a petitioner from bypassing the administrative review process altogether,we have never held that a petitioner is limited to the exact contours of his argument below.to the contrary,in restrepo mcelroy,cir,we held that d did not prevent us from considering a wholly new reliance argument on appeal because restrepo did raise the general issue of the aedpa retroactivity in his habeas petition,and we enjoy broad discretion to consider subsidiary legal arguments that were not specifically raised below.id.at emphasis added.we used subsidiary in a broad sense the reliance argument restrepo made in his administrative proceedings was that aedpa which foreclosed a form of relief sought by restrepo should not apply retroactively to crimes committed,or convictions entered,before the law effective date,whereas the subsidiary argument he raised on appeal was that aedpa should not apply to him because he decided,in reliance on the law,to delay his application for relief until a later date when he would be better able to demonstrate rehabilitation.
in drax reno,cir,we similarly held that d does not limit our review to those arguments specifically raised below.in that case,we found jurisdiction to decide drax eligibility for a certain type of relief from deportation gabryelsky relief where the relief was not specifically sought before the bia.in his initial immigration hearing,drax,who was then proceeding pro se,asked the ij whether he was qualified for any type of waiver of deportation,drax,at citing drax reno.lexis,at drax i internal quotation marks omitted,to which the ij responded in the negative.on appeal before the bia,drax,now represented by counsel,asserted that the ij had erred in stating categorically that no relief from deportation was available.drax,at.under these circumstances,we held that petitioner was permitted to raise the issue of gabryelsky relief for the first time on appeal because this argument was merely an extension of the argument his counsel raised directly before the bia.
the rule that emerges from this precedent is that d bars the consideration of bases for relief that were not raised below,and of general issues that were not raised below,but not of specific,subsidiary legal arguments,or arguments by extension,that were not made below.our decision in restrepo and drax not to interpret d to require complete conformity between an alien argument below and on appeal makes particular sense given that immigration law has undergone rapid changes in recent years and given the fundamental interests at stake because gill raised below the general issue,as characterized by the ij in his february,order,of whether attempted assault in the degree involve s the required mens rea or a guilty corrupt mind or vicious motive emphasis added,we have jurisdiction to consider the specific subsidiary argument that gill conviction for attempted reckless assault fails to meet the mental state requirement of the cimt definition because,under new york law,such a conviction is legally incoherent 
we further find that the judicial exhaustion doctrine would not bar consideration of a specific,subsidiary legal argument,particularly one that is purely legal and falls outside the ins traditional area of expertise.see mccarthy madigan,d exhaustion concerns strongest when the action under review involves exercise of the agency discretionary power or when the agency proceedings in question allow the agency to apply its special expertise,as well as when judicial review would benefit from an administrative factual record,superceded by statute on other grounds as noted in booth churner,d beharry,at judicial exhaustion doctrine would bar consideration of claim of eligibility for discretionary relief.moreover,to the extent that gill may have technically waived the legal incoherence argument by failing to make it below,we retain broad discretion,which we now exercise in gill favor,to consider waived arguments that are purely legal.see marrero pichardo ashcroft,cir.
even had we found that gill omission was a failure to exhaust his administrative remedies under d,we nonetheless would have assumed jurisdiction to avoid manifest injustice.this court recently so held in marrero pichardo ashcroft,noting that c ourts have historically interpreted procedural rules to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice.at sun ashcroft,cir there is agreement among the circuits that have addressed the issue that exceptions do apply to d,although the contours of such exceptions remain to be fully developed.
manifest injustice would result here were gill to be removed without full judicial review of the correctness of his removal.as explained below,the merits of his legal incoherence argument are in his favor,and go to the very basis for his deportation,marrero pichardo,at.moreover,these merits were not apparent during gill administrative case and have only crystalized in a subsequent opinion by the third circuit interpreting new york criminal law,knapik ashcroft,cir finally,although the record contains little description of gill personal circumstances,it does indicate that gill has lived in this country,with his united states citizen father and other family members,for sixteen years,since he was nine years old that he has been a lawful permanent resident since and that he is an honor student who is currently enrolled in college.taken together,these factors warrant an exception to the statutory jurisdiction requirement.see marrero pichardo,at exercising jurisdiction,in closely analogous circumstances,based on precisely the same considerations.
the dissent suggests that marrero pichardo must be read narrowly because it is a single case,decided by a panel of this court last year,and is in tension with theodoropoulos ii.post.the dissent does not attempt to locate any distinction in the text of marrero pichardo,which is squarely on point factually.nor do we see how it is in any tension with theodoropoulos ii,let alone in such tension that it must be narrowed.in theodoropoulos ii,we held that an applicant who had waived all administrative appeals was barred by the exhaustion requirement from seeking judicial review,and that no exception to the exhaustion requirement arose from the fact that his legal argument was,at the time he waived his administrative appeal,contrary to administrative precedent.apparently,there were no further circumstances urged by theodoropoulos as bases for finding jurisdiction.contrary to the dissent characterization,we did not hold in theodoropoulos ii that absent a constitutional problem there is no exception to the exhaustion requirement for any claim that could have been raised in the bia,see post emphasis added.we specifically limited the holding of theodoropoulos ii to the facts by declining to fix the precise boundaries of possible exceptions to the exhaustion rule.at.marrero pichardo simply adds further definition to these boundaries in analyzing the facts of that case.
finally,we have the power to consider the legal incoherence of gill crime of conviction even though gill has not raised it here.see lambert genesee,cir w e have discretion to consider and decide sua sponte a dispositive issue of law,cert.denied,d see also thomas crosby,cir tjoflat,concurring it is beyond dispute that,in general,we have the power to consider issues that a party fails to raise on appeal,even though the petitioner does not have the right to demand such consideration.united states boyd,cir finding an consensus that courts of appeals may,when justice requires it,raise critical issues of law sua sponte,vacated on other grounds,d cruz melecio,cir notwithstanding that the parties did not raise the issues that impel us to this course either to the district court or on this appeal,we have the power to do so sua sponte.united states heater,cir although petitioner did not raise the ex post facto argument himself,we find it within our discretion to consider this constitutional concern sua sponte,cert.denied,d.
ii.standard of review 
because the bia has expertise applying and construing immigration law,we afford chevron deference to its construction of undefined statutory terms such as moral turpitude.see chevron,natural res.def.council,d michel ins,cir deferring to bia rule that crimes of which knowledge is an element are generally cimts.however,as we recognized in michel,at,the bia has no expertise in construing federal and state criminal statutes,and so we review de novo the bia finding that a petitioner crime of conviction contains those elements which have been properly found to constitute a cimt.see also sutherland reno,cir.thus,in this case,we defer to the bia view that recklessness,in combination with serious resulting bodily injury and use of a deadly weapon,amounts to a cimt,but we review de novo the bia finding that attempted reckless assault under new york law contains these elements.
iii.gill alleged cimt 
we turn now to the question of whether gill conviction for attempted reckless assault was a cimt such that he was removable under a a i.
definition of cimt in immigration law 
at the outset,we affirm the bia holding that reckless assault with a deadly instrument resulting in serious bodily harm is a cimt.moral turpitude is a term used to refer to offenses that are inherently base,vile,or depraved.hamdan ins,cir quoting from the bia decision.in assessing whether a crime of conviction is a cimt,the bia takes the categorical approach,focusing on the intrinsic nature of the offense rather than on the factual circumstances surrounding any particular violation.dalton ashcroft,cir.thus,to constitute a cimt,a criminal category must by definition,and in all instances,contain each of those elements that constitute a cimt.michel,at.
i t is in the intent that moral turpitude inheres,united states ex rel.meyer day,cir,and therefore the bia focus is on the mental state reflected in a given offense.crimes committed knowingly or intentionally generally have been found,on the categorical approach,to be cimts.michel,at.likewise,crimes committed recklessly where recklessness is defined as a conscious disregard of substantial and unjustifiable risk have,in certain aggravated circumstances,been found to express a sufficiently corrupt mental state to constitute a cimt.see,matter of medina,bia holding that,although moral turpitude does not inhere in all crimes of recklessness,it does inhere in reckless assault with a deadly weapon matter of fualaau,bia holding that reckless assault was not a cimt because no serious bodily injury resulted.
we find that the bia definition of moral turpitude is consistent with the precedent set forth supra,and is reasonable.
gill crime of conviction 
as set forth supra,we now review de novo the bia characterization of gill crime of conviction.gill pleaded guilty to attempted assault in violation of that is,attempting to recklessly cause serious physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument.under new york law,a person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime when,with intent to commit a crime,he engages in conduct which tends to effect the commission of such crime.this standard has been characterized as a specific intent standard.people campbell.
a charge of attempting to commit a crime of recklessness has a certain conceptual incoherence,particularly where,as here,the offense is partly defined by its result serious bodily injury.a defendant can only be guilty of attempted assault if he specifically intended all elements of that offense,but is worded such that a defendant can be convicted simply because his assault resulted in serious injury,regardless of whether he intended such a result.recognizing this type of incoherence,the new york court of appeals dismissed an analogous charge in campbell,at,at,at the court reasoned that,b ecause the very essence of a criminal attempt is the defendant intention to cause the proscribed result,it follows that there can be no attempt to commit a crime which makes the causing of a certain result criminal even though wholly unintended,and thus there can be no attempt to commit assault,second degree penal law.
in people esquilin,dep t,the appellate division extended campbell holding to reverse a jury conviction for attempted kidnapping.there,the court held that,like second degree assault,
kidnapping in the first degree under penal law occurs when the accused,with intent to restrain the victim,does so restrain the victim by the use or threatened use of deadly force and,during the course of this abduction the victim dies.the gravamen of this charge is not the abduction but,rather,the unintended death.the causing of this result being criminal even if unintended,it follows that there can be no attempt to cause this result.
id.citations omitted.
the legal incoherence theory has also been applied to crimes of recklessness.in people terry,dep t,for example,the appellate division reversed a jury conviction of attempted second degree murder,holding that one can not attempt to commit second degree murder,cause someone death by recklessly engag ing in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person,under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life.because involves no intent,only a culpable mental state of recklessness,the court explained,it is incompatible with the specific intent requirement of the criminal attempt provision.terry,at,at see also people mcdavis,dep t t here can be no attempt to commit a crime that does not involve a specific intent,such as manslaughter in the second degree,a crime predicated upon a reckless act.people trepanier,dep t the crime of attempted reckless endangerment is nonexistent since it is a offense.
as these cases demonstrate,a person can not attempt as this term is used in new york criminal law to commit a crime of recklessness,particularly not one defined,as in,by an unintended result such as bodily injury.the question that follows is what significance,if any,this legal impossibility should have in the immigration context.although this is a question of first impression in this circuit as well as in most other circuits,the third circuit addressed the question in a case interpreting new york law knapik ashcroft,cir.in that case,the court considered a bia determination that knapik crime of reckless a cimt.the knapik court found that the concept of intentional recklessness was nonsensical,and that new york courts had recognized it as such.id.at citing terry,trepanier.because knapik crime of conviction was nonsensical,the court found that it could not demonstrate moral turpitude.
we find the third circuit logic persuasive and directly on point.without in any way questioning the state ability to hold a defendant to his plea to an attempted reckless crime which may have made practical sense in terms of reaching a contextually appropriate sentence or sentencing range we find that,in the immigration context,no mental state can be clearly discerned from such a conviction,let alone the sort of aggravated recklessness that has been found to demonstrate moral turpitude,see matter of medina,bia.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,because gill crime of conviction was not a crime involving moral turpitude,we reverse the bia removal order and remand with instructions to close gill removal proceedings.the stay of removal,which was in place pending our decision,will expire upon issuance of the mandate.
shobinder gill,a citizen of india who became a lawful permanent resident in and has been convicted of two offenses while still in college,appeals from an order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the ruling of an immigration judge ij that one of gill offenses attempted reckless assault with a deadly weapon,to wit,a firearm amounts to a crime involving moral turpitude cimt a ruling that mandates removal under section a a i of the immigration and naturalization act,a a i.there is no defect in that ruling,and we lack jurisdiction to seek one.
in reversing,the majority opinion conceives sua sponte the argument that an attempt at reckless conduct is an incoherent basis for the level of intent required for a cimt,and is satisfied that the merits of his legal incoherence argument are in his favor.first,the argument is not his it is raised sua sponte by the majority.when judges raise an issue sua sponte and consider it without briefing,no one should be surprised that the issue seems to them to be.in any event,because gill never raised that argument to the bia,the argument is unexhausted,and this court therefore lacks jurisdiction to consider it.
the majority premises appellate jurisdiction on the idea that the argument is subsidiary to an argument that gill did make that reckless conduct involves insufficient mens rea,and on the manifest injustice that would ensue if the argument is not enlisted to keep gill in the united states.the supposed manifest injustice according to the majority is that the argument gill omitted to make is valid,and that gill is a lawful resident and an honor student.i conclude that the argument decided by the majority is unexhausted that exhaustion is required no matter how effective an argument may seem on appeal and that gill status as an honor student confers no jurisdiction though it may confer on his unfortunate parents the right to display a bumper sticker.i therefore respectfully dissent.
in january,gill was convicted in new york county of theft of services,in violation of,a misdemeanor.in june,gill pled guilty in queens county to an attempt to commit intentional assault with a deadly weapon,a felony.attempt assault.in august,the ins initiated removal proceedings pursuant to a a i on the in the majority an attempt to commit intentional assault is a cimt.when the ins learned of the theft of services,that was added to the removal petition.
as the ij observed,gill retained a lawyer who was obviously in immigration law,and who,while removal proceedings were in an early stage,went back to criminal court in both counties of conviction and had gill prior convictions amended.the attempted assault conviction was reduced from intentional to reckless still a felony,and the theft of services conviction was reduced to disorderly conduct a violation.
the ins conceded that disorderly conduct was not ground for removal,but maintained that the assault conviction was still a cimt.gill argued that the charge did not involve the mens rea required for a cimt because it was for a reckless assault rather than one that was intentional.the ij initially agreed,but in november granted the ins motion to reconsider,noting that he would have reconsidered his ruling sua sponte because he had made a mistake of law.by written order in february,the ij held that gill had committed a cimt and therefore was removable.
there is no sign in the record that gill raised an issue as to whether attempted recklessness is a cognizable mental status under new york law.
gill counsel argued to the bia that the ij erred in granting the motion to reconsider and that reckless conduct does not involve moral turpitude.neither gill nor the ins nor the bia raised an issue as to whether recklessness can be attempted under new york law the word attempt appears nowhere in the argument section of gill appeal to the bia.the bia concluded that the motion to reconsider was appropriately granted,and agreed with the ij that gill conviction is a cimt.
gill timely appealed to this court,presenting the same two challenges one concerning the propriety of the ins motion to reconsider a because the ij would have reconsidered sua sponte the second as to whether a reckless assault is a cimt.gill brief presents his second argument this way 
petitioner was convicted of a crime alleging reckless conduct new york penal law.there is no evidence of mens rea set forth in the new york statute to determine that petitioner committed a crime involving moral turpitude.
gill brief nowhere highlights that the offense is one of attempt,or cites to the new york penal law governing attempt,or argues that the attempt as opposed to completion matters the word attempt appears once,where counsel recites the offense of conviction among the facts.
a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.d.failure to exhaust these remedies constitutes a clear jurisdictional bar.foster ins,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.so if gill failed to exhaust a claim before the ins,we lack jurisdiction to review it.see beharry ashcroft,cir.this statutory exhaustion requirement is mandatory,not discretionary.id.at bastek fed.crop ins,cir.and it is not subject to judicial exception.see booth churner,d see also beharry,at.
the majority opinion does not contend that the argument on which it rests was actually made below instead,it contends that the argument is subsidiary to the general argument gill did make before the bia that his crime of conviction did not reflect a sufficiently culpable mental state to be designated a cimt.this is error because i the majority opinion casts gill argument in the bia at a higher level of generality than gill ever did and ii the attempted recklessness argument on which the majority relies is not subsidiary to the argument that gill in fact made.
as demonstrated above,gill whole argument to the bia,as set out in the first sentence of his argument on cimt classification,was the board must conclude that reckless conduct does not involve moral turpitude and that the ij erred in finding otherwise.gill made no broader argument that his crime of conviction reflects generally an insufficiently culpable mental state he argued over and over that the recklessness constitutes the insufficiency 
while the respondent,gill,in the case before the bia used a weapon,he stands convicted only of reckless conduct and,therefore,he did not have the requisite mens rea required to compel the bia to find that the crime involved an act of moral turpitude.
recklessness is defined in black law dictionary,sixth edition as rashness,heedlessness,and wanton conduct.what is significant is the absence of the word intent.
in an earlier case,the bia decided that while reckless conduct may form the basis for a determination that a crime involves moral turpitude the bia has never held that a crime involving reckless conduct is per se a crime involving moral turpitude.
reckless conduct may not necessarily involve moral turpitude 
the bia,without particular emphasis or fanfare appears to have developed at least two separate and distinct lines of cases which relate to whether or not a conviction for a crime of reckless conduct is also one involving moral turpitude.
appellate opinions that undertake to address subsidiary arguments to those raised in the bia do so only because consideration of the appellate argument does not subvert the purpose of administrative exhaustion in the immigration context to provide the ins,as the agency responsible for construing and applying the immigration laws and implementing regulations with a full opportunity to consider a petitioner claims before they are submitted for review by a federal court.see foster,at quoting theodoropoulos ins,cir.the majority seizes on a single sentence in foster that more expansively says issues must be raised before the bia in order to be exhausted.this quote puts more weight on the word issue than it will bear the raising of an issue in the bia matters only if it is one that alerted the agency to the issue that is being taken up on appeal.in light of the purpose of the exhaustion requirement,an issue may be subsidiary and therefore within our jurisdiction even though not argued in so many words if consideration of it was necessarily prompted by consideration of an issue expressly argued,or if it was necessarily rejected by the same logic,or if there is some other sufficient sign that the bia had a full opportunity to consider it.see foster,at.otherwise,the doctrine of subsidiary issues would nullify the exhaustion requirement.
thus in foster the petitioner general protestations to the bia that his removal was improper did not let him argue on appeal that his crime of conviction was not an aggravated felony requiring removal because it was not a crime of violence.id.at.the court found no exhaustion notwithstanding that foster appeared pro se and that the court therefore construed his submissions generously.id.at.a fortiori,gill and his counsel can not be deemed to have exhausted an argument that they never made.
gill argued before the bia that a reckless assault entails an insufficient mens rea to be a cimt.the bia ruled otherwise,and the majority acknowledges that that ruling commands chevron deference.on this appeal,the majority poses and answers the question whether reckless assault amounts to a cimt if it is attempted rather than completed.the question whether cimt classification is supported by one mens rea is not subsidiary to the question whether such classification is supported by a different mens rea altogether.ironically,the majority holding itself depends on drawing a critical distinction between the mens rea of recklessness which is indisputably cognizable and the mens rea of attempted recklessness which the majority deems legally incoherent.
drax reno,cir,neatly draws the distinction between an issue that is subsidiary and one that is not.drax argued unsuccessfully before the bia that he was entitled to relief under c and under a on appeal,the court undertook to decide whether the two could be read together to afford relief even though neither section alone would do,and accurately characterized its analysis as merely an extension of the argument made below.at.at the same time,the court suggested that a retroactivity issue presented on appeal was unexhausted and that appellate jurisdiction as to it was therefore lacking even though drax had raised below various other retroactivity arguments,as well as the issue of retroactivity generally.at.
drax observes a vital distinction between two appellate arguments,one of which was subsidiary to an argument below while the other was not.tellingly,the majority in the present appeal thinks that these two parts of drax are in tension with each other.but the only tension is between drax and the majority opinion here.
in restrepo mcelroy,cir,this court held that a petitioner adequately exhausted his administrative remedies with regard to his retroactivity argument because the bia decision addressed the retroactivity argument and considered the relevant authorities.emphasis added.the question decided in the majority opinion in the present case turns on the interaction between federal immigration law and new york state precedent holding that for various purposes reckless attempt is not a cognizable mental state.the bia was never presented with that argument,or alerted to it by citation to new york case law.
if the bia had reviewed and decided that attempted reckless assault with a firearm is a cimt,the bia conclusion would be owed defere
