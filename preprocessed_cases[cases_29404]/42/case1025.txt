petitioner adeodatus canada petitioner petitions for review of the may,decision of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the january,decision of immigration judge ij michael straus ordering petitioner removal from the united states.the ij ordered petitioner removal because of his august,conviction for assault of a peace officer,in violation of connecticut general statutes cgs a,based on a plea of nolo contendere.the ij viewed this conviction as involving a crime of violence,thus making petitioner eligible for removal as an aggravated felon.in affirming,the bia concurred with the ij ruling.because we agree that petitioner conviction involves a crime of violence,we conclude that the bia properly upheld petitioner removal as an aggravated felon,and we therefore dismiss the petition.
background 
petitioner is a citizen of the philippines and a lawful permanent resident of the united states who entered this country on january.on july,petitioner entered a plea of nolo contendere to assault of a peace officer,in violation of cgs a,and to illegal operation of a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol,in violation of cgs.during the allocution,the prosecutor outlined the conduct that led to the charges against petitioner.according to the prosecutor,a police officer pulled over petitioner after observing him driving his car erratically.when the officer instructed canada to place his hands where he could see them,canada refused and instead began piping in his opinions using various expletives.hearing,july,at.then,
t he officer turned his hands with his flashlight and began reaching over to the steering wheel of the vehicle to attempt to take the keys away from petitioner to keep him from starting the vehicle 
as the officer reached over the steering wheel to grab the keys,petitioner began struggling with the officer and succeeded in starting the vehicle,began revving the engine.he then quickly shifted the vehicle into reverse and proceeded to back up at a high rate of speed spinning his tires.the officer left arm was now stuck between the steering wheel and the dashboard and the front door post,and the officer was now dragged alongside petitioner vehicle backwards.
id.eventually,after being dragged alongside petitioner car,the officer was able to get petitioner to put the car into park and prevent petitioner from further driving the car.officers arrived only to face additional resistance from petitioner.
after this allocution,and after petitioner was advised of his trial rights,the court informed petitioner that he would be facing a sentence of years suspended after years in jail with respect to the assault on a police officer charge.id.at.petitioner then entered his plea.thereafter,on august,petitioner was convicted and sentenced to a total of four years imprisonment suspended after eighteen months imprisonment and five years probation.
on december,petitioner was served with a notice to appear,alleging that he was removable under a a iii as an alien who had been convicted of an aggravated felony,to wit,a crime of violence for which the term of imprisonment was at least one year,pursuant to a f.on january,petitioner first appeared before an ij,who adjourned the hearing to permit petitioner to obtain counsel.the next hearing was held on january,during which an attorney appeared on behalf of petitioner and during which petitioner conviction was made part of the record.
after receiving submissions from both sides,the ij ruled that petitioner assault of a peace officer,in violation of cgs a,would clearly give rise to a substantial risk that the public safety officer would be subject to physical force and that any such force would be intentional.ij oral decision,at.consequently,the ij found that petitioner offense of conviction was a crime of violence,thus making petitioner an aggravated felon eligible for removal.
petitioner appealed to the bia.on may,the bia dismissed the appeal and ordered his removal.agreeing with the ij,the bia noted that an individual who intentionally injures a peace officer acting in the line of duty necessarily runs the risk of having to intentionally employ physical force,either to injure the officer or to protect himself from harm.bia decision,may,at.one bia member dissented,noting that he was not persuaded that all possible convictions under section a involved substantial risk of the use of force.id.at.this appeal followed.
discussion 
jurisdiction and standard of review 
under section a c of the immigration and nationality act of ina,a c,as amended by the real id act of,no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered by ina a a iii,a a iii however,the ina,as amended by the real id act,permits us to review questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals.a d.because the question of whether petitioner offense is a crime of violence and therefore constitutes an aggravated felony is such a question of law,we have jurisdiction to review it.in answering this question,we review de novo the bia decision.see dos santos gonzales,cir jobson ashcroft,cir mugalli ashcroft,cir.if we determine that petitioner conviction involves a crime of violence and therefore is an aggravated felony,then we must dismiss his petition for lack of jurisdiction.see united states dep t of justice,wl,at cir.may,jobson,at.
statutory background 
an alien convicted of an aggravated felony after admission to the united states may be deported.see a a iii.there are nearly two dozen aggravated felonies identified by congress in the ina.see a.one type of aggravated felony is a crime of violence for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.see id.a f.the phrase crime of violence is in turn defined in title as either 
a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,or 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
the parties agree that petitioner removal is based on section b and not on section a,as the crime for which petitioner was convicted does not have the use of force as one of its elements.thus,our discussion focuses on the requirements of section b.
section b sweeps more broadly than a,leocal ashcroft,d,but involves only two elements a criminal felony that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used.sutherland reno,cir quoting b.here,petitioner does not dispute that he was convicted of a felony.rather,he claims that the felony of which he was convicted under cgs a did not,by its nature,involve a substantial risk that physical force may be used.
section a provides in pertinent part a person is guilty of assault of a public safety officer when,with intent to prevent a reasonably identifiable officer from performing his or her duties,and while such officer is acting in the performance of his or her duties,such person causes physical injury to such officer cgs a.though the statute is entitled assault of public safety or emergency medical personnel,it provides a specific list of public safety employees who are covered under the statute.id.the list starts with peace officer s,but also includes many other categories of public safety personnel,including,among others,firefighters,probation officers,and employees of the department of children and families id.peace officer is defined elsewhere in the cgs as 
a member of the division of state police or an organized local police department,a chief inspector or inspector in the division of criminal justice,a state marshal while exercising authority granted under any provision of the general statutes,a judicial marshal,a conservation officer or special conservation officer,a constable who performs criminal law enforcement duties,a special policemen appointed under section,or,an adult probation officer,an official of the department of correction authorized by the commissioner of correction to make arrests in a correctional institution or facility,any investigator in the investigations unit of the state treasurer or any special agent of the federal government authorized to enforce the provisions of title of the united states code.
the statute is intended to protect peace officers in the performance of their duty.state woolcock,see also state nixon,noting expressed intent of the revision adding correction officers was to discourage those who would assault correctional employees quoting remarks of william kiner,reported at,pt.under connecticut law,assault under cgs a is a specific intent crime.see state pagano,state flynn.the elements of this offense are intent to prevent a reasonably identifiable peace officer from performing his duties the infliction of physical injury to the peace officer and the victim must be a peace officer.state turner,citation omitted state raymond,citation omitted 
categorical determination of a crime of violence 
guiding principles 
to determine whether an offense is a crime of violence under section b,we must look to the elements and the nature of the offense of conviction,rather than to the particular facts relating to petitioner crime.leocal,at.see also taylor united states,d.this is the categorical approach,under which only the minimum criminal conduct necessary to sustain a conviction under a given statute is relevant.dalton ashcroft,cir quoting michel ins,cir calabresi,dissenting.
where,however,a criminal statute encompasses diverse classes of criminal of which would categorically be grounds for removal and others of which would have held that such statutes can be considered divisible statutes.dickson ashcroft,cir citations omitted see also dos santos,at.in such a circumstance,while a court may not look to the particular facts of an alien conduct to determine if the alien actually used force,jobson,at,a court may refer to the record of conviction to determine whether the alien offense conduct falls within a category that would justify removal.kuhali reno,cir.t he record of conviction is statutorily defined as including,inter alia,the charging document,a plea agreement,a verdict or judgment of conviction,a record of the sentence,or a plea colloquy transcript.dickson,at citing c b accord abimbola ashcroft,cir identifying the record of conviction as including the charging document,plea agreement,a verdict or judgment of conviction,and a record of the sentence or plea transcript see also valencia gonzales,cir under this modified categorical approach,we examine documentation or judicially noticeable facts that clearly establish that the conviction is an aggravated felony,such as the indictment,the judgment of conviction,jury instructions,a signed guilty plea,or the transcript from the plea proceedings.citations and quotations omitted alterations in original vue ins,cir noting that immigration officers and courts,while precluded from considering the evidence,may examine the record of conviction including the indictment or information,plea,verdict or judgment and sentence to determine the crime of which the alien actually was convicted quoting wadman ins,cir.
under the categorical approach,we must determine if petitioner offense of conviction,by its nature,is a crime of violence.to make that determination,we first examine the statute under which petitioner was convicted,here,cgs a,to ascertain if it criminalizes conduct that can be described categorically as a crime of violence.as noted,this statute protects several categories of public safety officers and medical personnel from assault,which,aside from peace officers,includes employees of the department of correction,emergency room personnel,and active individual members of volunteer canine search and rescue teams.at oral argument,petitioner contended that statutory inclusion of such classes of public safety officers,whom petitioner expansively describes as volunteer firefighters,secretaries,nurses,doctors,game wardens,and dog catchers,requires the conclusion that cgs a does not identify a crime of violence under section b,because preventing these categories of public safety officers from performing their lawful duties does not,by its nature,involve a risk that force will be used against them.
even if petitioner is question we do not decide on this would only have succeeded in showing that the statute is divisible,requiring our inquiry to move to the record of conviction to identify the category of public safety officer in the statute that petitioner was convicted of assaulting to determine if assaults against such officers,by their nature,involve a substantial risk that force may be used.see kuhali,at.here,the record of conviction includes the transcript of petitioner nolo contendere plea,as well as the judgment of conviction while the judgment does not identify the category of public safety officer who was the victim of petitioner offense conduct,the transcript of the plea makes clear that petitioner was charged with,and ultimately convicted of,assaulting a police officer who had pulled over petitioner after observing him driving erratically.thus,there is no question that the offense conduct for which petitioner was convicted only involved a police officer,a category of public safety employee specifically protected by cgs a.
while petitioner does not contest our authority to consider the judicial record to determine the offense of conviction where a statute is divisible,he suggests for the first time during oral argument that because cgs a does not delineate the various categories of public safety employees covered in the statue in separate subsections,the statute can not be cleanly divided between conduct that is categorically a crime of violence and conduct that is not categorically a crime of violence.we find this argument unpersuasive.
to begin,petitioner cites no authority,and we are unaware of any,supporting his assertion that a statute is divisible only if the categories of conduct are in discrete subsections.indeed,we have on several occasions been able to carve out categories of offense conduct from divisible statutes that we held were crimes of violence,even in the absence of enumerated subsections.for example,in sui ins,cir,we treated the listed categories of mak ing,utter ing or possess ing a counterfeited security,under a,as divisible,even though they were listed sequentially and not in separate subsections.similarly,in dickson,we found that new york penal law sections,which generally prohibit the unlawful imprisonment of others,to involve a crime of violence when the offender imprisoned a competent adult,but not of an incompetent person or a minor under the age of sixteen.at see also valansi ashcroft,cir holding,which prohibits embezzlement by a bank employee,is a divisible statute that covers embezzlement with either intent to injure or intent to defraud,even though the statute on its face does not distinguish between the two,because the caselaw applying the statute distinguishes the two in defining the elements of the crime.
moreover,even though each of the categories of public officials protected by cgs a is not given its own subsection,petitioner has offered no reason why the mere listing of these clearly defined categories does not allow a court to distinguish among them for these purposes.in other words,cgs a does not proscribe assault generally against public safety officers,and then leave the classification of the subgroups of public safety officers covered by the statute to a regulating agency or the courts to determine.instead,the various categories of public safety officers protected by the statute are listed sequentially,each separated by a comma,and are phrased in the disjunctive.see cgs a peace officer,special policeman appointed under section,or active individual member of a volunteer canine search and rescue team emphasis added.since any statute that is phrased in the disjunctive can be readily converted to outline form,it would be strange to think that congress intended the application of the categorical approach to turn on the typography used by the statute drafters.singh ashcroft,cir.indeed,connecticut courts have encountered little difficulty in distinguishing between the categories listed in cgs a.see,state salters,t here exists a distinction between a peace officer and a correctional officer as seen by the fact that general statutes a separately lists peace officer and employee of the department of corrections.therefore,cgs a is a divisible statute in that a court may look to the record of conviction for the limited purpose of determining which public safety employee was the subject of any assault,thereby permitting it to determine whether the alien conviction was under a section of the statute that permits removal.see dickson,at.
we further conclude that petitioner offense of of a police officer under cgs a is a crime of violence under section b because it inescapably involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used in the commission of the crime.b.in reaching this conclusion we,of course,do not consider the fact that petitioner used force in this case,or that a person could theoretically violate cgs a without using force.instead,the supreme court has made clear that,under section b,we must consider whether the offense naturally involve s a person acting in disregard of the risk that physical force might be used against another in committing the offense.leocal,at.see also,at,wl,at the critical categorical inquiry is whether,inherent in any commission of the felony is a substantial risk that the perpetrator may use such force.citing leocal,at.
to be convicted of assaulting a police officer under cgs a,the offender must injure an officer while intentionally preventing the officer from performing his or her official duties.what this means in real terms is,among other things,preventing law enforcement officers from apprehending and arresting suspected criminals,carrying out lawful searches and seizures,intervening in personal disputes,and other duties that routinely involve physical intervention by police officers.indeed,the typical offender under cgs a is the subject of,or sympathetic to the subject of,the police officer actions.thus,it is unsurprising that the reported cases relating to convictions under cgs a entail intentional force and,indeed,violent force directed at police officers by those being investigated,questioned,or apprehended by police officers.see,state smith,defendant convicted of violating cgs a after fighting with officers seeking to question defendant about murder state casanova,abrogated on other grounds by state brocuglio,defendant struck police officer attempting to take defendant into custody state ortiz,defendant shot arresting police officers state madagoski,defendant,in facts strikingly similar to those presented in this case,injured police officer while attempting to drive away in van.
further,because assault of a police officer under cgs a is a specific intent crime,it is categorically different than other offense conduct found not to qualify as a crime of violence because such conduct involves only negligent or reckless conduct for example,the supreme court has held that drunk driving,though it might have violent consequences,is not a crime of violence because the risk that an accident may occur when an individual drives while intoxicated is simply not the same thing as the risk that the individual may use physical force against another in committing the dui offense.leocal,at.accord dalton,at holding that driving while intoxicated under new york law is not a crime of violence.similarly,we have held that second degree manslaughter under new york penal law,which merely requires the offender to recklessly cause the death of another person,jobson,at citing penal law,is not a crime of violence because it includes passive conduct or omissions which result in death,and,therefore,the statute encompasses many situations in which the defendant applies no physical force to the victim,and more importantly,situations that do not involve any risk that the defendant will apply force to the victim.id.at.in reaching this result,we noted our belief,later echoed by the supreme court in leocal,that a predicate offense can not satisfy the requirements of section b without requiring some intentional conduct.on this view,a defendant must,in pursuing his intended criminal activity,risk having to intentionally use force to commit the offense.id.at citation omitted.
thus,where the criminal statute at issue requires intentional conduct,even if force let alone violent force will not always be required to commit the crime,we have not hesitated to find the offense to be a crime of violence,as long as there is an inherent risk that force might be used to commit the crime.for example,in chery ashcroft,cir,we held that the mere possibility that a minor could not consent to sexual intercourse meant that there was an inherent risk that force might be used to violate a connecticut statute,cgs,proscribing sexual intercourse with,among others,minors between the ages of and where the defendant is at least years older and those mentally incapacitated and unable to consent.what we said to distinguish the statute in that case from the manslaughter statute at issue in jobson applies with equal force here the connecticut statute at issue here is distinguishable in that a conviction requires affirmative conduct by the defendant chery,at similarly,in dickson,we held that unlawful imprisonment of a competent adult under new york penal law was a crime of violence,even if done only by deception of the adult victim.at.in so holding,we acknowledged that force would not always be used to unlawfully imprison an adult,but we nonetheless found that the risk of using force was inherent in the nature of the crime.id.at.
these decisions flow directly from authority recognizing offenses such as burglary and prison escape as violent crimes.indeed,the supreme court has noted that burglary is a classic example of a crime of violence under b,because by its nature,it involves a substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a victim in completing the crime.leocal,at.see also jobson,at noting that a burglar risks having to use force if the occupants are home and hear the burglar quoting united states parson,cir emphasis in jobson.this is so even though a burglar can commit the crime by entering through a door when no one is inside.chery,at citing jobson,at.
similar to burglary,the courts have regularly found that the crime of prison escape involves the inherent risk of violence,even if the escapee is able to flee the prison without detection.see,united states gay,cir per curiam holding escape is a crime of violence under a because escape presents the potential risk of violence,even when it involves a from unsecured correctional facilities united states nation,cir even the most peaceful escape can not eliminate the potential for violent conflict when the authorities attempt to recapture the escapee.given this reality,we have no difficulty in concluding that escape qualifies as a crime of violence.specifically,prison escape by stealth is recognized as a crime of violence principally due to the obvious risk that an inmate might be pursued by law enforcement officers and seek to prevent apprehension through the use of force.as the tenth circuit expounded 
e very escape scenario is a powder keg,which may or may not explode into violence and result in physical injury to someone at any given time,but which always has the serious potential to do so.a defendant who escapes from jail is likely to possess a variety of supercharged emotions,and in evading those trying to recapture him,may feel threatened by police officers,ordinary citizens,or even fellow escapees.consequently,violence could erupt at any time.indeed,even in a case where a defendant escapes from a jail by stealth and injures no one in the process,there is still a serious potential risk that injury will result when officers find the defendant and attempt to place him in custody.
