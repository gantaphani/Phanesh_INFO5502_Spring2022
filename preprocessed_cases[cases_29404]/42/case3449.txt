petitioner chen piu kwong,a lawful permanent resident of the united states,was ordered removed on the ground that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony.see a a iii.he contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish that the crime of which he was convicted was an aggravated felony.we conclude that kwong conviction of burglary was a conviction of an aggravated felony,and was sufficiently established by the state court abstract of judgment.we also reject kwong claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,and we accordingly deny his petition for review.
background 
kwong is a native and citizen of the people republic of china.he entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident in.in april,kwong pleaded guilty to a violation of california penal code,the california burglary statute,and was sentenced to two years in prison.as a consequence of his conviction,removal proceedings were initiated.
the evidence of kwong conviction that was before the ij was a certified copy of the abstract of the judgment of the state court that abstract noted that kwong had pleaded guilty to a violation of of the penal code and described the crime as burglary first deg.section of the code defines and burglary burglary is burglary of an inhabited dwelling house,vessel which is inhabited and designed for habitation,floating home,or trailer coach,or the inhabited portion of any other building.code a.the abstract of judgment also indicated that kwong had been sentenced to two years of imprisonment.
the ij held that kwong conviction for burglary qualified as an aggravated felony because it was a crime of violence.see a f.the ij later denied kwong petition for withholding of removal.the board of immigration appeals bia adopted and affirmed the ij rulings with regard to the order of removal and denial of withholding.the bia also denied kwong motion to remand on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel 
ii.aggravated felony 
the ij and bia found that kwong is subject to a removal order as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.a a iii.in,the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira stripped the federal courts of jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony.a c as amended.the real id act of,however,restored jurisdiction over all constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review.a d as amended.whether an offense is an aggravated felony for removal purposes is a question of law.morales alegria gonzales,cir.thus,we have jurisdiction to address that question.
where,as here,the bia adopts and affirms the ij order pursuant to matter of burbano,bia,and expresses no disagreement with the ij decision,we review the ij order as if it were the bia.see abebe gonzales,cir en banc.we review de novo the ij and bia conclusions on questions of law,including whether kwong offense qualifies as an aggravated felony.see daas holder,cir.
exhaustion 
as a threshold matter,the government argues that kwong failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to two issues whether he was convicted of rather than burglary,and whether the ij erred in relying only on the abstract of judgment and the length of his sentence to determine that kwong had been convicted of burglary.we conclude that kwong exhausted these issues before the ij and the bia.
when the bia has ignored a procedural defect and elected to consider an issue on its substantive merits,we can not then decline to consider the issue based upon this procedural defect.abebe,at.thus,t he bia express adoption of an ij decision which explicitly discussed a ground is enough to convince us that the relevant policy concerns underlying the exhaustion requirement have been satisfied.id.quoting sagermark ins,cir.
after initially admitting the factual allegations in the notice to appear and not objecting to the introduction of the abstract of judgment into evidence,kwong filed a motion to reopen the pleadings and terminate the removal order,followed by a renewed motion to the same effect.in these motions,kwong stated that his original concession of removability was based on the fact that,at that time,his conviction was sufficient to qualify as an aggravated felony under a g.he sought to reopen because this court had subsequently decided ye ins,cir,which held that a conviction for vehicle burglary under california penal code was not an aggravated felony under ina section a g.the ij evidently interpreted kwong motion as submitting,among other positions,that kwong had not been convicted of burglary.the ij addressed and decided that issue on the merits.because the bia adopted the ij reasoning and affirmed for for the reasons stated therein,the ij discussion of the issue is sufficient,in and of itself,to overcome the exhaustion challenge.see abebe,at.
we also reject the government argument that kwong failed to challenge the ij exclusive reliance on the abstract of judgment.while kwong is required to raise every issue in the administrative proceedings,this court retains jurisdiction where the issue in question has been argued in a slightly different manner below.cruz navarro ins,cir.that is the case here,for kwong generally challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the ij finding as to the conviction 
first degree burglary under california penal code as a crime of violence 
under a f,the term aggravated felony includes a crime of violence as defined in section of title.section of title,in turn,provides in its residual clause that crime of violence means 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
the question for decision,then,is whether kwong offense by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of its commission.b.
we answered that question in the affirmative some time ago in united states becker,cir,where we held that burglary under california law is a crime of violence as defined by b.see also united states park,cir.we pointed out in becker that a ny time a burglar enters a dwelling with felonious or larcenous intent there is a risk that in the course of committing the crime he will encounter one of its lawful occupants,and use physical force against that occupant either to accomplish his illegal purpose or to escape apprehension.at footnote omitted.
in his briefing here,kwong argues that,rather than becker,our subsequent en banc decision in united states aguila montes de oca,cir en banc,controls and supports his argument that burglary under california penal code does not qualify as a crime of violence.he contends that the definition of burglary in is broader than the generic definition of burglary,and can not qualify as a crime of violence under either a categorical or modified categorical approach in his case.
these arguments are foreclosed,however,by our recent decision in lopez cardona holder,wl cir.lopez cardona flatly held that,under becker,burglary in violation of california penal code was a crime of violence within the meaning of b.id.at.it also held that aguila montes had no effect on that conclusion because aguila montes was based on a different definition of crime of violence aguila montes held only that a conviction under california penal code did not constitute a conviction for generic burglary.lopez cardona,wl at.aquila montes accordingly did not contradict or affect becker holding that burglary under is a crime of violence because it involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used in the course of committing the offense.id.at.
kwong attempts to avoid the reach of becker by contending that amendments to california penal code had the effect of sweeping within the definition of burglary some structures that are not inhabited,so that unlawful entry into them would not involve a substantial risk of the use of force.at the relevant time in becker,a provided
