this consolidated appeal addresses whether the length of an alien detention under the immigration and nationality act ina,et,entitled him to the writ of habeas corpus under and zadvydas davis,d.the appeal also addresses whether the district court abused its discretion by preliminarily enjoining an immigration judge ij to conduct a bond hearing for the alien,who at the time was in his month of detention and awaiting judicial review of an order denying his request to reopen his removal proceedings.we hold that the district court erred by granting the writ of habeas corpus because the alien detention was not indefinite,and that the preliminary injunction constituted an abuse of discretion because it was issued on the erroneous premise that the detention was governed by of the ina,rather than.we therefore reverse the grant of habeas relief,and vacate and remand with respect to the preliminary injunction.
factual and procedural background 
amadou lamine diouf was admitted to the united states in on an student visa.the visa expired in june.in december,diouf was found in possession of less than grams of marijuana and charged with a misdemeanor under revised code of washington e.diouf pleaded guilty the following month.
the government initiated removal proceedings against diouf in january,alleging that he was removable because he had remained in the united states after the expiration of his student visa in violation of a b,failed to maintain status in violation of a c i,and committed a offense in violation of a b i.the ij determined that diouf was subject to removal due to these charges.however,at diouf request,the ij ordered in lieu of removal that diouf voluntarily depart from the united states by june.the ij further ordered that diouf would be removed to senegal if he did not depart voluntarily by the specified date.diouf waived appeal and posted bond on march.
following his release,diouf retained counsel to reopen the removal proceedings and adjust his status from nonimmigrant alien to lawful permanent resident on the basis of his planned marriage to marie campbell a united states citizen to whom diouf had become engaged in.diouf and campbell married on june.the deadline for diouf voluntary departure passed one week later.on june,campbell filed an petition in light of their recent marriage.although counsel also prepared a motion to reopen the removal proceedings and a request for an extension of the voluntary departure period,he did not file those documents at that time.
upon learning that diouf remained in the country after the june departure deadline,immigration and customs enforcement ice sent a notice requiring him to present himself for removal on september.diouf failed to report as instructed,so ice cancelled his bond,apprehended him at his home on march,and detained him pending execution of the removal order.ice made arrangements for diouf to depart for senegal on may,but,after diouf refused to leave on that date,continued to detain him.ice warned diouf on july,that he would be fined or imprisoned for up to four years under a if he continued to refuse to depart.
diouf subsequently undertook a series of legal maneuvers to prevent his removal.on may,he filed a motion to reopen the case before the ij in light of his pending petition.on june,the ij denied the motion as untimely.diouf did not appeal.
after obtaining new counsel,diouf filed a second motion to reopen in september,this time arguing that his first attorney had provided ineffective assistance by failing to timely file a motion to reopen after the marriage,failing to seek an extension of the voluntary departure date,and failing to appeal the grant of voluntary departure.the ij denied the motion on september,because it was not accompanied by a certificate of service.
diouf refiled the second motion to reopen on december.the ij denied the motion on the grounds that it was untimely and that diouf was ineligible for a status adjustment.diouf requested a stay of removal pending appeal,but the board of immigration appeals bia denied that request on may.
two months later,the bia affirmed the ij,holding that the motions to reopen were untimely and that the ineffective assistance claims lacked merit.with regard to the first claim,the bia found that diouf original counsel could not have timely filed a motion to reopen in connection with the application for adjustment of status because the filing deadline occurred approximately three weeks before diouf married campbell,and the marriage was the only asserted justification for the adjustment.the bia then found that the attorney failure to request an extension of the voluntary departure deadline was harmless because the ij had already granted diouf the maximum period allowed for voluntary departure.the bia also found that the attorney decision not to appeal the grant of voluntary departure was reasonable because diouf had expressly waived the appeal.
on may,diouf filed a pro se appeal of the ij original voluntary departure order.on june,the bia dismissed the appeal as untimely.
while seeking relief before the ij and bia,diouf also filed a series of petitions with this court.on june,he filed a pro se petition for review and a motion to stay his removal pursuant to general order c.see dkt.we granted a temporary stay and on june,ordered diouf to submit a copy of the bia order that he sought to challenge.diouf subsequently filed a petition to proceed in forma pauperis and obtain counsel,but failed to provide a copy of a reviewable bia order.we therefore dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction on august,issuing the mandate on august,and lifting the temporary stay.
on august,diouf filed a second pro se petition for review and another motion for a stay of removal.see dkt.we again entered a temporary stay and on september,ordered diouf to pay a filing fee and provide either a correct alien identification number or a copy of the bia order he sought to challenge.diouf did not comply with this order,so we issued another order on november,directing him either to comply with the requirements of the september order or show cause why the petition should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.diouf filed a response on december.on january,we found that the petition was not a timely challenge to a final order of removal,and dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.we subsequently granted a request from diouf for an extension of time to file a motion to reconsider,but diouf ultimately did not file the motion.the mandate issued on may,and the stay lifted.diouf filed a motion to reopen on may,but we construed the motion as one for reconsideration and denied it as untimely on may.
diouf filed a third pro se petition for review and motion for stay of removal on february.see dkt.we entered another temporary stay on march,and again directed diouf to pay the filing fee and provide either a correct alien identification number or a copy of the bia order he sought to challenge.diouf did not respond.on april,we dismissed the petition for failure to prosecute,and the stay lifted.
diouf filed a fourth pro se petition for review and request for a stay of removal eight days later.see dkt.we again entered a temporary stay and ordered diouf to provide his alien identification number and a copy of the bia order he sought to challenge.diouf complied with this order on may,clarifying that his petition challenged the bia july denial of his motions to reopen.we granted the motion for a stay of removal on july,and appointed pro bono counsel to represent diouf on january.the case remains pending before another panel of this court.
diouf filed a fifth and final pro se petition on august,again seeking review of the bia july denial of the motions to reopen.see dkt.this petition was consolidated with diouf fourth petition on october,and remains pending before the other panel.see id.
diouf remained in detention while he pursued relief before the ij,bia,and this court.to determine whether the detention remained justified,ice conducted a custody review pursuant to on july,ice determined that diouf should remain in custody pending removal because his criminal history and lack of family support suggest he might flee if released.the detention therefore continued.
on november,diouf filed a petition for the writ of habeas corpus in the district court.he requested that the court enter a preliminary injunction for immediate release on the grounds that his lengthy detention violates a of the ina,a,and the due process clause of the fifth amendment.as an alternative to immediate release,diouf requested a preliminary injunction ordering the ij to hold a hearing at which the government would have the burden of justifying the detention.
the district court entered the following preliminary injunction on january,
petitioner must be within thirty days afforded an individual hearing before an immigration judge concerning whether his prolonged detention is justified.at the hearing,the immigration judge shall order petitioner released on reasonable conditions unless the government shows by clear and convincing evidence that petitioner presents a sufficient danger or risk of flight to justify his detention in light of how long he has been detained already and the likelihood of his case being finally resolved in favor of the government in the reasonably foreseeable future.
pursuant to the injunction,the ij conducted a hearing on february,to determine whether diouf prolonged detention remained justified.the ij held,after receiving evidence from both sides,that diouf did not present a sufficient danger to the community or risk of flight to justify the detention,which by then had extended over months.the ij accordingly released diouf on bond the same day.the government appeals the district court preliminary injunction.
while the government appeal of the preliminary injunction was pending before this panel,a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation concerning diouf petition for habeas corpus under.the magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant the petition because the length of diouf detention violates a.the district court adopted this recommendation on february,granted the petition,and ordered diouf released on the conditions previously imposed by the ij.the government also appeals this decision.we consolidated this appeal with the government earlier appeal of the preliminary injunction,and now address them both.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over the appeal of the preliminary injunction pursuant to a,and over the appeal of the grant of the writ of habeas corpus pursuant to a.the entry of the preliminary injunction is reviewed for an abuse of discretion,earth island inst.forest,cir,and the grant of habeas relief is reviewed de novo,bowen hood,cir.
discussion 
the first step in evaluating the government appeals is to determine whether diouf was detained under or of the ina,and,at the time the district court entered the preliminary injunction and granted habeas relief.as we recently explained in clark,cir,these statutes apply at different stages of an alien detention.section a provides the attorney general with discretionary authority to release aliens on bond or conditional parole prior to the removal period.see id.at.section a,by contrast,mandates detention during the removal period established in a.id.at.lastly,a provides the attorney general with discretionary authority to detain certain classes of aliens beyond the removal period,or to release them subject to the terms of supervision in a.see also zadvydas davis,d describing these differences dep t of homeland,cir same.
the government argues that the district court abused its discretion by entering the preliminary injunction and granting habeas relief on the erroneous premise that diouf was at the time being detained prior to the removal period and,thus,under a.specifically,the government contends that diouf was being detained under a because diouf order of removal became administratively final on june,when he failed to depart within the voluntary departure period,the administrative finalization of the order of removal initiated the removal period of a a,and diouf filing of multiple unsuccessful petitions for review with this court extended the removal period pursuant to a c to mandate the entire portion of the detention that followed the first days.diouf argues in response that he was being detained prior to the removal period,and thus under,because he had a petition for review pending before this court and a judicial stay of removal in place when the district court granted injunctive and habeas relief.he claims that did not apply because a b ii dictates that his removal period begins only once this court enters a final order on his pending petitions for event that has not yet occurred.for the reasons set forth below,we hold that diouf was being detained under a when the district court granted the writ of habeas corpus,and when it entered the preliminary injunction.
we begin by noting that diouf order of removal is administratively final.because the ij issued an alternate order of removal in connection with the grant of voluntary departure,and diouf did not timely appeal to the bia,diouf order of removal became administratively final upon overstay of the voluntary departure period.f.diouf voluntary departure period ended on june.thus,the order of removal became administratively final on june,the first day of his overstay.
we further conclude that diouf detention was authorized under,rather than.section a b provides that the removal period begins on the latest of the following 
i the date the order of removal becomes administratively final.
ii if the removal order is judicially reviewed and if a court orders a stay of the removal of the alien,the date of the court final order.
iii if the alien is detained or confined except under an immigration process,the date the alien is released from detention or confinement.
diouf removal period thus began on june,date his removal order became administratively a b ii or iii dictate a later date.see a b i.we hold that neither of them does.section a b ii is inapplicable because,although diouf appeals to this court resulted in several stays of removal,those appeals did not entail judicial review of a removal order,as the plain text of the statute requires.diouf never identified the order he sought to challenge in his first three appeals,and the fourth and fifth appeals challenged only the bia july denial of his motions to reopen.diouf does not contend that a b iii applies.accordingly,diouf removal period began on june,pursuant to a b i.
our recent decisions in and support this conclusion.in,the petitioner had obtained a stay of removal from this court in an appeal that both remained pending and challenged the bia affirmance of his removal order.at.we held in part that the petitioner was detained under a,rather than,because a b ii dictated that the removal period had not commenced.see id.at.however,we made clear that the statutory basis for the petitioner detention would have been different if the pending petition for review had not challenged an administratively final order of removal,explaining that the beginning of the removal period is not delayed by every judicially entered stay,id.at emphasis in original,and that the entry of a stay of removal for any reason other than review of a removal order for example,a stay entered while a court reviews an alien habeas petition or petition for review of the bia denial of a motion to not prevent the removal period from beginning,id.emphasis added.followed this construction of a b ii.see at holding that the petitioner was detained under rather than at the time he filed his habeas petition because he had obtained a stay of removal and was awaiting judicial review of his petition for review of a final order of removal.
having determined that diouf removal period began on june,we now locate within a the specific basis for diouf detention on january,the date of the preliminary injunction,and on february,the date of the grant of habeas relief.
unsurprisingly,the rather lengthy procedural history of this case does not present a straightforward application of a.the standard removal period should have ended on september,days after diouf order of removal became fin
