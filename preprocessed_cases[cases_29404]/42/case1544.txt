the board of immigration appeals bia denied the application of marina del carmen hernandez,a native and citizen of el salvador,for cancellation of removal under b because hernandez had committed a crime involving moral turpitude a offense that rendered her ineligible for such relief.see b c prohibiting the attorney general from canceling the removal of an alien who has been convicted of an offense under section a,a,or a id.a a i listing as an offense a crime involving moral turpitude for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed.hernandez argued that the in b c to a did not apply to her because a makes deportable only persons in and admitted to the united states,and hernandez had never been lawfully admitted.rather,she maintained that only the to a applied and that that section rendered her prior crime irrelevant because it contained a exception.the bia rejected this argument,relying on its precedential decision in matter of cortez canales,which read b c to only the offenses listed in the three sections,not the substantive operation of those offenses.thus,even though the substantive operation of a did not apply to hernandez,the offense listed in a did apply,and that provision contains no exception.
we conclude that the bia reading of b c is the most logical reading and therefore is,at least,a permissible interpretation of the statute,entitling the bia decision to chevron deference.thus,we affirm the bia and deny hernandez petition for review.
hernandez entered the united states sometime in without lawful admission or parole after inspection and has,since then,lived continuously in virginia with her four children,who are citizens.in,hernandez was granted temporary protected status,which affords eligible aliens protection from removal to certain countries upon the attorney general determination that conditions in those countries would prevent their safe return.see.
in january,hernandez was convicted of petit larceny under ann.and was sentenced to days confinement in jail.after she failed to respond to a request for documentation regarding her criminal record,citizenship and immigration services terminated her application to renew her temporary protected status.
in march,the department of homeland security commenced removal proceedings against hernandez,charging her with being present in the united states without being admitted or paroled,in violation of a a i.when she appeared before an immigration judge in march,she conceded removability but filed an application for cancellation of removal under b,alleging that her children would suffer hardship if she were not permitted to remain in the united states.the immigration judge pretermitted her application,holding that her conviction rendered her ineligible for the relief she requested,and ordered that she be removed to el salvador.
the bia dismissed hernandez appeal.noting that hernandez had conceded that petit larceny a class misdemeanor under ann,punishable by confinement in jail for not more than months,id.is a crime involving moral turpitude,the bia held that hernandez was ineligible for cancellation of removal under b c because she had been convicted of an offense under section a specifically,a crime involving moral turpitude for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed,a a i.the bia rejected her argument that the exception to a,a section that is also in b c,preserved her eligibility for cancellation of removal,holding that the exception had no applicability to offenses described in a.the bia also rejected hernandez argument that the offenses in a and a applied only to aliens who,unlike hernandez,had been admitted to the united states,while the offenses in a applied only to aliens who had not been admitted.to do so,it relied on its prior decision in cortez canales,which rejected the distinction that hernandez was trying to make.
from the bia decision,hernandez filed this petition for review.
in her petition,hernandez contends that even though she committed a crime involving moral turpitude for which a sentence of one year could have been imposed,she nonetheless remains eligible for cancellation of removal under b because her offense was excepted by the exception contained in a.in response to the government position that a,which contains no exception,also applies,hernandez contends that b c to a pertains only to aliens who,unlike her,were admitted and are now deportable.she argues further that even if b c generally the offenses in a regardless of an alien admission status,a a i does not apply to unadmitted aliens because that section only makes an alien deportable upon conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude that was committed within five years after the date of admission.emphasis added.thus,hernandez argues that only offenses under a apply to her and that a exception preserves her eligibility for cancellation of removal.
the government contends that because b c,by its plain terms,applies both to aliens previously admitted and now deportable and to aliens never admitted and now subject to removal,the provision disqualifies from eligibility for cancellation of removal the entire class of aliens who have committed any offense listed in any of the three sections in b c.it argues that b c does not the substantive operation of those sections,but only the offenses described within them,pointing to the specific language of b c that allows the cancellation of removal for admitted and unadmitted aliens only if the alien has not been convicted of an offense under the three sections.to support its conclusion,the government relies on the bia precedential decision in cortez canales,which so held.
because the bia decision and the decision in cortez canales involve statutory interpretation,we review the issue de novo.but in doing so,we give the bia chevron deference so long as its decision is a precedential decision issued by a panel.see martinez holder,cir.while the bia decision in this case was issued by a single bia member,the bia relied on cortez canales,which was decided by a panel,thus entitling it to chevron deference.see,e,escobar holder,cir efagene holder,cir marmolejo campos.holder,cir.thus,cortez canales controls to the extent that congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue and the bia answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,natural res.def.council.
to begin with,we recognize that the immigration and nationality act,often makes the distinction between an alien who has never been admitted to the united states and an alien who has been admitted but who has subsequently become deportable.both inadmissible and deportable aliens,however,are removable,albeit sometimes for different grounds.see judulang holder.compare a cataloging the grounds that render an alien ineligible to be admitted to the united states emphasis added,with a listing the grounds for deportation of an alien in and admitted to the united states.moreover,both inadmissible and deportable aliens can apply for discretionary cancellation of removal under b.and when they do,the specific criteria that they must satisfy are the same regardless of whether they are inadmissible or deportable.see id.b providing that the attorney general may cancel removal of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable,so long as the alien satisfies the specified criteria.thus,regardless of whether hernandez is inadmissible or deportable,she is eligible for cancellation of removal if she has not been convicted of an offense under section a,a,or a.id.b c.
section a provides that an alien is ineligible to be admitted to the united states if he has been convicted of certain listed crimes,including a crime involving moral turpitude.but the crime involving moral turpitude listed under this section is subject to a exception,which provides that a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude does not render an alien inadmissible if the alien has been convicted of a single crime the maximum penalty for the crime committed does not exceed imprisonment for one year and the alien is not sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of months.a a ii ii.section a provides that an alie
