robert garcia,a native and citizen of mexico,appeals the sentence imposed by the district court following his guilty plea to one count of being an illegal alien found in the united states after deportation,in violation of a and b.garcia argues that the district court committed two errors when it calculated his criminal history category under the united states sentencing guidelines adding two criminal history points under d,which requires additional points if the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence,including parole and adding one criminal history point under e,which requires additional points if the defendant committed the instant offense less than two years after release from imprisonment on a sentence counted under a.we hold that the district court correctly added two points under d and one point under e and therefore affirm garcia sentence.
the dates and order of the events leading up to garcia instant offense are important to both issues on appeal,and they are undisputed.on december,garcia was convicted in los angeles county superior court of robbery,in violation of california penal code.he was sentenced to three years imprisonment.
garcia was first admitted into the california department of corrections cdc on january.he was paroled on june.that same day,garcia was deported for the first time.on december,having returned to the united states at some point,he was sent back to the cdc again for violation of his parole.he was then paroled a second time on june,and then deported a second time that same day.he again returned to the united states at some point.on december,garcia was arrested by the los angeles police department lapd for residential burglary,in violation of california penal code,and a case was filed against him in los angeles county superior court.on april,he was again returned to the cdc for violation of his parole,and was then paroled a third time on august.on august,garcia was arraigned on the residential burglary charge and remanded to custody.on august,the residential burglary charge against garcia was dismissed because the prosecution was unable to proceed.
on november,garcia began working at a community service program called homeboy industries.on january,garcia was arrested by the lapd for residential burglary under california penal code,for which no court filing has been completed.on january,garcia first term of employment at homeboy industries ended.on june,garcia was returned to the cdc for a third violation of his parole relating to the original robbery charge,and then discharged a fourth time on june,because the statutory maximum on that charge had been reached.garcia was employed by homeboy industries a second time from june,until september.this brings us to the instant offense.on april,garcia was in the custody of the lapd which then notified the immigration and customs enforcement ice of garcia arrest.on april,garcia was transferred to ice custody.on may,the government filed an information charging garcia with having been an illegal alien found in the united states following deportation,in violation of a and b.the indictment also alleged that at least one of garcia deportations occurred subsequent to garcia conviction for an aggravated felony,namely the robbery conviction in.
garcia pleaded guilty to the charge in the information pursuant to a binding plea agreement with the government.this agreement contained a stipulation by the parties that the district court should impose a sentence equal to the low end of the applicable sentencing guidelines range determined by a total offense level of seventeen agreed to by the parties and the criminal history category calculated by the court in accordance with chapter of the sentencing guidelines.
pursuant to this agreement,the united states probation office uspo submitted a presentence investigation report psr addressing only garcia criminal history.the original psr determined that garcia fell within criminal history category iii based on five criminal history points however,in response to the government position paper regarding sentencing,the uspo submitted a modified presentence investigation report mpsr and addendum determining that garcia fell within criminal history category iv based on seven criminal history points.
for the purposes of this appeal,the main difference between the two reports is that the uspo accepted the government position that garcia committed the instant illegal reentry offense on april,less than two years after release from imprisonment on june,on a sentence counted under a,his sentence for the robbery conviction,e,and thus the mpsr added two criminal history points under e.however,the uspo declined to add two additional criminal history points under d,which applies if the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence,including parole.contrary to the government position,the uspo used april,the date garcia had been last arrested by the lapd and a day on which he was not on parole,as the date on which jimenez first committed this continuing illegal reentry offense.the uspo found that the government had not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that garcia first committed the continuing illegal reentry offense on april,a day on which he was on parole,because although garcia was not deported after that date,garcia could have returned to mexico and later reentered the united states during one of the periods in which he was not incarcerated.
both the government and garcia objected to the mpsr in memoranda filed with the district court.the government argued that the evidence supported a finding that garcia had been in the united states unlawfully since at least april,and that therefore an addition of two points under d was appropriate.garcia did not dispute the facts in the mpsr,but argued that the mpsr incorrectly added two points under e because garcia imprisonments following his parole violations should not be used to determine when garcia was release d from imprisonment on a sentence counted under a.
at garcia sentencing hearing on june,the district court stated 
in this matter the court makes some findings first of all,as to d counsel,you right,it is by a preponderance of the evidence,and the only evidence we have is,there nothing to show that he left during that period of time and if we going by a standard other than the preponderance of the evidence,i think defense counsel would have a much stronger argument but if i had to weigh whether or not he did or did not go back outside of the country for any period of time,based on everything i had here,i would say that it would be towards he did.
accordingly,the district court added two criminal history points under d on the ground that garcia first committed the instant offense while on parole.the court also held that.e applied because the two years between garcia release from imprisonment and the time he committed the instant offense r a n from the point when his sentence wa s completed,and that is after the violation of the parole.accordingly,the court added an additional criminal history point under e for a total of eight criminal history points,placing garcia within criminal history category iv.based on that criminal history category and the parties stipulated offense level of seventeen,the district court sentenced garcia to months imprisonment the low end of the guidelines range followed by three years supervised release.garcia timely appealed both the d and the e determinations to this court.
we review the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo,see united states,cir,and its findings of fact for clear error,see united states howard,cir.garcia argues that the district court erred in adding two criminal history points under d and in adding one criminal history point under e.we address each of these arguments in turn.
d provides add points if the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence,including probation,parole,supervised release,imprisonment,work release,or escape status.emphases added.there is no question that garcia was under a criminal justice sentence parole on april,the day on which he violated his parole a second time and was returned to the cdc for the third time.and there is no question that garcia was not on parole and therefore not under a criminal justice sentence on april,the day of his most recent arrest by the lapd.thus,our task is to determine on which of these two dates garcia committed the instant offense if april,then d applies if april,it does not apply.this inquiry implicates the unique nature of garcia instant offense.
the instant offense is garcia conviction under a federal statute punishing a previously deported alien who is at any time found in the united states without the permission of the attorney general.a.we repeatedly have held that the crime of being found in the united states after deportation is a continuing offense which continues so long as the alien remains in the country.that is,the offense commences with the illegal entry,but is not completed until discovery,at emphasis added quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,if garcia has been continuously in the country since april,then he committed the instant offense on that date,and thus committed this offense while under any criminal justice sentence,including parole.d.
in the district court,the government bore the burden of proving garcia continuous presence in the united states since april,by a preponderance of the evidence.see howard,at.the district court found that garcia had been continuously present in the country since that date.in reviewing this finding,we must first determine the appropriate standard of review.a district court findings will be affirmed absent clear error when the inquiry is essentially factual.see united states hinkson,cir en banc.by contrast,if resolution of an issue requires us to exercise judgment about the values that animate legal principles,the question is one of law and should be reviewed de novo.id.accordingly,if garcia were challenging the district court continuous presence finding on the grounds that it applied a legally incorrect definition of continuous,we would review the issue de novo.here,however,the district court determination rested entirely on the factual question of whether garcia ever physically left the united states to return to mexico.accordingly,we review this determination under the clear error standard.see howard,at.
we hold that the district court did not clearly err in finding that the government had proven garcia continuous presence by a preponderance of the evidence.first,the government submitted evidence accounting for garcia presence in the united states for a large portion of time between his return to the cdc on april,and his most recent arrest by the lapd on april.garcia was in the cdc,and therefore certainly in the country,between april,and august,the date on which garcia was paroled for a third time.only ten days later,on august,he was arraigned on his first residential burglary charge and remanded to custody.soon after that and thus soon after his release from custody,on november,garcia began working at homeboy industries,where he remained until at least january,when he finished his first term of employment.meanwhile,on january,he was arrested by the lapd for burglary for the second time.he was recommitted to the cdc on june,for violation of his parole and,two days after his discharge on june,was again employed by homeboy industries until september.he was then arrested by the lapd on april.
the government also submitted evidence to the district court that garcia had no reason to leave the united states.garcia had lived in the united states since he was five years old,had children who were united states citizens,had a fiancé who lived in the united states,and had come back to the united states both times after he was deported.moreover,because traveling to mexico and returning would have subjected garcia to the risk of being detected,the government argued that it wa s illogical to assume that defendant would voluntarily leave the county while residing here illegally.id.
garcia responds that the government evidence failed to prove that garcia did not leave the country on the dates between his contacts with law enforcement,and that the government can not meet its burden by showing that was in the united states on specific dates after april.he argues that such a line of reasoning amounts to mere speculation and conjecture.he also notes the frequency with which individuals cross the border to mexico and back undetected.
it is true that the government evidence does not account for garcia presence in the united states at every moment since april,and it is indeed conceivable that garcia could have returned to mexico at some point in between the dates of his contacts with law enforcement.however,the government did not need to prove with absolute certainty that garcia had been in the country continuously since april,the government burden was only to demonstrate continuous presence by a preponderance of the evidence.by accounting for garcia presence in the country for a major portion of the time since his return to the cdc on april,by demonstrating that garcia had no reason to leave the united states during that time,and by showing that it would have been illogical for garcia to leave the united states,the government satisfied its burden,particularly since garcia offered no evidence at all to counter the government evidence other than general findings regarding mexican aliens frequently crossing the border.at the very least,the district court finding was not clearly erroneous.
in sum,the district court did not clearly err in finding that garcia had been continuously in the united states from april,until his most recent arrest on april.and because the offense of being found in the united states after deportation continues so long as the alien remains in the country,at,garcia committed the instant offense on april,a date on which he was under any criminal justice sentence,including parole,d.thus,the district court correctly added two criminal history points under d.
e provides 
add points if the defendant committed the instant offense less than two years after release from imprisonment on a sentence counted under a or b or while in imprisonment or escape status on such sentence.if points are added for d,add only point for this item.
emphasis added.section a,in turn,provides add points for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month.
in,garcia was convicted of robbery and sentenced to three years imprisonment.this is indisputably a sentence counted under a.e.and,as discussed above,garcia committed the instant offense on april.id.thus,our task is to determine whether april,is less than two years after garcia release from imprisonment on his robbery sentence,which requires us to determine when exactly garcia was release d from imprisonment on this sentence for the purposes of e.
as discussed above,garcia was first admitted into the cdc for his robbery sentence on january,and first paroled on june.garcia was returned to the cdc for violation of his parole on december,released on parole again on june,returned to the cdc again for violation of parole on april,released on parole a third time on august,returned to the cdc for violation of parole on june,and then discharged a final time on june,because the statutory maximum had been reached.
garcia argues that his imprisonments following his parole violations should not be used to determine when garcia was release d from imprisonment on his robbery sentence,and that therefore garcia was release d from imprisonment on this sentence on june,the date of his first parole release.this date is more than two years before garcia committed the instant offense on april,and thus acceptance of garcia argument would mean that the district court erred in adding a criminal history point under e.the government argues,and the district court held,that garcia imprisonments following his parole violations count for the purposes of determining when garcia was release d from imprisonment on his robbery sentence.accepting this argument would mean that garcia committed the instant offense less than two years after release from imprisonment on this sentence,because april,is less than two years after june,the date of garcia second release on parole we review this legal issue de novo,see,at,and,for the reasons that follow,we hold that imprisonment following parole violations counts for the purposes of determining the date of a defendant release from imprisonment under e.
section e itself does not make clear how the timing of a defendant release from imprisonment is determined.however,a neighboring provision,k a,answers this question.section k a provides revocation of probation,parole,supervised release,special parole,or mandatory release may affect the points for e in respect to the recency of last release from confinement.emphases added.section k a is hardly a model of clarity,but we see no possible way that revocation of parole could affect the points for e other than by changing the date of the defendant release from imprisonment under that provision.thus,this provision demonstrates that,if a defendant is imprisoned for violating his parole relating to a prior sentence counted under a,he is release d from imprisonment on that sentence on the date that he is last release d from confinement for the parole violation.
garcia has three responses.first,he points out that e applies if the instant offense was committed less than two years after release from imprisonment on a sentence counted under a.emphasis added.a sentence count s under a if it exceed s one year and one month.a.since garcia robbery conviction resulted in a sentence,his subsequent parole violations did not affect whether his sentence counted under a.thus,he argues,his imprisonments resulting from his parole violations were not imprisonment s on a sentence counted under a,and therefore his releases from these imprisonments were not release s from imprisonment s on a sentence counted under a.
garcia argument misses the point.the question is not whether garcia imprisonments for his parole violations in themselves counted under a.the question is whether,for the purposes of e,these imprisonments are part of the original sentence counted under a his sentence for that his releases from these imprisonments are release s from imprisonment on a sentence counted under a.e emphasis added.and on this point,once again,k a states that r evocation of parole may affect the points for e in respect to the recency of last release from confinement.this provision demonstrates that garcia parole violation imprisonments qualify as imprisonment s on a sentence counted under a because the guidelines consider these imprisonments part of the original sentence for purposes of e 
second,garcia relies on a,which states the term prior sentence means any sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt,whether by guilty plea,trial,or plea of nolo contendere,for conduct not part of the instant offense.emphasis added.garcia correctly points out that a california parole violation sentence is not imposed upon adjudication of guilt.see in re eddie,cal r evocation proceedings,in and of themselves,do not concern guilt of any criminal charges parole violation proceedings are not part of any criminal prosecution.in other words,revocation involves no criminal guilt quotation marks and citation omitted.thus,he argues that parole violation sentences are not part of the original sentence under e.
garcia second response suffers from a similar flaw to his first.the question is not whether garcia imprisonments for violation of parole are in themselves prior sentence s under a it is clear that they are not.see id.but it is also clear that his original sentence is a prior sentence,and that this original sentence is a sentence counted under a for the purposes of e.the relevant question is the date of garcia release from imprisonment on that original sentence counted under a.and once again,the only provision addressing how that date of release is to be determined is k a,which suggests that a sentence following revocation of parole is part of the original sentence for the purposes of determining the defendant release date under e.
finally,garcia argues that e is at least ambiguous enough that we should invoke the rule of lenity in his favor.see united states,cir doubts about the correct interpretation of the sentencing guidelines should be resolved according to the rule of lenity.united states martinez,cir noting that the rule of lenity requires that we infer the rationale most favorable to the defendant and construe the guidelines accordingly.
however,the supreme court has held that t he simple existence of some ambiguity is not sufficient to warrant application of the rule of lenity.muscarello united states.rather,t o invoke the rule,we must conclude that there is a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the guidelines,to the point that,after seizing everything from which aid can be derived,we can make no more than a guess as to what the sentencing commission intended.id.at emphases added quotation marks omitted omission in original.we believe that the guidelines speak in clear enough terms that garcia case is not a situation of grievous ambiguity.see k a revocation of parole may affect the points for e in respect to the recency of last release from confinement.
in sum,garcia imprisonments for his parole violations count for the purposes of determining when he was release d from imprisonment on his robbery sentence.thus,garcia was release d from imprisonment on that sentence on june,less than two years before april,the date he committed the instant offense.accordingly,we conclude that garcia committed the instant offense less than two years after release from imprisonment on a sentence counted under a,and hold that the district court correctly added one criminal history point under e.
because the district court correctly added two criminal history points under d and one criminal history point under e,we affirm garcia sentence.
homeboy industries is a program intended to assist youths and gang members through a variety of services,including counseling,tutoring,employment,and free tattoo removal.wikipedia,homeboy industries,available at.industries last visited june.
the presentence investigation report psr does not indicate precisely why garcia was in the lapd custody.
the basis for these five points is not relevant to this appeal.
the offense of being found in the united states after deportation,a,is a continuing offense which continues so long as the alien remains in the country.that is,the offense commences with the illegal entry,but is not completed until discovery.united states,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.
the district court mistakenly referred to e during its discussion of d,and mistakenly referred to d during its discussion of e.the district court mistakenly referred to e during its discussion of d,and mistakenly referred to d during its discussion of e.
the guidelines provide that if two points are added under.d,only one point rather than two is added under.e.see e.
because of the continuing nature of garcia instant offense,garcia also committed the instant offense on april,the date of his most recent arrest by the lapd.this date is less than two years after june,the date of garcia final discharge from prison on the robbery conviction.thus,regardless of whether we consider garcia to have committed the instant offense on april,or on april,accepting the government interpretation of e would mean that garcia committed the instant offense less than two years after release from imprisonment on his robbery sentence.
this conclusion is bolstered by k,which provides in the case of a prior revocation of parole,add the original term of imprisonment to any term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation.the resulting total is used to compute the criminal history points for a,b,or c,as applicable.although this provision affects only the length of a prior sentence under a,b,and c,rather than the recency of the defendant release from imprisonment under e,it provides further support for our conclusion that parole violation imprisonments are considered part of the original sentence for the purposes of.
