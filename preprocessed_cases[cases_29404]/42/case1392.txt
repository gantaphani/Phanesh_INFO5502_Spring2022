ellyana and yulius sukwanputra petition for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia which adopted and affirmed an immigration judge ij decision denying the application for asylum and withholding of removal pursuant to the immigration and nationality act ina,and protection under the convention against torture cat.for the reasons stated below,we will grant the petition,vacate the order of the bia,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
ellyana sukwanputra and her husband,yulius sukwanputra are natives and citizens of indonesia.petitioner claims persecution in indonesia on account of her chinese ethnicity and catholic religion.in support,she relates numerous incidents of persecution spanning a twenty year period from her childhood until the late.three of the incidents are relevant to our decision,which we discuss below.
first,petitioner alleges that in,in her hometown of malang,a mob of native indonesians burned down her father store as part of widespread attacks on stores.petitioner,who was a child at the time,allegedly remembers hearing rioters say,burn it down,this belong to chinese despite the widespread destruction and looting,the police and army in indonesia allegedly did nothing to stop the attacks.
petitioner claims that similar governmental inaction led to the prolongation of riots in unjung pandang in september.prompted by the prospect of marriage,petitioner alleges that she and her husband traveled to the island of sulawesi,unjung pandang,so that she could meet his parents who lived there.petitioner laments that during their visit,a group of native indonesians allegedly burned down her husband family restaurant.petitioner allegedly recalls hearing the rioters yell,burn and kill the chinese after escaping the restaurant,petitioner and her husband stayed at the local police station for two days until the riots ended.
third,petitioner cites to the massive riots that plagued jakarta in may.petitioner asserts that following her graduation from college,she was living in jakarta looking for employment when massive riots broke out there.petitioner relates that during the riots many indonesian women were raped and killed.petitioner allegedly hid with friends inside a house,but could hear the voices of rioters on the streets and the sounds of them beating on the house.petitioner recalls that after the riots she fled to malang to stay with her parents.
on may,petitioners entered the united states on visitor visas.they were authorized to remain in the united states until november,and both overstayed their visas.on june,they were placed in removal proceedings.
on or about may,petitioner filed an application for asylum and withholding of removal under the ina,and protection under cat.the case was referred to immigration judge donald ferlise,who conducted a hearing on the merits.in addition to her own testimony,petitioner presented to the ij documentary evidence in support of her application.the ij admitted some of the documents into evidence,including petitioner written application,her sworn affidavits,and a country package which included the department of state report on human rights practices.however,the ij refused to give any weight to the following documents petitioners birth certificates,their marriage certificate,petitioner husband indonesia identification card,a death certificate for petitioner brother,and their child birth certificate.the ij reasoned that the documents were not certified as required under.
on october,the ij issued a decision denying the application for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection.the ij found that the asylum application was untimely and that petitioner had failed to establish changed circumstances materially affecting her eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay.the ij also found that petitioner had not demonstrated entitlement to withholding of removal or protection under cat.the ij premised his finding,in part,on the purported implausibility that petitioner was present at all of these three major events even though they were quite far apart in distance.decision at.as to these three critical events,the ij found petitioner testimony not to be credible.decision at.
on august,the bia entered its order affirming and adopting the ij decision.the bia rejected petitioner claim that the ij exhibited bias violating their due process rights.the bia concluded that while some of the ij statements were injudicious,there was insufficient evidence to show that the ij conduct prevented petitioner from fully presenting her evidence.
the bia jurisdiction arose under b.we have jurisdiction to review the bia final order of removal under a.
insofar as the bia adopted the findings of the ij,we must review the decision of the ij.abdulai ashcroft,cir when the bia defers to an ij,a reviewing court must,as a matter of logic,review the ij decision to assess whether the bia decision to defer was appropriate.as to matters which the bia issued its own opinion and did not summarily adopt the findings of the ij,we must review the decision of the bia.li attorney general,cir.
petitioners argue that statutory period of limitations for filing an asylum application provided in a violates the supremacy clause of the united states constitution and the due process clause,and that the judicial review bar provided in a,which precludes judicial review of determinations of the attorney general made under a,also violates the due process clause.we consider each of these arguments below,under a de novo review.abdulrahman ashcroft,cir.
citing to the supremacy clause,petitioners argue that the statutory period of limitations provided in a conflicts with article of united nations convention relating to the status of refugees convention.by acceding to the united nations protocol relating to the status of refugees protocol,the united states agreed to comply with the substantive provisions of the convention.ins,d ins stevic,d.however,article is not.see stevic,at.as such,article provides no enforceable rights beyond those granted by the ina.see id gonzales,cir.accordingly,the statutory period provided in a for filing an asylum application does not violate the supremacy clause 
petitioners claim that the statutory period of limitations provided in a violates the due process clause is also unavailing.although the fifth amendment entitles aliens to the the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner,dia ashcroft,cir quoting mathews eldridge,d,it d oes not violate due process for congress to impose a reasonable limitations period upon the filing of naturalization petitions.ins pangilinan,d.the state may erect reasonable procedural requirements for triggering the right to an adjudication,be they statutes of limitations a nd certainly accords due process when it terminates a claim for failure to comply with a reasonable procedural or evidentiary rule.logan zimmerman brush,d internal citations and quotations marks omitted emphasis in original.
the period of limitations for filing an asylum application under a b,which is tempered by the tolling provisions of a d,provides an asylum applicant an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.eldridge,at.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the period is not an unreasonable requirement for triggering the right to an adjudication,and,thus,an alien is not deprived of due process when his or her asylum claim is denied for failure to comply with the requirement.for these reasons,we conclude that the statutory limitations period provided in a does not violate the due process clause.
petitioners contention that the judicial review bar of a violates the due process clause likewise lacks merit.deportation is not a criminal proceeding and has never been held to be punishment,and thus n o judicial review is guaranteed by the constitution.carlson landon.rather,t he power to expel aliens,being essentially a power of the political branches of government,the legislative and executive,may be exercised entirely through executive officers,with such opportunity for judicial review of their action as congress may see fit to authorize or permit.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted emphasis added.as clearly indicated in a,congress did not authorize an opportunity for judicial review of determinations made by the executive branch regarding the timeliness of an asylum application.see tarrawally ashcroft,cir.because judicial review is not constitutionally guaranteed,the judicial review bar of a does not violate the due process clause.
failing their constitutional arguments,petitioners next challenge the ij determination that petitioner did not qualify for an exception to the filing deadline for asylum applications.pursuant to a b,an alien must file an asylum application within one year of the date of the alien arrival in the united states.a b.a application may be considered if the alien demonstrates either changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application a d.
petitioner entered the united states on may,but did not file her asylum application until may.the ij determined that the asylum application was untimely and that petitioner had failed to establish changed circumstances materially affecting her eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay,as required under a d to excuse a failure to meet the deadline.petitioners contend that the ij applied the wrong legal standard in making his determination under a d that petitioner had failed to demonstrate such changed or extraordinary circumstances.petitioners posit further that the record evidence reflects the existence of such changed or extraordinary circumstances so as to warrant the late filing.the government contends that pursuant to a,this court does not have jurisdiction to review the ij decision relating to the untimeliness of the asylum application.
the restriction on judicial review of determinations made by the attorney general regarding the timeliness of an asylum application is addressed in a.that provision states that n o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the attorney general under paragraph,a,which paragraph includes the provision relating to whether an asylum applicant has demonstrated the existence of changed or extraordinary circumstances,a d.in tarrawally,this court held that the language of a clearly deprives us of jurisdiction to review an ij determination that an asylum petition was not filed within the one year limitations period,and that such period was not tolled by extraordinary circumstances.at.
since our decision in tarrawally,congress enacted the real id act of real id act.the real id act authorizes judicial review of constitutional claims and questions of law,notwithstanding any other provision of the chapter which eliminates or limits judicial review.see real id act a a iii,adding a d nothing in subparagraph b or c,or in any other provision of this chapter other than this section which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed within an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.by virtue of a d,constitutional claims or questions of law raised in a petition for review elude the provisions of the ina.the effect of this provision is to restore to the court of appeals jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and questions of law.
despite the special treatment accorded constitutional claims and questions of law,a d does not exempt factual or discretionary challenges from the provisions of the ina.thus,a d does not prohibit a court of appeals from construing provisions which limit judicial review,such as a,as precluding review of factual or discretionary challenges.accordingly,we join our sister courts in concluding that despite the changes of the real id act,factual or discretionary determinations continue to fall outside the jurisdiction of the court of appeals entertaining a petition for review.accord ramadan gonzales,cir,cir vasile gonzales,cir.
mindful of these jurisdictional concerns,we now turn to the issues presented in this petition for review.here,petitioners first contend that the ij applied the wrong legal standard in making his determination under a d whether petitioner had established changed or extraordinary circumstances excusing her untimely application.petitioners posit that the ij should have applied a benefit of the doubt standard.as to this particular issue,we do not need to decide whether this issue raises a constitutional claim or question of law to which our jurisdiction extends under a d,since,as explained below,we find the argument to be wholly without merit.
in support of their argument for a benefit of the doubt standard,petitioners cite to the handbook on the procedures and criteria for determining refugee status,issued by the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr handbook.the unhcr handbook,in relevant part,describes the difficulty of proof inherent in an asylum seeker situation.unhcr handbook.to account for this difficulty,the handbook advises that if the applicant account appears credible,he should,unless there are good reasons to the contrary,be given the benefit of the doubt.unhcr handbook emphasis added.
petitioners reliance on the benefit of the doubt standard as set forth in the unhcr handbook is misguided for several reasons.first and foremost,the unhcr handbook is not binding on the ins or american courts.abdulai ashcroft,cir.second,the unhcr handbook sets forth procedures for determining refugee status,not for assessing the circumstances surrounding the late filing of an asylum application.third,even if the unhcr handbook were binding and relevant to the timeliness determination,the benefit of the doubt standard has no application to the facts of this case since the ij found that petitioner account was implausible and lacking in credibility.see unhcr handbook if the applicant account appears credible,he should,unless there are good reasons to the contrary,be given the benefit of the doubt.emphasis added.for these reasons,we conclude that petitioners claim that the ij applied the wrong legal standard does not raise a colorable claim of legal error as a consequence,we need not reach the jurisdictional issue of whether their claim falls within the judicial review provision of a d.
petitioners remaining argument is that the evidence in the record demonstrates changed circumstances materially affecting asylum eligibility or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay,as required under a d to excuse the late filing.we must first determine whether this contention raises a question of law to which our jurisdiction extends,a d or a factual or discretionary matter outside of our jurisdiction,a.
an untimely application for asylum may be considered only if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the attorney general that she qualifies for an exception to filing deadline.a d.this language requiring an asylum applicant to make a demonstration to the attorney general satisfaction implies that the attorney general determination entails an exercise of discretion.see vasile,at.petitioners claim that she met her burden of demonstrating changed circumstances materially affecting asylum eligibility or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay challenges that exercise of discretion.such a claim does not raise a constitutional claim or question of law covered by the real id act judicial review provision.we therefore agree with our sister courts that,despite the changes of the real id act,a continues to divest the court of appeals of jurisdiction to review a decision regarding whether an alien established changed or extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his untimely filing.ramadan,at,at vasile,at.therefore,we conclude that we do not have jurisdiction to review petitioners challenge.
petitioners also argue that the ij erroneously excluded evidence under,and that the evidence would have corroborated petitioner testimony.the authentication regulation of provides,in pertinen
