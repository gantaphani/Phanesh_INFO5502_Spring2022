after finding that an alien is eligible for asylum,may an immigration judge consider the alien three convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol in denying the application for asylum as a matter of discretion that is the principal question in this appeal,and because we conclude that an immigration judge may properly consider such convictions,we deny nikolai kouljinski petition for review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal.
background 
procedural history 
petitioner nikolai kouljinski kouljinski,now a russian jew,entered the united states in october and filed an application for asylum in november with the former immigration and naturalization service ins.joint appendix at request for asylum,application for asylum.in june,kouljinski learned that his wife had been involved in a serious car accident in russia,and he returned to russia after first receiving advance parole,which allowed him to reenter the united states and not abandon his application for asylum.at authorization for parole,hr g tr.at.he returned to the united states on august,and his wife and daughter followed him to the united states on december.
on august,the former ins initiated removal proceedings against kouljinski,alleging that,pursuant to a a i i,he was removable for entering the united states without valid documents.at notice to appear in immigration court.on november,at an initial master calendar hearing,the immigration judge ij,noting that kouljinski had originally applied for asylum in,scheduled a second hearing for february,at which time kouljinski was to submit an updated application for asylum.at transcript of master calendar hearing.kouljinski submitted an updated application for asylum at a brief hearing on february,at which he was represented by his current counsel.at application for asylum,transcript of hearing.kouljinski sought asylum,withholding of removal under the immigration and nationality act ina,and withholding of removal under the convention against torture cat.on august,an ij held a hearing at which kouljinski attorney,the department of homeland security attorney,and the ij discussed the parties evidentiary submissions in advance of the asylum hearing.at transcript of hearing.on november,the ij held a hearing on kouljinski asylum application.at transcript of hearing.at this hearing,kouljinski and his wife,alla kouljinski,testified regarding instances of harassment and intimidation that they experienced in russia and attributed to.
the ij rendered an oral decision at the conclusion of the hearing.at transcript of oral decision.the ij denied kouljinski applications for asylum,withholding of removal under the ina,and withholding of removal under the cat.the ij did so after first finding kouljinski eligible for conclu ded that kouljinski,in my view,has established a reasonable possibility of persecution,at the ij denied kouljinski asylum because he reached the conclusion that a favorable exercise of discretion in this case is unwarranted.at.in doing so,the ij decided that kouljinski eligibility for asylum was not a sufficiently weighty favorable discretionary factor to outweigh the fact that he has three convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol,noting that kouljinski most recent conviction was a felony offense.at.
kouljinski timely appealed to the bia,where he argued that the ij abused his discretion in denying asylum based on kouljinski convictions and his lack of family ties to the united states given that his wife and daughter are currently in the united states.kouljinski also challenged the ij findings as to past persecution and as to a likelihood of future persecution and torture,arguing that he had established the higher showing necessary to mandate withholding of removal under the ina and under the cat.
on june,the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision and dismissed the appeal.at.kouljinski filed a timely petition for review in this court of the bia decision.
b.the hearing 
at the hearing on november,kouljinski testified that he was born in leningrad,russia,in,that he is jewish,that he had been married to his wife for over twenty years,and that they have a daughter,then sixteen years old.kouljinski testified that his employment options in the former soviet union were limited because,as a jew,he could not be a member of the communist party.in,when he was working for a restaurant,kouljinski application for a managerial position was not approved by the district party committee,and he stated that the district party committee sen t documents to me suggesting that i need to quit.at hr g tr.at.as a result of that pressure,kouljinski quit to obtain another position he moved from leningrad to kronstadt,a city twenty kilometers from leningrad.kgb agents then demanded that he report to them while he was working in kronstadt.while he was working as a bartender in an establishment frequented by military personnel,the kgb arrested him and detained him overnight,demanding that he listen to conversations in the bar and pass along information to the kgb about anyone planning to leave the soviet union and seek asylum elsewhere.
after his father died in the late,kouljinski learned from some of his father papers how to manufacture jewelry that resembled fabergé products once it became legal to do so,he started his own business.soon thereafter,kouljinski faced problems from racketeers,who pressured him to manufacture counterfeit fabergé products,but he refused.on his application for asylum,kouljinski stated that an entity called the ost corporation began threatening and pressuring him,demanding that he merge his business with theirs because his was a russian practice and tradition,part of the russian culture,and therefore not suitable for jews.at asylum application.kouljinski testified that they frequently received threatening calls at night and that windows in their house were broken.the racketeers demanded thirty percent of his revenue,and kouljinski testified that when he attempted to report the extortion to the police,he was laughed at.ultimately,kouljinski decided to shut down his production and flee to the united states.
while kouljinski was in the united states,his wife continued to experience harassment in russia.kouljinski testified that she received threats,with callers telling her that we know that your husband got out and you should leave with him,because you even worse than him.you married a jew.at hr g tr.at.she also claimed that callers directed threats at their daughter.in,kouljinski was involved in a serious car accident,and she testified that the other car collided with my vehicle at a very high speed and that she spent over two weeks in the hospital due to her injuries.at hr g tr.at.her mother began receiving threats over the phone,with the callers saying that if your daughter does leave the country with her offspring,then she would lose her life.at hr g tr.at.at this time,her mother called kouljinski,who returned to russia.on his asylum application,kouljinski stated that he believed the auto accident was caused by persons associated with members of the ost at asylum applic.he admitted on at his asylum hearing that he had no personal knowledge regarding the circumstances of the accident.
kouljinski filed a lawsuit in russia against the other driver,and kouljinski asylum application stated that e ven though she won in court,the courts have never enforced the judgment.at asylum applic.when kouljinski testified about the car accident,she said that her suit never got to the court.at hr g tr.at.the government noted that a document submitted in kouljinski asylum application stated that a judgment had been granted on her claim in the amount of some three thousand dollars.at hr g tr.at,letter from saint petersburg attorney german natus.kouljinski replied that they had never received any payment and that her attorney informed her that the other party has twenty years to pay the judgment.
both kouljinski and his wife described episodes involving the brief kidnapping of their daughter.kouljinski testified that when he returned to russia in,while his daughter was playing outside one day,he received a phone call in which he was told that the caller had his daughter in a car.he stated that the caller wanted the documents regarding his jewelry manufacturing process,and he immediately agreed to hand over the documents.he claimed that when i got outside,my daughter was already returned to me.it all took not more than minutes.at hr g tr.at.kouljinski testified that on another occasion,when their daughter was five years old,their daughter disappeared while playing in a park.she stated that she received a phone call in which the caller claimed they had taken her daughter and that t his time we took her only for two hours.next time,it going to be forever.at hr g tr.at.no mention of either incident appeared in the application for asylum that kouljinski filed in,or in any earlier application or affidavit.
kouljinski and his wife also both testified that the graves of his family members have been desecrated in recent years.in his asylum application,kouljinski stated that he heard in that his father gravestone was destroyed by vandals.at his hearing,he also identified photographs sent to him by friends containing images of grave sites with names that had been vandalized and dirtied up.at hr g tr.at.kouljinski also identified photographs,which her mother friends had taken,depicting vandalized grave sites,and she stated that the vandalism was the work of a skinhead organization that exists in petersburg,whose goal is to clear petersburg from all.at hr g tr.at.kouljinski also specifically identified photographs of vandalism to the headstones of kouljinski aunt and uncle,his niece,and his parents.
kouljinski testified that since he has been in the united states,he has been convicted three times for driving under the influence of alcohol,in,and,all in the state of michigan.at michigan state court records.kouljinski asserted that he had not drunk alcohol for three years and that he attends aa meetings when he is able.he also stated that he now has a restricted driver license his car must be equipped with a device to check his blood alcohol level before he can start the car,and he is permitted to drive only to and from work and to and from meetings.at hr g tr.at,order.dep t of state,driver license appeal div.
finally,both kouljinski and the government submitted numerous documents for the ij to consider,including reports from the department of state and amnesty international.
c.the ij decision 
the ij opened his decision by analyzing the testimony that kouljinski and his wife gave at the hearing.the ij expressed concerns about the credibility of the testimony of kouljinski and his wife.at.although their testimony described their daughter being abducted,the ij highlighted that kouljinski application for asylum did not mention these alleged traumatic events.while kouljinski attributed the cause of their problems in russia to his jewish religion,kouljinski spoke about racketeers efforts to extort him and take over his business.the ij also noted discrepancies between kouljinski testimony about her car accident and lawsuit and the documents that kouljinski submitted with his asylum application.the ij did find credible kouljinski testimony that he is jewish and that he left russia because he was subjected to extortion by racketeers in connection with his business.
the ij next announced that he would not be prepared to find on this record that kouljinski was persecuted in russia on account of his religion.at.although kouljinski mentioned various employment difficulties,the ij stated that these appear to have been related to his failure to obtain party membership and those employment difficulties were not sufficiently serious enough to rise to the level of persecution.id.further,those experiences occurred prior to the disintegration of the soviet union,and there obviously have been significant changes in country conditions,particularly relating to whether membership in the communist party would act as a barrier to employment today.id.
although the ij found that kouljinski had not been persecuted in the past,in light of the testimony and the evidence in the the department of state country report on human rights practices for russia,at see also at dep t of state report the ij concluded that kouljinski had demonstrated a fear of future persecution.at.specifically,the ij stated that 
given the fact that kouljinski suffered some level of discrimination in the past based on the fact that he is jewish and the fact that societal appears to have survived the collapse of the soviet union and,unfortunately,that skinhead violence against jews and other minorities is a persistent problem in russia,he might well reasonably fear that he would be the target of such violence on return to russia today.
the ij next discussed kouljinski three convictions in the united states for driving while under the influence of alcohol,noting that he had very serious concerns in this case about whether asylum should be granted as a matter of discretion.at.the ij discussed each of the convictions and kouljinski efforts to attend counseling.the ij also noted that michigan had not fully restored kouljinski driving privileges and that kouljinski last conviction was a felony offense.
before making his final determination as to whether to grant asylum to kouljinski as a matter of discretion,the ij next evaluated whether kouljinski had demonstrated that he was entitled to withholding of removal under the ina or the cat.although the ij concluded that kouljinski established a reasonable possibility of persecution,he found that kouljinski had not demonstrated a likelihood of standard for withholding of two reasons first,because kouljinski was not,in my view,actually persecuted in the past,and second,because the type of harm that he fears is not harm which is inflicted by the government and is instead harm inflicted by actors.at.the ij stated that such harm is likely to be somewhat more sporadic than persecution by government authorities.id.the ij next found that kouljinski had not established a likelihood of being tortured on his return to russia for similar reasons,explaining that kouljinski did not complain of ever being tortured by government authorities and that his fear of persecution relates again to action by actors and not by the government.at.
at this point,the ij returned to balancing the favorable and unfavorable factors regarding the exercise of discretion in kouljinski asylum application.the ij explained that the question is whether kouljinski eligibility for asylum is a sufficiently weighty favorable discretionary factor to outweigh the fact that he has three convictions for driving under the influence,the most recent conviction a felony conviction for that offense.at.noting the repetitive nature of kouljinski behavior as an adverse factor,the ij concluded that i n consideration of these factors,unfortunately,i have reached the conclusion that a favorable exercise of discretion in this case is unwarranted.at.accordingly,the ij ordered that kouljinski petition be denied and that he be removed from the united states to russia.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the court reviews the factual determination of whether a petitioner qualifies as a refugee under a substantial evidence test.gilaj gonzales,cir.the court may reverse the bia determination if the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion,but indeed compels it.id.quoting ouda ins,cir.pursuant to b d,the attorney general discretionary judgment whether to grant relief under section a shall be conclusive unless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.an abuse of discretion occurs when the bia exercises its discretion in a way that is arbitrary,irrational,or contrary to law.gilaj,at.because the bia adopted the ij reasoning,we review the ij decision directly.id.at.
the disposition of an application for asylum involves a inquiry whether the applicant qualifies as a refugee as defined in a a,and whether the applicant merits a favorable exercise of discretion by the attorney general.gilaj,at quoting perkovic ins,cir.at the first step,an applicant for asylum may qualify as a refugee in either of two ways a by establishing that he or she has suffered past persecution on the basis of race,religion,nationality,social group,or political opinion or b by showing that he or she has a fear of persecution on one of those same bases.b.
once an applicant demonstrates his or her eligibility for asylum by establishing refugee status,as kouljinski did,the applicant progresses to the second step of the inquiry,at which point the bia has stated that the applicant has the burden of establishing that the favorable exercise of discretion is warranted.in re pula.the bia has also stated that ijs should consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted,id.at,and that t he danger of persecution will outweigh all but the most egregious adverse factors.in re kasinga.
even though the ij found that kouljinski succeeded in establishing refugee status by showing a fear of future persecution,kouljinski argues extensively in his brief that he is a refugee entitled to asylum because of both past persecution and fear of future persecution.see brief for petitioner.at.because both the ij and the bia agreed with kouljinski that he established refugee status via the second showing a reasonable possibility of future proceed to the second step and analyze the ij discretionary denial of kouljinski application for asylum 
kouljinski argues that the ij abused his discretion in denying him asylum for two reasons.first,kouljinski contends that drunk driving convictions,which are not even crimes involving moral turpitude,should not be a factor to negate the grant of asylum.pet.br.at.in his brief,kouljinski provides absolutely no citations or support for his assertions that only crimes involving moral turpitude may be the basis for a discretionary denial of asylum in fact,several cases appear to rely on such lesser crimes in affirming the exercise of discretion by immigration judges.see barrie gonzales,cir denying petition where ij based her discretionary denial on applicant multiple convictions for counterfeiting and disorderly conduct huang ins,cir stating that a dverse factors include criminal convictions,as well as significant violations of national immigration laws and the manner of entry into this country kazlauskas ins,cir holding that the ij permissibly found asylum unwarranted as a matter of discretion where the ij considered the applicant criminal record since he has been in this country dhine slattery,cir seven convictions over seven seven furnish a rational basis for the attorney general exercise of discretion.purveegiin ins processing,d,stating that the ins may consider petitioner criminal history in determining whether he is eligible for asylum and concluding that six misdemeanor convictions over four years furnished rational basis for the exercise of discretion ajanel ashcroft,cir denying petition,in context of motion to remand for adjustment of status,where the ij held that applicant did not merit favorable exercise of discretion because his single drunk driving conviction outweighed his recent marriage to a citizen and the fact that their child was a citizen.
the bia has stated that ijs should consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether a favorable exercise of discretion is warranted,in re pula,at,and kouljinski points to nothing in the ina,relevant regulations,or bia case law that precludes consideration of convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol.indeed,governing law provides for a mandatory denial of an alien application for asylum if the alien has been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime and constitutes a danger to the community of the united states.b a ii see also c i.given that the bia has held that f actors which fall short of the grounds of mandatory denial may constitute discretionary considerations,in re h,we need not determine whether driving under the influence of alcohol is a particularly serious crime which would require the denial of kouljinski hold that the ij properly considered kouljinski three convictions of that offense in denying his application as a matter of discretion.
in light of this case law and our view that an ij may properly consider an alien convictions for an offense like driving while under the influence of alcohol,regardless of whether it is a crime of moral turpitude or a particularly serious crime,we hold that the ij did not abuse his discretion in this case by basing his discretionary denial of asylum on kouljinski three convictions.
kouljinski second argument that the ij abused his discretion concerns the ij statement that kouljinski does not have family ties in the united states to individuals who are legally present in this country.at.kouljinski contends that the ij erred in ignoring his daughter and his wife,who testified at his hearing,pet.br.at,but bia case law belies this argument.in re pula,the case that kouljinski cites regarding the factors that an ij should consider in exercising discretion,states that whether the alien has relatives legally in the united states is another factor to consider.in re pula,at emphasis added.kouljinski does not rely on the presence of any relatives legally in the united states,as he only mentions his wife and daughter,who were not legally present.the ij therefore did not abuse his discretion balancing the factors without considering kouljinski wife and daughter.
in sum,kouljinski has not demonstrated that the ij abused his discretion in denying kouljinski application for asylum.
withholding of removal under the ina and the cat 
standard of review 
to prevail on a petition for withholding of removal under the ina,or on a petition for withholding of removal under the cat,an alien must show that there is a clear probability that she would be subject to persecution,for the ina,or to torture,for the cat,on the basis of one of the five statutorily protected grounds were she removed from this country.almuhtaseb gonzales,cir.this showing of clear probability requires more than that needed to demonstrate refugee status,which requires only a fear of persecution.b.see also mikhailevitch ins,cir an application seeking withholding of deportation faces a more stringent burden of proof than one for asylum.further,administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.
kouljinski contends that the ij erred in finding that kouljinski failed to meet the showing required for withholding of removal under the ina because the country condition reports alone support kouljinski claims that as a russian jew,he faces persecution,detention,torture and possibly even death at the hands of russians.pet.br.at.the ij,however,recognized that such violence was possible,but concluded that such violence was not likely and relied on the same state department country conditions report that kouljinski claims demonstrates his entitlement to relief.at.the ij noted that jewish leaders have stated publicly that of the soviet era no longer existed.at.the ij also stated that although jews continued to face prejudice,social discrimination and some acts of violence,because actors are the source of such harms,such occurrences are likely to be somewhat more sporadic than persecution by government authorities.at.the ij and kouljinski examined the same evidence,the ij reached a reasonable conclusion,and kouljinski does not point to any evidence that compels the opposite conclusion.
kouljinski argues that the ij erred in denying his claim for relief under the cat because the ij incorrectly focused on kouljinski subjective fears.see pet.br.at citing camara ashcroft,cir.although the ij did state his belief that kouljinski fear of persecution,in my view,relates again to action by actors and not by the government,the ij also supported his decision to deny relief under the cat by noting that kouljinski does not complain that he was ever tortured or really in any way physically mistreated by government authorities during the time he lived in the soviet union or russia previously.at.that consideration appears as a fac
