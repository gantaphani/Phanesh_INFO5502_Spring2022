ramiro ramos medina appeals from his conviction and sentence for illegally the united states after previously having been deported.we conclude that ramos prior conviction for burglary under california penal code qualified as a crime of violence under the immigration laws and for sentencing purposes.we also hold that the district court did not err in denying ramos a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under sentencing guidelines a.we distinguish the district court denial of an acceptance of responsibility adjustment here from cases in which district courts interpreted the guidelines to forbid the award of such an adjustment to any defendant who forces the government to prove his guilt at trial.see united states cortes,cir united states ochoa gaytan,cir.we affirm.
background 
in,ramos pled guilty to a charge of residential burglary under california penal code.the court sentenced him to two years in prison.
immigration officers determined that ramos conviction qualified as a crime of violence under b and was thus an aggravated felony under the immigration and nationality act ina,a f a a iii.they explained to ramos that this meant he could be removed to mexico under an administrative order without appearing before an immigration judge.see a a iii,b.they also explained to ramos that this procedure made him ineligible for discretionary relief from removal.see b.ramos signed a form acknowledging that he did not wish to contest his deportation and did not wish to seek withholding of removal.a final administrative removal order was issued,and ramos was taken to the mexican border and released.
five days later,border patrol agents apprehended ramos on the united states side of the border.ramos admitted that he had illegally crossed back into the united states.he was charged with violating,which makes it a crime for any alien who has been deported to the united states without permission.
ramos moved to dismiss the indictment.he argued that his california burglary conviction did not qualify as a conviction for an aggravated felony and that it had therefore been improper for the immigration authorities to deport him via the expedited administrative process and to tell him that he was not eligible for discretionary relief.the district court held that his conviction for burglary under california law did qualify as an aggravated felony and denied ramos motion.ramos was tried before a jury and convicted.
the district court calculated the sentencing guidelines range.it determined that a base offense level of eight applied to ramos conviction.it applied a level enhancement under guidelines b a because it determined that ramos prior burglary conviction qualified as a crime of violence.the district court considered but rejected a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.it reasoned that 
upon apprehension ramos did admit the elements of the conviction however,this case went to a jury trial,and,importantly,i think the defense vigorously in its examination of adverse witnesses and in its argument to the jury challenged the deportation removal element.
see a.given the adjusted offense level of and ramos criminal history level of v,the guidelines suggested a sentence of to months.
the district court identified several reasons for a shorter sentence,however.one of the reasons was that at the time of ramos apprehension,he had the right instincts by essentially admitting the elements,coming to terms with his case and cooperating with the authorities,and admitting that he was a deported alien found in the united states.the district court characterized this final reason as going generally to the acceptance of responsibility you were talking about,although not expressly acceptance of responsibility for the purposes of the downward adjustment.the district court settled on a sentence of months 
ii.discussion 
we review de novo the district court denial of ramos motion to dismiss his indictment based on alleged defects in his deportation.see united states muro inclan,cir.we review de novo the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines.see united states rosas,cir.we review for clear error the district court finding that ramos did not accept responsibility for his crime.see id.
ramos prior deportation 
ramos argues that his prior conviction for burglary under california penal code did not qualify as an aggravated felony.ramos was removable irrespective of whether his prior conviction was for an aggravated felony because he had entered this country illegally.see a b.the aggravated felony determination was relevant,however,because it was a prerequisite to the immigration authorities decision to deport ramos via the expedited administrative removal procedure and their determination that he was not eligible for discretionary relief.see a a iii,b,a united states garcia martinez,cir.ramos argues that the district court should not have allowed this tainted deportation to serve as the predicate to criminal prosecution for under.see generally united states ubaldo figueroa,cir describing what a defendant must prove to prevail in such a collateral attack on his prior deportation.
our decisions in united states becker,cir,and lopez cardona holder,cir,establish that burglary under california penal code is categorically a crime of violence and thus an aggravated felony for the purposes of the ina.we therefore affirm ramos conviction.
in becker,we held that burglary under california penal code qualified as a crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines.at.the defendant in becker had prior convictions for burglary under california penal code when he was convicted of bank robbery.id.at.the district court held that each of the prior convictions counted as a crime of violence and sentenced the defendant accordingly.id.the sentencing guidelines in effect at the time defined crime of violence by reference to.id.at citing.subsection b of provided that any offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense was a crime of violence.accordingly,we examined whether burglary under california penal code by its nature involved a substantial risk of force.becker,at.we reasoned that a ny time a burglar enters a dwelling with felonious or larcenous intent there is a risk that in the course of committing the crime he will encounter one of its lawful occupants,and use physical force against that occupant either to accomplish his illegal purpose or to escape apprehension.see also leocal ashcroft,burglary is t he classic example of a felony that involves a substantial risk of physical force under b.we concluded that california burglary was a crime of violence under b and the then current sentencing guidelines.becker,f d at see also park,at.
after we decided becker,the sentencing commission removed the reference to from the relevant section of the sentencing guidelines and replaced it with the commission own definition of crime of violence.see united states aguila montes de oca,cir en banc citing cmt.b iii.under the new definition,a crime is a crime of violence if it is included in a categorical list of generic crimes of violence or is some other offense under federal,state,or local law that has an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.cmt.b iii.since crimes that present merely a risk of force are not necessarily crimes of violence under the new definition,the revision rendered becker inapplicable to sentencing for a violation of.it did not,however,disturb becker conclusion that burglary under qualifies as a crime of violence for the purposes of b and other statutes that incorporate b by reference,including the ina.
we recognized the continued vitality of becker as a construction of the ina in lopez cardona,at.the petitioner in lopez cardona,like the defendants in becker,had been convicted of burglary under.id.at.the immigration judge and board of immigration appeals determined that this conviction qualified as a crime of violence under b,and that the petitioner was
