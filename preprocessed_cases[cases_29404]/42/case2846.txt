background 
harold makatengkeng arrived in the united states on july,as a nonimmigrant visitor.he overstayed his visa.on june,immigration authorities commenced removal proceedings against makatengkeng by serving him with a notice to appear.at a master calender hearing on september,makatengkeng admitted removability and indicated his intent to file a combined application for asylum withholding of removal,and cat relief.the ij held a final removal hearing on november.
factual background 
makatengkeng and his wife,reni mare,both testified at the removal hearing.we recount the substance of their testimony here.makatengkeng was born in bitung,north sulawesi,indonesia,in.makatengkeng suffers from albinism and blurry vision since living in the united states,he has been declared legally blind.
starting when he was young,makatengkeng was treated differently because of his albinism.in school,makatengkeng was insulted daily by the other students and the teachers hit him because his poor eyesight prevented him from performing the work he was given.as an adult,the insults and abuse continued.people called makatengkeng budo,an insult that means,according to makatengkeng,somebody that is a disgrace.people also called makatengkeng londo,the java word for dutch.because the dutch colonized indonesia,being called dutch is an insult.after she married makatengkeng,mare,who is not an albino,was subjected to the same insults.mare relatives tried unsuccessfully to prohibit her from marrying makatengkeng because,people like him usually have no future.makatengkeng children were also insulted in school and in the streets because of their father condition.they were called abnormal people,or budo,and people laughed at them because their father was white.sometime people would scream at them,calling them stupid or londo.
makatengkeng graduated from high school upon graduation,however,he was unable to find employment.according to his testimony,no one would hire him because of my situation like this.there is no way i can do anything.makatengkeng and his family were supported by his parents until he was able to start his own business servicing electronics.he had no formal training in electronics,but he learned the trade from his neighbor.makatengkeng earned enough from his business to support his family.
makatengkeng never suffered serious physical abuse,but he testified that people pulled the hair on his arms and removed the hat that he had to wear to protect his pale skin from the sun.children and even some adults would throw rocks at makatengkeng and his family every day when they went out,although never causing injury.makatengkeng never reported these incidents to police mare testified that generally all the police are muslim,and therefore it would do no good to report the discrimination and abuse the family suffered because makatengkeng,mare,and their children are christians.
makatengkeng moved around indonesia,trying to find peace.he moved from bitung to surabaya,east java,back to bitung,then to sorong,west irian jaya,back to bitung again,to sorong again,and,finally,to jakarta.he and his family were insulted every place they lived.
makatengkeng and his family attended church in jakarta,bitung,and sorong.in,the pastor of makatengkeng church in jakarta prohibited the congregation from having services for approximately three months.the pastor closed the church because he received a flyer from people in the community threatening the church.no one told the police about this incident because usually the police are muslim so there is no use.also in,makatengkeng cousin,who lived in a different area of indonesia,was killed because of his christian faith.during the time at issue,makatengkeng testified,all the christians in that area of eastern indonesia were killed.makatengkeng never lived in this region.
makatengkeng testified that after the united states attacked afghanistan,he felt terrified to leave the house.because of his skin condition,some people in indonesia thought he looked american,and he feared that the anger shown against the united states in daily demonstrations would be taken out on him.no one ever attacked him,but people warned him that he should be careful when he walk ed outside because they will think you are american.makatengkeng testified that,after receiving his visa on april,he was even more afraid of staying in indonesia.he did not arrive in the united states until july,however,because he wanted his son to finish school.
to support his claims for relief,makatengkeng submitted the following documents corroborating his family involvement in a christian church in indonesia a letter from the pentecostal church of indonesia in minnesota materials relating to his medical treatment from the minnesota state services for the blind a copy of his indonesian identity card,which identifies him as a christian and news articles relating violence in indonesia.the administrative record also included the state department country report on indonesia report.
b.the ij decision 
the ij found makatengkeng and mare to be credible.according to the ij,the documents makatengkeng provided confirmed that makatengkeng is a christian and that he has serious eye problems relating to his albinism.the ij noted that the main issue in the case relates to makatengkeng medical condition and found little evidence to support a claim of persecution based on religious affiliation.
starting with the asylum claim,the ij found that makatengkeng is a member of a particular social group because of his medical condition.according to the ij,a lbinism is an immutable characteristic that makatengkeng is incapable of changing.it clearly identifies him on sight.the court then determined that makatengkeng did not show that he had suffered past persecution.the ij cited fisher ins,cir,for the proposition that persecution involves a threat to one life or freedom on account of one of the protected bases under the immigration and nationality act.the ij determined that makatengkeng was essentially the victim of social discrimination,which does not amount to past persecution under the law.the ij also found that makatengkeng could not establish a fear of future persecution because the insults regarding his appearance did not involve a serious threat to his life or freedom.
the ij likewise found that makatengkeng could not meet the higher burden of proof required for a grant of withholding of removal.
the ij then moved to makatengkeng claim under the cat.the ij found that the people makatengkeng fears in indonesia are essentially general members of society who have taunted and harassed him because of his physical appearance.the ij concluded that without any government involvement or evidence that makatengkeng ever went to the authorities to complain about his condition,t here simply is insufficient evidence in the record to establish that it is more likely than not that the government of indonesia or someone acting with the acquiesce of the government would want to harm makatengkeng.
on september,after he had submitted his brief to the board,makatengkeng filed a motion to the board to admit evidence on appeal.makatengkeng sought to introduce two pieces of evidence a statement from his siblings regarding the country conditions in indonesia,and a recent diagnosis he received showing that he suffered from skin cancer.as an appendix to the motion,makatengkeng attached a letter from his diagnosing doctor,dated july,which stated that makatengkeng skin cancer was a result of growing up and living in the tropics with albinism.the letter stated that makatengkeng is at great risk for further skin cancer if he remains in a tropical area,and he is also at risk for melanoma,which can be deadly.in his motion,makatengkeng argued that his skin cancer diagnosis demonstrated that he would face additional hardship if he was removed to indonesia.he asked the board to admit and consider the additional evidence based on the principle of fundamental fairness and the interests of justice,or,alternatively,to remand the case to the ij.
on february,the board adopted and affirmed the ij decision,adding that t he concept of persecution does not encompass every sort of treatment that our society regards as offensive,unfair,unjust,or even unlawful or unconstitutional.regarding makatengkeng motion to admit evidence on appeal,the board treated the motion as a motion to reopen,and found that the allegations and submissions on appeal do not meet the requirements for such a motion.the board dismissed makatengkeng appeal and denied his motion.the board mentioned that the type of hardship relief makatengkeng appeared to be seeking with the introduction of the new evidence would be more relevant in an application for cancellation of removal.
ii.discussion 
we review the board factual determinations for substantial evidence.mamana gonzales,cir.in order for us to reverse the board decision,makatengkeng must show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.ins,d.where,as here,the bia adopts the ij decision and adds its own reasoning,we review both decisions together.quomsieh gonzales,cir.
the attorney general has discretion to grant asylum to a refugee.b a.refugee is defined as a person who is outside his country of nationality and is unable or unwilling to return to that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion a a.
a finding of past persecution creates a presumption of a fear of future persecution on the same grounds.woldemichael ashcroft,cir b.without the benefit of the presumption,an asylum applicant may prove a fear of future persecution by showing an objectively reasonable fear of particularized persecution.woldemichael,at emphasis omitted.the fear must also be subjectively genuine.gonzales,cir.to meet the subjective element,the petitioner must show that he genuinely fears persecution this may be proven by testimony that the ij deems credible.id.to satisfy the objective element,the petitioner must produce credible,direct,and specific evidence that a reasonable person in his position would fear persecution if returned.mamana,at.
particular social group 
as a threshold matter,we have doubts as to whether makatengkeng can show that albino indonesians qualify as a particular social group for asylum purposes.makatengkeng argues that he was persecuted on two grounds his medical condition and his christianity.the ij found,and we agree,that there is little substance to his claim of persecution based on his religion therefore we will focus on makatengkeng claim that he has faced,and fears he will face,persecution on account of his albinism.
the ij found that makatengkeng medical condition made him a member of a particular social group because a lbinism is an immutable characteristic that he is incapable of changing,and because i t clearly identifies him on sight.we are troubled by the ij determination that makatengkeng medical condition his albinism and the medical disabilities that come with a particular social group.see raffington ins,cir holding that mentally ill jamaicans,or mentally ill female jamaicans do not qualify as a particular social group for asylum purposes quoting safaie ins,cir.however,because we find for other reasons that relief is unwarranted,we accept,for purposes of this opinion,the ij determination that makatengkeng albinism places him within a particular social group.
past persecution 
we move next to the ij determination that the harassment and hardship makatengkeng suffered in indonesia did not rise to the level of persecution.the immigration and nationality act ina does not define persecution,but our court has held that persecution involves the infliction or threat of death,torture,or injury to one person or freedom on account of a statutory ground woldemichael,at quotation omitted see fisher,at persecution involves a threat to one life or freedom on account of one of five protected grounds.
intimidation and harassment alone do not rise to the level of persecution.berte ashcroft,cir.further,although mental or emotional injury can support a claim for persecution,persecution is an extreme concept.shoaira ashcroft,cir holding that the psychological damages the petitioner received from the rough treatment of the government authorities and from witnessing her father arrest on three occasions does not rise to the level of persecution quotation omitted.
makatengkeng argues that the economic discrimination he faced in indonesia amounts to past persecution.further,he contends that the insults and harassment he suffered,when examined in the aggregate,rise to the level of persecution.for the following reasons,we disagree.
we first discuss makatengkeng argument that he suffered economic persecution.makatengkeng contends that the level of economic hardship he suffered in indonesia,on account of his albinism,amounted to economic persecution.makatengkeng and his wife testified that,despite having completed high school,no one would hire him to perform any job.makatengkeng faced the same problems every place he lived in indonesia.further,he testified that his brother,who was an albino,also could not find work.
our circuit case law regarding economic persecution is not as developed as that in other circuits.claims of economic persecution are often embedded with claims of other forms of hardship and discrimination,where petitioners,like makatengkeng,ask us to aggregate their experiences and find persecution.see fisher,at.one exception to this general pattern is ahmed ashcroft,cir.id.at reviewing a claim that economic discrimination against the petitioners ethnic group amounted to persecution.in ahmed,we stated that,e conomic discrimination has been held to rise to the level of persecution if such sanctions are sufficiently harsh to constitute a threat to life or freedom.id.at.the petitioners in ahmed contended that they had a fear of persecution based on the system of allocating government jobs in pakistan.id.at.the board found that the petitioners had not shown anything more than fear of economic hardship or lack of educational opportunities,which was not sufficient to constitute persecution,and we agreed.id.at.while the number of governmental positions may have been limited,there was no evidence that the petitioners ethnic group was altogether disqualified from such work,because other evidence left open the possibility of private employment.id.at.additionally,none of the petitioners had ever lost a job in pakistan because of their ethnicity.id.
our decision in ahmed referenced two other cases in which we stated that a petitioner allegations of economic hardship did not rise to the level of economic persecution nyonzele ins,cir and minwalla ins,cir.in nyonzele,the petitioner testified that if he was deported,his opportunities for advanced education and a good job will be.id.at.we upheld the board decision that the petitioner had not proven a fear of persecution by showing economic discrimination,stating,f ears of economic hardship or a lack of educational opportunities do not establish a fear of persecution.nyonzele,at.
likewise,in minwalla,we affirmed the board determination that a petitioner allegations did not establish a fear of persecution.minwalla,at.we stated that p ersecution requires a showing of a threat to one life or freedom,and that m ere economic detriment is not sufficient.id.
makatengkeng urges us to adopt the test espoused by the ninth circuit in kovac ins,cir,and adopted by several other courts,which states that to rise to the level of persecution,economic hardship need not necessarily threaten the petitioner life or f
