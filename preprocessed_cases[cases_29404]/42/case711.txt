petitioner vijay chhabra,a lawful permanent resident of the united states who was convicted,following his plea of guilty,of one count of receiving medicare kickbacks in violation of b and one count of income tax evasion in violation of,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,loretta preska,chief judge,denying his petition for a writ of error coram nobis to vacate his tax evasion conviction on the ground that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with his criminal defense attorney advice as to the deportation consequences of pleading guilty to that count.the district court,after conducting an evidentiary hearing,ruled that chhabra petition was untimely and that chhabra failed to demonstrate either deficient performance of counsel or prejudice from the alleged advice,see strickland washington.on appeal,chhabra contends principally that the district court erred in finding his petition untimely,and in failing to find that chhabra criminal defense attorney made affirmative misrepresentations to him that prejudiced him in connection with his decision to plead guilty to the tax evasion count.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court denial of the petition for coram nobis.
background 
most of the facts are not in dispute.chhabra,a national of india,has been a lawful permanent resident of the united states since april and has been licensed to practice medicine in the state of new york since.in june,he was arrested pursuant to a criminal complaint charging him with one count of receiving and one count of conspiring to receive cash kickbacks from certain providers of medical services and equipment in exchange for referring medicare patients to those providers,in violation of u.b and.in october,chhabra was indicted on six counts five counts of receiving medicare kickbacks and one count of conspiring to do so.chhabra retained jeffrey hoffman or defense counsel to represent him and commenced cooperating with the government.
chhabra plea of guilty and the specter of deportation 
in june,chhabra and the united states attorney office for the southern district of new york usao entered into a formal agreement plea agreement or agreement contemplating that the indictment would be superseded by an information the superseding information that would charge chhabra with one count of receiving medicare kickbacks from through,in violation of b,and one count of income tax evasion for the calendar years through,in violation of.the government agreed to accept chhabra plea of guilty to those charges chhabra agreed to file amended tax returns for the years,to pay any past due taxes and penalties,and to cooperate with the government in ongoing investigations.the agreement stated that as to each count the maximum possible sentence included five years imprisonment.
the government also agreed that,with respect to the relevant years the usao would not prosecute chhabra further in connection with the alleged kickbacks,and subject to the approval of the tax division of the united states department of justice,neither the usao nor the tax division would prosecute him further for tax evasion.the government further agreed that if chhabra provided satisfactory cooperation the government would make a motion pursuant to of the sentencing guidelines guidelines and ask the court to sentence chhabra with lenience.the government disclaimed any assurance that chhabra would receive a particular sentence,and the agreement repeatedly stated that the sentence to be imposed on him would be within the sole discretion of the court.plea agreement at.
the government filed the superseding information on july.count one alleged that from through,both dates approximate,chhabra had solicited and received more than in illegal cash kickbacks.count two alleged that chhabra had failed to report those kickbacks on his income tax returns for and had evaded taxes for those years,including for and for.
on july,chhabra pleaded guilty to both counts of the superseding information before a magistrate judge.during the plea allocution,the magistrate judge reminded chhabra as to each count that the penalties included a maximum term of five years imprisonment.plea hearing transcript,july,plea tr,at.chhabra stated that he understood those potential penalties.see id.at.with respect to count two,chhabra stated,inter alia,that he had failed to pay the correct amount of taxes for each of the years through,and that he admitted the facts as alleged by the government.see id.at.
the magistrate judge stated that he was satisfied that chhabra understood the nature of the charges against him and the consequences of pleading guilty and was satisfied that there was a factual basis for the plea the magistrate judge stated that he would recommend that judge denny chin,to whom the case was assigned,accept chhabra plea of guilty.see plea tr.as it turned out,the actual acceptance of chhabra plea of guilty did not occur until.
in the meantime,chhabra cooperated with the government pursuant to the plea agreement,and the probation department prepared a presentence report psr.in october,chhabra and hoffman met with a probation officer at that meeting,the probation officer stated that chhabra could be deported because the tax evasion count against him involved a loss of more than and thus was an aggravated felony,see generally a m ii.shortly after that meeting,hoffman recommended that chhabra consult david glassman,an attorney specializing in immigration law.
chhabra consulted glassman in late or early.glassman confirmed that the tax offense to which chhabra was pleading guilty was an aggravated felony that carried deportation consequences.in connection with the present coram nobis petition,as discussed in part below,chhabra and glassman have given differing accounts of what additional advice glassman provided.
b.the psr and the acceptance of chhabra guilty plea 
a draft psr prepared shortly after chhabra october meeting with the probation officer stated,inter alia,that it was possible that the charges of conviction would render chhabra a deportable alien and that chhabra was fearful of that possibility and of the possibility that he would lose his medical license.in a version of the psr dated january,the probation department recommended that the sentence to be imposed on chhabra include a term of imprisonment.that psr noted the probation department belief that chhabra,upon release from prison,could make a positive contribution to society but the psr stated that that may not occur in the united states as the charges of conviction render chhabra a deportable alien emphasis added.an amended psr dated february,stated that the government planned to make a motion on chhabra behalf and that the probation department thus no longer recommended chhabra imprisonment.the amended psr reiterated,however,that the charges of conviction render chhabra a deportable alien.
the proceeding at which chhabra guilty plea was accepted,and at which he was sentenced,was eventually held on february.that hearing had been scheduled for january but had been postponed after a request by hoffman for an adjournment,stating in part as follows 
t here is an issue of potential deportation for chhabra which is not desired either by the united states attorney office or the defendant.toward that end an immigration specialist has been retained who is preparing a memorandum outlining specific findings the court might make at the time of sentencing which would be helpful to chhabra in deportation proceedings.
letter from jeffrey hoffman to judge chin dated january,hoffman january letter,at emphases added.no such memorandum was filed and so far as the record shows,chhabra and hoffman made no further mention of any deportation concerns to the district court until.
the amended psr,reiterating that the charges of conviction render chhabra a deportable alien,was received by chhabra and the court prior to the february,hearing.at the hearing,chhabra did not raise any concerns with respect to the prospect of deportation.the district judge accepted chhabra plea of guilty,finding that it had an adequate factual basis,and was made knowingly and voluntarily.plea and sentencing hearing transcript,february,g tr,at.
the amended psr stated that the taxes evaded by chhabra for the four years in question,based on the figures stated in the superseding information,totaled.as a matter of simple arithmetic,therefore,there must have been at least one year when the evaded taxes exceeded.when queried by the court,hoffman stated that the defense had no objections to the psr.see id.at.
the district court noted that the guidelines range for chhabra offenses was to months imprisonment.however,in light of the government motion and representation that chhabra had provided substantial assistance to the government,the court granted a downward departure and sentenced him principally to five years probation and a fine.
c.the immigration proceedings 
in,chhabra traveled to south america,and upon his return to the united states he was detained by immigration officials who discovered his conviction in their database.in july,chhabra received a notice to appear for removal proceedings notice.it stated that he had been convicted of taking medicare kickbacks and of income tax evasion,and that,having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude,he was removable pursuant to a a i i.
in february,chhabra,through his current attorney,thomas moseley,applied for cancellation of removal.chhabra admitted the notice factual allegations but argued that a specific amount of tax loss was not an element of tax evasion and that neither his plea agreement nor his plea allocution had specified the amount of tax loss.the government moved to pretermit chhabra application because chhabra had pleaded guilty to an information charging him with evading more than in federal income taxes such a crime is defined as an aggravated felony,see a m ii and an alien convicted of an aggravated felony is ineligible for cancellation of removal,see a.in august,an immigration judge ij found that the record in chhabra criminal case showed that his tax evasion offense was an aggravated felony and ruled that chhabra was thus ineligible for cancellation of removal and was removable.the board of immigration appeals affirmed that decision in march,and chhabra petition for review was denied by this court in.
d.the coram nobis proceedings 
chhabra filed his present petition for a writ of error coram nobis on february,requesting that his conviction be vacated coram nobis petition or petition.the petition,verified by chhabra,stated principally as follows 
prior to his agreement to plead guilty,chhabra was repeatedly advised by his criminal defense counsel that he would not be subject to deportation if he did not receive a prison sentence.the petitioner relied upon this incorrect advice and would not have entered a guilty plea in the absence of this advice.in addition,at no time prior to chhabra entry of a guilty plea,did his criminal defense counsel investigate or seek to negotiate a guilty plea in which chhabra would have entered a plea to tax evasion counts with amounts involving a revenue loss of or less,whatever might be the amounts determined for sentencing purposes.
in this connection,the petitioner criminal defense counsel did not have chhabra consult an immigration attorney until after the petitioner had entered his guilty plea following the issue of deportation being raised by united states probation in preparation of the presentence report.
coram nobis petition emphases added.
the government opposed the petition,arguing,inter alia,that coram nobis is extraordinary relief that should not be granted to chhabra in light of the lengthy and unexplained delay from at least late,when chhabra concededly was aware of the immigration consequences of his plea,to when he filed the petition that the petition did not allege that chhabra expert immigration counsel had failed to advise chhabra of the consequences of his guilty plea and that chhabra did not,after becoming aware of those consequences,attempt to withdraw his plea of guilty before it was accepted by the district court in.
the government also argued that chhabra could not show that he was prejudiced by any ineffective assistance of counsel because he was informed from the outset that he could be sent to prison,and he apparently,according to his own petition,believed when he pleaded guilty that if he were sentenced to a term of imprisonment he would be subject to deportation.the government argued further that chhabra likely would not have insisted on proceeding to trial after being advised correctly,given that chhabra admitted that he in fact committed the crimes to which he pleaded guilty,and that the government would have been able to prove his guilt through documents,live witnesses who had paid kickbacks to chhabra,and surveillance evidence of chhabra actually taking kickbacks from government cooperators.the government pointed out that chhabra received substantial benefits as a result of the plea agreement and his cooperation pursuant to the agreement.
chhabra filed a reply to the government opposition,reiterating,inter alia,the assertions made in his coram nobis petition that hoffman had affirmatively misinformed him that he would not be subject to deportation 
throughout my criminal case,my criminal defense counsel repeatedly advised me that i would have no immigration problem if i did not receive a custodial sentence and never departed from this advice.in this connection,he also advised that a sentence of imprisonment was highly unlikely in my case given my cooperation,my service to patients and my family circumstances.my criminal defense attorney referred me to immigration counsel only after my guilty plea before magistrate francis and after the issue of deportation had been raised by united states probation in preparing the presentence report in my case.this immigration attorney did not contradict my criminal defense attorney repeated advice that i would have no immigration problem if i did not receive a custodial sentence in addition,this immigration attorney did not recommend to me that i seek to withdraw my guilty plea before sentencing.likewise,my criminal defense attorney did not recommend that i seek to withdraw the guilty plea.
i would not have accepted the guilty plea in this case if i had known that my criminal defense attorney advice on the immigration consequences of such a plea was wrong and that i would have an immigration problem even if i did not receive a sentence of imprisonment.
reply declaration of vijay chhabra dated june,chhabra decl,emphases added.chhabra elaborated on various ways in which he would have attempted either to avoid pleading guilty on the tax evasion count or to plead guilty in such a way as to avoid revealing that his tax evasion in any calendar year involved a loss of or more.see id.chhabra added that 
t his petition has not been brought until now because my present attorney has attempted to contest the aggravated felony determination in immigration court and on appeal to the board of immigration appeals,which has not yet decided this case.
id.no explanation was included for the failure to file a petition during the period prior to the initiation of removal proceedings.
the government thereafter submitted a sworn affirmation from glassman and an unsworn affirmation from hoffman as to their respective advice to chhabra.hoffman stated that although he d id have any memory of specific conversations with chhabra,hoffman had been aware of the immigration laws as they pertain ed to criminal convictions,and it was his practice to discuss the immigration ramifications resulting from criminal convictions with clients whose immigration status could be effected sic by such a condition.affirmation undated of jeffrey hoffman filed june,hoffman aff.hoffman stated that in january,he had also recommend ed that chhabra meet with david glassman,an immigration lawyer,for advice concerning any requests we should make of the court at the time of sentencing that might improve chhabra immigration problems.id.
glassman,in his affirmation,stated that he had met with chhabra in the beginning of and had received,inter alia,copies of the criminal complaint,the plea agreement,and chhabra plea allocution before the magistrate judge.in february,glassman firm sent hoffman a report outlining possible available waivers for chhabra based upon his prior plea of an aggravated felony under immigration law.affirmation of david glassman dated june,glassman aff.glassman stated that his firm had reached the 
conclusion,which was discussed with chhabra,his wife and his criminal defense attorney,that section a m ii relating to tax evasion and a loss to the government in a sum in excess of does apply to chhabra and would make him removable from the united states and would be difficult to overcome.this would be true even if his ultimate sentence did not include any incarceration.
glassman aff.emphases added.glassman added that his firm also 
advised chhabra not to travel internationally as that might trigger the beginning of removal proceedings upon his return to the united states of america.we further explained to him that if his sentence did not include incarceration,the department of homeland security would not have a detainer on him but that his plea would eventually be entered into a data base which could trigger removal proceedings upon his return to the united states from an overseas trip.
while i can not comment on chhabra conversations with his criminal attorney,i can assure the court that chhabra was fully advised of the possible immigration consequences of his guilty plea.
id.emphasis added.
following the receipt of these declarations and affirmations and various other submissions,the district court scheduled an evidentiary hearing.at the hearing,held on june,the court heard testimony from chhabra,chhabra wife,hoffman,and glassman.
chhabra reiterated the assertions made in his petition and his reply declaration that hoffman had repeatedly told him that if there is no incarceration,there will be no deportation.coram nobis hearing transcript,june,coram nobis tr,at.chhabra testified that he had first become aware of and concerned about the possible deportation consequences in late when he met with the probation officer who told me that there could be deportation here,because you have an aggravated felony.id.at describing october meeting see also id.at q you admit that you became aware of the deportation consequences of your guilty plea at least as early as november,correct yes,sir.emphases added id.at in the month of december,when i heard about this aggravated felony,it was bothering me id.at while you were consulting hoffman and glassman,you were aware,because of having pled guilty to an offense,a tax evasion offense involving more than,that you were was deportable a.at that time,yes,it was bothering me sure,sir.emphases added.
chhabra testified that after the october meeting with the probation officer,hoffman told him not to worry because hoffman would work it out with the ausa to modify the charges so that in no single year would the tax deficiency be as much as.coram nobis tr.chhabra testified that hoffman referred him to glassman,and that both hoffman and glassman opined to him that,because chhabra paid his back taxes before being sentenced,there was no loss to the government id.at,and that both kept on saying that they would work it out with ausa and bring this amount down and you will have no consequences for immigration id.at.
chhabra acknowledged that,although he had been concerned as early as late about the possibility of deportation,had been intercepted by immigration officials upon his return from south america in august,had retained moseley to represent him in that connection in november,and had been served with the notice in july to appear for removal proceedings,chhabra had taken no steps at any of those times to be relieved of his plea.see coram nobis tr.it was not until february,some six months after the ij august decision finding chhabra removable,that chhabra commenced the present proceeding for a writ of coram nobis,and he acknowledged that he simply wanted to avoid the effect of the immigration decision see id.at.chhabra testified that he had no desire to withdraw his plea of guilty on the kickbacks count and that he did not even want to withdraw his plea on the tax evasion count see id.at he acknowledged that he had evaded more than in taxes in at least one year see id.at.chhabra goal was simply to have the united states attorneys office renegotiate his plea,so that he can avoid immigration consequences.id.at.
chhabra wife testified that hoffman had told her and chhabra that if there was no incarceration,then there wo be any immigration consequences.coram nobis tr.she testified that glassman stated that he and hoffman would get the amount of money involved in the tax evasion count changed,and that glassman assured us,he always keep chhabra in this country.and that he knew some people,so he wo have any immigration consequences id.
hoffman testified that he did not remember specific conversations with chhabra,but he testified i always knew that a felony conviction and potentially even a misdemeanor conviction,could have a serious impact on the immigration prospects of a defendant.coram nobis tr.hoffman stated that a noncustodial sentence could make a pragmatic difference because immigration officials were more likely to be aware of a custodial sentence and could lodge a detainer against the defendant to obtain custody of him following the conclusion of his prison term id.at but hoffman testified,it was not my understanding that incarceration versus nonincarceration had any legal efficacy in terms of immigration id.at.hoffman said that although he did not recall his specific conversations with chhabra,he would have told chhabra that there would be no immigration problem if he was not sentenced to a term of imprisonment.id.at.
hoffman testified that after glassman advised that chhabra could avoid deportability if the government would agree that the tax loss did not exceed,hoffman attempted to persuade the government to agree to a lower loss amount,but his attempt was unsuccessful.see id.at.hoffman did not advise chhabra to withdraw his plea of guilty because chhabra had told me,a nd his wife told me id.at that chhabra three primary goals were avoiding prison time,avoiding loss of his medical license,and retaining his eligibility to receive payments in the medicare and medicaid programs see id.at.hoffman believed chhabra had secured as beneficial a bargain as possible and that his chances of success at a trial would be poor.see id.at.
glassman testified that it had been his understanding of the law that a noncitizen convicted of an aggravated felony would be subject to removal from the united states,and that in chhabra case,it would make no difference whether his sentence was custodial or noncustodial.see coram nobis tr.glassman testified,i told chhabra that,in our opinion,he was an aggravated felon,based on the second count to which he pled.and that he would be removable from the united states.id.at.
glassman testified that his firm research had not turned up anything under the law at that time that any defense that chhabra would have to removal proceedings.id.at.glassman thus advised hoffman,and perhaps chhabra as well,to try to renegotiate with the attorney office in some way,chhabra plea so that the amount of tax loss would be less than.id.glassman also advised chhabra to avoid traveling outside of the united states,lest his conviction show up on department of homeland security computers upon his attempt to return.see id.at.
e.the district court decision 
in a memorandum and order reported at wl,the district court denied chhabra petition on the grounds that it was both untimely and without merit.first,the court concluded that chhabra had failed to demonstrate that there were sound reasons for the delay between his becoming aware that he would be subject to deportation as a result of his guilty plea and his filing of the present petition.the court noted that chhabra was aware of the potential immigration issues prior to judge chin acceptance of his guilty plea in february,but d espite this knowledge,petitioner made no attempt to withdraw his plea prior to his sentencing when judge chin accepted his guilty plea,finding it was made knowingly and voluntarily,choosing instead to fly under the radar in an attempt to avoid the immigration consequences of his guilty plea.id.at quoting g tr.and the court noted that when chhabra eventually was detained by immigration officials in and ordered in to appear for removal proceedings,chhabra chose to challeng e his deportation first through immigration proceedings and chose not to seek relief from his plea until his efforts in the immigration proceedings failed.wl,at.the court concluded that neither of chhabra chosen strategies was an adequate reason for his delay in seeking judicial relief from his plea.see id.
the district court also ruled that e ven if petitioner could offer a sound reason for the lengthy delay in bringing the present action,petitioner has not demonstrated that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.id.it 
conclude d that,even if defense counsel initial advice was inaccurate,because hoffman referred petitioner to competent immigration counsel who apprised petitioner of potential removal issues prior to judge chin acceptance of his guilty plea and because petitioner has admitted that he understood the potential immigration consequences of his guilty plea,defense counsel actions were objectively reasonable.
the court also rejected chhabra contention that hoffman rendered deficient performance by not negotiating a reduction of the amount of tax loss in the charge against chhabra.chhabra had presented no evidence to show that negotiating such a reduction was feasible.see id.at.and the court found,based on testimony by hoffman,that hoffman had made such an attempt but had been unsuccessful.see id.
finally,the district court ruled that any contention that hoffman should have advised chhabra to withdraw his guilty plea would not suffice to support an claim because chhabra could not show that he would have followed that advice.the court noted that at the coram nobis hearing,chhabra testified that he does not want to withdraw his plea of guilty and go to trial he merely wants to be charged with an offense that does not require his deportation.see id.at q.you want to withdraw your plea to the tax evasion count no,sir,because whatever i did wrong,i do want to admit that quoting coram nobis tr.thus,the court concluded that even if hoffman failure to advise chhabra to seek withdrawal of his plea had constituted deficient performance,chhabra could not establish that that performance caused him prejudice.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,chhabra contends principally that the district court erred in ruling a that he failed to establish both ineffective performance by defense counsel at critical stages and prejudice as a result,and b that his coram nobis petition was unduly delayed.for the reasons that follow,we reject all of chhabra contentions.
a.the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel 
preliminarily,we note that in the latter stages of the district court proceedings and in the initial stages of the present appeal,chhabra contended that coram nobis relief was warranted by the march decision in padilla kentucky,in which the supreme court ruled that an attorney failure to advise his noncitizen client of the deportation consequences of a plea of guilty establishes the performance prong of the strickland standard for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,see padilla.at.that contention has now been withdrawn by chhabra in light of the supreme court decision in chaidez united states,holding that the ruling in padilla is not applicable on collateral review of a conviction that was final when padilla was decided,see chaidez.at.
chhabra contends,however,that this court decision in united states couto,cir,entitles him to relief on the ground that defense counsel affirmatively gave him erroneous information.he also argues,inter alia,that defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to advise him to withdraw his plea of guilty and that the district court erred in refusing to address this claim.these contentions are without merit.
a defendant accused of crime has a sixth amendment right to effective assistance from his criminal defense attorney at all critical stages in the proceedings,including the entry of a plea of guilty.see,hill lockhart,see generally missouri frye.a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel iac in connection with a plea of guilty is analyzed under the test established by strickland.see,hill,at.for a claimant to meet that test,
he must show that counsel performance was deficient,strickland,at,so deficient that,in light of all the circumstances,the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,id.at and he must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense,id.at,in the sense that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different,id.at 
bennett united states,cir bennett.
b oth the performance and prejudice components of the ineffectiveness inquiry are mixed questions of law and fact bennett,at quoting strickland,at.the district court findings as to basic,primary,or historical fact are subject to the clearly erroneous standard of review the court ultimate rulings as to strickland components,and its ultimate decision as to whether counsel performance violated the defendant sixth amendment rights,are reviewed de novo.bennett,at quoting strickland,at.the iac claim must be rejected if the defendant fails to meet either the performance prong or the prejudice prong.bennett,at see,strickland,at.
in the present case,we see no errors in the district court rulings that chhabra failed to establish that defense counsel performance was substandard and failed to establish that but for the claimed advice or lack of advice chhabra would not have pleaded guilty.
the advice as to deportation consequences 
although chhabra principal contention is that his defense counsel advised him that he was not at risk of deportation if he did not receive a sentence that included incarceration,the district court did not find that chhabra was so advised.see,wl,at nn.referring to the alleged inaccuracy of hoffman advice emphasis added and to the testimony of hoffman that although he had no current memory of specific conversations with chhabra in,it was his practice to discuss the immigration ramifications resulting from criminal conviction with potentially affected clients,and that hoffman was aware of the immigration laws as they pertain ed to criminal convictions at that time internal quotation marks omitted.the court instead concluded that hoffman performance even if it had initially included erroneous advice as alleged by chhabra was not outside the range of professionally competent assistance.see id.at.in so concluding,the court found,to begin with,that,prior to the district court acceptance of chhabra plea of guilty,hoffman referred chhabra to david glassman,an immigration law specialist,specifically to obtain advice concerning chhabra potential immigration issues prior to his sentencing.wl,at see also id.at.this finding is indisputably correct.it is supported by the testimonies of hoffman and glassman,as well as that of chhabra himself,and by the hoffman january letter to judge chin.the district court further found that in january,chhabra followed hoffman advice to retain glassman,see id.at that glassman was aware that a m ii included tax evasion in excess of as an aggravated felony,wl,at that glassman specifically informed chhabra at that time that as an aggravated felon,chhabra would be removable from the united states,id.at and that glassman advised chhabra that a guilty plea would make him removable even if his ultimate sentence included no incarceration,id.at.these findings of historical fact as to what advice chhabra received and when he received it can not be termed clearly erroneous they are amply supported by,inter alia,the sworn declaration and testimony of glassman,which the district court was entitled to credit.we thus see no error in the court finding that chhabra was awa
