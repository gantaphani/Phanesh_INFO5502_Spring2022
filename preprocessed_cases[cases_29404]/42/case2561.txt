james babumba was a vocal opponent of ugandan president yoweri kaguta museveni.he was married to fiona babumba,and nakibuka worked as the family maid.in,babumba had unsuccessfully challenged a museveni supporter for a seat in the ugandan parliament.his candidacy,which angered supporters of president museveni,led to his being beaten and jailed during his campaign.after the election,the museveni government continued actively to suppress the activities of potential rivals.for a time,the babumba family lowered its political profile.in october,however,kizza besigye announced that he would challenge museveni in the march presidential election,and babumba became besigye regional campaign manager.nakibuka joined other members of the babumba family in campaigning for besigye.on her days off,she volunteered in babumba campaign office.she also distributed literature,attended rallies,and helped organize women to support besigye.
these political activities attracted the attention of the museveni administration.on the night of february,while babumba was working in his campaign office,five men dressed in military uniforms broke into the babumbas house.the soldiers dragged nakibuka and babumba into a bedroom and tied them both up using a particularly painful technique known as the kandoya style,in which the arms are pulled behind the back and the elbows are forced together in a way that subjects the chest to intense stretching and can dislocate the shoulders.while addressing both women by name,the soldiers beat them and demanded that they stop supporting besigye.one soldier put a gun to nakibuka head and cocked the hammer as she pleaded with him that she was only a maid.another soldier unzipped his pants and threatened to rape nakibuka,but the group leader ordered him to stop.the soldiers then demanded information about besigye campaign activities and threatened to return if the women and babumba did not stop supporting besigye.eventually the soldiers left the house,leaving the two women tied up until a gardener discovered them the following morning.several days after the attack,sergeant majid seganne,a man the babumbas knew as a member of museveni uganda peoples defense force updf,began bragging to babumba and other besigye supporters that he had led the attack on the babumba household.sergeant seganne boasted about what his men had done to nakibuka and babumba and threatened other besigye supporters with similar fates.
a few weeks later,museveni defeated besigye in the presidential election.after his victory,museveni attempted to locate and punish supporters of besigye,and the police soon arrested and interrogated babumba.once he was released,babumba left uganda for several weeks to attend an international conference,but he returned in april.political conditions continued to worsen,causing the babumbas and nakibuka to fear additional reprisal by the updf.besigye fled uganda in august.his flight triggered an increased government crackdown on his supporters.in december,babumba sent nakibuka,his wife,and children to mbarara,over miles away from their home in the suburbs of the capital city of kampala.there,they were threatened by a military leader and told that they would be arrested if they remained in uganda.nakibuka and the babumba family members in mbarara arranged through a besigye supporter to depart for the united states in january.babumba was arrested again,but managed to leave for the united states three months later.babumba was granted asylum,and his wife and children were approved derivatively.
nakibuka,however,had to file a separate application for asylum,which she did in may.in it,she claimed that she would be arrested or tortured if she returned to uganda because she was associated with babumba,whom she characterized as an enemy of the government.at her removal hearing,the immigration judge did not make a specific credibility finding.but he denied nakibuka application,finding that she had not suffered past persecution because the attack in february was not sufficiently serious or,alternatively,that she was not attacked for political reasons.the ij also found in the alternative that the government had rebutted the presumption that she would suffer future persecution,which would have applied had she demonstrated past persecution.the bia affirmed without an opinion and nakibuka filed this petition for review.
where,as here,the bia summarily affirms the decision of the immigration judge,we review the ij decision as if it were that of the bia.brucaj ashcroft,cir.we will not disturb the ij decision provided that it is supported by substantial evidence.id.
nakibuka first argues that the ij erred when he found that the harm she suffered was too mild to constitute past persecution.persecution is defined as punishment or the infliction of harm for political,religious,or other reasons that this country does not recognize as legitimate.liu ashcroft,cir internal citation and quotation omitted.an asylum applicant need not show that her life or freedom were threatened,but the harm she suffered must rise above the level of mere harassment and must result from more than unpleasant or even dangerous conditions in her home country.id.internal citations and quotation omitted.past persecution may be shown through even a single episode of detention or physical abuse,if it is severe enough.see dandan ashcroft,cir vaduva ins,cir.here,the ij found that nakibuka was detained and tied up overnight during the soldiers invasion of the babumbas home and that she was slapped and kicked but not severely harmed or beaten continuously.but,as nakibuka points out,the ij said nothing about her testimony that one of the soldiers pressed a gun to her head and threatened to kill her while another unzipped his pants and threatened to rape her,and that she was tied in the excruciating kandoya style.
the testimony that the ij ignored was central to nakibuka claim of persecution.a death threat,especially one that is accompanied by an attacker pressing a gun to the victim head,is a serious factor supporting a finding of persecution.see boykov ins,cir threats of a most immediate and menacing nature may constitute past persecution mitev ins,cir noting severity of death threat emanating directly from the secret police.the ij also minimized nakibuka complaints about the attempted rape,noting that another soldier intervened and prevented such an attack.but we are unwilling to dismiss so casually a threat of imminent rape.the threatened rape was one way for the soldiers to express their domination and control over both nakibuka and babumba,see ali ashcroft,cir,as well as a way to send a message to the women about what might happen if they and babumba did not stop supporting besigye,see ins,cir rape is a form of persecution if done on account of victim actual or imputed political opinion.the ij failed to consider these possibilities.nakibuka also correctly notes that the ij use of the term tied up for what happened to babumba and herself was euphemistic at best,given the reality of the kandoya technique.nakibuka explained in her affidavit that their elbows were made to touch and a rope was tied around both hands,causing their chests to stretch out and causing
