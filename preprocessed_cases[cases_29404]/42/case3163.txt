alberto garcia jimenez pled guilty to illegal reentry into the united states in violation of.at sentencing,the district court increased garcia jimenez base offense level because of a prior aggravated assault conviction in new jersey.the court concluded that the conviction constituted a categorical crime of violence under sentencing guidelines section.increasing the base offense level for illegal reentry by levels pursuant to section increased the guidelines range from to months to to months.the court sentenced garcia jimenez to serve months,but stated,with no further explanation,that,even if the aggravated assault conviction was not a crime of violence,it would impose the same sentence.
on appeal,garcia jimenez argues that his prior conviction is not a crime of violence because contrary to the new jersey statute,the generic federal offense of aggravated assault requires a mens rea greater than recklessness under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life extreme indifference recklessness and new jersey definition of attempt,an element alternatively incorporated into the statute of conviction,is broader than the federal generic definition of attempt.
we hold that,for both reasons,the provision of the new jersey statute under which garcia jimenez was convicted does not qualify as federal generic aggravated assault and therefore is not a crime of violence.because the district court guidelines error was not harmless,we vacate the sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.
garcia jimenez is a citizen of honduras.in,he was arrested in new jersey and indicted on several counts arising from an incident in which,after getting into an argument while drunk during a card game,he stabbed another card player.he pled guilty to aggravated assault,count one of the indictment,which charged that he attempt ed to cause serious bodily injury purposely or knowingly cause d serious bodily injury under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life,recklessly cause d serious bodily injury to another.the language of the indictment closely tracked the new jersey aggravated assault statute,which reads a person is guilty of aggravated assault if he i attempts to cause serious bodily injury to another,or ii causes such injury purposely or knowingly or iii under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life recklessly causes such injury stat.ann.b.documents from the new jersey proceedings do not specify which of the three prongs of the new jersey statute garcia jimenez was convicted of violating.
garcia jimenez was sentenced for the aggravated assault conviction and served time in prison,after which,in september,the department of homeland security deported him.he was found in arizona in may and charged with illegal reentry in violation of section a,as enhanced by subsection b 
after garcia jimenez pled guilty,and in anticipation of sentencing,the probation office prepared a report psr.the psr recommended that the district court depart upward from the guidelines sentence because garcia jimenez prior conviction understated the seriousness of the offense for which he had been convicted.garcia jimenez objected to the psr,arguing that,in proposing the sentence,the probation officer improperly relied on statements from the police report describing the incident.the probation office then revised the psr,dropping the enhancement and instead recommending a level enhancement under guidelines section.that section provides if the defendant previously was deported after a conviction for a felony that is a crime of violence increase the base offense level by levels b a.the comment to that section enumerates aggravated assault as a crime of violence.see id.cmt.b iii 
the psr acknowledged that under the categorical approach,the aggravated assault conviction probably was not a categorical crime of violence.but it nonetheless recommended the court apply the enhancement using the contents of judicially noticeable documents from the new jersey conviction.garcia jimenez objected to the enhancement.at sentencing,the united states agreed with the psr that the level enhancement was warranted,but specifically urged that,under esparza herrera united states,cir per curiam,garcia jimenez conviction does categorically qualify as a crime of violence.
the district court considered the psr as well as judicially noticeable documents submitted by the united states.relying on that information,and on the parties arguments,the court added levels to the base offense level for garcia jimenez reentry offense,thereby exposing him to a guidelines range of to months.in support of that range,the district court stated,citing esparza herrera,that possibly categorically the new jersey conviction is a crime of violence.we do even have to do the modified categorical approach.further explaining the sentence it would impose,the court reasoned that the to month range was reasonable to satisfy all of the statutory factors of sentencing,including garcia jimenez history and characteristics.
ultimately,the court sentenced garcia jimenez to months imprisonment,the low end of the recommended range.the court explained,the purpose of this sentence is to address safety to the community,public safety,and also to send a very clear message to garcia jimenez,that he should not return here ever until he has legal permission to travel here.
without the enhancement,garcia jimenez adjusted base offense level would have resulted in a guidelines range of to months.at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing,the court,without specifically noting the range applicable if the conviction were not a crime of violence,stated 
and i also should make a record that in the event that the court incorrectly calculated the guidelines and the level enhancement,if for some reason that was that is incorrect and it actually treated differently or less seriously under the guidelines,the court in its discretion would sentence the defendant outside of the advisory guidelines because i think that months is a reasonable sentence no matter whether the aggravated assault is a crime of violence under the advisory guidelines.so the court would treat it that way in any event and sentence the defendant outside of the guidelines if,in fact,the court were unable to reach the guideline range of to months due to the nature due to how the criminal history is treated under the advisory guidelines.
garcia jimenez timely appealed his sentence.
this court reviews de novo the district court determination that garcia jimenez prior conviction constitutes a crime of violence under guidelines section.united states marcia acosta,cir.as we explained in marcia acosta,a case,like this one,involving application of the level section enhancement 
the federal sentencing guidelines generally apply a level sentencing enhancement to a defendant convicted under when that defendant previously was deported after a conviction for a crime of violence.b a ii.the definition of crime of violence includes the crime of aggravated assault under state law.see,cmt.b iii.we use the categorical approach set forth in taylor united states,d to determine whether a defendant prior conviction constitutes a crime of violence for the purposes of b a.when the statute of conviction sweeps more broadly than the generic crime,a conviction under that law can not categorically count as a qualifying predicate,even if the defendant actually committed the offense in its generic form.
id.some internal quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted.
here,comparing the elements of the new jersey provision under which garcia jimenez was convicted with the elements of the federal generic definition of aggravated assault,we conclude,for two independent reasons,that the two are not a categorical match.see taylor,at.
new jersey law punishes an individual for aggravated assault if he a ttempts to cause serious bodily injury to another,or causes such injury purposely or knowingly or under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life recklessly causes such injury stat.ann.b.garcia jimenez maintains that this provision is broader than the federal generic definition of aggravated assault,because it punishes conduct committed with a mental state of recklessness whereas the federal generic definition of aggravated assault requires the defendant to have acted with a more culpable mental state with knowledge,purpose,or intent,for example.
esparza herrera resolved a closely related,yet distinct,issue.see.in that case,the defendant was being sentenced for illegal reentry and had previously been convicted of aggravated assault under arizona law.see id.at.the statute under which the defendant was convicted did not match the federal generic definition of aggravated assault,esparza herrera held,because arizona law punishes as aggravated assault offenses committed with a mens rea of simple recklessness.id.at.relying principally on the model penal code,esparza herrera explained that the federal generic definition of aggravated assault requires a mens rea of at least recklessness under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.id.at quoting model penal code,a emphasis added.esparza herrera did not hold that recklessness is sufficient to satisfy the federal generic definition of aggravated assault that question was not presented to the court,and the court did not resolve it.
the united states hangs its hat on esparza herrera,contending that the case at least implicitly decided that recklessness is sufficient to make out federal generic aggravated assault.but that is just not so.as noted,the facts of the case did not present the question whether recklessness is sufficient,and the careful at least language confirms that the question was not decided.
moreover,esparza herrera did not conduct the analysis that would have been required to answer the question now before us.a court applying categorical analysis ordinarily surveys a number of sources including state statutes,the model penal code,federal law,and criminal law treatises to establish the federal generic definition of a crime.see united states garcia santana,cir.most often,t he generic definition of an offense roughly corresponds to the definitions of the offense in a majority of the states criminal codes.id.quoting taylor,at internal alterations omitted.yet esparza herrera did not survey state aggravated assault statutes to decide whether recklessness suffices for federal generic aggravated assault.rather,the survey conducted in that case differentiated only between aggravated assault statutes that require simple recklessness and those that require any greater level of mens rea.see at.we can not assume that esparza herrera implicitly decided a question that was not presented and as to which it did not conduct the appropriate analysis 
after conducting the proper analysis,we conclude that a mens rea of extreme indifference recklessness is not sufficient to meet the federal generic definition of aggravated assault.states and the district of columbia do not punish as aggravated assaults offenses committed with only extreme indifference recklessness in addition,the common law definition of assault,a general intent offense that requires a showing of willfulness,has been incorporated into the federal offense of assault resulting in serious bodily injury,a.see united states loera,cir.
seventeen states and the model penal code do punish aggravated assaults committed with extreme indifference recklessness or a lesser level of mens rea 
that a substantial majority of jurisdictions require more than extreme indifference recklessness to commit aggravated assault is a compelling indication that the federal generic definition of aggravated assault also requires more than that mental state.see estrada espinoza mukasey,cir en banc,overruled on other grounds as recognized by united states rivera constantino,cir describing states as the vast majority of states for the purposes of the taylor analysis esparza herrera,at holding that jurisdictions is a sufficient consensus to establish the federal generic definition of a crime.
the model penal code does point in the opposite direction unlike in estrada espinoza and esparza herrera,where the model penal code and the statutory survey results were in harmony.but as we have emphasized,the model penal code,while a helpful tool in the categorical analysis,does not dictate the federal generic definition of a crime.united states velasquez bosque,cir see also,united states corona sanchez,cir en banc,abrogated on other grounds as recognized by avila holder,app x,cir declining to adopt the model penal code definition of an offense where that definition was contrary to the meaning of the offense in most states fernandez ruiz gonzales,cir en banc wardlaw,dissenting explaining that the majority adopted a federal generic definition of an offense that was contrary to the model penal code.we also note that at least one treatise confirms that assault,in its various forms,is a general intent crime see d assault battery the requirement of a general intent to do an act that is inherently dangerous to human life is a general element of assault and battery assault is a general intent crime.the weight of authority approximately of the states,the common law,federal law,and at least one treatise,as compared to the model penal code and of the states establishes that the federal generic definition of aggravated assault does not incorporate a mens rea of extreme indifference recklessness.
because the new jersey provision under which garcia jimenez was convicted punishes conduct committed with only extreme indifference recklessness,the new jersey definition of aggravated assault is broader than the federal definition.consequently,the district court should not have applied the enhancement to garcia jimenez sentence.
the new jersey statute of conviction also criminalizes attempts to cause serious bodily injury as aggravated assaults.jurisdictions do not incorporate attempts directly into their aggravated assault provisions 
this survey does not,however,accurately capture the landscape of aggravated assault offenses as they relate to attempts to cause serious bodily injury.many jurisdictions have separate attempt statutes that can be combined with the jurisdiction aggravated assault statute to create attempted aggravated assault.see,schnecker state,alaska citing alaska stat,but see in re james,cal d,declining to recognize the crime of attempted assault,either simple or aggravated.because we do not take a approach to the categorical analysis,gomez hernandez,at see id.at,and because certain jurisdictions do punish attempts to cause serious bodily injury by combining the jurisdiction attempt statute with its aggravated assault statute,the distinction between those jurisdictions that incorporate attempts directly into their aggravated assault statutes and those that punish a crime with precisely the same elements is not one of substance.
we need not,however,further belabor the question whether an attempt to cause serious bodily injury is part of the federal generic definition of aggravated assault.even if it were,the attempt prong of the new jersey statute is broader than any federal generic definition of attempt.
new jersey law criminalizes attempts comprised of solely preparatory acts and has specifically rejected the prevalent probable desistance test.federal law does not interpret generic attempt so broadly.
in new jersey,a person is guilty of attempt if the person p urposely does or omits to do anything which,under the circumstances as a reasonable person would believe them to be,is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in the commission of the crime.state fornino,quoting stat.ann.fornino,which the parties agree is the controlling precedent,discussed extensively the meaning of this language under new jersey law.see.
facially,new jersey requirement is identical to the requirement incorporated into the federal generic definition of attempt.see united states gonzalez monterroso,cir.but fornino explains that new jersey attempt statute was enacted to broaden the usual scope of attempt,eliminating from the conce
