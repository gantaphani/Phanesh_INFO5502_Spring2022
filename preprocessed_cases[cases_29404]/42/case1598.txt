a jury convicted appellant israel ramos cruz on nine criminal counts related to his membership in the gang la mara salvatrucha also known as ms.ramos cruz appeals his convictions under a c for aiding and abetting murder and under g a for being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm.he also challenges the district court decision to permit two witnesses to testify against him without revealing their names or other identifying information and the district court denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained during a search of his home.although the district court based its a c jury instructions on our decision in united states harris,cir,which while this appeal was pending was abrogated by the supreme court decision in fowler united states,d,we conclude that the error in instructing the jury was harmless.finding no other error,we affirm the district court judgment.
ramos cruz is a citizen of el salvador who entered the united states illegally in.in,he was initiated into a subgroup or clique of the ms known as the sailors locotes salvatruchos westside the sailors that operates primarily in prince george county,maryland,just outside of washington.as part of his initiation,ramos cruz took the nickname taylor.he eventually rose to a leadership position within the sailors,acting as clique leader or first word from approximately to.although ramos cruz convictions were based upon criminal activity,we focus on the events relevant to the issues before us on appeal.we lay out additional facts as necessary in our analysis.
on november,three members of the sailors participated in the murder of eluith madrigal.randy calderon,a sailor,brought madrigal to the home of juan carlos moreira,one of the founders of the sailors clique,claiming that madrigal was a member of a rival gang.nelson bernal,another founding member of the sailors,was also present.calderon and madrigal began to fight,and the fight ended with calderon and bernal stabbing madrigal to death.moreira was angry that the murder had taken place in his home,and he ordered calderon and bernal to dispose of the body.
following madrigal murder,moreira drove calderon,bernal,and moreira and bernal girlfriends to the residence of clique leader ramos cruz.at trial,bernal girlfriend sari llenas testified that,during the car ride,calderon seemed upset and mentioned calling the police.
once the group arrived,ramos cruz conferred with moreira in private.ramos cruz then announced that moreira,calderon,and another member of the sailors nicknamed curly were going to paint graffiti to commemorate the murder of madrigal.bernal testified to hearing calderon say,i know you think i not going to be tough enough,but nothing sic going to find out.i not going to tell nobody.i know you all want to kill me,but it okay i going to be tough.ramos cruz did not respond,and moreira told calderon to shut up.emilia masaya,a member of the sailors also present at ramos cruz home,testified to seeing ramos cruz give moreira a gun before moreira left with calderon.
calderon did not return to ramos cruz residence that night moreira and curly reappeared alone.masaya testified to hearing moreira tell ramos cruz,i got him.members of the prince george county police department found calderon body the next morning the morning of november,near a bridge next to a can of spray paint.calderon had been shot in the head.
ramos cruz convened a meeting of the sailors several days later.during this gathering,he announced that moreira had killed calderon because calderon had violated a gang rule and because he was considering talking to the police.these events form the basis of ramos cruz conviction under a c.
in january,the federal bureau of alcohol,tobacco,firearms and explosives atf began a collaboration with the prince george county police department known as the regional anti gang enforcement rage task force.the purpose of this collaboration was to address increased gang violence in the greater washington metropolitan area.ms was a primary focus of the task force.
on august,members of the rage task force executed a search warrant for ramos cruz residence.the warrant authorized officers to search the premises for evidence of malicious destruction of property.during their search,officers seized a loaded caliber semiautomatic handgun.the dna found on the gun matched ramos cruz dna.officers also seized other evidence,including several machetes a knife gloves marked with ms,taylor,and slsw and a composition book containing ms graffiti designs.the firearm found during this search,combined with ramos cruz immigration status,discussed further below,form the basis of his conviction under g a.
on june,a federal grand jury returned a fourth superseding indictment against ramos cruz and fifteen others for crimes arising out of their involvement in ms.ramos cruz was charged with conspiracy to participate in racketeering activity in violation of d,assault with a dangerous weapon in aid of racketeering in violation of a,conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering in violation of a,murder in aid of racketeering in violation of a,murder in violation of a c,two counts of use and carrying of a firearm during a crime of violence in violation of c,murder resulting from the use and carrying of a firearm during a crime of violence in violation of j,and being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm in violation of g a.
prior to trial,ramos cruz moved to suppress the evidence obtained during the august,search of his home.he argued that the affidavit on which the search warrant was based was insufficient to establish probable cause and that officers violated the rule when they entered his residence.at a december,hearing before the district court,ramos cruz withdrew his argument,acknowledging that the supreme court decision in hudson michigan,d,established that the exclusionary rule does not apply to violations.the court then denied ramos cruz motion.
also prior to trial,the government moved for permission for two el salvadorian police officers to testify under pseudonyms and without revealing their dates and places of birth and home and work addresses.the government based its request on concern for the safety of the two officers and their families were it made public that they had testified against ms members in a court.ramos cruz objected,emphasizing his need to investigate the witnesses backgrounds independently.the government submitted in camera affidavits from both prospective witnesses explaining the threat against them it also disclosed to ramos cruz in advance the substance of their proposed testimony.the district court noted that it had previously permitted these two witnesses to testify under the same precautionary measures in earlier trials involving the same ms conspiracy.see united states zelaya,cir unpublished affirming the district court decision.it then conducted an ex parte hearing to determine whether the circumstances that had persuaded it to allow these witnesses to testify under pseudonyms in the past still existed.the court concluded that the potential threat to the officers safety remained significant.the court also questioned the witnesses and determined that the government had no disclosure obligations under giglio united states,d.accordingly,the district court granted the government motion.
ramos cruz trial began on february.he was tried with santos maximino garcia,after the trials of the other defendants charged in the fourth superseding indictment were severed.ramos cruz pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.a trial ensued.
at trial,the government presented evidence regarding the facts discussed above relevant to ramos cruz convictions under a c and g a.it also presented additional evidence about ramos cruz immigration status,which is pertinent to ramos cruz g a conviction for being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm.
at issue with respect to g a was whether ramos cruz had a pending application for temporary protected status tps pursuant to b on august,when officers found him in possession of a firearm.ramos cruz argued that if he had a pending application,he was not in the united states illegally.
tps provides temporary benefits for citizens of foreign states in which circumstances exist that would prevent nationals of the state from returning in safety,such as an ongoing armed conflict or a natural disaster.el salvador,ramos cruz native country,has been designated as such a state since.aliens are prima facie eligible for tps if they have been continuously present in the united states since the most recent designation of the relevant state or a date designated by the attorney general and if they have not,inter alia,been convicted of a felony or two or more misdemeanors committed in the united states.c a,c b.an applicant who establishes a prima facie case of eligibility for tps is given two temporary benefits during the pendency of his application protection from removal and authorization to seek employment.id.at a b.these benefits remain in place until a final determination has been made with respect to the alien eligibility for tps.id.it is undisputed that after ramos cruz entered the country illegally in,he applied for tps in.
to address this issue,the government called former immigration and customs enforcement ice officer james colomb,who originally created ramos cruz alien file.colomb testified that ramos cruz initially appeared to have made a prima facie case of eligibility and,on june,was provided with employment authorization during the pendency of his tps application his employment authorization was extended on january,and again on november.
colomb testified,however,that ice records further indicated that ramos cruz tps application was denied on march.he also stated that ice appears to have sent an letter on march.colomb explained 
we have to send a notice of intent to deny out first saying we going to deny unless this happens.it very possible they did the denial first inadvertently and then went ahead and sent the notice of intent to deny after the fact.
upon further questioning,he confirmed that ramos cruz tps application would have been denied.colomb did not specify why.colomb also stated that ramos cruz had never been granted tps.
ramos cruz called his immigration attorney,jaime aparisi,in an attempt to demonstrate that his application for tps was still pending in august.after conducting voir dire of aparisi outside the presence of the jury,the district court determined that he had no testimony to offer pertinent to ramos cruz immigration status at the relevant time and declined to allow him to testify.ramos cruz called no other witnesses and introduced no exhibits relevant to this question.
at the close of evidence,ramos cruz moved for a judgment of acquittal on all counts.the district court denied the motion,then proceeded to instruct the jury.in relevant part,it explained that,the three elements the jury must find to convict ramos cruz of violating a c were that a person committed the premeditated murder of randy calderon,that the person acted knowingly and with intent to hinder,delay,or prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer of the united states of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a federal offense,and that the defendant aided and abetted that person.it further explained that,for the jury to find the second element,
t he g overnment does not have to prove that the person specifically intended to interfere with a federal investigation.all the statute requires is that the g overnment establish that at the time the person engaged in obstructionist conduct,he had the intent to influence an investigation that eventually happened to be federal and that the investigation involved the possible commission of a federal crime.
ramos cruz objected to this instruction,stating that it did not correctly explain the federal nexus required for conviction under a c.he also objected to the jury instructions regarding g a,which stated that a person with a pending tps application is in the united states illegally.the district court overruled both of his objections.
the jury convicted ramos cruz of all counts.the district court sentenced him to life in prison,plus years.
on appeal,ramos cruz raises four arguments.first,he contends that,in light of the supreme court decision in fowler,the district court improperly instructed the jury regarding the requirements for conviction under a c.second,he contests the district court denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal on his conviction under g a.third,he argues that the district court decision to allow the two el salvadorian witnesses to testify without revealing their names or other identifying information violated his rights under the confrontation clause.finally,he contends that the district court improperly denied his motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the august,search of his residence.we address these arguments in turn.
we first consider the effect of fowler on our a c jurisprudence.section a c punishes the murder or attempted murder of another person with intent to prevent the communication by any person to a law enforcement officer of the united states of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a f ederal offense.in harris,we considered the issue of what the government must show to allow a jury to make a sufficient connection between the communication the defendant acted to prevent and federal law enforcement officers.we explained that s o long as the information the defendant seeks to suppress actually relates to the commission or possible commission of a federal offense,the federal nexus requirement is established.harris,at.the district court followed this guidance when instructing the jury below.
ramos cruz contends that,following the intervening supreme court decision in fowler,our interpretation of a c is no longer valid,and his conviction on this count must be reversed.we agree that fowler rendered the jury instructions incorrect,but for the reasons discussed below,we find the instructional error harmless.
in fowler,the supreme court considered the evidentiary showing necessary to sustain a conviction under a c in circumstances analogous to those here in which a defendant killed his victim to prevent communication with law enforcement in general,rather than with federal law enforcement specifically.at.charles fowler shot and killed a local police officer when the officer discovered fowler and several other men preparing to rob a bank.he was convicted of violating a c.on appeal,he argued that the government had not offered sufficient evidence to show that fowler had killed the officer to prevent him from communicating with federal officers.the eleventh circuit affirmed fowler conviction,holding that the possible or potential communication to federal authorities of a possible federal crime is sufficient for the purposes of section a c.united states fowler,cir,overruled by fowler united states,d.
the supreme court rejected the eleventh circuit possible or potential communication test.fowler.at.the court first confirmed that a c does apply to a defendant who kills with intent to prevent communication with law enforcement officers generally,but only if the government in such a case makes a showing about the likelihood of a hypothetical communication with a federal law enforcement officer.id.at.the showing must demonstrate more than a mere possibility that the victim would have communicated with federal law enforcement officers,principally because much conduct punishable under state law also violates federal law,and where a federal crime is at issue,communication with federal law enforcement officers is almost always a possibility.id.at.thus,the supreme court reasoned,the eleventh circuit formulation would weaken or eliminate the independent force of the language of the united states included in the statute and impermissibly broaden it to cover much criminal conduct that is purely state in nature.id.at emphasis omitted.
the supreme court went on to hold that the appropriate standard for determining whether the government has demonstrated the appropriate federal nexus is whether it has shown a reasonable likelihood that had,the victim communicated with law enforcement officers,at least one relevant communication would have been made to a federal law enforcement officer.id.at.in making this showing,t he g overnment need not show that such a communication,had it occurred,would have been federal beyond a reasonable doubt,nor that it is even more likely than not.id.it is required to show,however,that the likelihood of communication to a federal officer was more than remote,outlandish,or simply hypothetical.id.the supreme court remanded to the eleventh circuit to apply its newly articulated test.id.at.
because the test we articulated in harris is analogous to that overturned in fowler,we recognize that harris is no longer controlling.further,because the district court here relied on harris in instructing the jury,its a c instructions were erroneous as to the federal nexus element of the offense a misinstruction regarding an element is nonetheless subject to review.see neder united states,d united states brown,cir.
we find an error in instructing the jury harmless if it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that a rational jury would have found the defendant guilty absent the error.neder,at.in brown,we considered whether the of a jury instruction was harmless error in a situation analogous to that here the district court declined to give an instruction not required under precedent that the supreme court later superseded.brown,at.to determine whether such an error was harmless under such circumstances,we mandated two inquiries.first,where a reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted element was uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence,then the erroneous instruction is properly found to be harmless.id.at quoting neder,at.second,if the defendant contested the omitted element,we ask whether the record contains evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to that omitted element.id.at quoting neder,at.if not,then the error was harmless.id.if so,however,reversal is necessary.id.at.
here,we must first determine if the question of whether calderon was planning to communicate with federal law enforcement officers was contested at trial.if so,to determine whether the misinstruction was harmless error,we must review the record with an eye to whether,based on the evidence presented,a jury rationally could have found that there was no reasonable likelihood that had calderon communicated with law enforcement officers,at least one relevant communication would have been made to a federal law enforcement officer.fowler.at.
the government contends that the jury heard sufficient evidence at trial to render the erroneous instruction harmless it first points to the fact that federal charges were filed in this case related to the murder of madrigal.it cites to testimony about the formation of the rage task force involving both local and federal law enforcement approximately one month after calderon murder.the jury also heard testimony that rage was focusing on the activities of ms and specifically looking at homicides and assaults that were committed by the gang members.finally,the government notes that detective paula hamill,the local police officer who investigated madrigal murder,testified to exchanging information about her investigation with atf and the attorney office.there is other record evidence that supports the government position,as well.specifically,former ms member noe cruz reported that he had begun cooperating with authorities in december and testified to speaking with federal prosecutors while serving as an informant between and.
at trial,ramos cruz did not contest either on direct or the government evidence about the formation of the rage task force,the focus of the rage task force,or detective hamill cooperation with federal authorities during the investigation of madrigal murder.ramos cruz called into question the credibility of cruz on he never,however,specifically challenged his statements about cooperating with federal officers.in light of this uncontested evidence,we conclude that no rational juror could have found that there was not a reasonable likelihood that,had calderon communicated with authorities,at least one relevant communication would have been to a federal law enforcement officer.
we base this conclusion on the guidance in fowler,which emphasized that the government does not need to show beyond a reasonable doubt or even that it is more likely than not that the hypothetical communication would have been to a federal officer.at.the government does,however,need to show more than a mere possibility that a communication would have been with federal officials,id.at,and that the likelihood of communication to a federal officer was more than remote,outlandish,or simply hypothetical,id.at.the government here presented enough evidence that a rational jury would necessarily conclude it was sufficiently likely that,had calderon communicated with police,at least one relevant communication would have been made to federal law enforcement officers.in drawing this conclusion,we do not focus solely upon the fact that madrigal murder was eventually prosecuted as a federal crime.instead,we follow the third circuit in holding that the federal nexus element of a c may be inferred by the jury from the fact that the offense was federal in nature,plus additional appropriate evidence.united states bell,cir quoting united states stansfield,cir accord united states rodriguez marrero,cir adopting the bell standard united states diaz,cir same united states causey,cir same united states emery,cir same.we consider vital the additional evidence of the formation of the rage task force shortly after madrigal murder,rage focus on investigating ms,detective hamill communication with federal authorities regarding madrigal murder,the testimony of ms informants explaining that they had spoken with federal law enforcement officers,and ramos cruz failure to contest any of this evidence.in light of this uncontroverted and overwhelming proof,we do not believe that the record contains evidence that could rationally lead to a contrary finding with respect to the omitted element.see neder,at.we therefore find that the error in instructing the jury was harmless.
ramos cruz raises two additional arguments,asserting that the fact that madrigal murder was eventually prosecuted as a state crime and that the rage task force did not exist at the time of the murders both undermine a finding that the reasonable likelihood standard was met.ramos cruz did not bring forth these arguments at trial and relies instead upon the government examination of its own witnesses as support for his position.
fowler supports our rejection of these arguments.first,the supreme court recognized that when a defendant acts in ways that violate state criminal law,some or all of those acts will violate federal criminal law as well.fowler.at.it made this observation as a point against allowing the mere fact that a crime could be federal to supply the federal nexus required by a c.see id.in doing so,however,it certainly did not suggest that,when other evidence demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of communication with a federal officer,the fact that the underlying crime could have been prosecuted under both state and federal law precluded prosecution under a c.see accord rodriguez marrero,at finding that a murder that could have been prosecuted under state law but was included as part of a federal indictment constituted a federal offense for the purposes of a c.
second,fowler specifically noted that prosecution under a c reaches killings that occur before the victim has had any communication with law enforcement officers.at.this statement undermines ramos cruz argument that the federal investigation must be in effect at the time of the murder.as such,we join our sister circuits in recognizing that the government need not prove that a federal investigation was in progress at the time the defendant committed murder.see,united states romero,cir holding that,to sustain a conviction under a c,t here need not be an ongoing investigation or even any intent to investigate moreover,to require that federal and state officials had been cooperating at the time of the murder would undermine the deterrent purpose of the statute.see fowler.at.when,as occurred here,federal law enforcement authorities become involved in an investigation approximately a month after the relevant murder,federal authorities are specifically focusing on the group in question,and local authorities investigating the underlying crime are actively cooperating with federal law enforcement officers,the reasonable likelihood standard is met.
ramos cruz next challenges his conviction under g a for being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm.ramos cruz contends that because his tps application was pending at the time he was found in possession of a firearm and,as such,he was not illegally in the country,the district court improperly denied his motion for acquittal because we believe that the government presented more than sufficient evidence to allow the jury to conclude that ramos cruz application for tps had been denied at the relevant time,we affirm.
we review a district court denial of a motion for acquittal de novo.united states campbell,cir.in doing so,we must decide whether,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,any rational trier of facts could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
section g a prohibits possession of firearms by aliens who are illegally or unlawfully in the united states.the statute does not define these terms.the district court instructed the jury that a person would be illegally or unlawfully in the country for purposes of the statute even if he had a pending tps application at the relevant time.ramos cruz challenges this interpretation.he contends,as he did at trial,that the district court should have instructed the jury that a person with a pending tps application is lawfully in the united states.neither party disputes,however,that a person who entered the country illegally and had been denied tps status would be an illegal alien.for the reasons discussed below,we believe the evidence presented at trial would have easily allowed a rational jury to determine that ramos cruz application for tps had been denied on august,when he was found in possession of a firearm.we therefore decline to reach the statutory interpretation issue ramos cruz urges upon us.
we base our conclusion on the evidence presented at trial.specifically,the government witness james colomb testified several different times that ramos cruz application for tps had been denied on march.although ramos cruz attempted through and the unsuccessful attempt to call aparisi as a witness to establish that ramos cruz application was still pending at the relevant time,the jury never heard any testimony to that effect.in fact,the final exchange between ramos cruz attorney and colomb on seems to have definitively established that ramos cruz application was no longer pending 
okay.so you are stating here today that there is not,in ramos cruz a file,an application for temporary status that would have postdated march.you certain of that.
to my knowledge,no.
in sum,the government presented ample evidence to allow a rational jury to conclude that ramos cruz did not have a pending tps application at the relevant time.
on appeal,ramos cruz argues that ice had not come to a final decision regarding his tps application at the relevant time,which he asserts is demonstrated by the fact that ramos cruz allegedly had a valid employment authorization card in august.in support of this argument,he makes claims that were not brought forth at trial and cites to documents from his alien file that he did not introduce or refer to at trial.to the extent ramos cruz attempts to introduce new evidence before us,we will not consider it for the first time on appeal.even if we did,the evidence to which he refers does not contradict the evidence the government presented demonstrating that ramos cruz application was denied in march.at most,it shows that ramos cruz was issued an extension to his employment authorization in november that was not set to expire until march.the extension was issued before the denial of his tps application in march,and even assuming the employment authorization was technically still valid in august which ramos cruz presented no evidence of we are not persuaded that an expiration date for a separate document set months prior to the denial of ramos cruz tps application in any way indicates that the denial was not final.
ramos cruz also challenges the district court decision to allow two government witnesses to testify under pseudonyms and without revealing their names,home and work addresses,or dates and places of birth.he contends that this ruling violated his sixth amendment right to confrontation,arguing that without the withheld information,he was not able to conduct independent research about the witnesses veracity.we review for abuse of discretion a trial court limitations on a defendant of a prosecution witness.united states smith,cir.
in general,the confrontation clause guarantees a defendant the right to question an adverse witness about identifying information,including his full name and address.smith illinois,d t he very starting point in exposing falsehood and bringing out the truth through must necessarily be to ask the witness who he is and where he lives.footnote omitted.we have recognized that this right is not absolute,however,and that a trial court may limit if the information sought could endanger the witness.chavis north carolina,cir.when the government seeks to withhold a witness true name,address,or place of employment,it bears the burden of demonstrating that the threat to the witness is actual and not a result of conjecture.united states palermo,cir.if the government makes a showing of an actual threat,the district court still has discretion to review relevant information and determine whether disclosure of the witness identifying information is necessary to allow effective.id.
as the district court noted,we previously approved of its decision to allow the identical el salvadorian witnesses who testified here to testify under the same circumstances in another trial involving the same ms conspiracy.zelaya.at.although the decision in zelaya is not binding,given that it involved the same witnesses and the same underlying conspiracy,we find it persuasive.
here,the government explained to ramos cruz and the district court its concerns regarding the danger to el salvadorian citizens who testify against ms members in courts.it also disclosed the substance of the testimony the two witnesses in question would provide at trial.notably,that testimony did not involve ramos cruz or his activities.rather,it provided generalized information about the operation of ms.the government further submitted in camera affidavits from both witnesses explaining the specific threat to them were their identities revealed.because these affidavits were originally sworn in and,the district court conducted an ex parte hearing and examined the two el salvadorian officers to determine whether disclosure of their names,addresses,or dates and places of birth to the defendant would continue to pose a danger to the officers and their families.it concluded that the same threat existed that had persuaded it to permit the officers to testify under these circumstances in zelaya.
after a review of the sealed affidavits and the sealed transcript of the ex parte hearing,we can not say that this decision was an abuse of discretion.as in zelaya,t he information provided to the district court indicated that the threat to these witnesses and their families,should their true identities be provided,was actual and not a result of conjecture.id.quoting palermo,at.moreover,as we also noted in zelaya,because the government disclosed to the defense details of these two witnesses before the trial,the defendants were able to effectively the witnesses without threatening their safety.id.
ramos cruz contends that the threats against the two witnesses were too speculative to warrant the protective action taken by the district court.he points to the fact that ramos cruz is not himself accused of threatening the witnesses and argues that i t is not sufficient to assert that anyone who testifies against one of its members faces danger from ms.appellant br.with regard to his first point,we agree with the circuit that t he appropriateness of using pseudonyms to protect witnesses does not depend on whether the threat to the witness comes directly from a defendant or from another source.united states celis,cert.denied,d.as to the second,we do not dispute that such a generalized statement would be insufficient to show that a threat against a witness was actual and not a result of conjecture.palermo,at.the witnesses here,however,specifically explained the heightened level of danger to which el salvadorians who testify against ms in courts are subject.they then connected that threat to the specific investigative work they perform in el salvador.we believe that this level of specificity is sufficient.
finally,we reiterate the limited focus of the witnesses testimony.they proffered no evidence directly involving ramos cruz or his activities.they merely provided background information about the internal workings of ms generally.on these facts,we can not conclude that the district court abused its discretion.
ramos cruz final contention is that the district court erred by denying his pretrial motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the august,search of his residence.he contends that the search warrant was not supported by probable cause and that officers violated the rule.we examine each of these claims in turn.when evaluating a district court denial of a motion to suppress,we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its legal determinations de novo.united states perry,cir.
a maryland state court judge issued a search warrant for ramos cruz residence based on an affidavit submitted by detective murphy,a gang unit detective with the rage task force.ramos cruz contends that this affidavit contained little more than bare assertions and did not provide the issuing judge with a proper basis to determine that evidence of a crime would be found at the location named.we disagree.
a police officer seeking the issuance of a search warrant must present an affidavit containing facts sufficient to provide the judge with a substantial basis for determining the existence of probable cause.doe broderick,cir internal quotation marks omitted.probable cause exists when there are reasonably trustworthy facts which,given the totality of the circumstances,are sufficient to lead a prudent person to believe that the items sought constitute fruits,instrumentalities,or evidence of crime and will be present at the time and place of the search.united states suarez,cir.we afford a judge finding of probable cause great deference on review.id.
the affidavit murphy presented here supported the judge finding of probable cause.murphy sought to search ramos cruz home for evidence of malicious destruction of property.in support,he described a photograph of an individual painting graffiti depicting an ms hand symbol and the name taylor he also included a copy of the photograph.he stated that the person in the photograph was known to sergeant norris,a fellow member of the rage task force,as ramos cruz,alias taylor.he explained that the rage task force knew ramos cruz to be a member of the sailors.murphy further stated that,based on his six years of police experience,persons who create graffiti typically keep materials at their residences.finally,murphy specifically stated that ramos cruz resided at the address murphy sought to search and that norris had seen ramos cruz entering and exiting the residence while conducting surveillance of this location.
ramos cruz argues that the affidavit stated no basis for the conclusion that the person in the photograph was ramos cruz,that his alias was taylor,or that he was a member of ms.appellant br.on the contrary,the affidavit clearly states the basis for these assertions murphy colleague norris experience as a member of the rage task force.because o bservations of fellow officers engaged in a common investigation are plainly a reliable basis for a warrant,united states ventresca,d,norris observation was sufficient.ramos cruz also contends that there was no basis for determining evidence of property destruction would be found at his residence.murphy made this assertion based upon his six years of experience dealing with gangs and graffiti,and common sense supports it.especially given our deferential standard of review,we do not see any ground for finding that the affidavit did not support a finding of probable cause 
lastly,ramos cruz alleges that police officers failed to knock and announce their presence before entering his residence,and he contends that this alleged oversight warrants application of the exclusionary rule.although he chose to raise it in his brief before us,ramos cruz himself acknowledged the futility of this argument when he withdrew it before the district court.without deciding whether the officers violated the rule,we reiterate that in hudson michigan,the supreme court held that the exclusionary rule does not apply to violations.at.because there is clear,binding precedent barring the remedy ramos cruz seeks,his argument has no merit.
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is 
one of the issues we address today is whether,consistent with the sixth amendment,the government may convict a criminal defendant through the use of anonymous witnesses that is,witnesses who testify using pseudonyms and whose true names remain unknown to the defense.i think not.thus,i write separately because,in my opinion,the district court erred when it allowed two of the government witnesses to testify using pseudonyms without requiring that the government disclose their true names to the defense.but,because the error was harmless,i would nevertheless affirm the judgment of the district court.
the right to,which the sixth amendment guarantees is essential to ensuring that criminal defendants receive a fair trial.see pointer texas,d.the supreme court has long recognized that t here are few subjects,perhaps,upon which this court and other courts have been more nearly unanimous than in their expressions of belief that the right of confrontation and is an essential and fundamental requirement for the kind of fair trial which is this country constitutional goal.id.at.
is,practically speaking,one of the most valuable tools a criminal defendant has to contest the government case,for it is the primary means through which he may challenge a witness testimony against him.see davis alaska,d.through effective,the criminal defendant may ferret out falsehoods and expose inconsistencies in a witness testimony,see pointer,at,as well as challenge the witness perceptions and memory,davis,at.further provides the defendant with the opportunity to impeach the witness credibility by demonstrating bias,prejudice,or ulterior motive,or by revealing facts about the witness that suggest an untruthful disposition.see id.in short,the right to confront and witnesses ensure s the reliability of the evidence against a criminal defendant by subjecting it to rigorous testing in the context of an adversary proceeding before the trier of fact.maryland craig,d.
yet the importance of in a criminal trial extends beyond the practical benefits it confers upon the defendant.the availability of meaningful also fosters society perception that criminal trials are open and fair.lee illinois,d.it does so by ensuring that convictions will not be based on the charges of unseen and unknown and hence unchallengeable individuals.id.if safeguarded,it reflects that,in a court of law,criminal trials are even contests between the government and the accused.see id.
criminal defendants do not have free rein on,however.the sixth amendment guarantees an opportunity for effective,not that is effective in whatever way,and to whatever extent,the defense may wish.delaware fensterer,d.trial judges thus possess wide latitude to impose reasonable limits on based on concerns about,among other things,harassment,prejudice,confusion of the issues,the witness s safety,or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.delaware van arsdall,d see also chavis north carolina,cir recognizing the trial court discretion to limit for many of the same reasons.because we entrust trial judges with such discretion,we review a trial court limitations on a criminal defendant for an abuse of discretion.united states smith,cir.
the supreme court,in smith illinois,d,confronted the issue of whether a trial court may prohibit a criminal defendant from inquiring on as to the true name of the witness testifying against him.the defendant was charged with,and ultimately convicted of,illegally selling narcotics.id.at.the primary witness against him was a man who identified himself as james jordan.id.at.the witness claimed to have purchased narcotics from the defendant,and the case hinged in large part on whose story the jury believed the witness or the defendant.id.on,the witness admitted that james jordan was not his real name.id.the defense attorney then asked the witness what his true name was,but before the witness could answer,the government objected.id.the trial court sustained the objection,forbidding the defense attorney from inquiring as to the witness true name.id.on appeal,the appellate court of illinois affirmed the defendant conviction.id.at.
the supreme court held that the trial court prevention of the defense attorney from inquiring into the witness true name violated the defendant sixth amendment right to.id.at.although the court recognized that the case did not involve the complete denial of all right of,it observed that when the credibility of a witness is in issue,the very starting point in exposing falsehood and bringing out the truth through must necessarily be to ask the witness who he is and where he lives.id.at.footnote omitted quoting pointer,at.it then noted that t he witness s name and address open countless avenues of examination and investigation.id.it concluded that t o forbid this most rudimentary inquiry at the threshold is effectively to emasculate the right of itself.id.
justice white authored a concurrence,which justice marshall joined,advocating that the personal safety of witnesses was a proper reason to limit.id.at.white,concurring.he maintained that,before barring a question that is normally appropriate,courts should require either the government or the witness to demonstrate why the witness should not have to answer it.id.at.according to justice white,the trial court could then ascertain the interest of the defendant in the answer and exercise an informed discretion in making his ruling.id.ultimately,he concluded that,in the case presented,neither the state nor the witness had made any showing to justify allowing the witness to refuse to provide his name.id.
many courts have since seized upon justice white concerns and held that smith does not compel a rigid rule of disclosure of a witness true name and address when it would pose a threat to the witness safety.see,united states el mezain,cir siegfriedt fair,cir united states rangel,cir united states palermo,cir people stanard.but at least one of these courts has indicated trepidation when it is the witness true name that the government seeks to withhold.see palermo,at under almost all circumstances,the true name of the witness must be disclosed.furthermore,not all courts have allowed the government to completely withhold the true names of witnesses from the defense,even when the safety of the witnesses was in danger.see,united states celis,describing a district court protective order that allowed witnesses to testify using pseudonyms but required disclosure of their true names to defense counsel alvarado superior court,cal th,d,w hen nondisclosure of the identity of a crucial witness will preclude effective investigation and of that witness,the c onfrontation c lause does not permit the prosecution to rely upon the testimony of that witness at trial while refusing to disclose his or her identity.
these latter courts often utilize or advocate protective orders as a means of balancing the criminal defendant right to a witness with the need to protect the witness safety.see celis,at approving the district court use of a protective order alvarado,d,at w e emphasize that the trial court remains free to fashion a more limited order denying,restricting,or deferring disclosure of the identity of each witness before trial including limiting disclosure to defendants counsel,as long as that order does not impermissibly impair defendants right to confront and the witnesses effectively at trial.for example,in celis,the district court entered a protective order that allowed witnesses to testify using pseudonyms,but required the government to release their true names to defense counsel.celis,at.the order further provided that defense counsel could,in turn,share the names with the represented defendants and one other member of the defense team,but it prohibited sharing the names with anyone else without leave of the court.id.during the trial,the district court allowed defense counsel to perform limited investigations of some of the witnesses in colombia and postponed in at least one instance to allow for an authorized investigation.id.at.the circuit approved this practice,determining that it appropriately balanced the defendants right to with the need to protect the safety of the witnesses.see id.at.
i do not take lightly the safety concerns accompanying the decisions made by juan diaz and jose perez the two witnesses who testified using to testify against ramos cruz.as the record reflects,ms has demonstrated its willingness to engage in violent reprisal against witnesses who testify against its members.there is no denying that by agreeing to testify against ramos cruz,diaz and perez exposed themselves to danger.most assuredly,requiring them to state their true names in open court would have made it easier for ms to target them and their families.safety concerns were thus real and valid.
we must recognize,however,that these concerns inhere in many prosecutions of defendants who are members of violent criminal organizations.the sad truth is that,in this respect,the situation presented in today case is not rare.gangs often employ violence as a means of intimidating witnesses.laura perry,note,what in a name,joan comparet cassani,balancing the anonymity of threatened witnesses versus a defendant right of confrontation the waiver doctrine after alvarado,san diego.witness intimidation is a serious problem of an alarming magnitude,and it plagues many of our communities.see alvarado,d,at comparet cassani,supra,at.as a result,the prosecution of members of violent gangs such as this prosecution of ramos cruz will often trigger safety concerns for many of the witnesses involved.
nevertheless,in addressing these concerns,we can not undermine our constitutional commitment to ensuring that criminal defendants,even those accused of belonging to violent criminal organizations,receive a fair trial.that means they must be allowed to rigorously test the government evidence,including all of its witnesses,in an adversarial proceeding before a jury.see craig,at.see strickland washington,d.i am unconvinced that they are able to do so if the government can completely withhold the true names of its witnesses throughout the trial.
access to the true names of the government witnesses is critical to ensuring that a criminal defendant is able to rigorously test their testimony in an adversarial manner.as noted,effective often entails challenging the witness credibility.hence,the opportunity for effective,which the sixth amendment guarantees,includes the opportunity to challenge the witness credibility.see van arsdall,at.but without a government witness true name,the criminal defendant is unable to perform the type of investigation whether in court or out of court necessary to be able to challenge his credibility.see smith,at.the criminal defendant can not explore the witness background and qualifications to discover any facts that might reflect poorly on his credibility.see alvarado,d,at.in effect,denying a criminal defendant knowledge of the true names of the g
