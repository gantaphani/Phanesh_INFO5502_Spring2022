held the impact of vartelas brief travel abroad on his permanent resident status is determined not by iirira,but by the legal regime in force at the time of his conviction.
a under the principle against retroactive legislation invoked by vartelas,courts read laws as prospective in application unless congress has unambiguously instructed retroactivity.see landgraf usi film products.the presumption against retroactive legislation embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our republic.at.numerous decisions of this court have invoked justice story formulation for determining when a law retrospective application would collide with the doctrine,namely,as relevant here,when such application would attac h a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past,society for propagation of gospel wheeler,cas.see,ins cyr,hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer,landgraf,at.vartelas urges that applying iirira to him would attach a new disability,effectively a ban on travel outside the united states,in respect to past events,specifically,his offense,guilty plea,conviction,and punishment,all occurring prior to iirira passage.
congress did not expressly prescribe a temporal reach.the court,therefore,proceeds to the dispositive question whether application of iirira travel restraint to vartelas would have retroactive effect congress did not authorize.see,at.vartelas presents a firm case for application of the antiretroactivity principle.beyond genuine doubt a c v restraint on lawful permanent residents like vartelas ranks as a new disability.once able to journey abroad to,fulfill religious obligations or respond to family emergencies,they now face potential banishment,a severe sanction.see,padilla kentucky.the government suggests that vartelas could have avoided any adverse consequences if he simply stayed at home in the united states.but losing the ability to travel abroad is itself a harsh penalty,made all the more devastating if it means enduring separation from close family members.
this court has rejected arguments for retroactivity in similar cases,see chew heong united states,cyr,at,and in cases in which the loss at stake was less momentous,see landgraf,at hughes aircraft,at.
b the court finds disingenuous the government argument that no retroactive effect is involved in this case because the relevant event is the alien return to the united states.vartelas return occasioned his treatment as a new entrant,but the reason for his new disability was his conviction.that past misconduct is the wrongful activity targeted by a c v.
c in determining that the change iirira wrought had no retroactive effect,the second circuit homed in on the words committed an offense in a c v.it reasoned that reliance on the prior law is essential to application of the antiretroactivity principle,and that vartelas did not commit his crime in reliance on immigration laws.this reasoning is doubly flawed.a party is not required to show reliance on the prior law in structuring his conduct.see,landgraf,at.in any event,vartelas likely relied on immigration law,and this likelihood strengthens the case for reading a newly enacted law prospectively.cyr is illustrative.there,a lawful permanent resident pleaded guilty to a criminal charge that made him deportable.under the immigration law in effect when he was convicted,he would have been eligible to apply for a waiver of deportation.but his removal proceeding was commenced after iirira withdrew that dispensation.disallowance of discretionary waivers attached a new disability to past conduct,at.aliens like cyr almost certainly relied upon th e likelihood of receiving discretionary relief in deciding to plead guilty,thereby forgo ing their right to a trial,at.because applying the iirira withdrawal to cyr would have an obvious and severe retroactive effect,and congress made no such intention plain,the prior law governed cyr case.vartelas case is at least as clear as cyr for declining to apply a new law retroactively.cyr could seek only the attorney general discretionary dispensation,while vartelas,under fleuti,was free,without seeking an official permission,to make short trips to see and assist his parents in greece.the second circuit compounded its initial misperception of the antiretroactivity principle by holding otherwise.fleuti continues to govern vartelas travel.

panagis vartelas,petitioner eric holder,attorney general 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
panagis vartelas,a native of greece,became a lawful permanent resident of the united states in.he pleaded guilty to a felony conspiring to make a counterfeit security in,and served a prison sentence of four months for that offense.vartelas traveled to greece in to visit his parents.on his return to the united states a week later,he was treated as an inadmissible alien and placed in removal proceedings.under the law governing at the time of vartelas plea,an alien in his situation could travel abroad for brief periods without jeopardizing his resident alien status.see a ed,as construed in rosenberg fleuti.
in,congress enacted the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,stat.that act effectively precluded foreign travel by lawful permanent residents who had a conviction like vartelas.under iirira,such aliens,on return from a sojourn abroad,however brief,may be permanently removed from the united states.see a c v a.
this case presents a question of retroactivity not addressed by congress as to a lawful permanent resident convicted of a crime before the effective date of iirira,which regime governs,the one in force at the time of the conviction,or iirira if the former,vartelas brief trip abroad would not disturb his lawful permanent resident status.if the latter,he may be denied reentry.we conclude that the relevant provision of iirira,a c v,attached a new disability denial of reentry in respect to past events vartelas offense,plea,and conviction.guided by the deeply rooted presumption against retroactive legislation,we hold that a c v does not apply to vartelas conviction.the impact of vartelas brief travel abroad on his permanent resident status is therefore determined not by iirira,but by the legal regime in force at the time of his conviction.
before iirira passage,united states immigration law established two types of proceedings in which aliens can be denied the hospitality of the united states deportation hearings and exclusion hearings.landon plasencia.exclusion hearings were held for certain aliens seeking entry to the united states,and deportation hearings were held for certain aliens who had already entered this country.see ibid.
under this regime,entry into the united states was defined as any coming of an alien into the united states,from a foreign port or place.a ed.the statute,however,provided an exception for lawful permanent residents aliens lawfully residing here were not regarded as making an entry if their departure to a foreign port or place was not intended or reasonably to be expected by them or their presence in a foreign port or place was not voluntary.ibid.interpreting this cryptic provision,we held in fleuti,at,that congress did not intend to exclude aliens long resident in the united states upon their return from innocent,casual,and brief excursion s outside this country borders.instead,the court determined,congress meant to rank a resident as a new entrant only when the foreign excursion meaningfully interrupt ed the alien residence.at.absent such disrupti on of the alien residency,the alien would not be subject to the consequences of an entry into the country on his return.ibid 
in iirira,congress abolished the distinction between exclusion and deportation procedures and created a uniform proceeding known as removal.see,judulang holder,slip,at.congress made admission the key word,and defined admission to mean the lawful entry of the alien into the united states after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer.a a.this alteration,the board of immigration appeals bia determined,superseded fleuti.see in re,en banc thus,lawful permanent residents returning,like vartelas,may be required to see k an admission into the united states,without regard to whether the alien departure from the united states might previously have been ranked as brief,casual,and innocent under the fleuti doctrine.at.
an alien seeking admission to the united states is subject to various requirements,see,a,and can not gain entry if she is deemed inadmissible on any of the numerous grounds set out in the immigration statutes,see.under iirira,lawful permanent residents are regarded as seeking admission into the united states if they fall into any of six enumerated categories.a c.relevant here,the fifth of these categories covers aliens who ha ve committed an offense identified in section a of this title.a c v.offenses in this category include a crime involving moral turpitude other than a purely political offense or an attempt or conspiracy to commit such a crime.a a i.
in sum,before iirira,lawful permanent residents who had committed a crime of moral turpitude could,under the fleuti doctrine,return from brief trips abroad without applying for admission to the united states.under iirira,such residents are subject to admission procedures,and,potentially,to removal from the united states on grounds of inadmissibility 
panagis vartelas,born and raised in greece,has resided in the united states for over years.originally admitted on a student visa issued in,vartelas became a lawful permanent resident in.he currently lives in the new york area and works as a sales manager for a roofing company.
in,vartelas opened an auto body shop in queens,new york.one of his business partners used the shop photocopier to make counterfeit travelers checks.vartelas helped his partner perforate the sheets into individual checks,but vartelas did not sell the checks or receive any money from the venture.in,he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to make or possess counterfeit securities,in violation of.he was sentenced to four months incarceration,followed by two years supervised release.
vartelas regularly traveled to greece to visit his aging parents in the years after his conviction even after the passage of iirira in,his return to the united states from these visits remained uneventful.in january,however,when vartelas returned from a trip to greece,an immigration officer classified him as an alien seeking admission.the officer based this classification on vartelas conviction.see united states ex rel.volpe smith,counterfeiting ranks as a crime of moral turpitude.
at vartelas removal proceedings,his initial attorney conceded removability,and requested discretionary relief from removal under the former c of the immigration and nationality act ina.see c ed.repealed.this attorney twice failed to appear for hearings and once failed to submit a requested brief.vartelas engaged a new attorney,who continued to concede removability and to request discretionary relief.the immigration judge denied the request for relief,and ordered vartelas removed to greece.the bia affirmed the immigration judge decision.
in july,vartelas filed with the bia a timely motion to reopen the removal proceedings,alleging that his previous attorneys were ineffective for,among other lapses,conceding his removability.he sought to withdraw the concession of removability on the ground that iirira new admission provision,codified at a,did not reach back to deprive him of lawful resident status based on his conviction.the bia denied the motion,declaring that vartelas had not been prejudiced by his lawyers performance,for no legal authority prevented the application of iirira to vartelas conduct.
the court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed the bia decision,agreeing that vartelas had failed to show he was prejudiced by his attorneys allegedly ineffective performance.rejecting vartelas argument that iirira operated prospectively and therefore did not govern his case,the second circuit reasoned that he had not relied on the prior legal regime at the time he committed the disqualifying crime.see.
in so ruling,the second circuit created a split with two other circuits.the fourth and ninth circuits have held that the new a may not be applied to lawful permanent residents who committed crimes listed in among them,crimes of moral turpitude prior to iirira enactment.see olatunji ashcroft,camins gonzales.we granted certiorari,to resolve the conflict among the circuits.
as earlier explained,see supra,at,a resident alien who once committed a crime of moral turpitude could travel abroad for short durations without jeopardizing his status as a lawful permanent resident.under iirira,on return from foreign travel,such an alien is treated as a new arrival to our shores,and may be removed from the united states.vartelas does not question congress authority to restrict reentry in this manner.nor does he contend that congress could not do so retroactively.instead,he invokes the principle against retroactive legislation,under which courts read laws as prospective in application unless congress has unambiguously instructed retroactivity.see landgraf usi film products.
the presumption against retroactive legislation,the court recalled in landgraf,embodies a legal doctrine centuries older than our republic.at.several provisions of the constitution,the court noted,embrace the doctrine,among them,the ex post facto clause,the contract clause,and the fifth amendment due process clause,at.numerous decisions of this court repeat the classic formulation justice story penned for determining when retrospective application of a law would collide with the doctrine.it would do so,story stated,when such application would tak e away or impai r vested rights acquired under existing laws,or creat e a new obligation,impos e a new duty,or attac h a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past.society for propagation of gospel wheeler,cas,cc nh.see,ins cyr,invoking story formulation hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer,landgraf,at 
vartelas urges that applying iirira to him,rather than the law that existed at the time of his conviction,would attach a new disability,effectively a ban on travel outside the united states,in respect to events already past,his offense,guilty plea,conviction,and punishment,all occurring prior to the passage of iirira.in evaluating vartelas argument,we note first a matter not disputed by the government congress did not expressly prescribe the temporal reach of the iirira provision in question,a.see landgraf,at court asks first whether congress has expressly prescribed new a proper reach brief for respondent court holding in ins cyr,at,compels the conclusion that congress has not expressly prescribed the statute proper reach quoting landgraf,at several other provisions of iirira,in contrast to a,expressly direct retroactive application,a iirira amendment of the aggravated felony definition applies expressly to conviction s entered before,on,or after the statute enactment date internal quotation marks omitted.see cyr,at,and setting out further examples.accordingly,we proceed to the dispositive question whether,as vartelas maintains,application of iirira travel restraint to him would have retroactive effect congress did not authorize.see landgraf,at.
vartelas presents a firm case for application of the antiretroactivity principle.neither his sentence,nor the immigration law in effect when he was convicted and sentenced,blocked him from occasional visits to his parents in greece.current a c v,if applied to him,would thus attach a new disability to conduct over and done well before the provision enactment.
beyond genuine doubt,we note,the restraint a c v places on lawful permanent residents like vartelas ranks as a new disability.once able to journey abroad to fulfill religious obligations,attend funerals and weddings of family members,tend to vital financial interests,or respond to family emergencies,permanent residents situated as vartelas is now face potential banishment.we have several times recognized the severity of that sanction.see,padilla kentucky,slip,at.
it is no answer to say,as the government suggests,that vartelas could have avoided any adverse consequences if he simply stayed at home in the united states,his residence for years prior to his visit to his parents in greece.see brief in opposition vartelas could have avoided the application of the statute by refrain ing from departing from the united states or from returning to the united states.post,at.loss of the ability to travel abroad is itself a harsh penalty made all the more devastating if it means enduring separation from close family members living abroad.see brief for asian american justice center et as amici curiae describing illustrative cases.we have rejected arguments for retroactivity in similar cases,and in cases in which the loss at stake was less momentous.
in chew heong united states,a pathmarking decision,the court confronted the chinese restriction act,which barred chinese laborers from reentering the united states without a certificate issued on their departure.the court held the reentry bar inapplicable to aliens who had left the country prior to the act passage and tried to return afterward without a certificate.the act text,the court observed,was not so clear and positive as to leave no room to doubt retroactive application was the intention of the legislature.at.
in landgraf,the question was whether an amendment to title vii ban on employment discrimination authorizing compensatory and punitive damages applied to conduct.the court held it did not.no doubt the complaint against the employer charged discrimination that violated the act at the time it occurred.but compensatory and punitive damages were not then available remedies.the later provision for such damages,the court determined,operated prospectively only,and did not apply to employers whose discriminatory conduct occurred prior to the amendment.see,at.and in hughes aircraft,the court held that a provision removing an affirmative defense to qui tam suits did not apply to fraud.as in landgraf,the provision attached a new disability to past wrongful conduct and therefore could not apply retrospectively unless congress clearly manifested such an intention.hughes aircraft,at.
most recently,in cyr,the court took up the case of an alien who had entered a plea to a deportable offense.at the time of the plea,the alien was eligible for discretionary relief from deportation.iirira,enacted after entry of the plea,removed that eligibility.the court held that the iirira provision in point could not be applied to the alien,for it attached a new disability to the guilty plea and congress had not instructed such a result,at.
the government,echoed in part by the dissent,argues that no retroactive effect is involved in this case,for the legislature has not attached any disability to past conduct.rather,it has made the relevant event the alien act of returning to the united states.see brief for respondent post,at.we find this argument disingenuous.vartelas return to the united states occasioned his treatment as a new entrant,but the reason for the new disability imposed on him was not his lawful foreign travel.it was,indeed,his conviction,of an offense qualifying as one of moral turpitude.that past misconduct,in other words,not present travel,is the wrongful activity congress targeted in a c v.
the government observes that lower courts have upheld racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act prosecutions that encompassed conduct.see brief for respondent citing united states brown,and united states campanale,per curiam.but those prosecutions depended on criminal activity,an act of racketeering occuring after the provision effective date.section a c v,in contrast,does not require any showing of criminal conduct postdating iirira enactment.
gonzales,featured by the government and the dissent,brief for respondent,post,at,is similarly inapposite.that case involved a,an iirira addition,which provides that an alien who reenters the united states after having been removed can be removed again under the same removal order.we held that the provision could be applied to an alien who reentered illegally before iirira enactment.explaining the court decision,we said t he conduct of remaining in the country is the predicate action the statute applies to stop an indefinitely continuing violation.it is therefore the alien choice to continue his illegal presence after the effective date of the new la w that subjects him to the new legal regime,not a past act that he is helpless to undo.at emphasis added.vartelas,we have several times stressed,engaged in no criminal activity after iirira passage.he simply took a brief trip to greece,anticipating a return without incident as in past visits to his parents.no indefinitely continuing crime occurred instead,vartelas was apprehended because of a crime he was helpless to undo.ibid.
the government further refers to lower court decisions in cases involving g,which prohibits the possession of firearms by convicted felons.brief for respondent citing united states pfeifer,and united states hemmings.l ongstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons,district of columbia heller,however,target a present danger,the danger posed by felons who bear arms.see,pfeifer,at hazardous conduct that statute targets occurred after enactment of the statute omnibus crime control and safe streets act of,stat.noting hazards involved when felons possess firearms 
nor do recidivism sentencing enhancements support the government position.enhanced punishment imposed for the later offense is not to be viewed as an additional penalty for the earlier crimes,but instead,as a stiffened penalty for the latest crime,which is considered to be an aggravated offense because it is a repetitive one.witte united states,quoting gryger burke.in vartelas case,however,there is no aggravated repetitive offense.there is,in contrast,no criminal offense at all.vartelas travel abroad and return are innocent acts,see fleuti,at,burdened only because of his offense.
in sum,vartelas brief trip abroad involved no criminal infraction.iirira disabled him from leaving the united states and returning as a lawful permanent resident.that new disability rested not on any continuing criminal activity,but on a single crime committed years before iirira enactment.the antiretroactivity principle instructs against application of the new proscription to render vartelas a arrival at the country gateway.
the second circuit homed in on the words committed an offense in a c v in determining that the change iirira wrought had no retroactive effect,at.it matters not that vartelas may have relied on the prospect of continuing visits to greece in deciding to plead guilty,the court reasoned.i t would border on the absurd,the court observed,to suggest that vartelas committed his counterfeiting crime in reliance on the immigration laws.at.this reasoning is doubly flawed.
as the government acknowledges,th is court has not required a party challenging the application of a statute to show he relied on prior law in structuring his conduct.brief for respondent.in landgraf,for example,the issue was the retroactivity of compensatory and punitive damages as remedies for employment discrimination.c oncerns of upsetting expectations are attenuated in the case of intentional employment discrimination,the court noted,for such discrimination has been unlawful for more than a generation.at.but e ven when the conduct in question is morally reprehensible or illegal,the court added,a degree of unfairness is inherent whenever the law imposes additional burdens based on conduct that occurred in the past.at.and in hughes aircraft,the court found that congress removal of a defense to a qui tam action did not apply to conduct in light of the presumption against retroactivity,at as in landgraf,the relevant conduct submitting a false claim had been unlawful for decades.see,at.
the operative presumption,after all,is that congress intends its laws to govern prospectively only.see supra,at.it is a strange presumption,the third circuit commented,that arises only on a showing of actual reliance.ponnapula ashcroft.the essential inquiry,as stated in landgraf,at,is whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.that is just what occurred here.
in any event,vartelas likely relied on immigration law.while the presumption against retroactive application of statutes does not require a showing of detrimental reliance,see olatunji,at,reasonable reliance has been noted among the familiar considerations animating the presumption,see landgraf,at presumption reflects familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations although not a necessary predicate for invoking the antiretroactivity principle,the likelihood of reliance on prior law strengthens the case for reading a newly enacted law prospectively.see olatunji,at discussing cyr.
cyr is illustrative.that case involved a lawful permanent resident who pleaded guilty to a criminal charge that made him deportable.under the immigration law in effect when he was convicted,he would have been eligible to apply for a waiver of deportation.but his removal proceeding was commenced after congress,in iirira,withdrew that dispensation.disallowance of discretionary waivers,the court recognized,attache d a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past.at internal quotation marks omitted.aliens like cyr,the court observed,almost certainly relied upon th e likelihood of receiving discretionary relief in deciding to plead guilty,thereby forgo ing their right to a trial.at hence,applying the iirira withdrawal to cyr would have an obvious and severe retroactive effect.ibid.because congress made no such intention plain,we held that the prior law,permitting relief from deportation,governed cyr case.
as to retroactivity,one might think vartelas case even easier than cyr.cyr could seek the attorney general discretionary dispensation.vartelas,under fleuti,was free,without seeking an official permission,to make trips of short duration to see and assist his parents in greece the second circuit thought otherwise,compounding its initial misperception treating reliance as essential to application of the antiretroactivity principle.the deportation provision involved in cyr,a,referred to the alien convict ion of a crime,while the statutory words sub judice in vartelas case were committed an offense.a c v see supra,at the practical difference,so far as retroactivity is concerned,escapes from our grasp.ordinarily,to determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence that an alien has committed a qualifying crime,the immigration officer at the border would check the alien records for a conviction.he would not call into session a piepowder to entertain a plea or conduct a trial.
satisfied that vartelas case is at least as clear as cyr for declining to apply a new law retroactively,we hold that fleuti continues to govern vartelas travel.
for the reasons stated,the judgment of the court of appeals for the second circuit is reversed,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
it is so ordered.
scalia,dissenting 
panagis vartelas,petitioner eric holder,attorney general 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
justice scalia,with whom justice thomas and justice alito join,dissenting.
as part of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,congress required that lawful permanent residents who have committed certain crimes seek formal admission when they return to the united states from abroad.a c v.this case presents a straightforward question of statutory interpretation does that statute apply to lawful permanent residents who,like vartelas,committed one of the specified offenses before,but traveled abroad after under the proper approach to determining a statute temporal application,the answer is yes.
the text of a c v does not contain a clear statement answering the question presented here.so the court is correct that this case is governed by our longstanding interpretive principle that,in the absence of a contrary indication,a statute will not be construed to have retroactive application.see,landgraf usi film products.the operative provision of this text the provision that specifies the act that it prohibits or prescribes says that lawful permanent residents convicted of offenses similar to vartelas must seek formal admission before they return to the united states from abroad.since vartelas returned to the united states after the statute effective date,the application of that text to his reentry does not give the statute a retroactive effect.
in determining whether a statute applies retroactively,we should concern ourselves with the statute actual operation on regulated parties,not with retroactivity as an abstract concept or as a substitute for fairness concerns.it is impossible to decide whether a statute application is retrospective or prospective without first identifying a reference point a moment in time to which the statute effective date is either subsequent or antecedent.otherwise,the obvious question retroactive in reference to what remains unanswered.in my view,the identity of that reference point turns on the activity a statute is intended to regulate.for any given regulated party,the reference point or retroactivity event is the moment at which the party does what the statute forbids or fails to do what it requires.see martin hadix,scalia,concurring in part and concurring in judgment landgraf,supra,at scalia,concurring in judgments.with an identified reference point,the retroactivity analysis is simple.if a person has engaged in the primary regulated activity before the statute effective date,then the statute application would be retroactive.but if a person engages in the primary regulated activity after the statute effective date,then the statute application is prospective only.in the latter case,the interpretive presumption against retroactivity does not bar the statute application.
under that commonsense approach,this is a relatively easy case.although the class of aliens affected by a c v is defined with respect to past crimes,the regulated activity is reentry into the united states.by its terms,the statute is all about controlling admission at the border.it specifies six criteria to identify lawful permanent residents who are subject to formal admission procedures,most of which relate to the circumstances of departure,the trip itself,or reentry.the titles of the statutory sections containing a c v confirm its focus on admission,rather than crime the provision is located within title iii of iirira inspection,apprehension,detention,adjudication,and removal of inadmissible and deportable aliens under subtitle a revision of procedures for removal of aliens and treating persons present in the united states without authorization as not admitted stat.and the specific subsection of iirira at issue a,entitled admission defined is an amendment to the definition of entry in the general definitions section of the immigration and nationality act ina.see ante,at.the original provision told border officials how to regulate admission not how to punish crime and the amendment does as well.
section a c v thus has no retroactive effect on vartelas because the reference point here vartelas readmission to the united states after a trip abroad occurred years after the statute effective date.although vartelas can not change the fact of his prior conviction,he could have avoided entirely the consequences of a c v by simply remaining in the united states or,having left,remaining in greece.that a c v had no effect on vartelas until he performed a activity is a clear indication that the statute application is purely prospective.see gonzales,no retroactive effect where the statute in question did not operate on a completed preenactment act and instead turned on a failure to take timely action that would have avoided application of the new law altogether 
the court avoids this conclusion by insisting that p ast misconduct,not present travel,is the wrongful activity congress targeted in a c v.ante,at.that assertion does not,however,have any basis in the statute text or structure,and the court does not pretend otherwise.instead,the court simply asserts that vartelas lawful foreign travel surely could not be the reason for the new disability imposed on him.ibid.emphasis added.but the reason for a prohibition has nothing to do with whether the prohibition is being applied to a past rather than a future act.it may be relevant to other legal inquiries for example,to whether a legislative act violates one of the ex post facto clauses in article i,see,smith doe,or one of the due process clauses in the fifth and fourteenth amendments,see,williamson lee optical of,or the takings clause in the fifth amendment,see,kelo new london,or the obligation of contracts clause in article i,see,united states trust of new jersey.but it has no direct bearing upon whether the statute is retroactive.
the court failure to differentiate between the question whether giving certain effect to a provision would make it retroactive and hence presumptively unintended and the validity question whether giving certain effect to a provision is unlawful is on full display in its attempts to distinguish a c v from similar statutes.take,for example,the court discussion of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico.that act,which targets patterns of racketeering,expressly defines those patterns to include some conduct.see.courts interpreting rico therefore need not consider the presumption against retroactivity instead,the cases cited by the majority consider whether rico violates the ex post facto clause.see united states brown,united states campanale,per curiam.the government recognized this distinction and cited rico to make a point about the ex post facto clause rather than the presumption against retroactivity,brief for respondent the court evidently does not.
the court confident assertion that congress surely would not have meant this statute to apply to vartelas,whose foreign travel and subsequent return to the united states were innocent events,ante,at,simply begs the question presented in this case.ignorance,of course,is no excuse ignorantia legis neminem excusat and his return was entirely lawful only if the statute before us did not render it unlawful.since iirira effective date in,lawful permanent residents who have committed crimes of moral turpitude are forbidden to leave the united states and return without formally seeking admission.see a c v.as a result,vartelas numerous trips abroad and uneventful reentries into the united states after the passage of iirira,see ante,at,were lawful only if a c v does not apply to him which is,of course,precisely the matter in dispute here.
the court circular reasoning betrays its underlying concern because the court believes that reentry after a brief trip abroad should be lawful,it will decline to apply a statute that clearly provides otherwise for certain criminal aliens.the same instinct likely produced the court questionable statutory interpretation in rosenberg fleuti.the court test for retroactivity asking whether the statute creates a new disability in respect to past events invites this focus on fairness.understandably so,since it is derived from a justice story opinion interpreting a provision of the new hampshire constitution that forbade retroactive laws a provision comparable to the federal constitution ex post facto prohibition and bearing no relation to the presumption against retroactivity.what is unfair or irrational and hence should be forbidden has nothing to do with whether applying a statute to a particular act is prospective and thus presumptively intended or retroactive and thus presumptively unintended.on the latter question,the new disability in respect to past events test provides no meaningful guidance.
i can imagine countless laws that,like a c v,impose new disabilities related to past events and yet do not operate retroactively.for example,a statute making persons convicted of drug crimes ineligible for student loans.see,r.or laws prohibiting those convicted of sex crimes from working in certain jobs that involve repeated contact with minors.see,cal.penal code ann.c west supp.or laws prohibiting those previously committed for mental instability from purchasing guns.see,g.the court concedes that it would not consider the last two laws inapplicable to convictions or commitments.ante,at.the court does not deny that these statutes impose a new disability in respect to past events,but it distinguishes them based on the reason for their enactment these statutes address dangers that arise postenactment.ante,at.so much for the test it has now become a test.but why is guarding against future danger the only reason congress may wish to regulate future action in light of past events it obviously is not.so the court must invent yet another doctrine to address my first example,the law making persons convicted of drug crimes ineligible for student loans.according to the court,that statute differs from a c v because it has a prospective thrust.ante,at.i can not imagine what that means,other than that the statute regulates conduct.but,of course,so does a c v.rather than re
