petitioner lennox thom petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus to vacate his final order of removal and to direct the board of immigration appeals to adjudicate his application for c relief from deportation.the united states district court for the southern district of new york mukasey,denied his petition,holding that he is ineligible for c relief under three provisions of the immigration law the bar,established by section of the immigration act of,stat,codified at c repealed,which precludes otherwise eligible lawful permanent resident aliens from applying for c relief if they have served at least five years in prison for an aggravated felony conviction section d of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat,which eliminated c relief for certain criminal aliens,including those convicted of aggravated felonies,irrespective of the amount of time they served in prison and section b of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat,which repealed c relief and replaced it with a form of relief called cancellation of removal,which is unavailable to aggravated felons.
we agree that petitioner is ineligible for c relief and affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
petitioner,a guyanan national,entered the united states as a lawful permanent resident in.in,after what we now know was a trial in new york state court,he was convicted of second degree murder and of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree.he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of twenty years to life.later that year,he was again convicted in new york state,this time for criminal possession of marijuana in the second degree,and was sentenced to one year in prison.
upon petitioner incarceration in new york downstate correctional facility,various notifications and documents were exchanged between that state prison and the immigration and naturalization service ins as these communications are relevant to one of petitioner claims,we will review them briefly.in a form dated october,the prison notified the ins of petitioner murder conviction and that his earliest possible release date was october.on may,the ins sent the prison a standard detainer known as an immigration of action.this form indicated that an i nvestigation has been initiated to determine whether this person petitioner is subject to deportation.the document stated that it was for notification purposes only and that it did not limit the prison discretion with respect to any decision affecting the petitioner.the document also directed the prison to notify the ins at least days prior to petitioner release or in the event of his death or transfer.on july,the ins sent the prison another such detainer notice.
on april,the ins requested that the prison furnish it with a copy of petitioner sentence and commitment order,and the prison answered this request shortly thereafter.the prison also complied with a similar request dated may.on january,the ins was notified that the petitioner had been transferred to the sullivan correctional facility.
over ten years three years before the expiration of petitioner minimum ins sent the prison another detainer notice,as well as a notice to appear and a warrant for arrest,all dated june.the notice to appear was served on petitioner by regular mail on june.the notice to appear charged that petitioner murder conviction rendered him removable as an aggravated felon under sections a a and a f of the immigration and nationality act ina,and that his marijuana conviction rendered him removable as an alien convicted of a controlled substance offense under section a b i of the ina.
at his march,removal hearing before an immigration judge ij,petitioner,through counsel,admitted his murder and marijuana convictions and conceded removability as an alien convicted of a controlled substance offense.he argued,however,that because his murder conviction preceded the relevant statutory definition of aggravated felony,which was established by congress in,see abuse act of,a a iii,stat,his conviction was not for an aggravated felony,and that to apply this definition retroactively would be unconstitutional.petitioner also maintained that he was eligible for c relief.see c repealed.
the ij found petitioner removable as charged.it held that petitioner murder conviction qualified as an aggravated felony despite the fact that the conviction the relevant statutory definition of that term.it further held that petitioner was ineligible for c relief,because the iirira had abolished that form of relief for all removal proceedings instituted after april.it also noted that,while the aedpa elimination of c relief for aggravated felons did not apply to aliens who were already in deportation proceedings on the date of that law enactment,april,see henderson ins,cir,there was no indication that petitioner was in proceedings at that time.finally,the ij pointed out that,even if the aedpa and iirira did not apply to petitioner,he would be independently precluded by the bar from seeking c relief.see c repealed barring c relief for any alien who has been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies and has served for such felony or felonies a term of imprisonment of at least years 
petitioner then appealed,pro se,to the bia.in addition to the arguments he made to the ij,he asserted that,even if his removal proceedings had begun in,the doctrine of laches should bar the ins from applying current law to him,since the ins waited sixteen years from the time of his murder conviction to institute removal proceedings.the bia agreed with the ij determinations,and stated that it could not consider petitioner laches argument,because it lacked authority to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel against the government.accordingly,the bia dismissed the appeal.
on february,petitioner,again proceeding pro se,filed a habeas petition under in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.he made three arguments that the iirira and the aedpa elimination of c relief may not be applied retroactively to his murder conviction that his deportation proceedings in fact commenced in upon the ins issuance of a detainer notice in,and that the iirira and the aedpa therefore do not apply to his case and that the doctrine of laches precludes the application of law to his case.
in an order dated may,the district court mukasey,rejected all of petitioner claims and denied the petition.this appeal followed 
discussion 
on appeal,petitioner renews the three arguments that he made to the district court.we find each one unpersuasive and accordingly affirm the judgment below.
first,petitioner argues that the iirira and the aedpa elimination of c relief can not be retroactively applied to his murder conviction,which was obtained after a trial.he contends that the supreme court decision in ins cyr,d,which held that these laws may not be applied retroactively to aliens who had pled guilty to deportable offenses,should be extended to cover aliens who were convicted after going to trial.our decision in rankine reno,cir,however,squarely forecloses this argument.in rankine,we reasoned that it is choosing to forgo fighting the conviction of a qualifying crime and enter a plea that leads to an expectation of relief from removal.the petitioners here assumed no similarly heightened expectation from their decision to go to trial.id.at quoting cyr ins,cir.aliens who decide to go to trial,we held,do not rely on the availability of c relief,but rather upon their claim of innocence their reliance,therefore,was on familiar criminal justice considerations and the application of the criminal laws rather than on the availability of c relief.id.at.see also swaby ashcroft,cir holding that an alien may not escape rankine rule by attesting that he relied on the availability of c relief in rejecting a plea agreement and deciding to go to trial.
petitioner makes an interesting,but ultimately unpersuasive,attempt to distinguish rankine.he begins by positing that the only reason that cyr and rankine found that an alien decision to plead guilty gave rise to reliance and expectation interests was that such a decision by the alien was motivated by the desire to receive a sentence of less than five years in order to preserve the alien eligibility for c relief under the bar.see c repealed barring c relief for any alien who has served a term of imprisonment of at least five years for an aggravated felony conviction.he then goes on to argue that,because the bar was not in place in when he was deciding between pleading guilty and going to trial,his decision to go to trial did not bespeak a lack of desire to preserve his eligibility for c relief.
we conclude that,whatever else is wrong with petitioner argument,its initial premise is flawed.while cyr and rankine recognized that the desire to evade the bar might well be one of an alien salient motivations in pleading guilty,see,cyr,at.noting,as an instructive example,the case of an alien in parallel litigation,in which the ij found that the sole purpose of his guilty plea was to ensure that he received a sentence of less than five years,these cases did not hold,as petitioner suggests,that this was the only reason that a plea of guilty indicated an alien reliance on the availability of c relief.
in deciding to plead guilty,an alien may have relied on the availability of c relief for any number of reasons.for example,an alien may have decided to plead guilty to a lesser offense based on the simple calculation that his chances of receiving c relief would be worsened by a conviction at trial for a more severe offense.see matter of edwards,wl bia in evaluating a c application,an ij weighs the humanitarian reasons favoring relief against the nature and seriousness of the alien criminal record.an alien might also have considered that pleading guilty and thereby accepting responsibility for his crime would strengthen his c application.see in re catalina arreguin de rodriguez,wl bia granting c application in part because of the alien acceptance of responsibility through pleading guilty,an act which bolsters an alien claim of rehabilitation.or an alien may have pled guilty simply because he was willing to bear a prison term,whereas he would have taken his chances at trial if he knew that conviction would entail deportation.see generally cyr,at.a s a general matter,alien defendants considering whether to enter into a plea agreement are acutely aware of the immigration consequences of their convictions.indeed,if the supreme court rationale in cyr were as narrow as petitioner suggests,the court could have easily limited its ruling to aliens who would have faced more than five years in prison if they had proceeded to trial for these reasons,we find petitioner attempt to escape rankine unavailing.
following rankine,we must therefore conclude that petitioner decision to contest his murder charges at trial did not give rise to a reasonable reliance or a settled expectation as to the availability of c relief because petitioner does not claim any other basis for such a reliance or expectation,see,restrepo mcelroy,wl,cir.april,we hold that the iirira and the aedpa may be applied retroactively to him 
in the alternative,petitioner argues that the iirira and the aedpa may not be applied to his case because the deportation proceedings against him were pending at the time those laws came into effect.specifically,petitioner contends that his deportation proceedings began when the ins issued a detainer notice to his prison in,and not when the ins served or filed a notice to appear in 
the question of whether these laws may be applied retroactively to a pending deportation proceeding is controlled by the retroactivity analysis established in landgraf usi film,d.under landgraf,a court must first determine whether congress has prescribed the statute temporal reach.id.at.if congress has not,a court must then determine whether application of the statute to the conduct at hand would have a retroactive effect.id.if it would,then,in keeping with our traditional presumption against retroactivity,we presume that the statute does not apply to that conduct.martin hadix,d quoting landgraf,at.
petitioner is correct in stating that congress did not intend that the iirira and the aedpa be applied retroactively to pending deportation proceedings.by its terms,the iirira abolition of c relief does not apply to aliens who are in deportation proceedings as of april.see iirira a,stat,see also cyr,at.and,with regard to the aedpa,we found in henderson,at,that there was abundant direct evidence,that congress did not intend that law to apply to aliens whose proceedings were pending on the date of its enactment,april.
we find no reason,however,to accept petitioner contention that his deportation proceedings began in.we hold,instead,that his proceedings started in,the year in which the ins served him with a notice to appear and filed that notice with the immigration court unlike the service or filing of a notice to appear,the ins issuance of a detainer notice is of limited is merely a method of advising the prison officials to notify the of the petitioner impending release or transfer the detainer expresses only the intention of the to make a determination of deportability,if and when,the subject of the notice becomes available at a later time.waldron ins,cir internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.and,the language and legislative histories of the iirira and the aedpa seem to us to be clear that deportation proceedings may not be deemed to have begun with the issuance of a detainer notice.we are,therefore,unpersuaded by petitioner claim that the issuance of a detainer notice prevents the application of the iirira and the aedpa to his case.
petitioner final claim is that,even if his removal proceedings began in,the doctrine of laches should preclude the government from applying law since the ins waited an allegedly inordinate amount of time from the date of his murder conviction to institute proceedings against him 
the government responds,inter alia,that the defense of laches may not be invoked against it in this context see united states angell,cir l aches is not available against the federal government when it undertakes to enforce a public right or protect the public interest.see also costello united,d noting that i t has consistently been held in the lower courts that delay which might support a defense of laches in ordinary equitable proceedings between private litigants will not bar a denaturalization proceeding brought by the government,but reserving the question.rather than deciding the question,we,like the supreme court in costello,find it more expedient to dispose of petitioner claim on its specific merits 
in considering petitioner laches claim,it is important to make clear what petitioner is not arguing.he is not,for example,asserting that the government conduct in this case rose to the level of a due process violation.singh reno,cir finding that an alien had stated a substantial due process claim where the ins filed an order to show cause in,but then drag ged its feet,despite the alien pleas for a hearing,until it finally held a hearing in late,after the aedpa had abrogated his right to seek c relief.
similarly,petitioner laches claim should be distinguished from an argument sounding in the presumption against retroactivity.one can imagine a case in which the ins has for years declined to bring deportation proceedings against an alien,despite his conviction for a deportable crime,because,in the ins estimation,the alien would be a very strong candidate for c relief.matter of gordon,wl bia noting that an ins district director has every right,in fact,a duty,to exercise his prosecutive judgment whether or not to institute a deportation proceeding against an alien if,in screening the file of,and possibly after consultation with,such an alien,it appears to him that a deportation proceeding would surely result in a grant of section c relief it would be pointless to institute an expensive,vexatious,and needless deportation proceeding.such an alien might reasonably rely on the ins inaction and decide on that basis to make important commitments to his residency in the united states such as by marrying,establishing a business,and losing ties with his home country only later to find that,after congress had eliminated c relief,the ins seeks to deport him.under these where congress intent as to the retroactivity of the elimination of c relief is alien might argue with some force that he has demonstrated the kind of reasonable reliance and settled expectations under landgraf,at,that would render the elimination of c relief impermissibly retroactive if applied to him 
unlike a laches defenses,this retroactivity is not before us and as to the validity of which we therefore express no opinion focuses on the reasonableness of an alien reliance on the continued availability of c relief.as a result,the diligence of the ins conduct is not particularly relevant to it.
diligence is,by contrast,crucial to the defense of laches.a party claiming this defense must establish two elements a lack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted,and prejudice to the party asserting the defense.costello,at.petitioner can not establish either element.we find no lack of diligence in the ins decision to institute deportation proceedings three years before the expiration of petitioner minimum sentence.if the ins had instituted deportation proceedings immediately after petitioner murder conviction,or at any time until shortly before the expiration of his minimum term,it might well have been a colossal waste of time.any number of events might make his later deportation unnecessary or inappropriate.for example,petitioner might not survive until the end of his long prison term.conditions in the country to which he would be deported might preclude his immediate deportation upon release,see a providing for deferral of removal under the convention against torture,where it is more likely than not that the alien will be tortured if deported,thus making the ins resources better used elsewhere.and,the law with respect to deportation of aliens like petitioner might change so as to make deportation impossible or unlikely.see generally cheryl shanks,immigration and the politics of american sovereignty,documenting cycles in immigration policy over the last century.for these and other similar reasons,delay in a case like the one before us,far from indicating a lack of diligence,suggests common sense on the part of the ins.
moreover,it is highly unlikely that petitioner would have received c relief,given the seriousness and recency of his crime,had proceedings been instituted earlier in his prison term.see,matter of,wl bia stating that the alien murder conviction is an extremely serious negative factor which may be overcome only by a showing of unusual or outstanding equities,and noting that the alien opportunity to demonstrate rehabilitation is of necessity limited inasmuch as he is in the early stages of serving a fifteen and year prison sentence.under the circumstances,it would be hard to say that petitioner has met his burden of showing that he was prejudiced by the ins alleged delay.
conclusion 
having determined that petitioner is ineligible for c relief,we affirm the district court denial of his habeas corpus petition.
in order to determine whether the petitioner is entitled to seek section c relief,the majority examines whether iirira and aedpa had a retroactive effect on the petitioner decision to go to trial.the majority analysis appears flawless,but i respectfully suggest that it focuses on the wrong question.the statutes in question eliminated section c relief for aliens convicted of aggravated felonies.the pertinent question,therefore,is whether those statutes retroactively impose additional disabilities on aliens who,prior to the statutes enactments,were convicted of an aggravated felony.applying the familiar retroactivity analysis to the past event of conviction,rather than the past decision to go to trial,reveals that iirira and aedpa imposed an obvious additional legal consequence on those previously convicted of an aggravated felony,certain,instead of possible,deportation.although no one in the petitioner position could point to any reliance associated with the past event of conviction,reliance is simply not a prerequisite to a determination that a statute operates retroactively.accordingly,i conclude that iirira and aedpa apply retroactively to any person convicted of an aggravated felony prior to the statutes enactment,and i must therefore respectfully dissent from the holding in this case.
identifying the relevant past event 
the touchstone of retroactivity analysis is landgraf usi film products,d.landgraf both confirmed the strong presumption against applying statutes retroactively,absent express legislative intent to the contrary,and established the analytical framework for determining whether a statute operates retroactively.the supreme court held that a statute applies retroactively if the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.id.at.determining whether a statute attaches new legal consequences to a past event,and thus whether the statute operates retroactively,is not a mechanical exercise.rather,it involves a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.id.emphasis supplied.the determination is one on which familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations offer sound guidance.id.
under landgraf,then,one must determine the relevant past event in order to undertake retroactivity analysis.iirira and aedpa elimination of section c relief for aggravated felons could conceivably attach new legal consequences to any of at least four past events the criminal conduct the agreement to plead guilty for convictions obtained by plea the decision to go to trial for convictions obtained by verdict and the conviction.the second circuit has,at various times,analyzed the retroactivity of iirira and aedpa with respect to three of these four but conviction.the supreme court has,as yet,considered only one guilty plea.
this court first considered criminal conduct as the relevant past event in cyr,cir.cyr observed in dicta that the elimination of section c relief attached no new legal consequence to criminal conduct because,it is the conviction,not the underlying criminal act,that triggers the disqualification from c relief.id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.this dicta became law in domond,cir quoting cyr.domond holding was reaffirmed,on the same grounds,in khan ashcroft,cir.in both cases,the court also rejected the argument that considerations of reliance required it to deem the elimination of section c relief a new consequence of the criminal conduct.the court observed that it would border on the absurd to argue that an alien would not have committed a crime had he known that he would be denied the possibility of section c relief domond,at see also khan,at it can not reasonably be argued that aliens committed crimes in reliance on such a possibility of c relief.
the guilty plea as the relevant event was considered by both the second circuit and the supreme court in the cyr decisions.this court held that elimination of section c relief did attach new legal consequences to the decision to plead guilty it is likely that a legal resident would,because of the possibility of receiving a lighter sentence,only decide to concede guilt to a crime that renders him or her removable in order to be eligible for relief from removal.cyr,at.the supreme court agreed and added the observation that n ow that prosecutors have received the benefit of these plea agreements,agreements that were likely facilitated by the aliens belief in continued eligibility for c relief,it would surely be contrary to familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations to hold that iirira subsequent restrictions deprive them of any possibility of such relief.cyr,at.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.
the decision to go to alternative to the decision to plead considered as a relevant past event in rankine reno,cir.in rankine,the court concluded that the elimination of section c relief attached no new consequence to that decision.the petitioners decided instead to go to trial,a decision that,standing alone,had no impact on their immigration status.unless and until they were convicted of their underlying crimes,the petitioners could not be deported.id.at.the court also rejected the argument that the consequence was the upsetting of petitioners settled expectation or reliance interest that section c relief would be available despite the decision to go to trial.here,petitioners neither did anything nor surrendered any rights that would give rise to a comparable to cyr reliance interest.id.at.this latter the upsetting of a reliance interest was not a new consequence was categorically affirmed in swaby ashcroft,cir.
ii.the relevance of conviction 
not one of the decisions cited above addressed the question whether the elimination of section c relief has a retroactive effect on the past event of conviction.in my view there is no doubt that the elimination of such relief attaches a new legal consequence to the event of conviction.the law,after all,renders deportable a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony,a iii,and iirira and aedpa eliminated section c relief for any alien convicted of an aggravated felony.moreover,cyr,domond and rankine expressly acknowledge that it is conviction that triggers elimination of section c relief.cyr,at domond,at rankine,at.
elimination of section c relief imposes obvious legal consequences on the past event of conviction.as the supreme court has said,t here is a clear difference for the purposes of retroactivity analysis,between facing possible deportation and facing certain deportation.cyr,at.the latest possible moment that either of these,certain deportation or possible attach is at the time of conviction the instant before the jury returns its verdict,the defendant is subject to no immigration consequence the instant after,he is subject to an immigration consequence.which consequence a defendant ultimately suffers depends on whether statutes passed after his conviction apply to him.therefore,application of a new law to the past event of conviction results in a different consequence than would otherwise precise concern of landgraf.
it is true that,because conviction is an event that occurs to,and not an action taken by,the defendant,considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance and settled expectations are not particularly useful guides to whether the statutes retroactively affect the consequences of conviction.that fact in no way affects the landgraf analysis.
on several occasions,including in landgraf itself,the supreme court reached the ultimate new legal consequences attach to a past the need to resort to these guiding principles.see,landgraf,at.noting fair notice considerations muted,but finding that increase in civil liability for past conduct was a retroactive effect rivers roadway express,d holding imposition of new legal liabilities for past conduct was retroactive hughes aircraft united states ex rel.schumer,d holding statute that expanded cause of action and thus increased liability had retroactive effect.in each of these cases the supreme court found it sufficiently obvious that the association of new or expanded legal disability with a past event altered the legal consequences of that event.the situation is not substantially different here the new laws expand the disability associated with conviction from possible deportation to certain deportation 
moreover,although the familiar considerations identified in landgraf may not be applicable in the present situation,one of the fundamental concerns of the landgraf court informs the analysis.the supreme court noted a particular concern raised by retroactive statutes,namely,that because t he legislature unmatched powers allow it to sweep away settled expectations suddenly and without individualized consideration it may be tempted to use retroactive legislation as a means of retribution against unpopular groups or individuals.landgraf,at.in cyr,the supreme court expressed its concern that immigrants are particularly vulnerable to the unintended retroactive effects of legislation.see cyr,at.
finally,this court has expressly acknowledged that the elimination of section c relief attaches new legal consequences to the event of conviction.in both domond and rankine,when rejecting arguments pertaining to other past events,the court held that the consequence of elimination of section c relief did not attach until conviction.in domond the court held that,it is the conviction,not the underlying criminal act,that triggers the disqualification from c relief.domond,at emphasis added.similarly,in rankine the court observed that,unless and until they were convicted of their underlying crimes,the petitioners could not be deported.rankine,at emphasis added 
undeniably,there is some tension between the rankine decision and my opinion in this case.the petitioners in rankine,like this petitioner,were convicted prior to the elimination of section c relief.nevertheless,the rankine decision does not discuss the retroactive effect on the event of conviction,and it offers no explanation conviction is viewed as the relevant elimination of section c relief is not retroactive.consequently,given the analysis provided by the supreme court in landgraf and cyr,along with the fact that domond and even rankine itself acknowledge that conviction is the point at which immigration consequences attach,i see no other possible conclusion than that rankine must be read narrowly as holding only that the elimination of the availability of section c relief does not attach new consequences to the decision to proceed to trial see restrepo,wl,at rankine resolved the narrower question of whether an alien detrimentally relied on the continued availability of c relief in deciding to go to trial rather than accepting a plea.
iii.reliance as a guide 
one possible reason that conviction has never been considered as the past event in analyzing the effect of the elimination of section c relief is that,ever since the supreme court ruling in cyr,there has been an overwhelming tendency in immigration retroactivity cases to focus on the question of detrimental reliance.if reliance is the central issue,then retroactivity analysis must focus on some action taken,and a passive event,like conviction,can easily be overlooked.although there is no denying that considerations of reliance are often illuminating in making retroactivity determinations indeed,the presence of reliance may very well provide the most compelling indication of unfair retroactivity,detrimental reliance is not the sine qua non of retroactivity analysis 
on a number of occasions,the supreme court has concluded that statutes operate retroactively without considering reliance by the affected parties.see,landgraf.rivers,d hughes aircraft,d.conversely,in at least one case the supreme court has held that a statute did not operate retroactively even when there appeared to have been reliance by the affected party.see martin hadix,d.
similarly,in this court principal immigration cases,although the presence of reliance has been considered when evaluating retroactivity as in cyr,the absence of reliance,standing alone,has not compelled the conclusion that a statute lacks retroactive effect.as discussed above,reliance was discussed in domond,khan,and rankine,but only in the negative,to rebut the petitioners arguments that their reliance constituted a sufficient reason for finding retroactive effect.the affirmative reason given in those cases for why there was no retroactive effect on the events considered was,as noted before,that deportation consequences do not attach until conviction.in other words,there is no support for the proposition that a showing of reliance is a necessary condition to a finding of retroactive effect see generally hughes aircraft,at.noting landgraf described sufficient,not necessary,conditions for establishing impermissible retroactivity.cyr does not hold otherwise.the existence of reliance supported the holding in cyr,but the holding in cyr does not require the existence of reliance.
