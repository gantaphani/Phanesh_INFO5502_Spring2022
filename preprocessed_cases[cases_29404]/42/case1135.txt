this appeal arises from the denial by the united states district court for the district of connecticut squatrito,of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus brought pursuant to against respondent john ashcroft,attorney general of the united states the government.the district court denied the petition,reasoning that because petitioner conviction of third degree assault in violation of section of the connecticut general statutes section constituted a crime of violence as defined in a a,petitioner was removable as an aggravated felon under a a iii.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with directions to grant the petition.
facts and procedural background 
petitioner jaroslaw chrzanoski petitioner or chrzanoski is a citizen of poland and a lawful permanent resident of the united states.on october,he pled guilty to assault in the third degree in violation of section of the connecticut general statutes,a class a misdemeanor,and was sentenced to a suspended sentence and three years probation 
in may,the immigration and naturalization service ins commenced removal proceedings against petitioner,alleging that because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony,he was removable pursuant to section a a iii of the immigration and nationality act ina,a a iii providing that a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.an immigration judge ij determined that intentional assault in the third degree under connecticut law included as an element the use of force.thus,the ij found that petitioner conviction constituted a crime of violence under a defining crime of violence as an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another and,therefore,was an aggravated felony as defined in section a f of the ina,a f defining aggravated felony as a crime of violence as defined in section of title,but not including a purely political offense for which the term of imprisonment sic at least one year.the ij also determined that petitioner was ineligible for any relief from removal.as a result,on july,the ij ordered petitioner removed to poland.
petitioner unsuccessfully challenged this determination with the board of immigration appeals bia.the bia recognized that t he focus of a is on the statutory elements of the offense and found that intentionally causing injury to another involves the use of force.it then found that petitioner plea transcript revealed that he had caused injury by striking a person in the head and pushing her to the ground,arguably intentional acts that certainly involved the use of physical force.therefore,it found that petitioner had been convicted of a crime of violence within the meaning of a and thus an aggravated felony under section a f of the ina.the bia accordingly dismissed petitioner appeal,thus rendering the order of removal final.
petitioner then sought relief from the final order of removal by filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in the district court.by written memorandum dated july,the district court denied this petition,finding that petitioner was convicted of assault because he hit somebody,which constitutes a crime of violence under a.because a crime of violence satisfies the definition of aggravated felony under a f,the petitioner is removable.
this appeal followed.
on appeal from the denial of a habeas petition brought pursuant to,we review the merits of the petition de novo.see kuhali reno,cir.on review of a removal decision,we owe no deference to the bia in its interpretation of criminal statutes that it does not administer,but grant chevron,natural resources defense council,d deference to the bia construction of the ina,which it does administer.kuhali,at internal citations omitted.thus,although we apply chevron deference to the bia interpretation of the ina,we review de novo the question whether connecticut third degree assault statute constitutes a crime of violence under a.see dalton ashcroft,cir we also note that while we apply chevron deference to the bia interpretation of the ina,we review de novo its interpretation of federal or state criminal statutes.accordingly,because the ina defines an aggravated felony in a f by reference to a crime of violence in,we review de novo the question whether new york vehicle and traffic law section constitutes a crime of violence that,in turn,constitutes a deportable aggravated felony under the ina.internal citations omitted 
pursuant to a a iii,a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.aggravated felony is defined at a f as a crime of violence as defined in section of title,but not including a purely political offense for which the term of imprisonment sic at least one year.section,then,defines crime of violence as 
a an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,or 
b any other offense that is a felony and that,by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.
the parties agree that petitioner removal is based on a and not b,as assault in the third degree is a misdemeanor under connecticut law,see.b.thus,our discussion solely concerns the requirements of a.
under the plain language of a,use of force must be an element of the offense for that offense to be a crime of violence under a.for example,the bia has held that sexual abuse in the second degree is not a crime of violence under a because the offense does not involve as an element the use of violent or destructive physical force.in re small,wl bia although a does not define use of force,use means t he application or employment of something,black law dictionary ed,and force means p ower,violence,or pressure directed against a person or thing,id.at.the word element similarly is not defined by statute but has a meaning in the law.see id.at defining elements of crime as t he constituent parts of a crime that the prosecution must prove to sustain a conviction.an element of a crime is a fact that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to obtain a conviction.see apprendi new jersey,d observing that a criminal defendant is entitled to a jury determination that he is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged,beyond a reasonable doubt internal citations omitted and alteration in apprendi in re winship,d holding that the due process clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.
petitioner pled guilty to assault in the third degree in violation of section of the connecticut general statutes,which provides,in pertinent part,that 
a person is guilty of assault in the third degree when with intent to cause physical injury to another person,he causes such injury to such person or to a third person or he recklessly causes serious physical injury to another person or with criminal negligence,he causes physical injury to another person by means of a deadly weapon,a dangerous instrument or an electronic defense weapon.
a.petitioner judgment of conviction cited generally to section and did not identify the subsection with which petitioner was charged and to which he pled guilty.the government does not argue that a conviction under section a or would constitute a crime of violence under a and therefore support an order of removal.rather,it asserts solely that a conviction under section a for intentional assault in the third degree constitutes a crime of violence and that petitioner,in fact,was convicted under section a of intentional assault in the third degree.because the subsections under section a differ only on the mens rea requirement,the precise subsection under which petitioner was convicted is not relevant to the question presented here.we therefore assume for the purposes of this analysis that petitioner was convicted of intentional assault in the third degree in violation of section a see connecticut tanzella,observing that difference between reckless assault and intentional assault is simply one of mental state these are not different crimes but simply different means of committing the same crime.
the connecticut supreme court has held that section a require s the state to prove that the defendant had intentionally caused physical injury.see also.selected jury instructions crim,requiring the state to prove that the defendant intended to cause physical injury to another and that the defendant caused such physical injury to the intended victim or to some third person.connecticut law defines physical injury as impairment of physical condition or pain.nothing in that definition nor in the language of section a requires the government to prove that force was used in causing the injury.nor has the government cited us to any authority indicating that connecticut courts ever instruct juries that they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that force was used in order to convict a defendant of violating section a.
the government concedes that connecticut intentional assault in the third degree statute does not expressly identify the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force as an element for conviction.the government argues,however,that force is implicit in the statute requirement of the intentional causation of physical injury thus,the government contends,even though section a lacks an explicit textual reference to physical force,it imposes an equivalent requirement that a defendant intend to cause physical injury.
petitioner responds that there is a difference between the causation of an injury and an injury causation by the use of physical force.we agree.in dalton,we considered whether a new york state felony conviction for operating a vehicle while intoxicated was a crime of violence under b at.in holding that not all violations of the new york statute are by their nature,in the words of b,crimes of violence,we rejected the government argument that there is a negligible difference between risk of injury and risk of the use of physical force 
while it may be true that all driving involves some risk of an accident and drunk driving increases that risk,upon closer examination,this reasoning begs the question of whether an accident is something that can be referred to as involving the use of physical force.such an argument equates the use of physical force with harm or injury,thus returning the inquiry to the question of whether there is any material difference between the risk of the use of physical force and the risk of injury.
there are many crimes that involve a substantial risk of injury but do not involve the use of force.crimes of gross negligence or reckless endangerment,such as leaving an infant alone near a pool,involve a risk of injury without the use of force.statutes criminalizing the use,possession distribution of dangerous drugs and other controlled substances also underscore the fact that some criminal conduct may involve a substantial risk of injury or harm without at the same time involving the use of physical force.other courts have also recognized the logical fallacy inherent in reasoning that simply because all conduct involving a risk of the use of physical force also involves a risk of injury then the converse must also be true.

although our analysis in dalton did not concern a,its discussion of the difference between conduct that risks the causation of physical injury and conduct that requires the use of physical force is relevant here.we find that just as risk of injury does not necessarily involve the risk of the use of force,the intentional causation of injury does not necessarily involve the use of force.see persaud mcelroy,d,concluding that a conviction under is not a crime of violence under a,because a conviction under,while requiring proof of physical injury,does not require,as an element of the offense,that the defendant use physical force to inflict that injury.given the elements of section a under connecticut law,it seems an individual could be convicted of intentional assault in the third degree for injury caused not by physical force,but by guile,deception,or even deliberate omission.certainly,connecticut recognizes that even second degree assault,which qualifies as a class d felony,can be committed without any physical force.see state nunes,affirming conviction for assault in the second degree,which requires,inter alia,that the defendant intentionally cause stupor,unconsciousness or other physical impairment or injury to another person,based on the defendant placement of a tranquilizer in the victim drink.in the exercise of prosecutorial discretion,the same conduct at issue in nunes could presumably be charged as the lesser included offense of third degree assault.moreover,human experience suggests numerous examples of intentionally causing physical injury without the use of force,such as a doctor who deliberately withholds vital medicine from a sick patient.in sum,while there are undoubtedly many ways in which force could be used to commit third degree assault under connecticut law,the plain language of the statute does not make use of force an explicit or implicit element of the crime.rather,its language is broad enough to cover myriad other schemes,not involving force,whereby physical injury can be caused intentionally.
the government attempts to avoid the clear language of a requiring that use of force is an element of the crime by citing to legislative history,an argument that the bia found persuasive in in re martin,wl bia en banc but a is unambiguous on its face that use of force must be an element of the crime,and as the supreme court recently stated,reference to legislative history is inappropriate when the text of the statute is unambiguous.dep t of housing urban dev.rucker,d.
we reject the government invitation to ignore the plain meaning of force,as the government has failed to demonstrate that the plain meaning is absurd,futile,or merely unreasonable and plainly at variance with the policy of the ina.see united states am.trucking ass.the government at oral argument was undoubtedly correct in arguing that congress intent in drafting was to expand the list of crimes that constitute aggravated felonies and thus subject alien defendants to removal.this general intent,however,presents us with no reason to ignore the deliberate structure through which congress chose to accomplish this task.through b,congress sought to classify as crimes of violence felonies that,by their nature,involve a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used.it did not require that felonies have as an element of the offense the use of force.but when congress considered which misdemeanors should be deemed crimes of violence,and thus aggravated felonies under the ina,it chose a materially different definition.namely,as discussed above,congress elected to reach only those misdemeanors that have as an element the use of force against the person or property of another.through this structure,congress chose to apply a less restrictive definition of crime of violence to felonies than to misdemeanors,and our analysis is faithful to this policy decision.thus,rather than being at variance with congress intent,our interpretation of a honors congress intent to expand the list of crimes that constitute aggravated felonies by defining as crimes of violence only those misdemeanors that include as an element the use of force.
our decision not to ignore the plain language of a is particularly appropriate in this case,given the serious consequences of a decision to find this crime a removable crime of violence.as we recently recognized
