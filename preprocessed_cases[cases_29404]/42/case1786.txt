jorge armando appeals his sentence,arguing that the district court erred in increasing his sentence for obstruction of justice under the united states sentencing guidelines he also argues that the district court erred in refusing to reduce his offense level for acceptance of responsibility.for the following reasons,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
a native and citizen of mexico,was removed and deported from the united states to mexico in august,after a conviction for an aggravated felony,distribution of cocaine,on march.in october,the defendant was found in the united states and deported to mexico through the port of entry at laredo,texas.on or about march,was again found in the united states.he had not applied for or received permission from the attorney general or the secretary of the department of homeland security of the united states for reentry into the country after his deportation.
on april,the government filed a complaint alleging that was found in the united states after being ordered removed and deported subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony.that day,made his initial appearance before the magistrate judge.when asked if he could understand and speak english clearly,said he could.nonetheless,the magistrate judge asked if he would like an interpreter for the hearing.in english,replied,if she here,yes.
on april,was indicted for illegal reentry after deportation in violation of a and b and,and.the magistrate judge held a detention hearing,which attended and participated in without the assistance of an interpreter.from this,the district court inferred that the magistrate judge and attorney had determined that did not need an interpreter.on april,was arraigned for the first time.he pleaded not guilty.no interpreter was present,and when asked by the district judge if he had read the indictment,he replied in english that he had.
was rearraigned to change his plea on june.an interpreter was present for the first two defendants called,who were represented by the same attorney as.he,however,did not request an interpreter or seek the assistance of the interpreter present.was sworn in and warned that answering any questions falsely could result in prosecution for perjury or making a false statement.again,the district judge asked if he could read,write and understand and speak the english language proficiently.under oath,he replied,yes,and proceeded to actively engage the district court using conversational english.first,identified himself.then,the following conversation took place in english when was called to enter his plea 
the court how far did you go in school 
the defendant sixth grade.
the court and where did you go to school 
the defendant down in el paso.
the court in el paso 
the defendant yes.i go a couple of years here in fort worth.
the court what school did you go to here 
the defendant i ca remember.it was on jennings street and rosedale.
their exchange continued with telling the court that he worked in the oil fields and answering yes and no questions about his mental and emotional health,as well as whether he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
after reading the indictment,including the reference to his prior aggravated felony conviction for distribution of cocaine,the district judge asked if he understood the charges.he replied,yes,but i confused on the distribution,and then clarified,yes,i understand,but i confused on the charge of distribution.the district court determined that the distribution charge was surplusage in the indictment,and that the prior conviction would increase the applicable statutory penalty range.then,the court presented the factual resume and asked if had read it before he signed it.replied,i read it before i signed it.when asked if he had any complaint with his counsel,said,no,no complaints at all.the district court conveyed the maximum sentence for the offense charged,and,satisfied that understood,accepted his guilty plea.on june,a probation officer interviewed in the presence of his attorney in english without any difficulty.
at his sentencing hearing on september,for the first time,requested an interpreter,claiming that he did not clearly understand everything that had happened during the rearraignment.the district court expressed concern about the expense and delay of using an interpreter when there is no need and inquired why he had not requested one at any previous hearing.defense counsel said that past experience before the district court led him to request an interpreter because although he understood the prior proceedings fine,he wanted an interpreter at his sentencing hearing to understand well.the district court opined that the interpreter was not necessary because had not required one at his detention hearing or at either of his prior arraignments,and he seemed to communicate and understand english well when he pleaded guilty.however,due to concern that his request would raise an issue as to the validity of his guilty plea,the district court set aside the plea,warning that an improper request for an interpreter could have an effect on his sentencing.
at a third arraignment on october,with the aid of an interpreter,again pleaded guilty to illegal reentry.at that time,the district court ordered the probation officer to conduct an inquiry into whether should still receive a reduction in his offense level based on acceptance of responsibility,and whether he should receive an enhancement for obstruction of justice,and to include the relevant findings and conclusions on those issues in an addendum to the psr.
on november,the probation officer in the presence of his attorney and an interpreter.however,communicated clearly with the officer in english.based on this interview,plus the findings of the district court,the addendum recommended a enhancement for obstruction of justice for providing materially false information to a judge regarding his need for an interpreter.sentencing guidelines manual cmt.f.also,the psr recommended that the reduction for acceptance of responsibility under was no longer warranted.these determinations increased total offense level from to,and increased his sentence range from months to months.objected to the amended psr,but at his sentencing hearing on december,the district court overruled his objections and expressly adopted the psr as to both findings of fact and conclusions of law,as modified or supplemented by the addendum,and any findings and conclusions made from the bench.accordingly,he was sentenced to months in federal prison and three years supervised release,and assessed a fine.filed a timely notice of appeal and now challenges the district court calculation of his sentencing range,the reasonableness of his sentence,and the constitutionality of b.
ii.discussion 
obstruction of justice 
challenges the enhancement of his sentence for obstruction of justice under of the guidelines.specifically,he argues that the district court factual finding that he willfully obstructed justice by falsely insisting under oath to the judge during sentencing that he needed an interpreter when in fact he did not was clearly erroneous,and that,even if the statements were made falsely,with the intent to obstruct justice,they were immaterial.
a district court interpretation or application of the sentencing guidelines is reviewed de novo,and its factual findings,such as a finding of obstruction of justice,are reviewed for clear error.united states adam,cir.there is no clear error if the district court finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole.united states harms,cir.further,we give deference to the credibility determinations of the district court.id.
section provides that a defendant calculated offense level can be increased by two levels if a the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded,or attempted to obstruct or impede,the administration of justice during the course of the investigation,prosecution,or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction,and b the obstructive conduct related to i the defendant offense of conviction and any relevant conduct sentencing guidelines manual.according to the commentary to,such conduct includes
