several years after entering the country illegally,guilebaldo ramos sanchez was apprehended by the immigration and naturalization service ins,which then initiated deportation proceedings against him.approximately a year later,a hearing notice was sent to sanchez by certified mail to the address that he had provided the ins.the notice was returned by the postal service with the stamp undeliverable as order expired.
sanchez failed to appear at the scheduled hearing and was ordered deported in absentia.nearly years later,immigration officials arrested sanchez,who then moved to reopen his deportation proceedings.the immigration judge ij denied his motion,reasoning that sanchez had failed to establish reasonable cause for failing to appear at his hearing and that his motion was untimely.
sanchez appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia.the bia dismissed his appeal,concluding that sanchez had failed to rebut the strong presumption of effective service that arose because the hearing notice was sent by certified mail to the address that sanchez had provided.in addition,the bia agreed with the ij determination that sanchez motion to reopen was untimely.for the reasons set forth below,we deny sanchez petition for review.
background 
the relevant facts in this case are undisputed.sanchez is a citizen of mexico who entered the united states illegally in april.he was arrested in may by an agent of the ins and personally served with an order to show cause osc,which charged that he was deportable.enforcement functions of the ins have since been transferred to the department of homeland security by of the homeland security act of,stat.the osc informed sanchez,among other things,that a deportation hearing would be scheduled before an ij he must provide a current address and notify the immigration court of any address changes a notice containing the time and place of the deportation hearing would be mailed to him at the last address he provided and if he failed to appear at the hearing,the ij could order sanchez deported in absentia.sanchez provided an address of dean street,adrian,michigan.
the ins initiated deportation proceedings against sanchez in march by filing the osc in immigration court.see a providing that immigration proceedings begin when a charging document is filed with the immigration court.in may,the immigration court mailed sanchez a hearing notice by certified mail to the dean street address,informing him that his deportation hearing was scheduled for july.the notice was returned to the immigration court with the postal service stamp undeliverable as order expired.when sanchez did not appear for the hearing,the ij ordered him deported in absentia.
on april,sanchez was arrested by immigration and customs enforcement agents.he filed a motion in immigration court two days later to reopen his deportation proceedings.sanchez argued that because he did not receive the hearing notice,he was entitled to reopening under c b of the immigration and nationality act ina,codified at.he further asserted that he was not at fault for failing to receive the notice because he was still living at the dean street address when the notice was sent.the ij denied the motion to reopen in may,finding that the hearing notice was properly sent by certified mail to the dean street address that sanchez had provided,and the motion was untimely under b iii because sanchez filed it more than days after entry of the in absentia deportation order.
sanchez appealed the ij ruling to the bia.in addition to repeating the arguments that he made to the ij,sanchez noted that the hearing notice was returned to the immigration court as undeliverable.he argued that his motion was therefore timely because a motion to reopen an in absentia deportation order may be filed at any time if the alien demonstrates that he did not receive proper notice.see c b.
the bia affirmed the ij decision.although the hearing notice was returned undelivered by the postal service,the bia concluded that sanchez received notice pursuant to matter of grijalva,i n bia.the bia reasoned that,under grijalva,a hearing notice sent by certified mail to the alien last known address establishes by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that the alien received written notice of the deportation hearing within the meaning of c t here is no requirement that the certified mail return receipt be signed by the alien or a responsible person at his address to effect service.quoting grijalva,at.the bia further reasoned that where a notice of hearing is sent through the united states postal service and there is proof of attempted delivery and notification of certified mail,a strong presumption of effective service arises.citing grijalva,at.
in this case,the record shows that the immigration court sent the hearing notice by certified mail to sanchez dean street address.sanchez never notified the immigration court of any address changes.although sanchez contended that he was living at the dean street address when the hearing notice was sent,he submitted no proof to support his claim.under the rules set forth in grijalva,the bia determined that sanchez had failed to rebut the presumption that he had received proper notice of his hearing.the bia therefore dismissed sanchez appeal.
sanchez filed a petition for review and a motion to stay removal with this court in july.in october,we granted his motion to stay removal pending the outcome of his petition.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
where the bia provides its own reasoning for denying a motion to reopen rather than summarily affirming the ij,we review the bia decision as the final agency determination.khalili holder,cir.our review is conducted under the standard.acquaah holder,cir.the bia abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily,irrationally,or contrary to law.sswajje.ashcroft,cir.if the bia is interpreting a statute that it administers and the statute is silent or ambiguous on a specific issue,then we defer to the bia interpretation of the statute so long as the interpretation is reasonable.ins.
governing law 
the governing law in this case is found in also referred to as ina,which was repealed by b of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,division c of,stat.iirira.provisions markedly similar to now appear in and.these successor statutes use the term removal instead of deportation because of a change in the statutory language wrought by iirira.see united states,cir.for consistency,we will continue to use the word deportation when discussing both the past and present statutes.
although was repealed by iirira,this section continues to govern an alien who is in deportation proceedings as of iirira effective date,which was april.see iirira b,a,c.sanchez deportation proceedings began on march,when the ins filed the osc pertaining to sanchez with the immigration court.see a.therefore governs this appeal.
discussion 
the bia denied sanchez motion to reopen on the grounds that he received proper notice under c b,and his motion was untimely.on appeal,sanchez challenges both of these grounds.we analyze each in turn below.
denial of motion to notice issue 
the first issue in this case is whether the bia abused its discretion when it denied sanchez motion to reopen deportation proceedings on the grounds that sanchez had received proper notice within the meaning of c b.an alien who fails to attend his deportation hearing after the government has provided proper written notice of the time and place of the hearing is subject to being deported in absentia if the government proves by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that he is deportable.c.sanchez challenges the propriety of the notice,but does not question the propriety of the ij entering the in absentia deportation order under c.
with exceptions not relevant here,a hearing notice is sufficient if sent by certified mail to the most recent address provided by the alien.a,c.there is no requirement that the alien actually receive the notice before an immigration court can order the alien deported in absentia.arrieta ins,cir in re grijalva,bia.
the successor statutes to are materially the same
