syed mahmood petitions for review of the decision by the board of immigration appeals bia dismissing his appeal by agreeing with the immigration judge ij denial of his motion to reopen as untimely filed.though we conclude that mahmood allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel provide a basis for equitably tolling the relevant filing deadlines,we nonetheless deny the petition because he failed to exercise the requisite degree of diligence.
facts and procedural history 
mahmood,a native and citizen of bangladesh,entered the united states in february.in june,the former immigration and naturalization service ins concluded that mahmood had presented invalid documents when he entered the united states and issued to him a notice to appear for possible removal.mahmood,however,failed to appear for his hearing before an ij in january,and he was ordered removed in absentia under b a.he moved to reopen the proceedings.after determining that mahmood had been severely ill and unable to attend the hearing,the ij concluded that exceptional circumstances warranted granting the motion.see b c i providing that an in absentia removal order may be rescinded if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances.
the ij scheduled another hearing in march,but again mahmood did not appear,and again the ij ordered his removal in absentia.in april,he filed a second motion to reopen,asserting a medical procedure had prevented him from appearing for the rescheduled hearing.the ij concluded that the procedure removal of a perirectal abscess was not sufficiently serious to constitute exceptional circumstances and denied the motion in may.included in the certified administrative record is a cover to charles grutman,mahmood counsel at that time,and dated june,to attach the ij decision.
well over a year later,in november,grutman received a bag and baggage letter ordering mahmood to report for removal to bangladesh.in response,grutman wrote to the ij and asserted that he had never been notified of the denial of the motion to reopen 
in december,mahmood counsel appealed the may order to the bia,and it dismissed the appeal as untimely in june.mahmood retained new counsel and filed his third motion to reopen in july,alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and seeking an adjustment of status in light of an approved petition filed by karen mahmood n√©e zimmerman,who had married mahmood in april.the ij denied the motion in september on the ground that it had been filed over three years after the ij issued the in absentia order that was the subject of the second motion to reopen,and thus long after the applicable time limits for moving to reopen had passed.the bia dismissed mahmood second appeal in august,and he timely petitioned for our court review.

iii.discussion 
equitable tolling and ineffectiveness of counsel 
generally,a motion to reopen must be filed within days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal.c c i with respect to in absentia orders of removal,an alien has days to file a motion to reopen that seeks to demonstrate that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances.b c i.the bia concluded that mahmood motion was untimely under both deadlines 
when this petition for review was filed,courts of appeal were divided over whether the deadlines in for moving to reopen in absentia orders of removal were mandatory and jurisdictional or,like a statute of limitations,subject to equitable tolling.compare,anin reno,cir holding that the deadline in former c a for filing motions to reopen deportation proceedings is jurisdictional and mandatory,with pervaiz gonzales,cir holding that the statutory deadline for motions to reopen in absentia proceedings is not jurisdictional and remanding for further proceedings in light of counsel alleged ineffective assistance,iavorski ins,cir holding that the period provided in former b for filing motions to reopen is subject to equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel,and lopez ins,cir holding that the time limit for motions to reopen an order of deportation under former c a is subject to equitable tolling 
subsequently,in borges gonzales,cir,we held that the b c i deadline is appropriately considered as analogous to a statute of limitations and,thus,subject to equitable tolling.id.at.in reaching this holding,we cited the old chancery rule for tolling on the ground of fraud.see also lopez,at discussing the old chancery rule providing that where a party has been injured by fraud and remains in ignorance of it without any fault or want of diligence or care on his part,the bar of the statute does not begin to run until the fraud is discovered internal quotation marks omitted reuther trs.of trucking employees,cir 
nevertheless,unlike the alien in borges,who alleged that he had been defrauded by an attorney and the attorney paralegal mahmood alleges that his attorney failed to notify him of the ij adverse ruling.at first glance,these allegations appear to be similar to those at issue in bejar ashcroft,cir,which the government contends controls the outcome here by dooming in the government view claims for tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel.in bejar,the alien,who was removed in absentia,alleged ineffective assistance based on her counsel failure to notify her of the ij adverse ruling,though bejar admitted that she had moved to another residence.id.at.without deciding whether ineffective assistance of counsel can serve as a basis for tolling,we concluded that bejar counsel did not render assistance sufficiently ineffective to justify tolling the applicable deadline.id.at.
as an initial matter and as already noted,other courts of appeal have recognized that ineffective assistance can serve as a basis for equitable tolling in immigration cases.bejar,which was decided,does not suggest that ineffective assistance is not a possible basis for tolling once one accepts,as we must in light of borges,that the deadlines are subject to tolling in at least some circumstances.
further,bejar is distinguishable.unlike mahmood,bejar contributed to her lack of notice by moving residences and failing to provide counsel with her new address.moreover,counsel receipt of the notice was undisputed in bejar.here,grutman letter claiming he received no notice is in tension with the bia finding that notice was sent.in this context,there are a number of possible scenarios.for example,it is possible that grutman failure to forward notice to mahmood was the result of his or his staff mishandling of the letter,perhaps through mere inadvertence or perhaps through gross deficiencies in his office administrative procedures.it also possible,as mahmood asserts,that grutman received the notice,never forwarded it to him,and then made misrepresentations to him and the court by claiming he grutman had never received it.even worse,grutman may have agreed to represent mahmood and accepted payment without intending ever to represent his client adequately.thus,through no fault of his own in his version of the events,mahmood was deprived of further proceedings in this case.in this context,the allegations of ineffective assistance would warrant further consideration by the bia or ij which issued their decisions well before borges,except that for the reasons discussed below his claims fail for lack of diligence 
due diligence 
though the attorney conduct at issue is sufficient,if substantiated,to provide a basis for equitable tolling,mahmood claims still fail for lack of diligence.borges,at discussing the government argument that the alien was ineligible for relief because he did not exercise due diligence iavorski
