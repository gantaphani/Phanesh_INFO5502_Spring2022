immigration 
the panel granted petition for review of the board of immigration appeals decision concluding that his conviction for fleeing from a police officer under california vehicle code is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude that rendered him statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal.
in holding that conviction is not a crime of moral turpitude,the panel accorded minimal deference to the bia decision due to flaws in its reasoning.
applying the categorical approach,the panel viewed the least of the acts criminalized under california vehicle code,and concluded that an individual can be convicted under subsection b for eluding police while committing three traffic violations that can not be characterized as vile or depraved.therefore,the panel held that california vehicle code is not a crime of moral turpitude because the conduct criminalized does not necessarily create the risk of harm that characterizes a crime of moral turpitude.
the panel also held that the modified categorical approach does not apply because the elements of california vehicle code are clearly indivisible.
schroeder,circuit judge 
we deal once again with the question of whether a crime of conviction supporting an order of removal was a crime of moral turpitude.such a conviction renders noncitizens statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal.b c.in this case,petitioner moises was convicted under california law for fleeing from a police officer.the california statute under which he was convicted is similar to many other statutes in that it criminalizes willful flight while driving in a wanton or reckless manner.it is unusual,however,in that it defines such conduct as including driving while violating traffic laws,some of which would not rise to a level of seriousness to qualify as a crime of moral turpitude.because the test is whether all of the conduct covered by the statute was turpetudinous,we grant the petition.
the california statute is in two parts,with part a providing the elements of the crime and part b defining the willful or wanton disregard element.it states 
a if a person flees or attempts to elude a pursuing peace officer in violation of section and the pursued vehicle is driven in a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property,the person driving the vehicle,upon conviction,shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison,or by confinement in the county jail for not less than six months nor more than one year.the court may also impose a fine of not less than one thousand dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars,or may impose both that imprisonment or confinement and fine.
b for purposes of this section,a willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property includes,but is not limited to,driving while fleeing or attempting to elude a pursuing peace officer during which time either three or more violations that are assigned a traffic violation point count under section occur,or damage to property occurs.
cal.vehicle code 
in holding that petitioner conviction was a crime of moral turpitude,the board of immigration appeals bia followed its earlier decision in matter of,which involved conviction under a washington statute.that statute provided 
any driver of a motor vehicle who wilfully fails or refuses to immediately bring his vehicle to a stop and who drives his vehicle in a manner indicating a wanton or wilful disregard for the lives or property of others while attempting to elude a pursuing police vehicle,after being given a visual or audible signal to bring the vehicle to a stop,shall be guilty of a class c felony.
matter of,at citing.code.
the washington statute did not contain the unusual california subsection allowing for conviction on the basis of three traffic violations.indeed,in our research of other cases in this and other circuits involving statutes criminalizing similar flight conduct,we have found none that contained a provision similar to the california three violation definition in subsection b.
our court has dealt with the california statute only once,and then in an unpublished,divided,memorandum disposition.lynch,app x cir.while the majority held that the statute defined a crime of moral turpitude,a lengthy dissenting opinion,focusing on subsection b,reached a different conclusion.we now find ourselves in agreement with the dissent conclusion.
background 
petitioner is a native and citizen of mexico.he first entered the united states in.on july,petitioner fled from the police while driving a vehicle,for which he was charged with evading while driving recklessly,in violation of california vehicle code,along with other crimes.petitioner pleaded guilty to violating,admitting that he was fleeing in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of others.in march,petitioner was granted voluntary departure.he reentered the united states the following month and has remained in the country since then.
on may,petitioner received a notice to appear,which alleged that he was removable as an alien who entered the united states without inspection.see a a i.petitioner conceded removability but applied for cancellation of removal pursuant to b,arguing that removal would cause exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his united states citizen wife and four citizen children.
in briefing to the immigration judge ij,petitioner sought cancellation of removal,arguing his conviction under was not a crime of moral turpitude.on january,the ij rejected petitioner claim,holding that is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude and that therefore petitioner was statutorily ineligible for removal under the immigration and nationality act,a,b c.
the bia,in an unpublished decision,dismissed petitioner appeal on january,agreeing with the ij analysis that is categorically a crime involving moral turpitude.petitioner timely petitioned for review.
discussion 
the determination of whether a conviction under a criminal statute is categorically a crime of moral turpitude proceeds in two steps.first,we review the elements of the statute de novo,affording no deference to the bia conclusions.vinh tan nguyen holder,cir.next,we ask whether the elements of the statute of conviction fall within the generic federal definition of a crime involving moral turpitude.id.in doing so,we presume the conviction rested upon nothing more than the least of the acts criminalized.moncrieffe holder.
at this second step,we give some degree of deference to the bia decision,unless the bia did not support its decision with any reasoning.see rivera lynch,cir.if the bia relies on a precedential determination in concluding that a crime is one involving moral turpitude,then we apply chevron deference to the bia determination.id.at citing chevron nat.res.def.council.if not,then we defer to the bia determination only to the extent that it has the power to persuade.id.at citing skidmore swift.under skidmore,the persuasiveness of the bia decision depends on the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,and its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements.at.
here,the bia engaged in extensive analysis of whether california vehicle code qualified as a crime involving moral turpitude,but it did not rely on any directly controlling bia authority involving a statute like california.the bia instead relied on its earlier,published determination in matter of,that a washington state crime for eluding a pursuing police vehicle constituted a categorical crime involving moral turpitude.the washington statute at issue in matter of,though,differed from the california statute in this case.that is because while,like the california provision,it criminalized reckless flight,it contained no definition of recklessness,and more notably,nothing that would have allowed recklessness to be proved through acts that,standing alone,were not themselves necessarily dangerous.see.code.because the statute in matter of materially differs from california vehicle code,the bia determination in this case is entitled only to skidmore deference.
the extent of that deference in any particular case depends upon the persuasiveness of the
