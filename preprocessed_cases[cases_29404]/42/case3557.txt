mario is a native and citizen of chile who has been a united states lawful permanent resident since.the board of immigration appeals bia determined that was removable because he had been convicted of an aggravated felony and two crimes of moral turpitude cimts after admission,pursuant to the immigration and nationality act ina a a ii iii,a a ii iii.the aggravated felony conviction was subsequently vacated.now petitions for review of the bia decision,contending that the remaining two convictions the bia misdemeanor false imprisonment under california penal code not categorical cimts.we agree and grant the petition for review.
in,was served with a notice to appear nta that asserted he was removable under ina a a iii for conviction of an aggravated felony as defined in ina a a sexual abuse of a minor and ina a a ii for conviction of two cimts not part of the same criminal scheme.the nta alleged he had been convicted of gross sexual imposition of a minor in violation of north dakota century code,and twice convicted of misdemeanor false imprisonment under california penal code.
at a hearing before an immigration judge ij,admitted all three allegations.the ij,finding that north dakota conviction was an aggravated felony and his two california convictions were cimts,sustained both charges of removability,and ordered him removed to chile.the bia affirmed in a per curium order.
filed a timely petition for review in this court while his appeal was pending,he filed an application for relief in a north dakota state court,seeking to have his guilty plea to the gross sexual imposition charge withdrawn.the state court granted the application and vacated the conviction.
the government then filed in this court an unopposed motion to remand to the bia for it to determine how the vacated north dakota conviction affected case.the motion requested that we direct the bia to return the case to us if it determined that was removable.we remanded the case to the bia without indicating whether we would resume control following the bia decision.
in march,the bia ruled that north dakota conviction was no longer valid for immigration purposes.the bia vacated its august decision and remanded the case to the ij.
then filed a motion for reconsideration with the bia,contending that our remand order required that his case be returned to us.in june,the bia granted his motion to reconsider,but explained that it could not return a record of proceedings to our court.instead,it vacated its march order insofar as that order remanded proceedings to the ij.it stated that because its march order had not revisited removability for his cimt convictions,its august determination of removability for those convictions was a final administrative order of removal from which could continue to pursue further relief before the ninth circuit.
we determine the existence of our own jurisdiction de novo.ins,cir.contends that we have jurisdiction over his petition because the bia june order affirmed that its august decision remains a final,appealable order of removal.the government responds that the bia march order irreversibly vitiated our jurisdiction by rendering the bia august decision.
we lack jurisdiction over a petition for review when the bia reopens an alien removal proceedings.see ashcroft,cir the bia reopening of the case divested us of jurisdiction timbreza gonzales,cir same accord yuan gao gonzales,cir where the bia reconsiders a final order of removal,there is nothing for the appellate court to retain jurisdiction of.as we explained in cordes mukasey,the remand for further proceedings is what caused us to lose jurisdiction.otherwise,this court and the ij would both have been considering the same thing at the same time petitioner removal,cir.
we conclude that we have jurisdiction over petition for review.when filed his petition,the bia august decision was a final order of removal.see a b ashcroft,cir.because the bia in june granted reconsideration of its march order and affirmed the august decision with respect to cimt convictions,that part of the august decision remains a final order of removal.mukasey,cir where the bia decision granting a motion for reconsideration expressly affirms the bia prior decision and its analysis does not significantly differ federal court jurisdiction is divested only where the bia subsequently vacates or materially changes the decision under review,overruled on other grounds by holder,cir en banc jaggernauth att y,cir court retains jurisdiction when the bia reconsiders an earlier decision and explicitly upholds it.
unlike the situations presented in,timbreza,and cordes,we are the sole tribunal considering removability.see,at timbreza,at cordes,at.in addition,the petitioners in those three cases could seek review before an ij.can not,so a decision that we lack jurisdiction would strip him of his right to obtain review of the bia determination that he is removable 
contends that a misdemeanor violation of california penal code is not a categorical cimt because conduct that would potentially be morally turpitudinous such as false imprisonment effected by violence,menace,fraud,or deceit is felony false imprisonment,not misdemeanor false imprisonment.the government declined to brief this issue,preferring to rely entirely on its jurisdictional argument.we assume,however,that the government would have disagreed with contention 
legal standard 
the bia must conduct a analysis to determine whether an alien has been convicted of a categorical cimt.first,it must interpret the statute and,in certain cases,examine the record of conviction to determine what offense the alien has been convicted of committing,at.we review the bia determination of this issue de novo.id.at.second,the bia must determine whether the alien conduct meets the federal generic definition of a cimt.id.at.if the bia issues or relies on a precedential determination to conclude that a particular crime is a cimt,we accord it chevron deference otherwise,we defer to the bia determination only to the extent that it has power to persuade skidmore deference.id.at discussing chevron,natural res.def.council,and skidmore.swift.
decisions below 
the ij concluded that california penal code was a categorical cimt because 
this court believes that the people of the state of california find the personal liberty of their citizens to be of paramount importance.the willful and unlawful violation of that personal liberty for any reason,even perhaps a good faith belief that he was engaging in a citizen arrest,is of such consequence that an individual acting in that capacity,willfully and unlawfully,enters into a realm in which his actions are considered to be of such substantial moment that the personal liberty of another would be violated,and the court finds that therefore,this is a crime that is considered vile and heinous by the people of the state of california and any violation of section is such a crime.
the bia summarily affirmed the ij conclusion.
elements of the offense 
california penal code defines false imprisonment as the unlawful violation of the personal liberty of another.it is a general intent crime,because its definition includes only a description of the particular act without any reference to an intent to do a further act or achieve a further consequence.people fernandez.it may be committed by acts or by words,or both,and by merely operating upon the will of the individual or by personal violence,or both.id.the conduct may involve merely the simple act of announcing without probable cause the making of a citizen arrest,the natural consequence of which is to cause the police to take the victim into custody.people henderson,cal d,overruled on other grounds by people flood,cal th.
felony false imprisonment is effected by violence,menace,fraud,or deceit.code see also fernandez.at.a false imprisonment is effected by violence where the defendant uses greater force than reasonably necessary to effect the restraint.people castro,defendant who pulled victim towards his car committed felony false imprisonment by using more force than necessary to restrain her.false imprisonment using menacing words is also
