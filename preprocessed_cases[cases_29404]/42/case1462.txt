introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on lawrence adedoyin appeal from a judgment of conviction and sentence entered in this criminal case on july,the district court exercised jurisdiction under and we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to.
the background of the case is as follows.adedoyin is a nigerian national who has entered the united states on several occasions.in august,adedoyin,then using the name lawrence omoadedoyin,pled nolo contendere in the superior court of california to a felony.as a result of his plea,adedoyin was convicted and sentenced to one year in prison and three years on probation.in,an immigration judge in san francisco ordered adedoyin,who was using the name lawrence omoadedoyin,deported.at that time the judge issued a warrant of deportation and adedoyin left the country.
adedoyin,however,returned to the united states on november.prior to returning,adedoyin obtained a nigerian passport under the name adedoyin famakinde which he used successfully in obtaining a united states visa.at the time he applied for the visa,adedoyin,in responding to a question in the application as to whether he had any criminal convictions,answered negatively and accordingly did not disclose his california conviction.
after returning to the united states adedoyin,from through,attempted to set up a television network promoting african and heritage.while engaging in this endeavor,adedoyin failed to pay several landlords,vendors and his own employees.he also bounced a check to a vendor who had agreed to provide satellite access for the television station.
adedoyin conduct led to an indictment in the proceedings culminating in this appeal.after a superseding indictment was filed,a second superseding indictment was filed on july.the second superseding indictment charged adedoyin with two counts of improper entry into the united states by an alien,in violation of a and two counts of fraud and misuse of visas,permits and other documents,in violation of a,three counts of mail fraud,in violation of,and three counts of wire fraud,in violation of.adedoyin entered a plea of not guilty to all charges and moved to sever the mail and wire fraud charges from the entry and visa counts.the court granted the motion and determined that the mail and wire fraud case would be tried first.after various continuances and changes of counsel,adedoyin trial on the mail and wire fraud counts was scheduled to start on september,but the islamic terrorist attacks which,inter alia,destroyed the world trade center prevented the case from going forward.consequently,the court rescheduled the trial for september.
prior to the commencement of trial on september,adedoyin moved for a postponement.he argued that he could not receive a fair trial in the wake of the attack on the world trade center because he was a foreign national alleged to have perpetrated a fraud against,among other individuals and entities,the world trade center.the court denied adedoyin motion,stating that inasmuch as he was a nigerian national and was not of middle eastern descent,there was little risk that the jury unfairly would link him to the events of september.the court also cited the long delay in bringing the case to trial.nevertheless,to address adedoyin concerns,the court questioned the jurors individually to determine if each could be fair and impartial even though there were allegations that he had defrauded the world trade center.each of the impaneled jurors informed the court that he or she could be fair and impartial.
at trial,the government presented various witnesses to prove the mail and wire fraud alleged against adedoyin.former landlords,vendors and former employees of the television network testified against adedoyin,detailing his failure to make payments.in addition,persons adedoyin had solicited testified that he sent out letters offering to provide major corporations with promotional videos to be aired on the television network for.in an attempt to counter the government evidence,adedoyin offered two witnesses.the first,wilfred warrick,was involved with adedoyin at the time of trial in setting up another television station seeking to promote africa and african culture.the court asked warrick several questions in an attempt to obtain information about the new venture.
adedoyin concluded his defense with his own testimony.he testified that a form which he presented to a representative from media to show that his business was economically viable was a projection of his future income rather than a reflection of money he actually had earned.the court questioned adedoyin on this point.at the conclusion of the trial,on october,the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the three mail fraud counts and not guilty on the three wire fraud counts.
the trial on the four entry and visa charges began on november.at trial,the district court,over adedoyin objection,admitted a certified copy of his california felony conviction.as we have set forth,adedoyin had pled nolo contendere to the charges which led to that conviction.adedoyin attempted to prevent evidence of the conviction from being admitted,pointing out that rule of the federal rules of evidence,except in certain circumstances not relevant here,prohibits the admissibility of a plea of nolo contendere.the district court overruled his objection and admitted the certified copy of the conviction.at the conclusion of the trial,the jury found adedoyin guilty of two counts of improper entry into the united states by an alien but not guilty of two counts of fraud and misuse of visas,permits and other documents.after the court sentenced adedoyin on both sets of convictions he timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
adedoyin raises three separate issues on this appeal.first,he maintains that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for a continuance in the wake of the september,terrorist attacks.second,adedoyin argues that the district court further abused its discretion in asking questions of both him and defense witness wilfred warrick.finally,adedoyin claims that the district court erred in admitting evidence that he previously had been convicted of a felony on the basis of a plea of nolo contendere.we will address each claim in turn.
denial of a further continuance 
we review the district court denial of adedoyin motion for a continuance for abuse of discretion.see united states lattany,cir.under h a,a district court is empowered to grant a continuance in a criminal trial under the speedy trial act if it makes findings that the ends of justice would be served best by such a delay.prior to trial on the mail and wire fraud charges,adedoyin sought a postponement of the proceedings due to the september,terrorist attacks.as we have indicated,adedoyin argued that because he was a nigerian national and one of the alleged victims of his fraudulent activities was the world trade center,he would be unable to receive a fair trial.the court denied the motion for continuance and the mail and wire fraud case proceeded to trial on september,eight days after the terrorist attacks.the court reasoned that the case had been delayed on several occasions because adedoyin frequently had changed attorneys and the court stated that inasmuch as adedoyin was of nigerian origin and not of middle eastern descent and the allegations involved charges of fraud rather than violent action,starting the trial so soon after september,would not prejudice him.
we reiterate that to ascertain if the terrorist attacks would prejudice adedoyin,the court conducted an individual voir dire of each juror to determine whether the events of september,would affect his or her ability to be fair and impartial each juror informed the court that he or she could be fair and impartial.
adedoyin maintains that i n refusing to grant the stay,the defendant right to a fair trial was severely prejudiced.appellant br.at.while he recognizes that each juror informed the court,during individual questioning,that he or she could be fair and impartial,adedoyin states in his brief that one questions whether jurors could truly understand or acknowledge the depth of their feelings so soon after
