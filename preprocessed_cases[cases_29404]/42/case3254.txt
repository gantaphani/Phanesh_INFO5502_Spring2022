faustino gomez appeals the district court denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment charging him with illegal reentry under.gomez argues that his underlying removal was invalid because the stipulated removal proceeding violated his right to due process and denied him an opportunity to seek voluntary departure.we hold that the removal was invalid for two independent reasons the stipulated removal proceeding violated gomez right to due process because he was denied his right to appeal the removal order,and the immigration judge ij violated.b by finding gomez waiver of rights voluntary,knowing,and intelligent on the basis of an insufficient record.nonetheless,we affirm gomez conviction because the violations were harmless given that gomez was ineligible for voluntary departure at the time of the proceeding.
gomez also challenges the district court imposition of a sentencing enhancement.he argues that his conviction for sexual conduct with a minor under arizona revised statute section does not constitute a crime of violence as defined by united states sentencing guidelines manual b a ii.we agree.we hold that,including the version for offenses against victims under fifteen,does not categorically meet the generic definition of sexual abuse of a minor or of statutory rape.after descamps united states,we no longer analyze a statute missing an element of a generic offense,as here,under the modified categorical approach.thus,we vacate gomez sentence and remand for resentencing.
background 
in january,gomez was indicted on three counts of violating arizona revised statute section for sexual conduct with a minor who was under the age of fifteen.count one charged gomez with digitally penetrating the victim,and counts two and three charged him with having sexual intercourse with her.in september,gomez signed a plea agreement,pleading guilty to two counts of attempted sexual conduct with a minor under the age of in violation of attempt and sexual conduct with a minor.in november,gomez was sentenced to a term of imprisonment,not to be released until january.
on january,the immigration authorities served gomez,who was in immigration and customs enforcement ice custody,with a notice to appear nta.gomez signed and returned a request for prompt hearing.the nta included the allegation that he had been convicted of the offenses.ice transferred gomez to eloy detention center where he received,on january,a revised nta that omitted any reference to his past conviction.gomez again signed a request for prompt hearing.while gomez was in a cell with other aliens,an immigration official read to them en masse a stipulated removal form in spanish.gomez does not remember whether he had a copy of the form when it was read to the group.after the en masse reading,gomez met individually with an immigration officer who told gomez that he could be removed immediately if he signed the form.gomez claims that during the individual meeting,the form was not reviewed again,and he did not read the form.the whole process lasted less than minutes.gomez signed the preprinted form,which contained both english and spanish statements waiving gomez rights to counsel,to a hearing before an ij,to any form of relief including voluntary departure,and to appeal.without a hearing,the ij issued a two paragraph decision and order on january,finding gomez uncounseled waiver of rights to be voluntary,knowing,and intelligent.gomez was removed to mexico via nogales,arizona that same day.
on december,gomez was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in washington state.a day later,an ice agent located gomez in the franklin county jail in washington.gomez was indicted on january,for illegal reentry in violation of gomez moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the underlying stipulated removal proceeding was invalid.the district court denied the motion.a week later,gomez filed a motion for reconsideration along with a declaration,stating,inter alia,that he had not understood the stipulated removal proceeding although the district court denied gomez motion for reconsideration,the court characterized the validity of gomez removal proceeding as a close question.gomez entered a guilty plea,reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment.
the probation officer prepared a report psr and recommended a total offense level of.the total offense level included a enhancement based on the probation officer determination that gomez had been previously deported after being convicted of a crime of violence as defined by b a ii.the psr assigned gomez six criminal history points,for a criminal history category of iii,and a guidelines sentencing range of to months imprisonment.without the enhancement,the sentencing range for gomez would likely have been ten to sixteen months.see united states sentencing commission guidelines manual,sentencing table,
on september,the district court conducted a hearing on objections to the psr.gomez primary objection was to the sentencing enhancement for his conviction.gomez argued that the conviction did not qualify as a crime of violence under the categorical or modified categorical approaches.
on september,the district court conducted a sentencing hearing.the district court acknowledged the psr recommended guidelines sentencing range of to months,and found that gomez conviction was in fact categorically statutory rape,which is a crime of violence under b a ii.the district court also conducted an alternative analysis,assuming that the generic definition of statutory rape included a fouryear age differential,and found that gomez satisfied this element because the court could consider gomez age at the time of the conviction given that his date of birth appeared on the judgement sic paperwork.finally,the district court noted several reasons for imposing a sentence.it also noted that it would likely have given the same sentence even if it erred in applying the enhancement.the district court then imposed a sentence of months imprisonment and three years of supervised release.

iii.discussion 
conviction 
when an alien defendant is prosecuted for illegal reentry under,he may not collaterally attack the underlying deportation order unless the alien demonstrates that 
he exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.
d united states gonzalez villalobos,cir.an underlying removal order is fundamentally unfair if a defendant due process rights were violated by defects in his underlying deportation proceeding,and he suffered prejudice as a result of the defects.united states ubaldo figueroa,cir alteration in original quoting united states zarate martinez,cir.
a defendant can establish the first two prongs of d by showing that he was denied judicial review of his removal proceeding in violation of due process.see reyes bonilla,at ubaldo figueroa,at.due process requires that 
w here a determination made in an administrative proceeding is to play a critical role in the subsequent imposition of a criminal sanction,there must be some meaningful review of the administrative proceeding.this principle means at the very least that where the defects in an administrative proceeding foreclose judicial review of that proceeding,an alternative means of obtaining judicial review must be made available before the administrative order may be used to establish conclusively an element of a criminal offense.
united states mendoza lopez,footnote omitted citations omitted see also united states lopez vasquez,cir.
a defendant can also satisfy the first two prongs of d by showing that immigration officials in the underlying removal proceeding violated a regulation designed to protect an alien right to judicial review.see united states barajas alvarado,cir,cert.denied.t he supreme court has ruled that when congress enacts a procedure,aliens are entitled to it.id.citing united states ex rel.knauff shaughnessy,whatever the procedure authorized by congress is,it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned.see also united states ramos,cir it is a maxim that agencies must comply with their own regulations.quoting ramon sepulveda ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
once a due process or a qualifying regulatory violation has been established,we evaluate the third prong of d that the deportation order was fundamentally unfair as a prejudice inquiry.see reyes bonilla,at noting that we have long held that a defendant seeking to exclude evidence of a prior removal order in a prosecution for illegal reentry must demonstrate a due process violation and bears the burden of proving prejudice.quoting united states proa tovar,cir en banc and citing d see also united states rangel gonzales,cir explaining that for the purposes of a prosecution we conduct a inquiry to determine if a regulatory violation invalidates an underlying removal order the regulation itself must serve a purpose of benefit to the alien and the violation must have prejudiced interests of the alien which were protected by the regulation internal quotation marks omitted.
here we conclude that gomez deportation was invalid for two independent reasons.first,gomez was denied his right to appeal his removal order in violation of due process because immigration officials failed to obtain a knowing waiver of that right.second,the ij who ordered gomez removed violated b by finding that gomez waiver of his rights was voluntary,knowing,and intelligent when there was an insufficient factual basis for such a finding.however,we affirm the denial of gomez motion to dismiss the conviction because he can not show that he was prejudiced by these violations given that he was ineligible for any form of relief at the time of the proceeding.
violations 
invalid waiver 
obtaining an invalid waiver of the right to appeal a deportation order violates due process.lopez vasquez,at although a deportee may waive his right to judicial review of his deportation order,that waiver must be considered and intelligent.otherwise,the deportee is deprived of judicial review in violation of due process.internal quotation marks omitted quoting mendoza lopez,at.thus,although an alien can not collaterally attack an underlying deportation order if he validly waived the right to appeal that order,united states arrieta,cir,a valid waiver of the right to appeal must be both considered and intelligent,ramos,at quoting arrieta,at additional internal quotation marks omitted.
the first two prongs of d are satisfied if the right to appeal was denied in violation of due process.see reyesbonilla,at if reyes did not validly waive his right of appeal,the first two requirements under d will be satisfied.ubaldo figueroa,at see also gonzalez villalobos,at.
at the time of his removal proceeding,gomez signed a stipulated removal form,printed in english and spanish,waiving his right to appeal the deportation order.gomez argues that because he contests the validity of his waiver,the government reliance on that insufficient to prove by clear and convincing evidence that his waiver was valid.guided by ramos and reyes bonilla,we agree.
the parties begin by debating who bears the burden of proving the validity of gomez waiver.under the same circumstances as those in this case,we have said unmistakably that t he government bears the burden of proving valid waiver in a collateral attack of the underlying removal proceedings.ramos,at citing lopez vasquez,at see also reyes bonilla,at.the government must prove a valid waiver by clear and convincing evidence.reyes bonilla,at citing united states pallares galan,cir.
we find unavailing the government argument that united states medina,cir,is to the contrary.in medina,the defendant argued that the government could not prove that he had in fact been deported without a tape recording of the deportation proceeding.id.we noted that the lawfulness of the prior deportation is not an element of the offense under.id.quoting united states delgado,cir internal quotation marks omitted.thus,in establishing the fact of a prior deportation as an element of an illegal reentry offense,t he government merely needs to prove that the defendant was in fact previously deported.id.gomez does not challenge the government ability to prove that he was in fact deported.rather,gomez argues under a separate provision of the statute d that his deportation was invalid.in spelling out the elements of an illegal reentry offense in medina,we did not silently overrule our prior precedent holding that t he government bears the burden of proving the waiver.lopez vasquez,at citing brewer williams,i t is incumbent upon the state to prove an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.internal quotation marks omitted 
as ramos emphasized,this court should indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver,and should not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.at quoting lopez vasquez,at see also reyes bonilla,at.we carefully abide by this principle,especially where an uncounseled individual purportedly waived his right to appeal.
where an alien defendant was represented by counsel at his deportation proceeding and did not allege facts undermining the validity of his waiver,we held that the government met its initial burden of proving a valid waiver by introducing an official immigration record.united states galicia gonzalez,cir.we stated that where the government introduces official records which on their face show a valid waiver of rights in connection with a deportation proceeding,the burden shifts to the defendant to come forward with evidence tending to prove the waiver was invalid.id.at.there,galiciagonzalez counsel signed a waiver of rights form along with a declaration that she fully explained the contents of the agreement to him and that he entered it with full knowledge.id.at.and galicia gonzalez did not even allege there was anything wrong with his deportation,that his rights were improperly explained or that he was coerced into waiving them.the government prima facie showing thus stands unchallenged and this satisfies the government burden of showing a valid deportation for purposes of section.id.at.
galicia gonzalez is not controlling here for two independent reasons gomez was not represented by counsel at his removal proceeding,and gomez contested the validity of his waiver and alleged facts supporting its invalidity in the district court when prosecuted for illegal reentry.first,ramos explicitly held that the district court erred by relying on galicia gonzalez to shift the burden to ramos,because galicia gonzalez was represented at his deportation proceeding while ramos was not.ramos,at noting that the district court erred in concluding that the validity of ramos stipulated removal order was controlled by our decision in galicia gonzalez because unlike the petitioner in galicia gonzalez,who had received a full explanation of a stipulated removal agreement from his counsel,and who had entered into the stipulation through counsel,ramos lacked the benefit of legal representation.second,when a defendant in a prosecution contests the validity of his waiver of the right to appeal his deportation order,we have held that the government introduction of an official document signed by the defendant waiving his right to appeal is insufficient to meet the government burden of proving a valid waiver.reyes bonilla,at noting that the district court finding of valid waiver would be sound if reyes had not contested his understanding of the notice but holding that the signed notice was inadequate to meet the government burden where reyes testified in district court that he had lacked understanding of the removal proceedings.
the circumstances underlying the stipulated deportation in ramos are strikingly similar to the circumstances here.like ramos,gomez was unrepresented and,like ramos,was deported pursuant to a stipulated removal proceeding at the eloy,arizona detention facility.see ramos,at.ramos signed the same stipulation as gomez.the preprinted stipulation form contains both english and spanish statements that waive the alien rights to counsel,to a hearing before an ij,to any form of relief including voluntary departure,and to appeal.in ramos,we described the process for stipulated removal proceedings at eloy 
after detainees are selected for participation in the stipulated removal program,deportation officers typically prepare an nta and a stipulated removal form for each individual.deportation officers then gather detainees selected for the program for a group presentation.there,an immigration enforcement agent explains in spanish that a detainee has two options first,to accept stipulated removal,or second,to appear before an ij,where the detainee may ask to remain legally in the united states or seek voluntary departure.the agent also advises the group that under the stipulated removal program,a detainee can be removed that very day whereas it could take anywhere from two to three weeks or longer to appear before an ij if the detainee chooses not to sign the form.the agent then reads the text of the stipulated removal form aloud in spanish,and concludes the presentation.next,dhs deportation officers meet individually with each detainee to determine whether he or she wants to sign the stipulated removal form.deportation officers do not review the detainee at any time before or during the individual meeting.no transcriber,interpreter,or attorney is present during the detainee individual meeting with the deportation officer.
id.at.this description is consistent with the record in this case,in particular gomez sworn declaration.
in ramos,we described the testimony of the immigration officer who met individually with ramos after the en masse reading,and we noted her limited spanish language skills.at.we concluded that ramos waiver of his right to appeal was invalid for several independent reasons including because his waiver was not considered or intelligent because he did not receive a competent spanish language translation of his right to appeal when he signed the form.id.at.
we are not persuaded by the government argument that ramos relied on the incompetence of the immigration officer individual translation.this argument improperly shifts the burden to the alien defendant to prove an incompetent explanation of the alien rights however,the burden to prove a competent explanation,and thus valid waiver,rests with the government.we can not conclude that waiver of rights,including the right to appeal,was considered or intelligent without evidence that a detainee was able to understand the questions posed to him when put to the choice of foregoing all rights or remaining in detention until he could appear before an ij.ramos,at emphasis added citing perez lastor ins,cir.the fact that ramos signed a stipulation indicating his understanding and waiver,and that the ij found his waiver to be voluntary,knowing,and intelligent,id.at,was insufficient to meet the government burden of proof and the government offers nothing more here.see also reyes bonilla,at concluding that the government failed to meet its burden of proving a valid waiver where the evidence was unclear as to whether the immigration officer explained to reyes in a language he could understand his right to appeal and there was no evidence as to the extent of the explanation given or the immigration officer ability to communicate in spanish.
thus,we see no reason to distinguish ramos.if anything,there is more evidence here that gomez had difficulty understanding the stipulated removal proceeding.gomez stated in his declaration that he filed in the district court that he has difficulty reading spanish,that he did not understand the stipulated proceeding,and that he received the same sort of en masse reading of the stipulation as ramos.gomez also stated that the immigration officer did not review the stipulated removal form with him during his individual meeting with the officer.the government has presented no evidence other than the signed form that gomez was provided with a competent translation when he signed it.as we held in ramos,due process requires that an alien be provided an individual explanation that is competently translated when he sign s the form above and beyond an en masse explanation.at.
moreover,shifting the burden to gomez to prove an incompetent translation would skew the government incentives and create an insurmountable hurdle for alien defendants.in ramos,the government produced the immigration officer at a hearing only to have the court find that her translation had been inadequate.as here,the government may not always be able to produce the immigration officer or she may be otherwise unavailable.thus,it is not realistic to expect the defendant to produce the officer.furthermore,if the government can stand silent and merely rely on the signed stipulation as sufficiently clear and convincing evidence,then it would have no incentive to produce an immigration officer witness.
in sum,we hold that the stipulated removal proceeding at eloy violated gomez right to due process by obtaining an invalid waiver of gomez right to appeal the deportation order.the government has not met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that gomez validly waived his right to that appeal 
regulatory violation 
gomez also argues that his deportation was invalid because the ij violated b by finding that gomez waiver of rights was voluntary,knowing,and intelligent without a sufficient factual record again,our reasoning in ramos is directly on point and does not rely on the concern of incompetent translation.independent of the invalid waiver issue,we found that ramos stipulated removal form provided an inadequate basis on which the ij could rely to evaluate the validity of ramos waiver of rights.without any independent inquiry of the petitioner,and depending solely on information provided by dhs,the ij concluded that ramos had voluntarily,knowingly,and intelligently waived his due process rights.ramos,at.despite the form explicit waiver language,we concluded that the ij finding violated b by failing to determine whether ramos waiver was voluntary,knowing,and intelligent,as required by the regulation.id.we concluded that the regulatory violation would have been sufficient to invalidate ramos underlying removal but for a lack of prejudice.see id.at.
here,on january,gomez signed the revised notice to appear requesting a prompt hearing before an ij.on the same day,he signed the stipulated removal form waiving,inter alia,the right to a hearing before an ij.without a hearing,and only on the basis of gomez signed stipulated removal form,the ij found gomez waiver to be voluntary,knowing,and intelligent.the ij then found,upon review of the charging document and the written stipulation that he is removable based upon clear and convincing evidence in the form of his own admissions and ordered him removed 
we do not read ramos to require an actual appearance by every alien before an ij,a possibility that the district court considered here.rather,as the district court also discussed,b can be read to contain two disjunctive provisions 
an immigration judge may enter an order of deportation,exclusion or removal stipulated to by the alien or the alien representative and the service.the immigration judge may enter such an order without a hearing and in the absence of the parties based on a review of the charging document,the written stipulation,and supporting documents,if any.or,
i f the alien is unrepresented,the immigration judge must determine that the alien waiver is voluntary,knowing,and intelligent.
b.in other words,we could read the second provision to rebut the first where an alien is unrepresented,the ij duty to determine the waiver validity supercedes the ij ability to do so without a hearing.however,we need not decide that issue.rather,as gomez points out,there are several other avenues that immigration officials could pursue to create a sufficient factual record without conducting a hearing.for example,the government could provide a written declaration by the immigration officer of the circumstances surrounding the alien waiver,stating that avenues of relief were discussed and that the officer provided a competently translated,individualized explanation of the rights the alien waived 
here,we conclude that the procedures followed in removing gomez violated b because the ij could not have found that gomez waiver was voluntary,knowing,and intelligent based on the evidence before him,and thus violated b.see ramos,at.
therefore,on the basis of both his invalid waiver of the right to appeal the deportation order and the ij regulatory violation,gomez has met the requirements of d to attack collaterally the validity of his deportation.we next turn to whether gomez was prejudiced by these violations.
as discussed supra,in a collateral attack on the validity of a deportation order the defendant bears the burden of proving prejudice under d.see medina,at.to establish prejudice in this context,the defendant must show that it was plausible that he would have received some form of relief from removal had his rights not been violated in the removal proceedings.see arrieta,at.in order to demonstrate prejudice,an alien would also have to show that he is not barred from receiving relief.if he is barred from receiving relief,his claim is not plausible.united states gonzalez valerio,cir.
gomez argues that he was prejudiced by the due process and regulatory violations during his removal proceeding because he was eligible for and would have pursued prehearing voluntary departure under.the government contends that gomez was ineligible for voluntary departure because his previous arizona conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony under a 
under,an alien is generally eligible for voluntary departure so long as he has not been convicted of an aggravated felony rendering him deportable under a a iii,and is not deportable for reasons of national security under a.id.b c.the aggravated felony definition is set forth in a and includes sexual abuse of a minor,id.a a,and an attempt to commit an offense described in this paragraph,id.a u 
aside from a narrow exception not presented here we look to the law at the time of the deportation proceedings to determine whether an alien was eligible for relief from deportation.vidal mendoza,at lopez vasquez at.gomez argues that vidal mendoza and lopezvelasquez are inapplicable to our prejudice inquiry here.he asserts that those cases dealt only with our due process inquiry and that we must look to current case law when deciding prejudice.we read our case law more broadly.gomez offers no persuasive authority or logic on which to distinguish our reasoning in vidal mendoza and lopezvelasquez when deciding prejudice 
therefore,we must decide whether gomez conviction for attempted sexual conduct with a minor under the age of in violation of arizona revised statute section qualified as an aggravated felony,a,at the time he was ordered deported in january we conclude that gomez conviction would have qualified as sexual abuse of a minor,defined as an aggravated felony under a a.
we first defined the term sexual abuse of a minor for purposes of a a in united states baron medina,cir,where we applied the ordinary,contemporary,and common meaning of sexual abuse of a minor,and concluded that any use of young children for the gratification of sexual desires constitutes an abuse because the child is too young to understand the nature of defendant advances.
vidal mendoza,at second and third alterations in original the statute at issue in baronmedina criminalized the touching of an underage child body with a sexual intent,where the child was under fourteen years of age.at,accord cedano viera,at.we later held that a conviction under a virginia statute criminalizing intercourse with a child under fifteen years of age constituted sexual abuse of a minor in the sentencing context where the defendant was years old and the victim was thirteen years old.united states pereira salmeron,cir alteration in original 
the board of immigration appeals bia precedent also guides our conclusion.in in re rodriguez rodriguez,the bia broadly defined sexual abuse of a minor to exceed the definitions set forth in various federal criminal statutes,so as to include abuse that did not involve actual contact.id.at.in so holding,the bia looked to a setting forth the rights of child victims and witnesses,which defines sexual abuse as the employment,use,persuasion,inducement,enticement,or coercion of a child to engage in,or assist another person to engage in,sexually explicit conduct or the rape,molestation,prostitution,or other form of sexual exploitation of children,or incest with children.id.at quoting a.the bia did not set forth a threshold age at which such conduct would constitute abuse,although a defines child as a person who is under the age of.
most tellingly,in april just three months after gomez deportation we relied on in re rodriguezrodriguez to affirm the bia holding that sexual intercourse with a year old constituted sexual abuse of a minor as defined by a a.afridi gonzales,cir,overruled by estrada espinoza mukasey,cir en banc,overruled on other grounds by united states aguilamontes de oca,cir en banc per curiam,abrogated by descamps.unlike estrada espinoza,at,afridi like all of our cases preceding gomez deportation did not explicitly rely on the fact that the subject statute required the defendant to be a certain number of years older than the victim.at.applying the categorical approach,we held that the california statute of conviction that criminalizes conduct by a ny person who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is more than three years younger than the perpetrator,was categorically sexual abuse of a minor.id.quoting code c.we stated 
a conviction under this statute meets the bia interpretation of sexual abuse of a minor as encompassing any offense that involves the employment,use,persuasion,inducement,enticement,or coercion of a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct in re rodriguez rodriguez,at.afridi had sexual intercourse with a girl who was more than three years younger than he.sexual intercourse clearly constitutes sexually explicit conduct,and the victim in this matter was a minor as that term is commonly defined.further,the bia definition of sexual abuse of a minor is not limited to victims of any certain age.therefore,his offense falls within that definition.accordingly,the bia properly found that petitioner was removable for having committed an aggravated felony 
id.first and second alterations in original.
construing the two statutory provisions together,see supra note,gomez statute of conviction contains three elements a mens rea of intentionally or knowingly an act of engaging in sexual intercourse or oral sexual contact and a victim who is under fifteen years of age.although the case law that existed in did not explicitly enumerate the elements of sexual abuse of a minor,these three elements were sufficient to fall categorically within the bia and ninth circuit definition.the sexual intercourse or oral sexual contact element of clearly constitutes sexually explicit conduct.see in re rodriguez rodriguez,at.and a victim under fifteen years of age fits squarely within the definition of minor.id.at afridi,at.under the logic of in re rodriguez rodriguez,at,and pereira salmeron,at,such conduct with a victim under fifteen years of age constituted abuse at the time.
thus,under the governing case law at the time of his deportation,gomez crime would have categorically qualified as sexual abuse of a minor for the purposes of a a,and he would not have been eligible for voluntary departure.because gomez was not prejudiced by the due process and regulatory violations that occurred in his removal proceeding,we affirm the district court denial of his motion to dismiss.
sentencing 
we next determine whether,under current law,gomez conviction constitutes a crime of violence within the meaning of b a ii.because our case law has evolved since,we reach the opposite conclusion from what we concluded in analyzing the prejudice inquiry.that is,we hold that arizona revised statute section including the under fifteen version is not categorically a crime of violence because it is missing an element of the generic offenses of sexual abuse of a minor and statutory rape,and the district court finding to the contrary was reversible error.thus,we vacate gomez sentence and remand for resentencing.
the united states sentencing guidelines provide for a enhancement where the defendant was previously deported after a conviction for a crime of violence.b a ii.the commentary defines crime of violence as any of the following offenses under federal,state,or local law statutory rape,or sexual abuse of a minor.id.cmt.b iii attempt convictions for offenses counted under u.b also qualify as crimes of violence.id.cmt.the district court imposed a sentencing enhancement because it found that gomez conviction was categorically a conviction for statutory rape.
we begin by analyzing gomez conviction under the familiar categorical approach set forth in taylor united states,u.under this approach,we look only to the elements of gomez statute of conviction,and not the particular facts underlying his conviction.at as we explained above,gomez conviction under arizona revised statutes section contains three elements a mens rea of intentionally or knowingly an act of engaging in sexual intercourse or oral sexual contact and a victim who is under fifteen years of age.then,we look to the generic definitions of sexual abuse of a minor and of statutory rape to determine if the elements of are the same as,or more narrow than,the generic offenses.see descamps.at.i f the state statute sweeps more broadly than the generic crime,a conviction under that law can not count for the purposes of a sentencing enhancement.id.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that gomez conviction under is not categorically a conviction for sexual abuse of a minor or statutory rape because it is missing an element of each generic offense.
generic sexual abuse of a minor 
we turn first to the generic definition of sexual abuse of a minor.three related lines of cases compel us to conclude that the statute,even including the under fifteen version,is missing an element of sexual abuse of a minor.first,in a unanimous en banc opinion considering whether a conviction constitutes the aggravated felony sexual abuse of a minor as set forth in a a,we defined the generic offense of sexual abuse of a minor as requiring four elements a mens rea level of knowingly a sexual act with a minor between the ages of and and an age difference of at least four years between the defendant and the minor.estrada espinoza,at,see also we have recognized that the definition of sexual abuse of a minor set forth in estrada espinoza applies equally to.see valencia barragan,at,applying estrada espinoza definition of sexual abuse of a minor in the sentencing context medina villa,at reaffirming that the decisional law defining the term sexual abuse of a minor in the sentencing context,is informed by the definition of the same term in the immigration context,a a,and vice versa footnote omitted supra note.
second,in medina villa,we held that estrada espinoza did not set forth the exclusive definition of sexual abuse of a minor.at.we noted that estrada espinoza definition of sexual abuse of a minor encompassed statutory rape crimes only,and recognized that a residual category of sexual abuse of a minor exists that encompasses statutes where the conduct proscribed is sexual the statute protects a minor and the statute requires abuse.id.at.in turn,we defined the term abuse as physical or psychological harm in light of the age of the victim in question.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we have noted that sexual contact with a victim under the age of fourteen is categorically abuse,see united states lopez solis,f d,cir,but we have never held that such a per se rule applies to consensual sex with persons fourteen and older,see valencia barragan,at recognizing the two distinct generic definitions of sexual abuse of a minor and holding that a statute contains the element of abuse under the medina villa definition if it applies to sexual conduct with children younger than fourteen years pelayo garcia,at rejecting argument that a statute that criminalizes sex between someone over with a minor under sixteen is per se abusive.
third,in addressing the under eighteen version of the statute,we have expressly determined that convictions under arizona revised statutes section meet neither the generic definition of sexual abuse of a minor set forth in estrada espinoza nor the generic definition of abuse of a minor set forth in medina villa.rivera cuartas holder,cir.a conviction under this statute does not meet the definition set forth in estrada espinoza for two reasons it lacks the age difference requirement and is broader than the generic offense with respect to the age of the minor because the statute applies to persons under eighteen years of age.id.at.here,analyzing the under fifteen version of,the statute continues to lack the age difference element.section also does not meet the generic definition of sexual abuse of a minor under the medina villa framework as it lacks the element of abuse.id.again,analyzing the under fifteen version,the statute continues to lack the element of abuse because the statute may apply to victims who are not younger than fourteen years.valenciabarragan,at see also pelayo garcia,at.
generic statutory rape 
arizona revised statutes section is also missing an element of the generic offense of statutory rape.whether the generic offense of statutory rape has,as an element,a age difference,is an issue of first impression.the development of our law in this area,as well as the statutory law of other jurisdictions,leads us to conclude that a fouryear age difference is an element of the generic offense of statutory rape.because,even the under fifteen version of the statute,is missing this element,a conviction under the statute is not categorically a crime of violence.
we first addressed the generic offense of statutory rape in united states gomez mendez,cir.there,we held that t he term statutory rape is ordinarily,contemporarily,and commonly understood to mean the unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor under the age of consent specified by state statute.id.at.in gomez mendez,we did not address what other elements,if any,comprised the generic offense of statutory rape.
shortly after gomez mendez,we revisited the definition of the generic offense of statutory rape.see united states rodriguez guzman,cir.in rodriguez guzman,we reached one of the issues left open by gomez mendez the ordinary,contemporary,and common meaning of the term minor in the context of a statutory rape law.id.at.finding that at least thirty states set the age of consent at sixteen and the model penal code and the federal statutory rape provision had as an element a victim under the age of sixteen,we held that the ordinary,contemporary,and common meaning of the term minor in the context of statutory rape law was a person under sixteen years of age.id.again,we did not consider whether the generic offense of statutory rape included any other elements.
in united states gonzalez aparicio,cir,we were faced with the same question presented here whether a conviction under arizona revised statutes section was categorically a crime of violence for the purposes of sentencing.id.at.the district court held that it was,but did not specify whether the conviction was categorically a conviction for the generic offense of statutory rape or sexual abuse of a minor.id.at.gonzalez aparicio did not object below,but on appeal,he argued that the generic offense of statutory rape has,as one of the elements,a age difference.id.at.we recognized that estrada espinoza definition of sexual abuse of a minor might bear on the definition of generic statutory rape.see id.at.ultimately,however,we declined to decide how estrada espinoza should be applied in defining the generic crime of statutory rape under b a ii.id.at.acknowledging that whether the generic federal definition of statutory rape includes a four year age difference element is a difficult issue,we also declined to resolve that question.id.instead,we held that any error that may have been committed by the district court in imposing the crime of violence sentencing enhancement was not plain error.id.at.
finally,in united states zamorano ponce,cir,we again addressed the elements of the generic offense of statutory rape.zamorano ponce argued that his conviction was not categorically a conviction for the generic offense of statutory rape because the statute of conviction did not include a mens rea element of knowingly,relying on estrada espinoza.zamoranoponce,at.we rejected this argument,explaining 
defendant reliance on estrada espinoza is misplaced.that case defined the term sexual abuse of a minor for the purpose of considering whether a prior conviction constituted an aggravated felony under the immigration and nationality act.nothing in estrada espinoza purports to require that statutory rape,within the meaning of the commentary to the guidelines,contain a mens rea element.nor does the case overrule or undermine gomez mendez or rodriguez guzman in any other way.in fact,we have recognized previously that estrada espinoza never discussed or even cited to our prior statutory rape decisions in gomez mendez and rodriguez guzman.
id.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.having rejected the argument that estrada espinoza sets forth the elements of the generic offense of statutory rape,we held,based on gomez mendez and rodriguez guzman,that generic statutory rape does not have,as an element,a mens rea of knowingly.id.at.although we held that estrada espinoza does not set forth the elements of generic statutory rape,we nonetheless recognized that whether a fouryear age difference is an element of generic statutory rape remains an open question.id.at.
we now answer that question in the affirmative.in reaching this conclusion,we follow the approach we took in rodriguez guzman,looking to the model penal code,federal law,and state statutory rape laws to determine whether statutory rape,in the generic sense,includes a age difference.see at see also estrada espinoza,at in the absence of specific congressional guidance as to the elements of a crime,courts have been left to determine the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most states.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the model penal code statutory rape provision,entitled corruption of minors and seduction,requires a age difference between the victim and the perpetrator.model penal code a.it provides that 
a male who has sexual intercourse with a female not his wife,or any person who engages in deviate sexual intercourse or causes another to engage in deviate sexual intercourse is guilty of an offense if 
a the other person is less than years old and the actor is at least four years older than the other person 
see also rodriguez guzman,at.likewise,the federal statute that most closely matches generic statutory rape,a,see rodriguez guzman,at,also includes a age difference 
furthermore,a substantial number of state statutes now include at least a age difference in their statutory rape laws states have an age difference in at least some of their statutory rape laws of those,states require an age difference of four years or more rodriguez guzman held that the common understanding of the term minor in the context of statutory rape laws is a person under the age of sixteen based on a comparable number of states thirty setting their age of consent at sixteen.at.moreover,of the states with an requirement,only twelve require a age difference in any of their and only twelve require a age difference in any of their provisions in contrast,states require a age gap in at least some of their statutory rape laws moreover,seventeen states require an even greater age difference ranging from five years to twelve years in at least some of their statutory rape provisions based on the foregoing,we conclude that there is significant consensus among the states that statutory rape is characterized by an age difference between the victim and the defendant,and a age difference is the most common line that states have drawn.
we recognize that states have at least one provision criminalizing sexual intercourse with minors that includes no age difference element whatsoever however,in seventeen of these states,such statutes always have,as an element,a victim who is under the age of fourteen moreover,in another seven of these states,at least some of the provisions that lack an age difference element require as an element a victim under the age of fourteen because only eighteen states ever criminalize sexual intercourse with older minors irrespective of an age difference we are not persuaded that these state laws are probative of the elements of generic statutory rape,which involves sexual intercourse with minors under the age of sixteen,not just the very young.rodriguez guzman,at basing the generic definition of the term minor within the context of statutory rape on a consensus of thirty states.when viewed as a whole,the state statutory rape laws,the model penal code,and federal law support our conclusion that statutory rape is ordinarily,contemporarily,and commonly understood to include as an element a age difference between the victim and the defendant.
to summarize,the elements of generic statutory rape are sexual intercourse with a minor under the age of sixteen who is at least four years younger than the defendant.generic statutory rape does not have,as an element,a mens rea requirement of knowingly.arizona revised statutes section is missing the age difference element of the generic offense of statutory rape 
therefore,arizona revised statute section,even the under fifteen version,is missing an element of generic statutory rape and generic sexual abuse of a minor.thus,a conviction under the statute is not categorically a conviction for a crime of violence under b a ii.because the statute is missing an element of these generic crimes,our inquiry ends here we do not undertake a modified categorical analysis.descamps.at,holding that the modified categorical approach does not apply to statutes that contain an indivisible set of elements sweeping more broadly than the corresponding generic offense,meaning that the statute of conviction has an overbroad or missing element.because of the mismatch in elements,a person convicted under such a statute is never convicted of the generic crime.id.at.
harmless error 
we also reject the government argument that the sentencing error was harmless.in imposing the sentence,the district court stated 
i would also note that if i wrong on the calculations and the court or court on appeal find s that the age differential is essential,i doubt very much that there would be any significant change in the sentence that about to be imposed.
the district court did not actually calculate the sentence it would have imposed absent the enhancement and imposed a sentence that was above the guidelines range absent the enhancement.see united states munoz camarena,cir noting that a guidelines calculation error may be harmless if one of four nonexhaustive factors is satisfied,including if the district court chooses a sentence that falls within the correct guidelines range see also united states acosta chavez,cir.
iv.conclusion 
in sum,we hold that the ij violated an immigration regulation designed to protect an alien righ
