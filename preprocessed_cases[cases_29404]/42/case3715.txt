we must decide whether our decision in gonzales,cir,compels the conclusion that a parent status as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence may be imputed to an unemancipated minor child residing with that parent,for purposes of satisfying the permanent residence requirement for cancellation of removal under section a of the immigration and nationality act ina,a.because the rationale and holding of apply equally to the permanent residence and the continuous residence requirements,we conclude that it does.
factual and procedural background 
kattia guadalupe escobar escobar is a native and citizen of el salvador.she came to the united states and settled in california with her mother in the early,when she was approximately five years old.her mother adjusted her status to lawful permanent residence on march,when escobar was thirteen.escobar herself attained lawful permanent resident status on february.she has two citizen children.
on august,after escobar attempted to drive an undocumented mexican child across the border from tijuana the department of homeland security dhs issued a notice to appear charging escobar with removability under section a e i of the ina,a e i any alien who at any time knowingly has encouraged,induced,assisted,abetted,or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the united states in violation of law is inadmissible.
in removal proceedings,the immigration judge ij found escobar removable under section a e i and held that she was ineligible for cancellation of removal as a lawful permanent resident.title a provides for cancellation of removal for a permanent resident who has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than years,has resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status,and has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.under,the continuous residence requirement in subsection a was satisfied for escobar by imputing the admission of her mother for permanent residence.see at.however,the ij determined that escobar mother status could not be imputed to satisfy the permanent residence requirement in subsection a.
escobar appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia,raising only the issue of her eligibility for cancellation of removal.in a published decision,the bia noted its disagreement with,declined to apply holding to allow imputation for the permanent residence requirement,and dismissed escobar appeal.in re escobar,bia.escobar filed a timely petition for review on july.
more than five months later,escobar submitted a motion to reopen to the bia,raising the new argument that it was legally impossible to have encouraged,induced,assisted,abetted,or aided a minor,age eight,to enter or to try to enter the united states illegally,because a child of that age lacked the capacity to intend to enter.a e i.the bia denied her motion in a per curiam decision on april,as untimely.the bia also stated that,even if it were to reopen proceedings sua sponte,the respondent has failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits of her claim.escobar timely appealed the denial of her motion to reopen,and we consolidated the petitions for review.see b.

iii.discussion 
escobar eligibility for cancellation of.imputation of status,intent,and state of mind to unemancipated minor children 
b oth the bia and this court repeatedly have held that a parent status,intent,or state of mind is imputed to the parent unemancipated minor child in many areas of immigration law,including asylum,grounds of inadmissibility,and legal residency status,at see also,vang ins,cir imputing a parent firm resettlement under to a minor senica ins,cir imputing a parent knowledge of ineligibility for admission to that parent minor children to deny their application for discretionary admission under k matter of huang,bia abandonment of lawful permanent resident status of a parent is imputed to a minor child who is subject to the parent custody and control.citing matter of winkens,bia.as we explain in a companion case,also filed today,w e have allowed imputation precisely because the minor either was legally incapable of satisfying one of these criteria or could not reasonably be expected to satisfy it independent of his parents.ramos barrios holder,cir on several occasions,we have confronted situations in which a parent would qualify for relief under section a or its predecessor,section c while a child who at all times had been in the physical custody of that parent would not.in recognition of the fundamental concerns motivating this form of discretionary relief,we have consistently imputed a parent satisfaction of the provision status requirements to the unemancipated minor children in that parent custody.
section c and 
in,we considered whether,under section c,a parent lawful unrelinquished domicile is imputed to his or her minor children.at.concluding that imputation was appropriate,we first distinguished our holding in that to be eligible for section c relief,aliens must accumulate seven years of lawful unrelinquished domicile after their admission for permanent residence.id.at quoting ins,cir.in light of crucial differences between the applicant in,who had entered the united states illegally and acquired permanent resident status only after marrying,and,who had entered legally with his parents and was always legally within the country,but nevertheless acquired permanent resident status many years after his parents achieved it,we concluded that did not foreclose the possibility of imputation.on the contrary,we found a number of persuasive reasons to hold that a child lawful unrelinquished domicile under section c is that of his or her parents.id.
first,we observed that the position espoused by the government would subvert the fundamental policies animating section c.id.severing the bonds between parents and their children who had resided legally in the united states for the better part of their lives would frustrate the section just and humane goal of providing relief to those for whom deportation would result in peculiar or unusual hardship.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,section c core policy concerns would be directly frustrated by the government proposal to ignore the parent domicile in determining that of the child.id.at.the existence of other sections of the ina giving a high priority to the relationship between permanent resident parents and their children lent strength to this analysis id.
second,congress use of the term domicile reinforced the imputation of this form of status,because children are,legally speaking,incapable of forming the necessary intent to remain indefinitely in a particular place,and thus can not determine their own domicile,id.at.we therefore held that parents lawful unrelinquished domicile should be imputed to their minor children under section c.id.at quoting c.the second and third circuits,the only other circuits to consider this issue before iirira repealed section c,reached the same conclusion,imputing a parent accumulation of lawful unrelinquished domicile to that parent minor children.see rosario ins,cir morel ins,cir,vacated on other grounds,cir.
section a and 
we first considered the possibility of imputation under section a in.see at.facing removal due to a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude,satisfied section a permanent residence requirement.however,the ij found him ineligible for cancellation of removal because he had not satisfied section a continuous residence requirement,although he had lived in the united states since,when he was one year old.id.at a.the bia affirmed in a reasoned opinion,rejecting argument that allowed the imputation of his mother continuous residence as a permanent resident to satisfy the requirement,at.
because the bia interpreted section a in its opinion,we applied chevron deference in our review,asking whether the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,and if so whether the agency interpretation is based on a reasonable,permissible construction of the statute,at quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d.after concluding that section a is silent regarding imputation,id.at,we took up the tools of statutory construction to assess whether the bia interpretation of a as being unamenable to imputation is a reasonable one,id.at.examining,the legislative history of section a,and the statutory framework of the ina,we concluded that the bia interpretation was unreasonable,see id.at,and held that for purposes of satisfying the of continuous residence after having been admitted in any status required for cancellation of removal under a,a parent admission for permanent resident status is imputed to the parent unemancipated minor children residing with the parent,id.at.
the statutory framework and congressional intent 
before its repeal,section c provided that a liens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years,may be admitted in the discretion of the attorney general.c repealed 
in applying section c,the courts of appeals developed conflicting interpretations of its requirement that permanent residents demonstrate a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years.id.our circuit and the fourth circuit followed the bia longstanding interpretation,restricting the accumulation of lawful unrelinquished domicile to immigrants who had been admitted for permanent residence.see,at chiravacharadhikul ins,cir matter of,bia.the second,third,and seventh circuits disagreed,concluding that the domicile requirement could be satisfied by lawful domicile prior to admission as a lawful permanent resident,so long as the immigrant was also eventually admitted for permanent residence.see lok ins,cir morel,at ins,cir.the fifth,tenth,eleventh,and circuits discussed the conflicting interpretations,but did not decide the issue.see ins,cir onwuneme ins,cir melian ins,cir anwo ins.
the legislative history confirms that by enacting iirira,congress intended to address,among other things,the circuits varying interpretations of section c.in,the senate had considered a predecessor bill to iirira entitled the immigration enforcement improvements act,cong.see cong.rec,may.in title iii,section b,the bill set forth a cancellation of removal provision with the same basic requirements as section a five years of permanent residence,and seven years of continuous residence in a analysis of the bill,the department of justice stated that section b would clarify an area of the law regarding the cutoff periods for these benefits that have given rise to significant litigation and different rules being applied in different judicial circuits.cong.rec.at.
section a resolved the section c circuit split with the same compromise that had been proposed in the immigration enforcement improvements act,requiring at least five years of residence after being lawfully admitted for permanent residence and seven years of continuous residence after having been admitted in any status.a.it is thus apparent that,in enacting section a,congress intended to clear up a longstanding disagreement between the various courts of appeals and the bia regarding the type of status necessary to qualify for relief under former c,at see also gonzales,cir ultimately,congress designed the dual requirement of a legal permanent residency and continuous residence in any status,a,to clear up prior confusion and to strike a balance between the conflicting interpretations by counting a limited period of time spent in status while still requiring at least five years of permanent resident status.internal quotation marks omitted 
moreover,it is equally apparent that congress modifications to section c were not intended to alter the availability of imputation to the unemancipated minor children of parents who qualified for relief.the circuits did not split as to the underlying policy objectives motivating section c,but simply over the type of status necessary to satisfy lawful unrelinquished domicile.therefore,the fundamental goal underlying this discretionary remedy to provide relief from deportation for those who have lawfully formed strong ties to the united states,at unaffected by this clarification of the requirements to secure that relief.
the bia decision in in re escobar 
in denying escobar direct appeal,the bia disagreed with our opinion in and declined to apply our reasoning to the residence requirement in section a.see in re escobar,at.however,the holding,reasoning,and logic of apply equally to the resident status requirements of both section a and a,and thus imputation of the custodial parent status to the minor is compelled.
a.our deference to the bia 
it is that congress delegated to the bia the authority to promulgate rules,on behalf of the attorney general,that carry the force of law through a process of adjudication,at quoting ins,d.however,only selected decisions of the board rendered by a panel or by the board en banc may be designated to serve as precedents.id.at quoting g.although the bia published,decision in in re escobar requires chevron deference,we have previously applied chevron and found the bia interpretation of section a unreasonable.see,at.indeed,when scrutinized,the bia decision in in re escobar can not fairly be characterized as a new interpretation of section a,but is rather the same unreasonable interpretation we rejected in thus,our precedent guides our assessment of the bia interpretation under chevron.
b.the requirement of lawful admission for permanent residence and the question of congressional intent 
contrary to the government assertion,is controlling precedent for the imputation of lawful permanent resident status from a parent to a child.in re escobar,at.further,although being lawfully admitted for permanent residence is a term of art,defined in a as the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the united states as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws,such status not having changed,it does not follow that allowing imputation for the permanent residence requirement would run contrary to the clear intent of congress.in re escobar,at.
first,review of the plain language of the statute demonstrates that both sections c and a use a variant of the word lawful in setting out their requirements.section c required lawful unrelinquished domicile,and section a requires an applicant to have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.thus,the government emphasis on section a requirement of being lawfully admitted is clearly misplaced.at.if the change from requiring seven years of domicile to seven years of residence after having been admitted did not prevent imputation,see,at,surely the change from lawful unrelinquished domicile to lawfully admitted for permanent residence should have no such effect.indeed,when we decided,we had already held that to be eligible for section c relief,aliens must accumulate seven years of lawful unrelinquished domicile after their admission for permanent residence.at quoting,at.thus,by allowing imputation for minor children to satisfy the domicile requirement,necessarily held that a parent admission to permanent resident status is imputed to the child for purposes of section c relief,at.accordingly,although the status requirement in section a is distinct,the distinction is not relevant,and we again conclude that the change in terminology is not so great as to be dispositive.id.at.
second,because escobar actually has been admitted for permanent residence,it is beyond dispute that she has satisfied the substantive and procedural requirements of admission for permanent residence she has failed to satisfy only the component of this requirement,which was imposed to probe the duration of an alien lawful ties to the united states.see,at.the government defense of the bia decision is thus flawed in two critical respects the decision is factually inaccurate in implying that escobar has not satisfied the mandated statutory and regulatory application process and the substantive eligibility requirements for admission.in re escobar,at.the decision also erroneously suggests that imputing status for the sole purpose of assessing eligibility for cancellation of removal necessarily requires imputing in other contexts and with regard to other forms of relief.see id.at.although the bia asserts that if imputation of a parent lawful permanent residence would allow a minor alien to fulfill the requirements for cancellation of removal,the child would never have to become a lawful permanent resident in his own right,id.at,this is simply not the case.the possibility of cancellation only arises when removal proceedings have been initiated.many more benefits accrue to those who attain lawful permanent resident status than the one avenue to relief from removal,such as eligibility for employment,the right to live permanently in the united states,the ability to vote in state and local elections that do not require citizenship,the ability to travel freely within and without the united states,and the ability to pursue citizenship.imputing a parent status for purposes of cancellation would convey none of these other significant and desirable benefits.
finally,the government wrongly asserts that allowing imputation under section a would be inconsistent with the purpose of the ina and the intent of congress when it amended the statute to add the relief of cancellation of removal for certain permanent residents.id.at.if section a silence regarding imputation suggests anything,it suggests that congress acquiesced in the unanimous practice of the circuits to consider the issue,all of which had found imputation appropriate under section c.regardless,in light of the statutory scheme and legislative history of section a,allowing imputation for both the requirements would not essentially destroy the distinct tests mandated by congress when it amended the statute,id.at,because the distinct tests were created to resolve a circuit split that did not concern imputation,see,at.as discussed,section a was only intended to clarify the type of status necessary to qualify for relief.id.emphasis added.therefore,unlike the physical presence at issue in ramos barrios,which does not include an element of status,intent,or state of mind,ramos barrios,at,the status requirements of section c and section a are equally amenable to imputation.
moreover,even with imputation,the requirements of section a and remain distinct,as all applicants for cancellation of removal as permanent residents are still required to demonstrate both five years spent as a lawful permanent resident and seven years of residence after admission in any status applicants who have spent time in the united states as the unemancipated minor children of lawful permanent resident parents merely have an alternative mechanism to demonstrate that they satisfy these distinct mechanism that is wholly consistent with,if not compelled by,the statutory scheme.see,at noting the congressional policy of recognizing that presence in the united states of an extended length gives rise to such strong ties to the united states that removal would result in undue hardship.thus,allowing imputation to satisfy section a requirement would not be contrary in any way to congressional intent.
c.the bia consistent willingness to impute in other contexts 
the government champions the bia assertion that its prior decisions do not support the automatic imputation of lawful permanent resident status from parent to child,noting that the cases cited in all deal with aliens whose relatives abandoned their lawful permanent resident status and the resulting imputation of the abandonment of that status.at.the government identifies two reasons why this distinction is relevant.
first,the government notes that imputing the abandonment of permanent resident status is consistent with the longstanding policy that a child can not form the intent necessary to establish his or her own domicile.id.this observation lacks relevance it is a distinction that makes no difference.the argument appears to be that the abandonment of permanent resident status requires intent,and therefore imputation is appropriate,whereas the acquisition of permanent resident status does not require intent,so imputation is not appropriate.but we know of no authority for the proposition that intent,standing alone,is the touchstone of imputation analysis.in,we dealt with a more cogent version of this argument.see at.there,we rejected the assertion that the status of admission could not be imputed because,unlike domicile,which depends on intent or capacity,admission does not depend on either intent or capacity.id.as suggests,it is unreasonable to impute the abandonment of permanent resident status while refusing to impute the acquisition of such status under section a.indeed,while unemancipated minors may be technically capable of attaining lawful permanent resident status without their parents assistance,it is not reasonable to expect them to do so.the imputation of both domicile and permanent resident status to minor children is appropriate,so far as cancellation of removal is concerned,precisely because the minor either is legally incapable of satisfying one of these criteria or could not reasonably be expected to satisfy it independent of his parents.ramos barrios,at.
second,the government insistence that acquiring lawful permanent resident status,with the attendant eligibility requirements,is necessarily more complicated than abandoning such status,in re escobar,at,is similarly not probative.as noted,there is no dispute that escobar satisfied the attendant eligibility requirements to acquire permanent resident status.moreover,the fact that it may be more complicated to acquire permanent resident status than to abandon it does not provide any indication as to whether imputation is more appropriate for one than the other.if there is any reasonable conclusion to be drawn from that fact,it is that the complications associated with acquiring permanent resident status favor imputation,as minor children are less equipped to deal with those complications on their own.
accordingly,the bia explanation of its inconsistent imputation practices remains so unclear or contradictory that we are left in doubt as to the reason for the change in direction.holder,cir en banc quoting gonzales,cir en banc.in light of this and apparently arbitrary inconsistency,interpretation of section a continues to receive support from the observation that the bia repeatedly has held that a parent status,intent,or state of mind is imputed to the parent unemancipated minor child in many areas of immigration law,including asylum,grounds of inadmissibility,and legal residency status,at.
d.the bia interpretation of section a is unreasonable 
we acknowledge that,at chevron second step,d eference to an agency interpretation is especially appropriate in the immigration context where officials exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations,at internal quotation marks omitted.further,a t step two our function is not simply to impose our own construction on the statute,as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.rather,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at quoting chevron,at.
with this framework in mind,compels the conclusions that imputation under section a is appropriate,and that a contrary interpretation of the statute is not permissible while agencies retain discretion to fill ambiguous statutory gaps,it does not follow that an agency may repeatedly put forward an interpretation that we already have examined under chevron and found unreasonable at its second step.
moreover,the bia interpretation of the statute remains demonstrably contrary to the fundamental purposes motivating the discretionary relief congress made available in section a.escobar has spent almost her whole life within the united states.when escobar was only thirteen and her mother attained lawful permanent resident status,escobar easily could have adjusted her own status as well,with the assistance of her mother.not only is it absurd to penalize escobar for her mother failure to include her in the adjustment process,but it flies in the face of common sense to conclude that a lawful permanent resident such as escobar,who has spent more than two decades establishing a life in this country,can not be eligible for cancellation of removal,which is premised on the longstanding congressional policy of recognizing that presence in the united states of an extended length gives rise to such strong ties to the united states that removal would result in undue hardship,at citing,sess.further,if escobar had never attained lawful permanent resident status,her eligibility for cancellation of removal would have been governed by section b,under which she easily would have established that she had been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than years.b a.accordingly,we hold that,for purposes of satisfying the five years of lawful permanent residence required under ina section a,a,a parent status as a lawful permanent resident is imputed to the unemancipated minor children residing with that parent.
brand x and duran gonzales do not alter our analysis at chevron second step 
the bia recently relied on in re escobar to deny imputation for section a requirement within our circuit,directly conflicting with our holding in.see matter of,bia.in matter of,the bia applied the supreme court decision in national cable telecommunications ass brand x internet services,d brand x and our decision in duran gonzales dhs,cir to conclude that its subsequent interpretation of section a in in re escobar had undermined the precedential value of.see matter of,at.we disagree.
the bia reliance on brand x and duran gonzales in matter of is misplaced.most notably,in brand x itself,in reaching the prior decision at issue,at t portland,cir,our court had not even considered an agency interpretation of the communications act,nor had we applied chevron deference when we interpreted the statute.see id.at we note at the outset that the fcc has declined,both in its regulatory capacity and as amicus curiae,to address the issue before us.thus,we are not presented with a case involving potential deference to an administrative agency statutory construction pursuant to the chevron doctrine.indeed,the fcc was not even a party to portland.see brand x,at.accordingly,when we authored the decision that the supreme court reversed in brand x,we did not employ a deferential review of an agency interpretation at chevron second step.see brand x internet servs.fcc,cir,rev,d.rather,as the supreme court observed,we declined to apply chevron because we thought the commission interpretation of the communications act was foreclosed by the conflicting construction of the act we had adopted in portland.brand x,at.
similarly,in duran gonzales,we observed that our previous decision in had clearly relied on the agency regulations to reconcile the inadmissibility provision with the special adjustment provision.at.thus,did not foreclose the agency interpretation of the statutory scheme,but rather relied on the regulations to both reject an informal agency interpretation of the inadmissibility provision and reach its holding.id.at quoting brand x,at.accordingly,our conclusion in duran gonzales that the bia new interpretation of these regulations was clearly reasonable did not directly contravene the analysis,which was premised on a different interpretation of the same underlying regulations.see id.at see also,at in the absence of a more complete agency elaboration of how its interpretation of a can be reconciled with its own regulations,we must defer to the regulations rather than to the informal guidance memorandum.
in sum,neither brand x nor duran gonzales suggests that an agency may resurrect a statutory interpretation that a circuit court has foreclosed by rejecting it as unreasonable at chevron second step as both brand x and duran gonzales acknowledged,under chevron,an agency interpretation of a statute it is charged with administering must be reasonable.see brand x,at.duran gonzales,at.in contrast to the prior decisions at issue in brand x and duran gonzales,the panel considered and rejected the precise interpretation of section a that the bia resurrected in in re escobar and extended in matter of.our assessment of in re escobar therefore remains bound by the ongoing validity of our holding in.
b.the motion to reopen 
escobar concedes that her motion to reopen was untimely.absent exceptional circumstances,the untimeliness of a motion to reopen bars consideration of the merits,because we lack jurisdiction to consider whether the bia properly refused to reopen a case sua sponte.toufighi mukasey,cir.escobar has failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances.
escobar argues that we should follow in reaching the merits of her motion.in,we granted and remanded a petition for review in which the petitioner faced removal on the basis of a conviction that had been subsequently vacated and expunged.see at.the bia had denied the petitioner motion to reopen on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction under d because the petitioner had departed from the united states.id.at.because the subsequently vacated conviction was a key part of the government case for removal,id.at,we remanded to the bia for a determination whether the original conviction was vacated on the merits or because of immigration consequences,id.at.
is inapposite.escobar new legal theory is not comparable to a vacated conviction,particularly because this theory did not arise from a change in law or newly discovered evidence.on the contrary,the argument was available from the outset of escobar removal proceedings.moreover,the bia denied motion to reopen because he had left the united states,not because his petition was untimely.
escobar also has not satisfied any of the grounds warranting equitable tolling of the deadline to file a motion to reopen.see iturribarria ins,cir this court recognizes equitable tolling of deadlines and numerical limits on motions to reopen or reconsider during periods when a petitioner is prevented from filing because of deception,fraud,or error,as long as the petitioner acts with due diligence in discovering the deception,fraud,or error.escobar can point to no deception,fraud,or error that delayed her motion to reopen.see id.accordingly,the bia did not abuse its discretion in denying this motion as untimely.
conclusion 
viewing section within the context of the ina,compels the conclusion that the bia interpretation of section a is unreasonable.it is perhaps worth noting that,in so holding,we do not guarantee that escobar and others in her situation may remain in the united states.on the contrary,we merely grant access to the possibility of cancellation of removal,leaving the ultimate determination to the sound discretion of the attorney general.
we further conclude that the bia did not abuse its discretion in denying escobar motion to reopen as untimely.
petition granted and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion petition dismissed.
i concur fully in judge wardlaw opinion.i write separately to express my concern with both the bia current rule and our holding in gonzales,cir.
to qualify for cancellation of removal,a person must have had permanent resident status for five years,a,and must have had continuous residence under any legal immigration status for seven years,id.a.the board of immigration appeals bia has interpreted those requirements strictly a parent legal status can not be im
