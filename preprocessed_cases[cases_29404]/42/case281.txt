ru xiu chen and his wife xiu jin zheng,both natives and citizens of china,petition for review of a final order by the board of immigration appeals bia,denying their applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat.the bia affirmed the decision of an immigration judge ij,who denied their applications on the basis of an adverse credibility finding.we deny their petition.
we briefly summarize petitioners testimony before an ij.chen and zheng were married on august.zheng soon became pregnant with her first child and gave birth to a son on may.
zheng then became pregnant again,in violation of china policy of allowing only one child per couple.on may,when zheng was eight months pregnant,government officials learned of her second pregnancy and came to her house,where she and chen were living,to force her to have an abortion.chen and zheng protested,and seven or eight government officials forcibly removed zheng from the home.zheng was taken to a hospital,where she received an injection directly below her bellybutton.seven or eight hours later,zheng felt intense pain about ten hours later,zheng gave birth to a stillborn baby.chen had followed zheng to the hospital,and zheng later saw chen at the hospital.
shortly thereafter,zheng became pregnant for a third time.she went into hiding and secretly gave birth to a daughter on april.during her pregnancy,zheng received medical care from a private doctor in china.zheng provided no medical records to document the care that she had received from this doctor.
government officials learned of zheng second birth and came to the home of zheng in june,looking to sterilize chen and zheng.zheng testified that family planning authorities had come to her home a total of three times.the first time was the incident in when family planning officials forced zheng to have an abortion.the second time was the june incident.according to zheng,the most recent time that family planning authorities visited her home was in when they came to collect a fine for having more than one child per couple.zheng also described a fourth incident in which the family planning officials had visited her home in to collect the overbirth fine.zheng submitted a letter,which described only the incident.
after the june incident,chen chose to leave china,and zheng moved away from her house.zheng lived with a family friend from july until october.she then lived with her younger brother,where she stayed for more than two years,beginning in october.zheng took her newborn daughter with her but left her son to live with her.
a friend helped chen leave china.initially using a chinese passport in his own name,chen traveled through hong kong,bolivia,and peru before arriving in the united states on july.he presented a fraudulent japanese passport,and immigration officials denied him admission to the united states.chen applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat on january.his application alleged that chinese officials had forced his wife to have an abortion during the eighth month of her pregnancy.chen also claimed that if he were returned to china,he would be forcibly sterilized for violating china policy of allowing one child per couple.
about years later,zheng,who was still living in hiding at her brother home in china,told chen that his father in china was dying of liver cancer.chen chose to return to china to visit his father and applied for advanced parole from immigration officials.the agency granted chen advanced parole on june.chen obtained a passport in his own name from immigration officials,and he traveled to china under his own name for approximately two weeks,returning to the united states on august.the ease with which chen was able to return to china conflicts with his statement in the affidavit he filed in support of his asylum application that he had been smuggled out of china and had been blacklisted by the family planning authorities.
when chen returned to china,he stayed with zheng for five days in a hotel under his own name near the hospital where his father was receiving treatment.family planning officials were hiding in the entrance of the hospital,try ing to catch him.chen mother warned him that the family planning officials were at the hospital,and chen left the area and stayed in the town where his wife had been hiding for several days.family planning officials never came to chen hotel looking for him and did not pursue him further during the time he remained in china.
zheng joined her husband in the united states approximately a year later,entering the country without inspection on july.before coming to the united states,zheng left her two children with her in china.on april,chen filed a second asylum application,listing his wife as a derivative beneficiary.chen attached to his second asylum application the same affidavit describing his experiences in china that he had used for his original asylum application in.he did not mention the incident in which family planning officials were allegedly hiding at the hospital where chen father was receiving treatment.
the agency referred chen asylum application to an ij on april,and simultaneously issued zheng a notice to appear nta,charging her with removability under a a i.on december,zheng appeared before an ij,admitted the facts contained in the nta,and conceded removability.
on february,zheng filed a separate asylum application,listing chen as a derivative beneficiary.zheng application claimed that chinese officials had forced her to have an abortion when she was eight months pregnant in.she also alleged that government officials came looking for her husband following the birth of their second child in and wanted to sterilize him for violating china policy.
petitioners applications subsequently were joined for hearing purposes but were not consolidated.zheng and chen testified before an ij at a hearing on september.at the close of the testimony,the ij noted that she was a little troubled by the changing testimony and at zheng hesitancy in answering some of the questions that were put to her.at the hearing,zheng testified that she had a miscarriage in while she was living in the united states.zheng presented no medical records to corroborate this claim,and her lawyer had only learned of the miscarriage from zheng as they were talking on the way to the hearing that morning.although zheng had been seeing a gynecologist annually since living in the united states and claimed that she was still suffering side effects,such as dizziness,from her forced abortion,she did not mention the abortion to her gynecologist until she suffered the miscarriage in.
the ij offered zheng and chen an opportunity to obtain evidence corroborating their claim,including medical records.she also invited petitioners to have chen brother and zheng sister,both of whom lived nearby in massachusetts,testify and continued the proceedings to allow them to secure those witnesses.chen brother never testified before the ij.
the ij held a further hearing on november.at that hearing,the ij asked zheng questions about the medical records from her doctor in the united states that she had submitted.the ij said that zheng demeanor was very strange indeed when she testified and suggested that having the doctor that zheng had been seeing in the united states testify would help corroborate her testimony and clarify the meaning of some of the notations in her medical record.the ij continued the proceedings to allow zheng doctor and zheng sister to appear as witnesses.the parties agreed to resume the hearing on december.
zheng doctor,however,was unavailable to testify,and the hearing resumed on july.at that time,the ij heard testimony from zheng sister,who stated that zheng first told her about the forced abortion two years after it had allegedly occurred.zheng sister testified that zheng had chosen not to tell her about the abortion for two years because she has heart problems and zheng did not want to cause her stress.
the hearing was continued several times to allow zheng doctor to testify.but zheng doctor ultimately never testified.
