astghik kechichian,a native and citizen of armenia,petitions for review of a final order of removal of the board of immigration appeals bia.the bia agreed with the finding of the immigration judge ij that kechichian is not entitled to withholding of removal because she has not shown that it is more likely than not she would be persecuted were she to return to armenia.the bia declined to address kechichian argument that she is a member of a social group of people with mental illness requiring treatment because she had failed to raise that argument before the ij.the bia also refused to remand the case to the ij on account of a newly produced certificate from the armenian embassy stating that kechichian son is not an armenian citizen.
we deny the petition for review.
kechichian entered the united states on december,with a visitor visa valid through december.on april,she was served with a notice to appear,charging that she had remained in the united states beyond december,without authorization.
in pleadings before the ij on may,kechichian conceded that she was removable as charged in the notice to appear.on february,kechichian filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat 
an affidavit accompanying kechichian application stated that her father had fled armenia in,was currently residing in the united states,and had a pending application for asylum.in armenia,her father had been a doctor and a writer who challenged and frequently came into conflict with government authorities,as a result of which he was harassed and eventually fired from his job.kechichian brother was also a doctor.in,he refused to cover up the beating of an activist,as a result of which he was beaten and held overnight by the government and fired from his job at a hospital.he found a new position,and in april,he was ordered to inject lethal substances into two members of an opposition party,which he refused to do.he escaped the hospital where he worked and,after learning that the government was looking for him,he fled armenia in june.
kechichian further stated that she did not want to return to armenia because she feared she would be persecuted by the government just as her brother was.she noted that she is also a doctor,and i know that i would be similarly threatened by the administration of the hospitals,wh ich are government controlled,to follow their instructions.she also said that she fears her son would be persecuted,refused armenian citizenship,and unable to attend school because his father was not an armenian citizen.
a hearing was held before the ij on june.at this hearing,kechichian testified that she is a native and citizen of armenia.she was married in.she graduated from medical school in and is licensed to practice medicine in armenia,but she has never practiced medicine in armenia or elsewhere.her son was born in armenia but he is not an armenian citizen because his father was not.
kechichian testified that she lived in lebanon from to because her husband was a syrian citizen and his family lived in lebanon.kechichian left lebanon in september or october of because she was depressed and wanted to see her family in armenia.she said that she came with her son to the united states in december in order to visit her father and to seek advice regarding her son lack of armenian citizenship.
kechichian stated that she never practiced medicine because she left armenia shortly after her marriage and she could not practice medicine in lebanon without being a lebanese citizen.
kechichian testified that she does not want to return to armenia because she wants to stay with her son and family and because she fears that she could be harmed because of her relationship to her brother.she also said that if she were to return to armenia,she does not know how she would support herself because she does not think she could find a job as a physician on account of her brother.
kechichian further testified that her mother is divorced from her father,continues to live in armenia,works at a hospital as a physician,and has never been arrested or harmed.she also testified that she has extended family members who live in armenia and she is unaware of any of them being persecuted.
the record before the ij also included a psychiatric evaluation of kechichian conducted by a forensic nurse.this evaluation documents that kechichian suffered depression while living in lebanon and has continued to struggle with symptoms since coming to the united states,although she is hesitant to discuss these problems.the evaluation further states that although kechichian did not suggest anything of the sort,it is possible that her reluctance to discuss her psychiatric symptoms is consistent with reports that the mentally ill are often shunned by their communities in armenia.it also notes that armenian legislation protecting the rights of the mentally ill was only recently passed in june and that the resources available in armenia to treat mental illness are lacking and there is significant social stigma attached to needing such care.
in an oral decision,the ij found that kechichian had not met her burden of establishing entitlement to withholding of removal because she had not established a nexus between her brother and father situations and her own.the ij also found that kechichian had not demonstrated eligibility for cat relief,and that even if she were statutorily eligible for question he did not would not be able to make the required showing that a reasonable person in her position would have a fear of future persecution.the ij granted kechichian voluntary departure.
kechichian appealed the ij decision to the bia.she included with her appeal a certification from the armenian embassy that her son is not considered to be an armenian citizen,and she requested that the bia remand the case to the ij to consider this new evidence because her fear of return to armenia rests in part upon her fear for her son persecution on account of his nationality.she also argued that she is a member of a particular social group of people with mental illness requiring treatment and that she fears persecution on the basis of her membership in this group.she asserted that her psychiatric evaluation provided the basis for this claim and that the ij erred by not considering that she might face persecution on the basis of her mental illness 
on march,the bia issued its own opinion and dismissed kechichian appeal.it held that she failed to demonstrate that she is entitled to withholding of removal because unlike her brother,she is not a member of a social group of physicians unwilling to participate in government corruption because she has never actually practiced medicine,and she has not shown that she is more likely than not to be harmed on account of her relationship to her brother because she has not been persecuted on that basis in the past and her mother and extended family have remained in armenia without incident.the bia declined to address kechichian argument that she is a member of a particular social group of people with mental illness requiring treatment because she had failed to raise this as an issue before the ij.finally,the bia declined to remand the case to the ij based on the embassy certificate because even if kechichian son is not an armenian citizen and even if she fears that he might be harmed because of his lack of citizenship,she had not demonstrated how this would entitle her to withholding of removal.kechichian was again granted voluntary departure.
before us,kechichian challenges the bia conclusion that she was not entitled to withholding of removal on account of both her membership in a social group of physicians who refuse to participate in government corruption and her membership in a persecuted family the bia refusal to consider her mental health status as a part of her claim and the bia refusal to remand the case to the ij to consider the newly introduced evidence.she also argues that her due process rights were violated by the ij and bia failure to consider her mental health argument.
