antonio perez arceo petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia finding him removable under a e i.that statute provides that a ny alien who at any time knowingly has encouraged,induced,assisted,abetted,or aided any other alien to enter or to try to enter the united states in violation of law is inadmissible.antonio was charged as removable along with his son juan and his wife micaela for allegedly participating in an attempt to smuggle micaela undocumented and mother into the united states in a van.the immigration judge ij held a joint hearing in which all three testified that micaela was solely responsible for the smuggling attempt.but while the ij found micaela credible,the ij also found juan and antonio testimony not credible,and the ij held that all three were removable.
we grant antonio petition for review.the bia did not address the ij seemingly inconsistent credibility findings.nor did the ij make a finding that antonio engaged in an affirmative act of help,assistance,or encouragement of smuggling as our case law requires for a violation of a e i.altamirano gonzales,cir.we remand on an open record for the ij to reconsider his ruling,provide further explanation,and engage in further factfinding if necessary.
antonio perez arceo is a mexican citizen who became a legal permanent resident of the united states in.his wife micaela perez de pacheco and his son juan perez pacheco were also legal permanent residents.in early june,the family drove from the united states to mexico to take antonio ill daughter to the doctor.on june,the family attempted to return to the united states in a van through the port of entry in otay mesa,california.juan was driving the van and antonio was in the front passenger seat.micaela sat in the far back row with her mother maria garcia and her maria rodriguez.antonio and micaela other children were in the middle row.the family ride to the border from the home where they had been staying in mexico lasted minutes.
when the family reached the port of entry,border patrol suspected that garcia and rodriguez were not the rightful owners of the documents they presented,and the van was held for inspection.antonio,juan,and micaela were each interviewed separately by a border patrol officer.antonio told border patrol that he knew garcia and rodriguez did not have the proper documents to enter the united states,but he did not realize they were in the vehicle till he woke up while being in line to cross the border.when he realized the undocumented women were in the van,he got into an argument with his wife and son,but he did not leave the van because it was to sic late and he was near the officers sic booth.
micaela told border patrol a similar story.micaela explained that she made arrangements with her brother to smuggle garcia and rodriguez into the united states and her husband antonio had no idea.she further stated that she paid a lady to get documents for her mother and to cross the border.she stated that she regret ted doing it and would never do it again.
when juan was questioned at the border,he told a different story.he said that antonio made the arrangements to bring rodriguez and garcia into the united states.and he said that juan uncle was going to pay antonio for the service.juan stated that antonio gave rodriguez and garcia false immigration documents to use at the border.
juan,antonio,and micaela were each charged with removability for smuggling under a e i,and the proceedings were consolidated.on march,juan submitted an affidavit under oath stating,
i retract the statements made to the immigration officer on or about june,at the border inspection point in otay mesa.i was driving the van,but when i was interviewed by the immigration officer,i was scared.i saw my mother holding the children,and was afraid what would happen to my two younger sisters and younger brother,if the immigration officer detained my mother.out of panic and fear i said that it was my father who made the arrangements.i did not want my younger sisters to be without a mother.
i did not participate in the making of any plans to smuggle garcia and rodriguez to the united states.the one who made all the arrangements was my mother and her brother.my mother agreed with her brother that her brother would pay my mother i was aware that garcia and rodriguez were in the car.however,it was my mother who asked them to get in the van.
juan reiterated,i am certain that my father was not involved in making the arrangements.
the ij held a joint hearing for antonio,micaela,and juan on october.one attorney represented all three respondents.the government initially noted that micaela had conceded removability.juan then testified and explained that his mother had arranged for smuggling garcia and rodriguez.he testified that his march statement implicating his mother was accurate he claimed to have lied during his june interview when placing the blame on antonio because the border patrol had threatened to take the children away from micaela if he did not implicate someone.
antonio then testified consistent with his i statements,explaining that the smuggling was his wife idea and that he had no knowledge of it until they were near the border.antonio testified that he had been drinking the night before and first learned that the women were in the backseat right before reaching the border when they were passing the documents to present to border patrol and he said oh my god,why so many that,according to antonio testimony,is when he turned around and saw garcia and rodriguez in the far back row of the van he had not heard them speak during the trip.antonio surmised that his wife had not told him about the women in the backseat because she had pitched a smuggling plan to him two months earlier and he did not agree.
the government then rested,and the respondents called micaela to the stand.micaela testified consistent with her i that the smuggling had been entirely her idea and antonio had no knowledge of it until they neared the border.she explained that she had hidden it from him because he had previously said no when she brought up the idea.micaela explained that she had kept the women hidden from antonio by seating them in the back row of the van behind the high seats in the middle row.micaela also echoed juan testimony that border patrol told her they would take her kids away if she did tell the truth.
the government then called border patrol officer jesus lopez,who had interviewed all three respondents at the border.lopez testified via telephone that he did not remember this particular case but there was no possible way he had threatened to take anyone kids away and he would never ask questions or make statements before turning on the video recording.
the ij ruled from the bench on october.the ij first held that the burden was on the government to prove removability by clear and convincing evidence.the ij recognized that to prove removability for smuggling,the government must show an affirmative act to attempt or aid in smuggling beyond mere knowledge.see altamirano gonzales,cir.the ij concluded that micaela was removable because of her testimony that she obtained the documents and was going to be paid by her brother to smuggle her and mother into the united states.the ij also relied on micaela admission of guilt in her i form.the ij then turned to juan and found that his affirmative act was driving the van and handing rodriguez and garcia documents to the immigration officials,as well as making a false statement to border patrol regarding rodriguez and garcia intended length of stay.
finally,the ij addressed the issue of antonio removability and stated that he did not believe juan changed story that absolved antonio of guilt,nor did he believe antonio testimony.the ij pointed to five apparent inconsistencies to support his negative credibility determinations about juan and antonio testimony.first,the ij reasoned that antonio said that he was going to mexico to take his son to the doctor,but juan and micaela said they went for a daughter.second,the ij said that juan testified that he and antonio talked in the van on the way to
