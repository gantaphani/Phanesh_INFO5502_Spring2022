elrem islami islami,a former resident of kosovo,and a citizen of yugoslavia came to the united states on december,and,on may,petitioned for asylum and withholding of removal,under the immigration and nationality act of,as well as for protection under article of the convention against torture cat.
in his application,islami alleged that as a muslim and ethnic albanian residing in kosovo,he had been persecuted by ethnic serbs who dominated the yugoslavian government and military.islami escaped from kosovo in february largely to avoid being conscripted into the yugoslavian military,a fate he says he tried to resist because of his concerns that the ethnic serbs physically abused their albanian counterparts and,more importantly for our analysis,because he feared that he would be ordered to participate in unlawful and brutal military campaigns,which were widely condemned internationally.in this respect,he notes that these alleged brutalities were directed especially at his fellow muslims and ethnic albanians.
islami first sought asylum in germany in,but was denied protection and ordered to return to kosovo.he then fled to the united states in december where much of his immediate family had sought refuge and applied for asylum.
on february,an immigration judge ij denied his petition.the ij found that even if islami claims of harassment and mistreatment were true,the actions committed against him did not rise to the level of persecution.moreover,the ij held that islami fears of future persecution were not in light of improved conditions in kosovo particularly given the installation of a new government in belgrade since islami departure.
this decision was summarily affirmed on may,by the board of immigration appeals bia.islami filed the instant petition for review in this court.
he argues that the ij erred as a matter of law in concluding that,because compulsory military service is not a bona fide ground for claiming persecution,islami was not eligible for asylum.islami explains that he was not avoiding military service per se,but rather that he was objecting to being forced to take part in military activities that were widely condemned by the international community as criminal.he also resisted service because he feared physical abuse by ethnic serbs who occupied dominant positions in the military.
additionally,islami contends that the conditions in kosovo have not improved as dramatically as the ij concluded.islami claims that notwithstanding the nato invasion and occupation,incidents of persecution of ethnic albanians persist to this day.
to establish eligibility for asylum,an applicant must show that he or she is a refugee who has suffered past persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,or has a fear of persecution on one of these grounds see a jin shui qiu ashcroft,cir.to be entitled to withholding of removal,the applicant must meet the requirements of asylum eligibility and establish that it is more likely than not that were he or she to be deported his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of one of the five bases for asylum.see diallo,at.it is easier to establish eligibility for asylum,but the power to grant asylum to eligible aliens is discretionary,and reserved to the attorney general.by contrast,the attorney general must withhold the deportation of an alien who passes the stricter test for this form of relief.jin shui qiu,at internal citations omitted 
article of the cat provides that n o state party shall expel or return a person to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,adopted,art.iii,treaty doc,codified at and implemented at.we have defined torture as the intentional infliction of pain or suffering that is perpetrated or sanctioned by a nation authorities.ramsameachire ashcroft,cir see also a defining torture,for purposes of the cat,in equivalent terms wang ashcroft,cir referring to definition of torture in a.
to qualify under the cat,an alien must establish that it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal,ramsameachire,at internal quotation marks omitted.the regulations provide that 
i n assessing whether it is more likely than not that an applicant would be tortured in the proposed country of removal,all evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture shall be considered,including,but not limited to 
i evidence of past torture inflicted upon the applicant 
ii evidence that the applicant could relocate to a part of the country of removal where he or she is not likely to be tortured 
iii evidence of gross,flagrant or mass violations of human rights within the country of removal,where applicable and 
iv other relevant information regarding the conditions in the country of removal.
once an alien has met this burden,the united states may not remove him or her to that country.see ramsameachire,at see also wang,at to be entitled to relief under cat,however,an applicant must establish that there is greater than a fifty percent chance that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured upon return to his or her country of origin.c.
importantly,the ij or bia must consider all evidence of possible torture independent of the ij or bia analysis of asylum claims.in other words,it is reversible error to conclude that a cat claim is necessarily precluded because an applicant had failed to carry his burden of proof with respect to his asylum claim.ramsameachire,at.
we apply the deferential substantial evidence standard in evaluating factual findings of the bia or ij.see wu biao chen ins,cir per curiam.the bia or ij determination will be upheld if it is supported by reasonable,substantial and probative evidence in the record.see ins,cir noting that s ubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla and that it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion internal quotation marks omitted jin shui qiu,at substantial evidence review is slightly stricter than the standard yet we will not reverse the bia simply because we disagree with its evaluation of the facts.internal quotation marks omitted.
we review de novo questions of law regarding what evidence will suffice to carry any asylum applicant burden of proof.id.at.importantly,if the ij or bia were to use an inappropriately stringent standard when evaluating an applicant testimony,we would treat that as a legal,rather than factual error.see ins,cir.
where,as in this case,the bia summarily affirms the ij decision,we review the decision of the ij directly.see id.at.
islami principal claim of persecution involves his refusal to join the national army.typically,compulsory military service does not provide asylum seekers with adequate cause for claiming persecution.see,foroglou ins,cir krastev ins,cir.courts,however,have identified two broad exceptions to this rule.first,if an individual refusal to serve in the military leads to disproportionately excessive penalties,inflicted on him or her because of that individual race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,he or she may be eligible for asylum.see mekhoukh ashcroft,cir.second,an individual may be eligible for asylum if he or she is fleeing to avoid punishment for refusing to join a military force condemned by the international community.see vujisic ins,cir see also mekhoukh,at noting that for an applicant to be eligible for asylum on this basis the military must be condemned by the international community as one that commits human rights abuses and that the petitioner must have a conscientious objection to serving in that military.
here,the ij finding that islami was unlikely to receive disproportionately excessive penalties simply because he was an ethnic albanian was supported by substantial evidence but,the ij erred in failing to recognize that service in the yugoslavian army would likely require islami participat
