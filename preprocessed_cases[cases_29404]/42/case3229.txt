legal,factual,and procedural background 
statutory structure 
section of nacara establishes rules to permit certain classes of aliens,including some from guatemala,to apply for relief from removal under what is titled special rule for cancellation of removal.nacara,stat,nacara.in enacting nacara,congress relaxed the requirements of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat,for cancellation of removal for such aliens by applying the less stringent requirements.see barrios holder,cir munoz ashcroft,cir.
under f of iirira,as amended by nacara,the attorney general has discretion to cancel removal of,and adjust to the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence an alien who,inter alia 
i is not inadmissible or deportable under paragraph or of section a or paragraph,or of section a of the immigration and nationality act and is not an alien described in section b b i of such act 
ii has been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than years immediately preceding the date of such application 
iii has been a person of good moral character during such period and 
iv establishes that removal would result in extreme hardship to the alien or to the alien spouse,parent,or child,who is a citizen of the united states or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
iirira f,as amended by nacara,amended by,stat,no person who has given false testimony for the purpose of obtaining any immigration benefits during the relevant period for which good moral character is required shall be found to be a person of good moral character.f.
if an application for nacara special rule cancellation of removal was treated as a continuing application,an applicant would be required to show good moral character up to the point that a final administrative decision is issued in order to meet nacara requirement.see in re garcia.if,however,an application for nacara special rule cancellation of removal is not a continuing application,then the good moral character period requirement ends on the date the applicant files the application.
ii.factual and procedural history 
aragon is a native and citizen of guatemala,who entered the united states without inspection in.on june,aragon filed an application for special rule cancellation of removal under nacara.on september,helen maudeen wauku,an asylum officer,interviewed aragon.after the interview,the department of homeland security dhs declined to grant aragon application because it appeared from aragon testimony that he was barred from relief as a person who ordered,incited,assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of others under ina c,c.dhs instead referred aragon application to an ij.aragon subsequently submitted an updated nacara application at the request of the ij.
on january,aragon testified about his role in the guatemalan army from to and stated on direct examination that his army unit had arrested one guerrilla.on,aragon testified that his unit had arrested guerrillas on approximately two other occasions,but that he was not present during those arrests.aragon denied that he stated during his nacara interview with wauku that every time his unit engaged in combat,it captured three to six guerillas.
on march,wauku testified before the ij about aragon nacara interview.reviewing the notes she took during the interview,she testified that aragon stated during the interview that his unit had captured between three to six guerrillas every six months.wauku testified that she had concluded after the interview that aragon had assisted a persecutory army because he drove troops to areas where atrocious conflicts had occurred,and was knowledgeable about catching guerrillas.she stated that she had therefore determined that he was ineligible for nacara relief due to the persecutor bar,and had referred his application to an ij.
on march,the ij denied aragon application for nacara special rule cancellation of removal.although the ij found that aragon had established the extreme hardship and continuous physical presence requirements,she found that aragon had given false testimony for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit,either by fabricating incidents during the nacara interview to make himself seem more important or by minimizing incidents during the merits hearing to avoid the persecutor bar.accordingly,the ij found that aragon was unable to establish good moral character under f.the ij concluded that aragon was thus statutorily ineligible for special rule cancellation of removal,and denied his application.
aragon appealed to the bia,which held that an application for special rule cancellation of removal is a continuing application through removal proceedings.as such,the bia explained that the period during which good moral character is required did not end on the date aragon filed his application,but rather extended until a final administrative decision was issued.the bia then affirmed the ij finding that aragon made false statements for the purpose of obtaining special rule cancellation of removal,based on the inconsistencies between his testimony at the merits hearing and the nacara interview.the bia thus affirmed the ij conclusion that aragon was statutorily ineligible for special rule cancellation of removal because he could not establish good moral character during the requisite period.aragon timely filed this petition for review.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal under u.we review questions of law de novo,except to the extent that deference is owed to the bia determination of the governing statutes and regulations.barrios,at.
discussion 
the bia and the ij concluded that aragon presented false testimony during either the nacara interview or the merits hearing for the purpose of obtaining nacara special rule cancellation of removal.because the bia concluded that an application for nacara special rule cancellation of removal is a continuing application,it considered these statements,which were made after aragon filed his application,when determining whether aragon was a person of good moral character.
aragon argues that a nacara application is not continuing in nature.thus,he contends that because his purportedly false statements were made after he filed his application,they should not be taken into account for purposes of making the required good moral character determination.the government counters that we must defer to the bia determination that an application for special rule cancellation of removal is continuing.see garcia,at holding,in the context of the continuous physical presence requirement,that an application for nacara special rule cancellation of removal is a continuing application,and that an applicant can accrue physical presence until the issuance of a final administrative decision in re ortega cabrera,holding that an application for cancellation of removal under ina b,b is a continuing application for purposes of evaluating good moral character.
we employ the chevron framework when reviewing the bia interpretation of its governing statutes.marmolejo campos holder,cir en banc citing chevron natural res.def.council.accordingly,we must first determine whether the intent of congress is clear.chevron,at.if it is,both we and the agency must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.marmolejo campos,at quoting chevron,at.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous,we must then determine whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.
at the first step,we ask whether the statute plain terms directly addres s the precise question at issue.cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,quoting chevron,at.if we,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertain that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.chevron,at.said another way,t he starting point for our interpretation of a statute is always its language,cmty.for creative non violence reid,and we must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.bank germain.when the words of a statute are unambiguous,then,this first canon is also the last judicial inquiry is complete.id.at internal quotation omitted.
the relevant portion of nacara states that the attorney general has discretion to cancel removal of an alien,who,among other requirements 
ii has been physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than years immediately preceding the date of such application and 
iii has been a person of good moral character during such period.
nacara emphasis added.
the plain terms of the statute require that an applicant for nacara special rule cancellation of removal be a person of good moral character during the requisite period of continuous physical presence,which is not less than years immediately preceding the date of such application.nacara a ii.when must the applicant have good moral character he must have it during such period,id.a iii,which clearly refers back to the period of time for which continuous physical presence is required,as stated in nacara a ii.the plain language of nacara is thus clear the period of time for which an applicant must show good moral character refers to the period of seven years immediately preceding the date of the nacara application,id.a ii,and ends on the date that application is filed.for this reason,any conduct occurring after the filing of the application is irrelevant to the good moral character determination required under the plain language of the statute under the plain terms of nacara,an application for special rule cancellation of removal is therefore not a continuing application.
the language of the suspension of deportation statute,a repealed by iirira on september,emphasis added,provides additional support for our conclusion that the statutory language relevant to special rule cancellation of removal under nacara unambiguously establishes that it is not a continuing application.to have been eligible for suspension of deportation,an alien must have established,inter alia,that he was physically present in the united states for a continuous period of not less than seven years immediately preceding the date of such application,and that during all of such period he was and is a person of good moral character.id.emphasis added see also b requiring that alien was and is a person of good moral character to be eligible for suspension of deportation under nacara.this language shows that congress knew how to expand the required period of good moral character beyond the period immediately preceding the date of application by using the expansive language was and is rather than the past tense has been,cuadra gonzales,cir,but did not do so for special rule cancellation of removal.see.bank,at russello united states,w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.internal quotation omitted see also keene united states,highlighting a court duty to refrain from reading a phrase into the statute when congress has left it out.
the government asserted at oral argument that the date of such application language in the nacara special rule cancellation of removal statute is ambiguous first,the government argued that the nacara special rule cancellation of removal statute is ambiguous for the same reasons the seventh circuit found ambiguity in the cancellation of removal statute,b,in duron ortiz holder,cir.in duron ortiz,the seventh circuit held that the inclusion of a rule,which provides that any period of continuous physical presence ends when the alien is served a notice to appear,d,adds ambiguity to the cancellation of removal statute.duron ortiz,at.the seventh circuit explained that this interplay of the statutory language creates ambiguity because the stoptime provision renders the date of the application language superfluous when the notice to appear is served.id.the seventh circuit concluded that i n light of the possible ambiguity the provision adds to the cancellation of removal statute,it must defer to the bia reasonable interpretation of when an alien must show good moral character for cancellation of removal.id.however,unlike the provision at issue in duron ortiz,nacara special rule cancellation of removal does not include such a rule.see nacara.therefore,the ambiguity that the seventh circuit described in the cancellation of removal statute is not present in the nacara special rule cancellation of removal statute.
second,the government pointed to aragon nacara application to argue that the statutory language the date of such application is ambiguous.see also garcia,at.the government represented that aragon had filed two nacara applications,and claimed that it was therefore unclear to which date the statute refers.even if we were to consider arguments based on documents extrinsic to the statute in evaluating the statute meaning,this argument is plainly incorrect.the record shows that the second application that aragon submitted was an update to his initial application.moreover,the dhs notice to aragon,dated september,which notified him that dhs declined to grant his application after the nacara interview,specifically stated that it was not a denial of his application,and that the application would be referred to an ij.the notice also provided that the ij may give aragon permission to supplement his present application.we see no ambiguity in the language of the statute referring to the date of such application,and the government attempts to manufacture ambiguity are unpersuasive 
for these reasons,the plain language of the nacara special rule cancellation of removal statute unambiguously expresses congress intent that the relevant good moral character period is the period preceding the filing of the application.we therefore hold that an application for special rule cancellation of removal under nacara is not a continuing application.because the statutory language is unambiguous,we end our inquiry at chevron first step,and need not reach the question whether the bia approach is based on a permissible construction of the statute.see chevron,at.this result is consistent with that of the eighth circuit in cuadra gonzales,which is the only other federal appellate decision to address this precise issue.at.
in reaching this result,we acknowledge that it may allow an alien who presents false testimony after his application is filed to nonetheless show good moral character for purposes of special rule cancellation of removal.however,we decline to allow policy considerations to inject ambiguity into the text of an unambiguous statute.using extrinsic policy considerations to determine whether there is statutory ambiguity is plainly contrary to supreme court precedent on both chevron step one and statutory interpretation more generally.see,depierre united states,that we may rue inartful legislative drafting does not excuse us from the responsibility of construing a statute as faithfully as possible to its actual text.bank,
