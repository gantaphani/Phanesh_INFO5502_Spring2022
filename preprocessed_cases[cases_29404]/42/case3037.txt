joseph ngure petitions for review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture.we hold that the determination whether the bia properly employed its streamlined affirmance without opinion procedure with respect to ngure claims is committed to agency discretion by law.reviewing the decision of the immigration judge ij,which was affirmed without opinion by the bia,we conclude that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the ij determination that ngure application for asylum was untimely.as to those claims over which we have jurisdiction,we deny the petition for review.
on august,joseph ngure,a native and citizen of kenya,entered the united states as a nonimmigrant student to attend principia college in elsah,illinois.the terms of his visa permitted him to stay in the united states until june.on january,the ins issued a notice to appear charging that ngure was removable for failing to maintain his nonimmigrant status.ngure admitted that he was removable,and on may,he applied for asylum,withholding of removal under b,and relief under the convention against torture.
ngure is a member of the kikuyu tribe,which is the largest tribe in kenya.while ngure was a student at the university of nairobi in,he participated in a demonstration protesting,among other things,the detention of various political prisoners and the marginalization of tribes such as the kikuyu.due to violence that erupted at the demonstration,the university closed.at that time,ngure was arrested while he was in his room.soon after he arrived at the police station,he secured his release because he knew the superintendent of police.ngure claims that his friend charles kirigua was arrested and tortured for his involvement in the demonstration,but kirigua actually told ngure that he was injured during a robbery.
again,in,ngure participated in a demonstration that became riotous,and government forces arrested hundreds of participants,including ngure.when he was arrested,he was hit with batons and truncheons.he was detained at a police station for one week,during which time he was interrogated,roughed up,and subjected to cold and crowded conditions.the interrogations focused on whether he was affiliated with any dissident kenyan groups.ngure told the officials that while he was not a member of the groups,he sympathized with their causes.the following week ngure was questioned in more tranquil settings at the directorate of intelligence.he was then returned to the police station for another week,at which time ngure bailed him out of jail,and the government dropped the charges against him.
ngure is a follower of the christian science faith.in,his christian science group met in the park,but police officials advised them that they needed to have a permit to meet in the park and ordered them to disperse.the police took names,but none of the meeting attendees were harmed or arrested.
when ngure was working in nairobi in,he was arrested as he passed by a at a park.he was charged with participating in illegal demonstrations,and was released the next morning on a recognizance bond.the bond required ngure to report to the police station on a monthly basis until the riots were resolved.
after ngure left kenya for the united states in,the kenyan police went to the home of ngure family because he failed to report as scheduled pursuant to the bond.when ngure was not found,an arrest warrant was issued on february,commanding the arrest of ngure and ordering him to be brought before the court to answer the charge that he participated in illegal demonstrations at uhuru park freedom corner and defaulting on his own recognizance to appear.
in november,an ij conducted an evidentiary hearing concerning ngure removal from the united states.the ij concluded that ngure was ineligible for asylum because he did not file his application within one year of arriving in the united states and did not demonstrate any changed or extraordinary circumstances that caused his failure to apply within that time period.see a b d.alternatively,the ij found that although ngure testimony was credible,he did not suffer past persecution or have a fear of future persecution on account of his membership in the kikuyu tribe,political opinions,or religious beliefs.based on the same evidence,the ij denied his requests for withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture.the bia subsequently affirmed the ij decision without opinion,pursuant to e pursuant to agency regulations,the ij decision became the final agency determination.e ii.
prior to,a panel of three bia members reviewed the decisions of immigration judges.after concluding that the rapidly growing caseload of the board of immigration appeals was impeding its ability to provide fair,timely,and uniform adjudications,attorney general reno instituted the bia affirmance without opinion awo procedure in.executive office for immigration review board of immigration appeals streamlining.attorney general ashcroft amended the awo regulations in in an effort to strengthen and enhance the review process.board of immigration appeals procedural reforms to improve case management.
the streamlining regulations provide that a single board member shall affirm without opinion an ij decision in certain circumstances.the bia member is required to employ the awo procedure if the member finds that the result reached by the ij was correct,that any errors by the ij were harmless or nonmaterial,and that either the issues on appeal are squarely controlled by existing board or federal court precedent and do not involve the application of precedent to a novel factual situation or the factual and legal issues raised on appeal are not so substantial that the case warrants the issuance of a written opinion in the case.e i.the decision to affirm without opinion does not necessarily approve the reasoning of the ij,but it does signify that the bia agrees that the result was correct because any errors were harmless or nonmaterial.e ii.once the bia affirms a decision without opinion,the ij decision becomes the final agency determination.palomino ashcroft,cir.
our court,like every court of appeals to consider the question,has held that the awo procedure comports with the due process clause of the fifth amendment.loulou ashcroft,cir,amended by,slip op.cir.april,belbruno ashcroft,cir yuk ashcroft,cir dia ashcroft,cir en banc georgis ashcroft,cir mendoza att y,cir albathani ins,cir.in loulou,we explained that an alien has no constitutional or statutory right to an administrative appeal from the decision of an ij.at.any such right,we observed,is created by regulations issued by the attorney general,and the current regulations do not entitle an alien to a full opinion by the bia.id.as a matter of constitutional law,the alien is entitled only to a reasoned decision from the agency,not from a particular component of the agency.yuk,at dia,at albathani,at.we concluded in loulou that streamlined review did not compromise our ability to review the decision of the attorney general,because we can review directly the decision of the ij.at.accordingly,we rejected the constitutional challenge to the awo procedure.id.at.
ngure raises a nonconstitutional challenge to the use of the streamlining procedure in his case he argues that the bia decision to affirm without opinion does not comply with the governing regulations,and that this court should remand the case to the bia for issuance of a written opinion by a panel.the government implicitly concedes that as a general matter,the justice department failure to follow its own regulations can be challenged under the administrative procedure act apa.see webster doe,d vitarelli seaton,d service dulles,d.the government contends,however,that the decision to employ the awo procedure in a given case is committed to agency discretion by law,within the meaning of the apa,a,and that we have no jurisdiction to review it.our jurisdiction,under that view,is limited to reviewing the decision of the ij,which constitutes the final determination by the agency 
there is a basic presumption of judicial review of agency action.lincoln vigil,d internal quotations omitted.this is just a presumption,however,and in certain instances,agency action is deemed committed to agency discretion by law,and thus unreviewable by the courts.id.at.over the years,the supreme court has held that judicial review is precluded for certain administrative decisions that are traditionally left to agency discretion,id.at,under what has been described as the common law of judicial review of agency action.heckler chaney,d.these discretionary actions include such matters as whether to institute an enforcement action,id.at,how to allocate funds from a appropriation,lincoln,at,and whether to grant reconsideration of an action because of material error.icc of locomotive engineers,d.
the supreme court typically has held that actions are committed to agency discretion where it is not possible to devise an adequate standard of review for an agency action,such as where the relevant statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency exercise of discretion.chaney,at.see also united states juvenile male,cir north dakota ex rel.bd.of and sch.lands yeutter,cir.courts often ask whether there is sufficient law to apply in reviewing the agency action.citizens to preserve overton park,volpe,d.an important factor in discerning whether there is a meaningful standard for judicial review is whether the agency decision involves a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise.chaney,at.in that situation,t he agency is far better equipped than the courts to deal with the many variables involved in the proper ordering of its priorities.id.at.see also lincoln,at.
there is no statute that requires the bia to issue a written opinion in any particular case,and ngure does not contend that a statute provides the requisite law to apply.as noted,however,the judiciary may in certain contexts review an agency compliance with its own regulations when the regulations impose binding norms on the agency.vitarelli,at.dulles,at.as a general rule,an agency pronouncement is transformed into a binding norm if so intended by the agency,and agency intent,in turn,is ascertained by an examination of the statement language,the context,and any available extrinsic evidence.padula webster,internal quotations and citations omitted.we consider the language and context of agency regulations to determine whether they were intended to bind the agency discretion.south dakota ubbelohde,cir.the supreme court has conducted judicial review,for example,where agency rules were intended primarily to confer important procedural benefits upon individuals in the face of otherwise unfettered discretion,am.farm lines black ball freight,d citing vitarelli,d,or where a rule required the agency to exercise independent discretion,but it failed to do so.united states ex rel.accardi shaughnessy.on the other hand,where a procedural rule is designed primarily to benefit the agency in carrying out its functions,judicial review may be circumscribed.am.farm lines,at.
several considerations lead us to conclude that the bia decision whether to employ the awo procedure in a particular case is committed to agency discretion and not subject to judicial review.first,an administrative agency decision about how to allocate its scarce resources to accomplish its complex mission traditionally has been free from judicial supervision.this tradition of deference is rooted in the separation of powers,and the respect of the judiciary for the functions of a coordinate branch of government.it is absolutely clear that absent constitutional constraints or extremely compelling circumstances,administrative agencies should be free to fashion their own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable of permitting them to discharge their multitudinous duties.vermont yankee nuclear power natural res.def.council,d internal quotations and citations omitted.well before enactment of the apa,the supreme court recognized that administrative agencies and administrators will be familiar with the industries which they regulate and will be in a better position than federal courts or congress itself to design procedural rules adapted to the peculiarities of the industry and the tasks of the agency involved.id.at.quoting fcc schreiber,d see also fcc pottsville broadcasting.
the attorney general explanation for the awo procedure demonstrates the applicability of these principles to the immigration review process 
to operate effectively in an environment where over appeals and motions are filed yearly,the board must have discretion over the methods by which it handles its cases.the process of screening,assigning,tracking,drafting,revising,and circulating cases is extremely time consuming.even in routine cases in which all panel members agree that the result reached below was correct,disagreements concerning the rationale or style of a draft decision can require significant time to resolve.the department has determined that the board resources are better spent on cases where there is a reasonable possibility of reversible error in the result reached below.
streamlining.at.we believe that the tradition of agency discretion over internal procedures is particularly strong in this case,because judicial deference to the executive branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context where officials exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations.ins,d quoting ins abudu,d.
second,our review of the text,structure,and history of the streamlining regulations leads us to conclude that the attorney general surely did not intend to create substantive rights for aliens in the determination whether a particular decision of an ij was affirmed without opinion.as the department of justice explained when adopting the initial streamlining regulations 
the number of appeals filed with the board in recent years has exceeded the board capacity to give meaningful,consideration to each appeal,and to issue written decisions in every case.the summary affirmance process is a reasonable response to the current situation,because it allows the board to concentrate its resources on cases where there is a reasonable possibility of reversal,or where a significant issue is raised in the appeal,while still providing assurances that correct results are achieved in all cases under the board appellate jurisdiction.
streamlining.at.the justice department again stressed the importance of streamlining as a management tool when amending the regulations in the department has concluded that streamlining has proven to be an effective procedure for managing an caseload and will significantly assist and promote fair and expeditious review of all pending and incoming appeals while maintaining a respondent rights to a reasoned administrative decision.procedural reforms to improve case management.at.consistent with this theme,the awo regulation appears in a section entitled case management system.e.
to say the least,judicial review of the bia streamlining decision would have disruptive practical consequences for the attorney general administration of the alien removal process.southern ry.seaboard allied milling,d.it is,of course,a basic principle of administrative law that where agency action is subject to judicial review,the agency must provide an adequate reasoned explanation of its decision.sec chenery.sec chenery.the attorney general streamlining regulations,however,explicitly prohibit the bia from providing any explanation for its decision to affirm without opinion.e ii.the reason seems evident if the bia were required to explain in each case why the result reached by the ij was correct,why any errors were harmless or nonmaterial,why the issues on appeal are squarely controlled by precedent and do not involve application of precedent to a novel factual situation,and why the issues are not so substantial that the case warrants issuance of a written opinion,see id.e i,then the bia would be required to write the functional equivalent of a written opinion on the merits in every adjudication.indeed,if we were to hold that the streamlining decision is subject to judicial review,then we would expect aliens regularly to challenge the bia affirmance without opinion on the ground that it failed to provide an adequate explanation for its judicially reviewable decision to affirm without opinion.
it is readily apparent,however,that by setting criteria for which cases should be decided through affirmance without opinion,the attorney general did not intend primarily to confer important procedural benefits upon individuals in the face of otherwise unfettered discretion.am.farm lines,at.we believe the attorney general intended primarily to provide bia members with a mechanism to use their scarce resources efficiently as they carried out the attorney general responsibility to enforce the immigration laws.in this regard,we think the justice department regulation is not unlike this court rule,which provides that a judgment may be affirmed without opinion in certain enumerated circumstances.see cir.rule it has never been thought that the supreme court would review the propriety of this court decision to affirm a district court without opinion under rule,as opposed to the merits of the underlying decision,and we see no reason to believe that the department of justice intended its comparable rule to have a different effect.
third,the specific determinations that ngure would have us review are not amenable to judicial consideration.for a court to rule that ngure case did not satisfy the criteria for affirmance without opinion,it would have to conclude either that the result reached by the ij was incorrect including that any errors made by the ij were not harmless,or that the bia was wrong to find that factual or legal issues raised on appeal are not so substantial that the case warrants the issuance of a written opinion in the case.e i we conclude that it is not possible to devise a meaningful and adequate standard of review with respect to either point.
review of the first the result reached by the ij was a situation similar to that which the supreme court confronted in icc locomotive engineers.there,the court considered the authority of the interstate commerce commission to reopen a proceeding and reconsider its prior actions because of material error.in holding that the icc refusal to reopen a proceeding was committed to agency discretion by law,the court observed that an appeal of such a refusal places before the courts precisely the same substance that could have been brought there by appeal from the original asks them to review it on the strange,basis of whether the agency decision is not only unlawful,but so unlawful that the refusal to reconsider it is an abuse of discretion.locomotive engineers,at.the court concluded that an appeal of a refusal to reopen proceedings serves no purpose whatever,because the aggrieved party could simply appeal the original order directly to the courts.id.noting that federal courts often deny rehearing petitions without subjecting that denial as opposed to the underlying decision to further appellate review,the supreme court held that the apa codified a tradition of nonreviewability that exists with regard to refusals to reconsider for material error,by agencies as well as by lower courts.id.at.
the bia decision to affirm without opinion is comparable to the icc decision to deny a motion to reopen in important respects.when the bia summarily affirms,the decision of the ij becomes the final agency determination.an alien may petition the court of appeals for review of the agency decision.ngure,however,would have this court review both whether the result of the ij decision was correct,and whether the bia was correct to conclude that the result of the ij decision was correct.review of the bia determination would duplicate the review of the merits already undertaken,but on the strange,removed basis of whether the ij decision not only is wrong,but so wrong that affirming it without opinion was an abuse of discretion.id.at.as in locomotive engineers,an appeal to determine whether the bia was correct to find that the ij decision was correct serves no purpose whatever when the court can directly review the ij decision.see also georgis,at observing that it makes no practical difference whether the bia properly or improperly streamlined review of georgis case because the court of appeals reviews directly the decision of the ij.and where a statute precludes judicial review of the ij determination,the court of appeals also lacks jurisdiction to review the bia decision to affirm without opinion,because such review would require the court to examine the merits of the ij unreviewable determination.falcon carriche ashcroft,cir.
with respect to the second the issues presented to the bia were so substantial that the case warrants the issuance of a written opinion we conclude that there is no manageable standard for judicial review.the question here is not whether the issues are substantial in the abstract,or whether the case presents a substantial question of law or fact,as in the familiar determination for release of a criminal defendant pending appeal.see,b b united states powell,cir.the term substantial is modified in the regulation by the requirement that the issues be so substantial that they warrant the issuance of a written opinion.e i b emphasis added.
whether a particular case warrants the issuance of a written opinion is necessarily a function of the bia limited resources at a particular point in time,and the views of members of the bia as to whether those limited resources should be dedicated to writing an opinion in a given case.that decision about allocation of resources turns on a determination by the bia members,given their expertise in the field and their experience in reviewing thousands of administrative appeals,whether the administration of the immigration laws would be enhanced by publishing an opinion.see e.we respectfully disagree,therefore,with dictum from our sister circuit in denko ins,cir,that the size of the bia factor which the board may be better equipped to no relevance in deciding which cases are appropriate for summary affirmance.as the department of justice explained in 
the summary affirmance system represents a careful balancing of the need to ensure correct results in individual cases with the efficiencies necessary to maintain a viable appellate organization that handles an extraordinarily large caseload.the streamlining system will allow the board to manage its caseload in a more timely manner while permitting it to continue providing nationwide guidance through published precedents in complex cases involving significant legal issues.
streamlining.at.like other decisions committed to agency discretion by law,the bia streamlining determination involves a complicated balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise,chaney,at,including the size of the bia caseload and the limited resources available to the bia.
as even ngure concedes,moreover,t he regulation provides no guidance about what would make a factual or legal issue not so substantial that a written decision is not warranted.brief of petitioner at.the regulations do specify that one of several enumerated circumstances must be present before the bia is permitted to employ a panel,e,but they do not require that the bia must issue a written opinion in any particular circumstance.we thus part company with the tenth circuit,which found it significant that the circumstances in which panel review is permissible have nothing to do with the bia caseload or other internal circumstances.batalova ashcroft,cir.if the courts fashion a lower threshold or different criteria than the bia for determining what is substantial enough to require a written opinion,then the judiciary may well compel the bia to issue more opinions than it is equipped to produce,thus undermining the resource allocation goals that led to the streamlining process in the first place.this presumably is why the department of justice made clear in that it did not intend to cause judicial enforcement of panel review,and accordingly crafted regulatory language to ensure that a single bia member has discretion to refer cases to a panel in accordance with e.see procedural reforms to improve case management.at.we believe the regulation is designed not to provide aliens with an enforceable right to written opinions,but rather to give the bia flexibility to decide whether a particular issue,at a particular time,warrants the dedication of scarce resources.
ngure relies on haoud ashcroft,cir,for the proposition that this case should be remanded to the bia for a written opinion like ngure case,haoud involved a decision of an ij that denied an alien claim for asylum on alternative grounds,one of which was subject to judicial review insufficient evidence of persecution,and one of which was declared unreviewable by statute untimely asylum application.id.at.the first circuit held that the bia decision to streamline was subject to judicial review,because the board own regulation provides more than enough law by which a court could review the board decision to streamline,and because e specially when the board review of an ij decision often hinges on circuit court precedent,we are,both statutorily and practically,to review a decision to streamline.id.the court observed that after the ij rejected the alien persecution claim,the bia had filed a new decision that appeared to support the alien claim.id.at.the court expressed concern that it could not determine from the awo whether the bia had affirmed the ij decision based on the absence of persecution which the court thought dubious in light of the new precedent or on untimeliness which was judicially unreviewable.id.at.accordingly,the court remanded the case for further agency proceedings during which the bia could spell out its reasoning.id.at.
in some respects,we respectfully disagree with the first circuit.for the reasons previously discussed,we do not agree that the determination to streamline a particular case is generally amenable to judicial review.we also believe that the proper focus for the reviewing court is on the decision of the agency which,by regulation,is the decision of the ij in this case,not on whether the reviewing court can discern the reasoning of an agency component such as the bia or the attorney general,for that matter,when he declines to review a decision of the bia,see h.principles of administrative law require that the agency provide a reasoned explanation for its decision,see chenery,at,and the opinion of an ij satisfies this requirement regardless whether the grounds relied upon by the ij are subject to judicial review.that an alien might be unable to challenge the explanation of the ij under the statute enacted by congress does not mean that the agency failed to provide a reasoned explanation for its decision.
our decision in this case need not conflict with haoud,however,because the first circuit decision can be read more narrowly.haoud may be understood as permitting judicial review of the decision to streamline only in a narrow species of cases,namely,those in which there is both a reviewable and a basis for the ij decision and a new development in the law that may have undermined the reasoning of the ij on the reviewable issue.haoud involved an intervening decision of the bia,and the first circuit was concerned that there is no way we can determine from the awo whether the board reviewed the case and found a legitimate way of distinguishing the bia intervening decision in denying haoud asylum claim.haoud,at.in our own cases involving the social security administration appeals council,we have held that while the decision to deny review generally is unreviewable,riley shalala,cir browning sullivan,cir,the court of appeals may remand a case if the appeals council denies review without considering new and material evidence.nelson sullivan,cir.there may be reasons to conclude that not even that level of judicial review of the bia streamlining decision is available,given differences in the regulatory schemes,but we need not resolve that issue here,because ngure unlike haoud points to no intervening legal developments that might have affected the decision in his case.
accordingly,we hold that the bia decision to affirm without opinion in ngure case is not subject to judicial review.the decision of the ij constitutes the decision of the agency,and we turn next to a consideration of that decision.
the ij rejected ngure asylum claim on alternative grounds.the ij concluded that ngure had failed to apply for asylum within of his arrival in the united states as required by statute,a b,and that he did not demonstrate changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.id.a d.the ij decided,alternatively,that ngure had not demonstrated the requisite fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion if he were returned to his native kenya.see id.a a.
on appeal,ngure argues that there were exceptional circumstances that prevented him from filing a timely application for asylum.congress,however,has precluded judicial review of the attorney general determination that an alien did not demonstrate changed or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an asylum application.ismailov reno,cir a.accordingly,we lack jurisdiction to consider ngure challenge to the ij timeliness determination,and his petition for review of the attorney general denial of asylum must be rejected.
ngure also claims that he is entitled to withholding of removal under b,which is not subject to a filing deadline.to obtain that relief,an alien must show that there is a clear probability that he would suffer future persecution,in the country to which the alien will be removed,because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.francois ins,cir b.in other words,an alien must establish that it is more likely than not that he will suffer persecution.ins stevic,d.
the ij first analyzed whether ngure established a fear of persecution to support his application for asylum,and concluded that he had not made the requisite showing.the ij then concluded that because withholding of removal requires a greater showing of likely persecution than does asylum,ngure claim for withholding of removal necessarily failed as well.we follow the same analysis by first reviewing the ij determination that ngure did not have a fear of persecution,and then considering his request for withholding of removal.
to demonstrate a fear of persecution,an alien must demonstrate that he genuinely fears persecution,and produce credible,direct,and specific evidence that a reasonable person in the alien position would fear persecution if returned to the alien native country.francois,at.an ij decision on this point will be upheld so long as it is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.ashcroft,cir.our review takes into account evidence that both supports and opposes the conclusion of the agency,but the evidence need not rise to the level of a preponderance to sustain the decision.id.at.to reverse the decision of the agency,we must find that the evidence was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.ins,d.
ngure asserts that he suffered past persecution when he was arrested in kenya in,and.in the absence of a statutory definition,our court has defined persecution as the infliction or threat of death,torture,or injury to one person or freedom,on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.ins,cir.that general definition must be refined further in the context of a particular alien situation.
we conclude that the ij was not compelled to find that ngure three prior arrests established persecution.the arrests in,and came after demonstrations that became riotous,and officials arrested hundreds of participants,including ngure.his arrests in and resulted in detentions of less than hours and involved n
