sentence enhancement 
velasco was sentenced under of the version of the sentencing guidelines section b a calls for a enhancement if the defendant previously has been convicted of a crime of violence.the commentary to defines the term crime of violence as follows 
crime of violence means any of the following murder,manslaughter,kidnapping,aggravated assault,forcible sex offenses,statutory rape,sexual abuse of a minor,robbery,arson,extortion,extortionate extension of credit,burglary of a dwelling,or any offense under federal,state,or local law that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.
sentencing guidelines manual cmt.b iii.
an offense can be a crime of violence either because it fits within the enumerated list of qualifying offenses or because it has as an element the use of force.united states,cir.the district court enhanced velasco sentence upon finding that velasco was convicted under a specific disjunctive portion of the illinois aggravated battery statute and that this disjunctive portion had as an element the use of physical force.thus,the question before us is whether the district court properly held that velasco illinois aggravated battery conviction has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.
in united states,this court,sitting en banc,held that for a offense to have as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force necessary for a sentence enhancement under,the use of physical force must be a fact that is necessary for the prosecution to secure a conviction,cir en banc noting that an element is a constituent part of a claim that must be proved for the claim to succeed quoting black law dictionary ed.if any set of facts would secure a conviction under the statute without proof of the intentional use of force against the person of another,then the offense can not be characterized as a crime of violence for purposes.id.
when determining whether a prior conviction qualifies as a crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines,this court is bound by the categorical approach of taylor united states,d.see also shepard united states,d holding that taylor categorical approach applies equally to convictions following guilty pleas and jury verdicts.taylor requires us to consider only the statutory definition of the offense charged,rather than the defendant actual conduct underlying the offense,to determine whether the offense contains an element involving the use of force.see,united states,cir en banc per curiam,cert denied,d united states,cir.if there are several methods of committing a crime under a statute,each method of violating the statute must qualify as a crime of violence,without inquiry into the defendant actual use of force.taylor,at.however,if an offense statute contains disjunctive statutory alternatives under which a defendant may be convicted,a sentencing court may look to the offense conduct described in the indictment or jury instructions for the limited purpose of determining which of the disjunctive alternatives a defendant conviction satisfies,at.if the precise disjunctive statutory alternative can be determined from the indictment,then the court may look to that particular provision to determine whether the use of force is a required element of the offense.id.at.
velasco was convicted under the illinois aggravated battery statute.comp.stat.this court twice previously has examined this statute to determine whether it contains an element requiring the prosecution to prove that the defendant engaged in the use of physical force.united states,cir unpublished united states.cir per curiam unpublished.in each prior case we determined that the illinois aggravated battery statute provides for the commission of the offense of aggravated battery in a number of different ways,some of which do not require the use of physical force against a person.at.at.in both cases the records on appeal did not contain the indictments for the illinois convictions and the court was unable to discern under which of the disjunctive statutory elements the defendants were charged and convicted.see.at the record in this case does not include the indictment for the illinois conviction and we are unable to pare down the statute to determine which of its disjunctive elements were used to charge and convict the defendant.accordingly,in each case we held that the relevant conviction under the illinois aggravated battery offense statute could not be properly characterized as a crime of violence because the use of physical force could not be shown to be a required element underlying the conviction.
velasco relies on our decisions in and to argue that an illinois aggravated battery conviction categorically does not qualify as a crime of violence for purposes.however,our prior examinations of illinois aggravated battery statute are not dispositive of the present case.in contrast to the records on appeal in and,velasco indictment for aggravated battery is included in the record and identifies the disjunctive portion of the aggravated battery statute under which velasco was charged and convicted.as such,we again turn to the illinois aggravated battery statute,with a more narrow inquiry into whether the disjunctive portion under which velasco was convicted requires as an element the use of physical force.we conclude that it does.
under illinois law,aggravated battery occurs when a person who,in committing a battery,intentionally or knowingly causes great bodily harm,or permanent disability or disfigurement.comp.statt.a.the statute provides,in subsections b through d,a number of specific ways
