petitioner michael olusean falae,a nigerian national,seeks review of a final order of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his motion to remand proceedings to an immigration judge ij in order to allow him to apply for adjustment of his immigration status.the proposed adjustment was based on the combined force of i the approval of a visa application sponsored by his employer,see,and ii his marriage to a united states citizen,see id.i.the petitioner argues that these two events qualify him for a waiver of inadmissability and an adjustment of status under the immigration and nationality act ina.discerning no abuse of discretion,we deny the petition for review.
the petitioner arrived in the united states in april of armed with a tourist visa that apparently authorized him to remain for six months.we say apparently because both the visa and the petitioner passport had been issued in the name of one vincent olanrewaju adeyemi.the petitioner initially lived with his fiancée,stella olujoke,a whom he had known in nigeria.he did not leave after six months and,in march of,he jilted olujoke and married a united states citizen 
in july of,the petitioner divorced april without ever having lived with her.nine days later,he married his once and former fiancée,olujoke,who then amended her pending application for asylum and related relief to include the petitioner.the petitioner and olujoke were interviewed by an asylum officer in may of.that interview resulted in an unfavorable recommendation and the institution of removal proceedings.the notice to appear was made returnable to the immigration court in boston.
at the start,the immigration and naturalization service ins charged the petitioner with illegal entry into the united states in violation of a a i subsequently,the ins lodged additional charges of inadmissability and deportability,under a a,based on the use of fraudulent documents to gain entry into the united states.the same sort of charges were lodged against olujoke.while the two cases were consolidated for some period of time,that order was rescinded after the petitioner and olujoke divorced.olujoke case is pending before us appeal and will be addressed in a separate opinion.in this opinion,we chronicle only those facts and proceedings that relate directly to the petitioner.
to make a tedious tale tolerably terse,the petitioner conceded removability and moved to amend his pleadings to permit an application for adjustment of status based on the approval of an visa application filed on the petitioner behalf by his employer,the providence school department.the approval of that application resulted in his classification as a skilled worker and,thus,afforded a potential avenue to allow him to remain in the united states.see b a establishing a special visa category for skilled workers who obtain labor certification.
in october of,the ij found that the petitioner fraudulent use of documents to gain entry into the united states debarred him from an adjustment of status,notwithstanding the approved application.the ij further found that the petitioner lacked credibility.she based this credibility determination on his demeanor,myriad inconsistencies in his trial testimony,and questionable documentation submitted on his behalf including a bogus yearbook photograph.the ij found particularly troubling the petitioner inability to recall any details about his first marriage including his wife last name and the fact that the petitioner and his first wife never lived together.although the ij declined to make a specific finding that the union was entered into for the purpose of evading united states immigration laws,see c,she thought it probable that the marriage was a sham she termed it a green card marriage.she also deemed it curious that the petitioner second marriage occurred a mere nine days after his divorce became final.
based upon these and other findings,the ij concluded that the petitioner had not shown past persecution in nigeria by credible testimony.consequently,he had not established eligibility for asylum,withholding of removal,or protection under the convention against torture cat.furthermore,the ij declared the petitioner ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under i because he could not identify any qualifying citizen relatives in the united states.accordingly,the ij pretermitted the application for adjustment of status,ordered the petitioner removed to nigeria,and denied his request for voluntary departure.
the petitioner filed a timely appeal with the bia and,a month later,divorced olujoke.three months thereafter,he married sandra hannah,a united states citizen.he then filed a motion to remand so that he might seek adjustment of status based on the combination of i the approved visa application submitted by his employer and ii his marriage to a united states citizen.as part of his proffer,the petitioner asseverated that deportation to nigeria would impose extreme hardship upon his new bride,who allegedly suffered from a kaleidoscopic array of medical and psychological disorders.
in january of,the bia upheld the ij determinations and rejected the petitioner merits appeal.it simultaneously denied his motion to remand.on that score,the bia noted that the petitioner had married his new wife a mere months after he was ordered removed by the ij and explained that the petitioner lack of credibility at his hearing,his prior use of fraudulent documents,his previous marital history and the timing of his current marriage argued persuasively against an affirmative exercise of its discretion to reopen the proceedings.this petition for judicial review followed.
the petitioner seeks judicial review of the bia denial of his motion to more and no less in that motion,he asked the bia to remand the matter to the ij in order to allow him to pursue an adjustment of status.neither the ina nor the bia rules of practice recognize motions to remand as such.here,however,the motion to remand was plainly in the nature of a motion to reopen the proceedings before the ij the ij originally adjudged him ineligible for relief in part because he lacked a qualifying citizen relative once he had married a united states citizen,he sought to present fresh evidence of his newfound eligibility for an adjustment of status.the bia,therefore,properly treated the motion to remand as a motion to reopen.see in re coelho,bia.so do we.
motions to reopen are disfavored in immigration practice because of the compelling public interests in finality and the expeditious processing of proceedings.ins abudu,d fesseha ashcroft,cir.the granting or denial of such a motion is discretionary.see ins doherty,d.at a bare minimum,the movant must make a showing of prima facie eligibility for the relief that he seeks.see,afful ashcroft,cir.he also must show that the evidence sought to be introduced on remand is material and that it was not previously available.see c see also fesseha,at.even if he satisfies these threshold conditions,he is not home free he still must persuade the bia to exercise its discretion affirmatively and order the case reopened.see a see also abudu,at.
we review the bia denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion.see jupiter ashcroft,cir.this means that we will interfere with the bia disposition of such a motion only if the petitioner can establish that the bia made an error of law or acted in a manner that is fairly characterizable as arbitrary or capricious.see carter ins,cir see also henry ins,cir explaining that the bia may abuse its discretion by neglecting to consider a significant factor that appropriately bears on the discretionary decision,by attaching weight to a factor that does not appropriately bear on the decision,or by assaying all the proper factors and no improper ones,but nonetheless making a clear judgmental error in weighing them.in conducting this deferential review,we must keep in mind that the usual reasons for ceding deference to agency decisionmaking on similar motions in other administrative contexts have special force in the immigration context.see abudu,at.
we assume,for argument sake,that the petitioner made the required showing of
