since his arrival in the united states more than thirteen years ago,chinese national huo qiang chen has been engaged in almost constant litigation to avoid removal from this country based on claimed past persecution and feared future persecution in china for resistance to that country coercive population control program.in this latest round of proceedings,chen petitions for review of an april,decision of the board of immigration appeals bia,which upheld a march,order by immigration judge ij sandy hom denying chen applications for asylum and withholding of removal and directing his removal from the united states.see in re huo qiang chen,no,aff g no.chen challenges the bia determination that,under the circumstances of this case,imposition of a fine equal to approximately twenty times chen annual income and,after chen left china,a further sanction for failure to pay the fine,specifically,termination of his family farming leasehold,did not establish either past persecution or a well founded fear of future persecution as those terms are used under the immigration and nationality act ina,stat.codified as amended at.
for reasons discussed herein,we hold that while a severe fine can amount to economic persecution,an alien claiming to have suffered past persecution must show more than the imposition of such a fine he must show that payment of the fine or efforts to pay or collect it actually deprived him of the basic necessities of life or reduced him to an impoverished existence.see in re t z.at the same time,however,we clarify that an unpaid fine and sanctions imposed after an alien is already in the united states for nonpayment of a fine may support a well founded fear of future persecution if the alien were returned to his native country,particularly where the record indicates a likelihood that authorities would continue to demand payment of the fine and such payment would impoverish the alien or deprive him of the basic necessities of life.
substantial evidence here supports the agency finding that chen failed to demonstrate that the imposition of a severe fine deprived him of the basic necessities of life or impoverished him before he left china.accordingly,we deny review of the bia past persecution ruling.the agency erred,however,in concluding that no evidence existed of continuing demands for payment while chen has been in the united states and in reaching other factual conclusions not supported by substantial evidence.we therefore grant review of the bia feared future persecution ruling.accordingly,we vacate the bia order insofar as it denied chen both asylum and withholding of removal based on such ruling,and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
chen fines for resisting china population control program 
in china,chen,who is almost illiterate,had worked as a farmer on a acre plot of land leased to him and to his father before him by the government in a sharecropper arrangement.chen realized approximately renminbi rmb per year from farming,which he used to support himself,his wife,and their three children.chen sporadically supplemented these earnings by doing odd jobs in his village,for which he was generally paid rmb a day 
by having three children,chen and his wife had violated china coercive population control program.as punishment,chinese officials sterilized chen wife,and in april,fined chen rmb.chen paid rmb of this fine,raising the money by selling his television and some rice and by borrowing rmb from his sister.chen testified that,in september,government officials gave him ten days to pay the rmb outstanding on the fine as well as an additional rmb penalty.thus,in,chen was fined a total of rmb,with rmb still owed.
ten days later,with the fine unpaid,government officials came to chen home in search of property that might be seized to satisfy the fine.although they apparently found nothing worth taking,an argument ensued,which prompted chen to flee his village to avoid retaliation.
for several years chen hid in a neighboring village where he earned rmb per year more than he had earned farming tending a community cow.meanwhile,his wife continued to farm their assigned land.
chen illegally enters the united states chinese authorities terminate his farming leasehold 
in,chen decided to leave china,paying a smuggler to help him enter the united states.chen friends and relatives loaned him the money necessary to pay the smuggling fee.since,chen has resided in new york,earning to a year working in the construction and restaurant industries.by,he had repaid his debt to friends and relatives.also,since,chen has been the sole support for his wife and children in china.in that year,as punishment for chen failure to pay the outstanding fine,chinese officials terminated his family right to farm its assigned plot of land.chen wife has not worked since that time.chen asserts that government officials nevertheless have continued coming to his family home to seek payment of the fine.
chen efforts to secure relief from removal 
initial agency denial 
upon chen april arrival in the united states,immigration proceedings were initiated against him.from the outset,chen conceded removability but requested asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the united nations convention against torture cat based on feared persecution for resistance to china population control program.he supported his claimed fear by reference to his wife sterilization,the imposition of a rmb fine,and after the revocation of his family farming rights for failure to pay the fine.
on may,after chen first hearing,the ij found him not credible and denied him relief from removal.chen appealed to the bia,which,on october,rejected the ij adverse credibility determination,but nevertheless concluded that chen had failed to establish eligibility for asylum,withholding of removal,or cat relief.chen unsuccessfully moved for the bia to reopen and reconsider its ruling,whereupon he petitioned this court for review of the bia decision.on june,pursuant to a stipulation and settlement by the parties,this court vacated the bia decision and remanded for further proceedings and reconsideration in light of diallo ins,cir holding that bia may deny relief for lack of corroboration only if it a identifies particular pieces of missing,relevant documentation,and b shows that documentation at issue was reasonably available to alien,and jin shui qiu ashcroft,cir same.almost a year later,on may,the bia remanded the case to the ij.
second agency denial 
after further hearings,the ij again denied chen relief from removal on march.the ij concluded that chen a had not established entitlement to cat relief,b was not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal based on his wife sterilization,and c was not otherwise eligible for asylum or withholding of removal because he had not demonstrated his own resistance to the coercive population control policies.in a july,decision,the bia identified error in the ij final conclusion.it found that chen payment to have his wife intrauterine device removed and his purposeful failure to obtain birth permits for his second and third child manifested the necessary resistance.accordingly,the bia remanded the case to the ij,with specific directions that further evidence be taken as to chen financial circumstances to determine if he was entitled to relief based on economic persecution.
third agency denial 
chen provided further testimony before the ij on october.on march,the ij again ordered removal,concluding that chen had waived his original request for cat relief by not pursuing it further on remand and had not established either past economic persecution or a well founded fear of future economic persecution so as to warrant either asylum or withholding of removal.with respect to the latter conclusion,the ij found that,although chen had been fined a large amount,he had not demonstrated that the fine caused him substantial economic harm because a after chen went into hiding,his family income doubled because he was able to earn rmb per year in a neighboring village while his wife continued to work their farm b when chinese authorities visited his home looking for valuables that might satisfy the fine,they seized nothing c chen had the demonstrated ability to borrow significant amounts of money up to from family and friends d chen had already left china when authorities terminated his farming leasehold in and e in the united states,chen was able to earn enough money to repay his smuggling debt,support his family in china,and accumulate savings of.as to feared future persecution,the ij found that chen subjective fear was not objectively reasonable because there was no evidence a that government officials had come to his home or inquired about his whereabouts in the last ten years or b that chen would be unable to support himself upon return to china by farming,tending livestock in a neighboring village,or working in the construction or restaurant industries.
chen appealed to the bia and submitted a motion to reopen.on april,the bia dismissed the appeal and denied reopening.echoing the ij,the bia concluded that chen had suffered no past economic persecution as a consequence of the large fine imposed on him because,when he failed to pay the fine,both he and his wife were able to continue working,and authorities did not confiscate their possessions or their home.the bia explained that the termination of his farming leasehold did not constitute past persecution because it occurred only after chen departure from china.instead,this confiscation was relevant to chen professed fear of future persecution.the bia agreed with the ij that chen fear of future persecution was not objectively reasonable because chen economic situation in the united states had changed so as to allow him to pay the fine,and he could support himself in china by working in a neighboring village or doing odd jobs as he had in the past.
on may,chen filed the current petition,which seeks review of the bia april,decision.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction and standards of review 
federal courts have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal pursuant to.where,as here,the bia affirms an ij removal order and closely tracks the ij reasoning,we consider both the ij and the bia opinions for the sake of completeness.maldonado holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in doing so,we review the agency factual findings only to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence,but we review its conclusions of law de novo.niang holder,cir.
under the substantial evidence standard,the agency factual findings are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b.while this standard is highly deferential,it does not admit misstatement of the facts in the record or bald speculation or caprice.shu wen sun bia,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
as for legal conclusions,where the bia has issued a precedential opinion,our de novo review is limited to determining whether the bia legal interpretations satisfy the requirements for deference under chevron,natural resources defense council.see baraket holder,cir.opinions,such as the bia opinion here,can not claim chevron deference.see mei juan zheng holder,cir.our court has not yet decided whether bia opinions are entitled to deference pursuant to skidmore swift,which affords agency interpretations respect according to their persuasiveness,sai kwan wong doar,cir internal quotation marks omitted.see dawkins holder,cir observing that question of skidmore deference to unpublished bia decisions remains open.we need not conclusively answer the question here because the bia legal reasoning is infected by factfinding not supported by substantial evidence and,therefore,would not warrant skidmore deference even if it applied.see gonzales oregon,stating that under skidmore,courts follow agency interpretation only to extent it is persuasive.
as relevant here,whether certain events will or might occur in the future is a question of fact.see hui lin huang holder,cir.on the other hand,whether certain events,if they occurred,would constitute persecution as defined by the ina is a question of law.see id.at.further,whether a given likelihood of persecution satisfies the requirements for asylum or withholding of removal is a question of law.see id.at.
b.the statutory scheme 
asylum is a form of discretionary relief that allows an otherwise removable alien to remain and work in the united states.see b a,c.to qualify for asylum,an alien must demonstrate that he is a refugee,id.b,meaning that he is unable or unwilling to return to,and unable or unwilling to avail himself of the protection of,his home country because of past persecution or a well founded fear of future persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,see id.a a see also b mei fun wong.holder,cir.persecution on account of resistance to a coercive population control program is statutorily deemed to be persecut ion on account of political opinion.a see generally mei fun wong holder,at.meanwhile,a well founded fear of future persecution requires a subjective fear that is objectively reasonable.see jian xing huang ins,cir.supreme court precedent instructs that a fear of future persecution may be well founded even where the probability of the feared harm is less than.see ins cardoza fonseca,u,one can certainly have a fear of an event happening when there is less than a chance of the occurrence taking place.accord guan shan liao dep t of justice,cir.
withholding of removal 
withholding of removal is a form of mandatory relief that prevents an otherwise removable alien from being removed to a country where the alien life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b.threats to life or freedom comprise a narrower category than persecution.see ivanishvili dep t of justice,cir noting that while concept of persecution inheres in the analysis of both asylum and withholding of removal,persecution includes more than threats to life or freedom internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,showing that life or freedom would be threatened is a higher burden than establishing a well founded fear of such harm specifically,it requires evidence that life or freedom threatening harm is more likely than not.vanegas ramirez holder,cir quoting ins stevic.
because the standard for withholding of removal is thus more demanding than that for asylum,it necessarily follows that an alien who can not demonstrate eligibility for asylum also can not demonstrate entitlement to withholding of removal.see id.
economic persecution 
courts have long recognized that certain economic sanctions can rise to the level of persecution.see,dunat hurney,cir interpreting former version of provision requiring physical persecution and holding that economic persecution can suffice because t he denial of an opportunity to earn a livelihood in a country such as the one involved here is the equivalent of a sentence to death by means of slow starvation and none the less final because it is gradual accord diminich esperdy,cir noting full agree ment with dunat holding on economic persecution.despite that long recognition,a consistent standard for identifying when economic injury rises to the level of persecution has proved elusive.see mirzoyan gonzales,f d,cir describing history of conflicting standards.in response to a request by this court for clarification of the standard governing economic persecution claims,see id.at,the bia attempted to articulate a definitive standard in in re t z.we have not yet decided whether the in re t z standard is entitled to chevron deference.see xiu fen xia mukasey,cir.neither party here argues that the standard is not entitled to such deference instead,each insists that in re t z compels a judgment in its favor.we therefore deem any argument regarding the applicability of the in re t z standard to be forfeited,and we apply that standard to chen claim of economic persecution.
in re t z instructs that an economic sanction constitutes persecution if it depriv es the victim of liberty,food,housing,employment or other essentials of life,or deliberately imposes a severe economic disadvantage.at emphasis omitted quoting,at,reprinted in.the first prong of this standard is intended to reference deliberate deprivation of basic necessities such that life or freedom is threatened.id.at.the second prong references sanctions that,while not actually threatening life or freedom,nonetheless reduce an applicant to an impoverished existence.id.at.
economic sanctions that might manifest persecution include particularly onerous fine s,confiscation s of property,and sweeping limitation s of opportunities to continue to work in an established profession or business.id.there is,however,no fixed threshold for the economic harms that will manifest persecution.instead,whether a given economic sanction constitutes persecution turns on its impact on the victim.accord in re j h s,petition for review denied sub nom.jian hui shao mukasey,cir.thus,a sanction that impoverishes a poor victim would constitute persecution,while the same sanction imposed on a wealthier individual without such effect would not.see in re t z,at,see also guan shan liao dep t of justice,at holding that whether fine constitutes persecution turns on victim financial circumstances and fine effect.in sum,an economic sanction is persecution only if its impact is an infliction of suffering or harm that on its own would be sufficient to constitute persecution.mei fun wong holder,at internal quotation marks omitted.
chen asylum claim 
in denying chen asylum,the agency determined that he had failed to demonstrate economic harms manifesting either past persecution or a well founded fear of future persecution.we identify no error in the past persecution determination,but we vacate the agency rejection of chen claimed fear of future persecution and remand for further proceedings on that issue.
past persecution 
chen argues that the agency erred in rejecting his past persecution claim because the imposition of an or rmb fine on a man with an income of only to rmb per year must,as a matter of law,be found to constitute economic persecution without regard to whether the fine was paid.that argument improperly conflates the issue of when an economic sanction is severe enough to have persecutive potential with when such a sanction in fact effects persecution.
a total rmb fine,more than twenty times chen annual income,was certainly extraordinarily severe and particularly onerous,the kind of economic sanction that in re t z recognized could amount to persecution.at.but in re t z does not state that the mere imposition of a severe or onerous fine necessarily effects persecution.rather,in re t z explains that an economic sanction constitutes persecution when it actually depriv es the alien of basic necessities such that life or freedom is threatened,id.at,or reduces the alien to an impoverished existence,id.at.the imposition of a severe or onerous fine does not,by itself,have these persecutive effects.a severe fine may,after all,go unpaid.the government might not attempt to collect the fine,or its attempts might not deprive the alien of life necessities or render him impoverished.thus,while imposition of a severe or onerous fine may have the potential to impoverish or to deprive a person of life necessities in the future,a person has not suffered past persecution until payment or collection efforts actually have such persecutive effects.see id.at observing that immigration law requires that there be actual harm amounting to persecutory harm see also mei fun wong holder,at collecting cases describing persecution as infliction of suffering or harm on proscribed ground emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted rather,imposition of a severe or onerous fine,on its own,can support only a well founded fear of future persecution.
this conclusion finds support in our precedent,as well as that of our sister circuits,holding that threats of persecution,no matter how credible,do not demonstrate past persecution.see gui ci pan att y,cir see also zhen hua li att y of,cir cited approvingly in gui ci pan stating that even sinister and credible threats,including death threats,would not qualify as past persecution unless fulfilled or highly imminent lim ins,cir cited approvingly in gui ci pan identifying no past persecution despite highly credible death threats.that is true even where,as here,the threat implicit in an onerous fine that collection will render one impoverished or without the necessities of life leads the alien to flee his own village and hide in a neighboring one to avoid suffering these effects.see generally gui ci pan att y,at stating that where petitioner girlfriend was able to avoid forced abortion by couple going into hiding,petitioner could not claim past persecution from threat of abortion guan shan liao dep t of justice,at holding that petitioner who fled village after imposition of economic fine and threat of detention had not demonstrated past persecution instead,threats may be used to establish only a well founded fear of future persecution.see guan shan liao dep t of justice,at see also zhen hua li att y of,at u nfulfilled threats are generally within that category of conduct indicative of a danger of future persecution.internal quotation marks omitted lim ins,at threats are precisely of future harm.
chen cites no case in which a court has found past economic persecution on the basis of an unpaid fine.indeed,in the one case he cites where a court finding of past persecution rested,in part,on a fine,the alien had been forced to pay the fine before fleeing china.see zhen hua li att y of,at finding economic persecution based partly on fine id.at sloviter,dissenting noting that alien had paid fine while in china.moreover,when our court has considered whether a particular fine constituted past persecution,we have required the alien to demonstrate that payment of the fine actually constituted a substantial disadvantage to him.guan shan liao dep t of justice,at noting that alien claimed to have paid fine.
in short,because economic persecution occurs only when a person is deprived of the necessities of life or rendered impoverished,and because chen failed to show that the fine imposed on him ever had such effects before he left china,he necessarily fails to demonstrate that the bia erred as a matter of law in rejecting his claim of past persecution.
the termination of chen farming leasehold warrants no different conclusion,because past persecution references persecution that the alien has experienced in his native country before departing from it.see b requiring alien claiming past persecution to have been persecuted in the past in the applicant country of nationality or,if stateless,in his or her country of last habitual residence.chen left china in.thus,by the time his leasehold was terminated,he had been in the united states for almost two years.moreover,he was working in this country,earning enough to support himself,repay loans,accumulate modest savings,and after termination of the leasehold support his wife and children in china.whatever economic hardships the leasehold termination may have visited upon his wife and children,chen can not show that the sanction ever resulted in his own economic persecution.instead,the loss of chen leasehold is a factor properly considered in assessing whether he has a well founded fear of future economic persecution if returned to china.
accordingly,we conclude that there is no merit to chen argument that,as a matter of law,the record compels a finding that he suffered past economic persecution.to the contrary,the agency reasonably concluded that the record does not admit such a finding.
well founded fear of future persecution 
the bia and ij concluded that despite an outstanding rmb fine and the loss of his farming leasehold,chen did not have a well founded fear of future economic persecution upon return to china because a he had not claimed that chinese officials made any attempt to collect the fine after and b even if payment were demanded,chen could make arrangements for installment payments,borrow money from friends and relatives,earn money working in a neighboring village,as he had before fleeing
