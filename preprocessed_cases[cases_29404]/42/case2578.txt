we have consolidated these immigration cases for decision on the question of whether the deportation reinstatement provision of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,a,is impermissibly retroactive when applied to an alien who reentered the united states before but applied for adjustment of status after the act effective date.this question was reserved in this court recent opinion in ashcroft,cir,which held that a is impermissibly retroactive when applied to an alien who reentered the united states and applied for adjustment of status prior to iirira effective date.we now hold that a is not impermissibly retroactive when applied to an alien who reentered the united states before iirira effective date but did not apply for adjustment of status until after the act became effective.
background 
rafal labojewski,a citizen of poland,entered the united states on a visitor visa in.he overstayed the visa and on november,was ordered deported.he illegally reentered the united states in or using a false passport and visa.in november labojewski mother,a lawful permanent resident,filed an alien relative visa petition on his behalf,which was approved on may.in september labojewski applied for adjustment of status based upon his mother lawful permanent resident status.in this application labojewski falsely answered n o to the question of whether he had ever been deported from the united states.
faustino,a citizen of mexico,entered the united states without inspection in may.he was arrested and ordered removed in march.he reentered illegally that same year using the alias joaquin.he was arrested and voluntarily departed in october.he again reentered illegally about a year later,this time using the alias alfredo vasquez casales.he was arrested and deported in january.three months later,in april,he reentered illegally,again using the name alfredo vasquez casales.he was apprehended and deported in may,after submitting a sworn statement that his true name was alfredo vasquez casales and that he had never used any other name.
again reentered without inspection in june,and this time was charged and convicted of violating for illegal reentry after previous deportation.he was sentenced in the united states district court for the southern district of new york to a term of imprisonment,suspended in favor of three years probation,with the condition that he leave the united states and not return without permission.the sentence was entered on december,he was deported from new orleans on december.
again reentered the united states without inspection in the early or government says it was april,says it was march.claims that on july,his son,a united states citizen,filed an alien relative visa petition on his behalf,and further contends that the petition was approved on february.neither the petition nor the approval is in the record,however,and thus it is unclear whether the visa petition disclosed history of illegal reentry and deportation or his use of aliases.on september,applied for adjustment of status using the name faustino chavez.in his application he falsely answered n o to the question of whether he had ever been deported from the united states and also falsely answered n o to the question of whether he had ever sought entry into the united states by fraud or willful misrepresentation of material fact.
on september,labojewski and reentered the united states illegally but before they applied for adjustment of adopted the iirira,stat.as is pertinent to these cases,iirira created a of the immigration and nationality act ina,appearing at a,which provides 
if the attorney general finds that an alien has reentered the united states illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily,under an order of removal,the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed,the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under this chapter,and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.
this new provision,part of an attempt to streamline removal procedures,requires the summary reinstatement of a prior removal order of an illegal alien who reenters the united states illegally after previously having been deported for any reason.see ashcroft,cir.the old reinstatement f,appearing at f authorized summary reinstatement only for those illegal aliens previously deported for specified reasons,such as commission of an aggravated felony.arevalo ashcroft,cir.in contrast,a operates against all aliens who reenter illegally after prior removal,prohibiting any review of the merits of the prior removal order as well as any opportunity to seek adjustment of status,a form of discretionary relief previously available even to those who illegally reentered the united states,at arevalo,at.
also,pursuant to regulations implementing a,an illegal alien subject to reinstatement under the statute is not entitled to a hearing before an immigration judge on the issue of reinstatement of the prior removal order instead,an immigration officer determines the alien identity,whether he or she was subject to a prior order of removal,and whether he or she unlawfully reentered the united states.a,b,at.the alien is provided an opportunity to make a statement if the alien expresses fear of persecution if removed,the matter is referred to an asylum officer.b,e.otherwise,if the foregoing predicate determinations are made,the prior order of removal is reinstated.
iirira became effective april.applied for adjustment of status in september labojewski applied for adjustment of status in september.in the course of adjudicating labojewski and petitions to adjust status,the department of homeland security determined that both aliens had reentered the united states illegally after having been removed.accordingly,the immigration and customs enforcement bureau invoked a and summarily ordered their prior removal orders reinstated.labojewski and petitioned for review in this court,raising the sole issue of the retroactive effect of a.
ii.analysis 
in landgraf usi film,d,the supreme court established a inquiry to determine the permissibility of retroactive application of a statute.first,the court must discern whether congress has spoken to whether the statute should have retroactive effect,at citing landgraf,at.if congress has clearly specified a statute retroactive reach,then there is no need to resort to judicial default rules.landgraf,at.an expressly retroactive statute is given its intended retroactive effect unless there is a constitutional impediment to doing so.id.at.
however,if congress has not clearly the statute is silent or ambiguous about its retroactive the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect,whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.landgraf,at.
the supreme court acknowledged in landgraf the inherent tension in retroactivity analysis,in that two legal principles are in conflict.the first is the rule that a court is to apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision.id.at.quoting bradley sch.bd.of richmond,d.the second is the principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place.id.at.the court in landgraf reconciled the conflict by deferring to congress when it clearly expresses its intent that a statute is retroactive and applying a presumption against retroactivity when congressional intent is ambiguous.
accordingly,when it is unclear whether a statute is meant to be retroactive,prospectivity remains the appropriate default rule.id.at.the requirement of clear congressional intent assures that congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and allocates to congress responsibility for fundamental policy judgments concerning the proper temporal reach of statutes.id.at.where congress has not made a clear policy judgment about retroactivity,applying the presumption ag
