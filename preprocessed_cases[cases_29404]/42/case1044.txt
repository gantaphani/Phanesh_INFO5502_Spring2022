the immigration and naturalization service instituted removal proceedings against petitioner baswell francis in,alleging that because he had two jamaican convictions for possessing marijuana in the early,francis had been statutorily inadmissible at the time he obtained his temporary resident status in and his permanent resident status in.in support of its allegations,the government relied on two pieces of evidence a colloquy between francis and an immigration judge ij,which the government construed as francis admission of one of the jamaican convictions and a faxed photocopy of francis rap sheet from a jamaican police department.because we think that no rational factfinder could conclude that this evidence,standing alone,constitutes clear,convincing,and unequivocal evidence that francis had two convictions,as that term was defined by applicable law in and,we grant the petition,vacate the bia order,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
on november,petitioner baswell francis became a lawful temporary resident as a special agricultural worker saw.see immigration and nationality act ina,of the.the saw program is unique in two respects.first,it contains a confidentiality provision,ina b a,b a,under which all false alien provides in his or her initial application for temporary residence can be used only to determine the applicant eligibility for temporary resident status and only during the period before adjustment to permanent resident status in francis case,this period spanned from to.because of the saw program confidentiality provision,we do not have access to his application and do not know whether francis disclosed any prior convictions in it.
the second unique feature of the saw program is that,under ina a b,a b,the status of an saw worker is automatically adjusted from lawful temporary resident to lawful permanent resident after two years.that section adjusts the status of an alien granted lawful temporary status to that of a lawful permanent resident on the basis of a fixed schedule,without regard for the alien admissibility at that time.this mechanism is perhaps unique under the immigration laws matter of,interim decision,bia citation omitted.on december,francis was automatically adjusted to permanent resident status under this provision 
because francis thus became a permanent resident,he is afforded heightened procedural protections in any deportation proceedings.t he burden of proof is now on the service to establish the applicant inadmissibility,and the full panoply of due process considerations now applies id.at.the government must also meet a heightened standard of proof by establishing francis deportability by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence.woodby ins,d.
francis apparently applied for united states citizenship at some point in.his application is not included in the record we do not know if it contained any statements concerning past convictions.it was only after receiving that application that the government initiated deportation proceedings against francis,alleging that he had been convicted twice in jamaica for possession of marijuana,once in and once in.
under ina a a,a a,a ny alien who at the time of entry or adjustment of status was within one or more of the classes of aliens inadmissible by the law existing at such time is deportable.the government argued that francis was inadmissible when he received temporary resident status in and permanent resident status in because under ina a a i ii,a a i ii,any alien who is convicted of a violation of or a conspiracy or attempt to violate any law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title,is inadmissible.because,according to the government,francis two convictions rendered him inadmissible under section at the time he became a temporary and permanent resident,he is now deportable under section.
francis appeared at a hearing on the government charges before an ij in buffalo,new york on september.francis told the ij that he had contacted a lawyer from the court list of free legal services.the ij responded that no lawyer had filed an appearance on his behalf.the ij then accommodated francis concerns by rescheduling the hearing until february,to give francis additional time to contact a lawyer.
at the february hearing,francis reported that he had tried again to obtain representation but that the lawyer to whom he had placed telephone calls had never returned them.the ij responded that i afraid i going to have to go forward with your case because it been pending for a while and that i going to have to ask that you speak on your own behalf.see tr.of removal hearing,at.
the following exchange ensued 
q they say you were convicted on february,in saint james,jamaica,west indies of the violation of the crime relating to illicit possession of or trafficking in narcotic drugs or marijuana,to wit possession of marijuana.is that true 
convicted.i remember charge but for only one possession of marijuana.
yes,but were you convicted of it did you go to court 
yes,i go to court.
q.the judge say you were guilty 
okay.then it says you were convicted on december,in saint james,jamaica,west indies of the violation of a crime relating to the illicit possession of or trafficking in narcotic drugs or marijuana,to wit possession of marijuana.so the next year,a year later,over a year later,you were charged with the same things just about.is that true 
i try to remember that case but i still ca remember about it,i trying to say,when was that because i know they charge with possession of marijuana in jamaica once,so i was trying to remember when was that one.
well,were you arrested in december of everybody remembers if they get arrested 
a yes,well,i remember 
and i know you remember the first time 
yes,i remember the first 
in february.
i remember the first time because that was on my birthday 
well what happened the second time 
i do remember if i was,if it was the same thing,smoking,possession of marijuana,but i ca quite remember that one but i remember the first one.
q.you mean you ca remember the exact charge 
yes,i ca remember 
well,do you remember being arrested 
yes,i think i remember being arrested.
okay.but you do did it have something to do with narcotics 
maybe we say marijuana.
okay,it says here that you were in possession of marijuana and,or you were trafficking in it.so 
no,i was trafficking no marijuana.i never been trafficking marijuana.
q.but you did have it on your person,right 
no it was a joint.
okay.all right,so,i take that as an admission.
id.at.based on this testimony,the ij ordered francis deported.
represented by.the bia vacated the ij order and remanded for further proceedings.the bia agreed with the ij that francis had admitted one conviction but disagreed that he had admitted a second one.the bia noted that under e iii,a waiver may be available if an alien is convicted of a single offense of simple possession of thirty grams or less of marijuana.the bia therefore remanded for the ij to determine whether francis asked for and was granted a waiver at the time he sought temporary resident status.
on remand,the government reported that it had discovered an additional file indicating that,before francis had entered the country in,he had been ordered excluded during a proceeding in baltimore.at the government suggestion,the ij placed an order for the file of the proceedings from the federal records center.
the ij questioned francis,who confirmed that he had been previously been ordered excluded in.the ij asked did you,how come you did tell your lawyer this,with all due respect did you think it was important to let her know that see tr.of removal hearing,at.francis answered i never told her because the question never asked.like you asking me now.id.at.the ij adjourned the proceedings until both parties had an opportunity to inspect the file from the proceedings.
the records indicated that francis had previously tried to enter the country with a false birth certificate under the name leon williams.the file included an order from the ij in baltimore stating that you do not appear to me to be clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to enter the united states as you may come within the exclusion provisions of section a,and of the immigration and nationality act,as amended,in that you were convicted in jamaica on two occasions for possession of marijuana.see amended notice to applicant for admission detained for hearing before immigration judge,may,government,ex.a.included in the file was a copy of a jamaican police report,which was prepared in response to a request for a check of francis williams fingerprints.the report stated 
subject was convicted for possession of ganja marijuana and was given three months hard labor but received a suspended sentence.subject was also convicted on for possession of ganja and was fined the equivalent of or one month imprisonment.ganja amounts were not indicated.
government,ex.b.the court again adjourned the hearing to allow counsel to prepare arguments in light of the new information.
at the adjourned hearing,the government took the position that,in light of the saw confidentiality provisions,it could not use information or misinformation from the temporary resident application as a basis for seeking to have francis deported.instead the government argued that the hearings provided independent proof that francis had been twice convicted for possession of marijuana and,therefore,that he had been ineligible for temporary resident status when he applied in.t he two convictions say there no possibility of waiver,so we can just rest on that.see tr.of removal hearing,at see also tr.of removal hearing,at.
the ij asserted,however,that he had the power to disregard ina b a confidentiality provision the ij issued an order finding francis deportable because he obviously fail ed to reveal the existence of his convictions on his application and because he has had two convictions for possession of marijuana and is therefore statutorily ineligible for a waiver.order of immigration judge.
the bia affirmed the ij order on alternate grounds.instead of basing its ruling on misrepresentations in francis saw application,protected under the ina,it adopted the government position and found,on the basis of the police report together with francis admission to the ij,that there was sufficient evidence of record to sustain the charge o f removability.in re baswell francis,slip op.at,wl bia.
francis petitions for review of the bia order.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review the bia factual determinations under the substantial evidence test.ivanishvili dep t of justice,cir.we have generally applied this test in claims for asylum,withholding of removal,or relief under the convention against torture,where the alien bears the burden of proof.in this case,however,because francis is a permanent resident,the government bears the burden of proof,which it must meet by adducing clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that the facts alleged as grounds for deportation are true.woodby ins,d see also berenyi immigration,d when the government seeks to strip a person of citizenship already acquired,or deport a resident alien and send him from our shores,it carries the heavy burden of proving its case by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence.t hat status,once granted,can not lightly be taken away footnotes omitted.
as a preliminary matter,we must ascertain whether the substantial evidence test becomes more demanding as the government underlying burden of proof increases.in an en banc decision,the eleventh circuit declared that it does not 
we apply the substantial evidence test even when,as in this case,the government is required to prove its case by clear and convincing evidence in the administrative forum.in other words,the fact that the ins was required to prove the alien deportability by clear and convincing evidence in the bia does not make our review of the bia decision more stringent.
adefemi ashcroft,cir en banc footnotes omitted,cert.denied,d.the court reasoned that findings of fact made by administrative agencies,such as the bia,may be reversed by this court only when the record compels a reversal the mere fact that the record may support a contrary conclusion is not enough to justify a reversal of the administrative findings.id.
by contrast,the sixth and ninth circuits have stated that evidence may need to be more substantial to meet the clear and convincing standard.according to the sixth circuit,
although our deferential standard of review works against overturning the board,the underlying burden of proof in this case has very much the opposite effect our task in this case,therefore,is to determine whether we are compelled to conclude that,contrary to the board finding,the record does not contain clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that respondent abandoned her lpr status in the united states.
hana gonzales,cir citations omitted see also nakamoto ashcroft,cir c ombining the substantial evidence standard with the burden of proof,we must determine whether substantial evidence supports a finding by clear and convincing evidence that respondent committed marriage fraud.
we think the sixth and ninth circuits have the better argument.gonzales,cir noting that in asylum cases w e review de novo questions of law regarding what evidence will suffice to carry the burden of proof.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.accordingly,under the substantial evidence test,in order to grant a petition for review of an order of the bia,we are not required to find that any rational trier of fact would be compelled to conclude that francis was in fact not convicted of two drug offenses.rather,we must find that any rational trier of fact would be compelled to conclude that the proof did not rise to the level of clear and convincing evidence 
ii.the relevant definition of conviction 
the government seeks to deport francis under ina a a,a a,which states that a ny alien who at the time of entry or adjustment of status was within one or more of the classes of aliens inadmissible by the law existing at such time is deportable.the government asserted that francis was inadmissible at the time he received temporary and permanent resident status because of ina a a i ii,a a i ii.that section,in its current form,reads 
any alien convicted of,or who admits having committed,or who admits committing acts which constitute the essential elements of a violation of or a conspiracy or attempt to violate any law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title,is inadmissible.
id.emphasis added.
francis entered the country in and became a permanent resident in.but the current statutory language in section a a i first became effective in as part of the immigration act of,stat.because ina a a makes deportable only aliens who were inadmissible at the time of entry or adjustment,we must therefore consult the statute in effect from through.the applicable version of the statute at that time,ina a,a,excluded any alien who at any time has been convicted of a violation of,or a conspiracy to violate,any law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of the controlled substances act.emphasis added.this provision was repealed by the act and replaced with the statute current language.
the government now concedes that the former ina a,not the current ina a,is the governing law in this case for purposes of determining francis deportability.see gov t supp.letter br.dated,at.in order to deport francis,the government was therefore required to prove by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that he was actually convicted of a drug crime,not merely that he admitted to the underlying criminal conduct.
the applicable definition of conviction was narrower in the relevant time period,from to,than it is today.in matter of ozkok,interim decision,bia,the bia created a test to evaluate whether a defendant has been convicted for purposes of federal immigration laws in cases where formal adjudication of guilt has been withheld and a defendant,despite his admission of guilt,has been given probation,a suspended sentence,or some form of rehabilitation program.
where adjudication of guilt has been withheld,further examination of the specific procedure used and the state authority under which the court acted will be necessary.as a general rule,a conviction will be found for immigration purposes where all of the following elements are present 
a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or he has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilty 
the judge has ordered some form of punishment,penalty,or restraint on the person liberty to be imposed including but not limited to incarceration,probation,a fine or restitution,or sanctions such as a rehabilitation program,a or program,revocation or suspension of a driver license,deprivation of nonessential activities or privileges,or community service and 
a judgment or adjudication of guilt may be entered if the person violates the terms of his probation or fails to comply with the requirements of the court order,without availability of further proceedings regarding the person guilt or innocence of the original charge.
id.at.under the ozkok definition,it was possible for a defendant to plead nolo contendere,obtain a suspended sentence,or enter a rehabilitation program on long as the court stopped short of a formal adjudication of having the offense be considered a conviction for purposes of immigration laws.this required an individualized analysis of the particular procedures of different state penal systems to determine whether a person had been convicted.see,ins,cir finding no conviction under texas deferred adjudication procedures because the alien opportunity to seek further proceedings on the issue of guilt distinguishes the texas scheme from the maryland deferred adjudication procedure considered in ozkok molina ins,cir breyer,examining rhode island nolo contendere scheme to determine whether nolo pleas constitute convictions under ozkok.
congress subsequently indicated its dissatisfaction with the ozkok test when it amended the ina to change the definition of conviction in as part of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,enacted as division c of the omnibus consolidated appropriations act of,a,stat.the statute,in sharp contrast to the ozkok regime,now declares that a ny reference to a term of imprisonment or a sentence with respect to an offense is deemed to include the period of incarceration or confinement ordered by a court of law regardless of any suspension of the imposition or execution of that imprisonment or sentence in whole or in part.ina a b,a b.
the house conference report explained that t his section deliberately broadens the scope of the definition of conviction beyond that adopted by the board of immigration appeals in matter of ozkok.conf,at.according to the report,ozkok did not go far enough to address situations where a judgment of guilt or imposition of sentence was suspended,conditioned upon the alien future good behavior.id.
for example,the third prong of ozkok requires that a judgment or adjudication of guilt may be entered if the alien violates a term or condition of probation,without the need for any further proceedings regarding guilt or innocence on the original charge.in some states,adjudication may be deferred upon a finding or confession of guilt,and a final judgment of guilt may not be imposed if the alien violates probation until there is an additional proceeding regarding the alien guilt or innocence.in such cases,the third prong of the ozkok definition prevents the original finding or confession of guilt to be considered a conviction for deportation purposes.this new provision,by removing the third prong of ozkok,clarifies congressional intent that even in cases where adjudication is deferred,the original finding or confession of guilt is sufficient to establish a conviction for purposes of the immigration laws.in addition,this new definition clarifies that in cases where immigration consequences attach depending upon the length of a term of sentence,any sentence is considered to be actually imposed,including where the court has suspended the imposition of the sentence.
id.at least five of our sister circuits have acknowledged that in enacting iirira,congress specifically and deliberately abrogated the ozkok test.see ashcroft,cir ashcroft,cir gill ashcroft,cir griffiths ins,cir ins,cir.
for the purposes of this case,however,the relevant inquiry is not what the definition of conviction currently is,but what it was in and.compare white ins,cir massachusetts practice of putting some charges on file does not satisfy ozkok definition of conviction with griffiths,at concluding that such filing procedures do constitute convictions after enactment of the iirira.irrespective of presumptions against retroactivity,molina,at examining whether revised federal definition of conviction should be applied retroactively to guilty pleas entered in reliance on the previous definition,the text of ina a a explicitly requires that we determine whether at the time of entry or adjustment of status francis was within one or more of the classes of aliens inadmissible by the law existing at such time.a a emphasis added.if francis did not have at least one prior conviction under the ozkok test,then he would have been admissible at the time of his entry and adjustment of status,and ina could not serve as a basis for his deportation now.
iii.the government proof 
the only evidence the bia relied on other than francis own admissions to establish his prior convictions was a police report from jamaica obtained in connection with the baltimore proceedings.francis argues that the police report was not admissible,and even if admissible,that it did not rise to the level of clear,convincing,and unequivocal evidence.
admissibility 
as an initial matter,francis challenges the admissibility of the jamaican police report.in,the attorney general promulgated regulations in for determining what kinds of evidence may be used to prove a criminal conviction in immigration proceedings.section a lists a series of judicial documents which shall be admissible as evidence in proving a criminal conviction.congress subsequently adopted a similar statutory list of evidence that constitutes conclusive proof of a conviction.see c b see also in re luis,wl bia,unpublished opinion this section of the act generally utilizes the records listed in our regulation,a,but amends and expands that list of specific documents,and provides that such records conclusively establish the existence of a criminal conviction.
in francis case,it is uncontested that the jamaican police report does not fall within any of the documents or records listed in section a of the regulations or in section c b of the statute as proof of a conviction.but the regulations include an additional provision,d,which has no counterpart in the federal statute.d states any other evidence that reasonably indicates the existence of a criminal conviction may be admissible as evidence thereof.the bia concluded that francis police report was admissible as such any other evidence under section d.
francis argues that because congress has specifically listed the items that constitute proof of conviction,the regulations may not supplement that list by allowing a ny other evidence.but the attorney general regulations are entitled to chevron deference and must be upheld so long as they are permissible construction s of the statute.chevron usa,natural res.def.council,d see also blanco de belbruno ashcroft,cir.it seems to us to be reasonable enough for the attorney general to read the statute as a list of what documents constitute conclusive proof of conviction,as it says,but not as a prohibition on admitting other types of documents.as the eleventh circuit has observed,section c b does not state that the forms of proof it lists constitute the sole means of establishing a criminal conviction rather,the statute merely says that such forms shall constitute proof of a criminal conviction.other forms of proof will suffice if probative.fequiere ashcroft,cir.moreover,we have cited approvingly
