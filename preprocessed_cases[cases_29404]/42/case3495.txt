the grant of employment authorization,pending the approval of adjustment of status to that of a legal permanent resident lpr under,does not confer admission status on an undocumented alien one who entered without inspection or authorization and has not otherwise been admitted for purposes of calculating seven years of continuous residence under a.employment authorization,under c,merely allows such alien the right to work while his or her application for adjustment of status is being adjudicated.
factual background 
melchor guevara entered the united states without inspection in.after entering the united states,guevara began living and continues to live with his lpr daughter and his two united states citizen grandchildren.
in october,guevara filed an application to adjust his status from that of an undocumented alien to an lpr under i after receiving an approved i.after filing his application,guevara applied for and received his employment authorization in january.while his application for adjustment of status was pending,guevara requested permission to temporarily leave the united states,advanced parole,d a the request was denied on september.thus,guevara was required to stay in the united states pending the approval of his application for adjustment of status or risk forfeiting his application.on october,he was allowed to adjust his status to an lpr.
on september,guevara attempted to assist another alien daughter and her child to enter the united states unlawfully.because of that conduct,guevara was served on the same day with a notice to appear in removal proceedings.the government charged him with knowingly assisting undocumented persons to enter the united states in violation of immigration and nationality act ina a e i,a e i.
during guevara removal proceedings,he admitted to assisting his daughter and grandchild to illegally enter the united states.however,he also applied for cancellation of removal.the immigration judge ij found that guevara was eligible for cancellation of removal under ina.specifically,the ij found that guevara met the requirement for cancellation of removal,because guevara was granted the employment authorization on january,and lived in the united states continuously until the initiation of removal proceedings on september.the ij held that,when the government granted guevara the opportunity to work in the united states,he was admitted in any status.in making this decision,the ij found guevara circumstances similar to those of participants in the family unity program fup and therefore applied the reasoning of garcia quintero gonzales,cir,to guevara.the ij also noted that guevara was denied advanced parole and thus required to remain in the united states.
the government appealed the ij ruling to the board of immigration appeals bia.the bia,in an unpublished decision,reversed the ij decision.the bia rejected the ij conclusion that receiving an employment authorization document was comparable to being a participant in the fup.the bia found that the holding in garcia quintero,supra,involving an alien who was accepted into the fup,does not extend to an alien who was simply granted an employment authorization document.the bia further noted we find the respondent circumstances are distinct from a fup beneficiary who is eligible to depart the united states and return pursuant to the fup concept of voluntary departure.instead,the bia found guevara ineligible for cancellation of removal,because he had not met his seven years of continuous residence,which it determined began on october,the date guevara application for adjustment of status was approved.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the bia determination of purely legal questions,including the bia interpretation of the immigration and nationality act.lopez ins,cir.we apply chevron deference to the board interpretations of ambiguous immigration statutes,if the board decision is a published decision.see marmolejo campos holder,cir.however,we need not defer to the bia if the statute is unambiguous.see id.at see also ins aguirre aguirre.we follow the skidmore framework if the decision is unpublished and not directly controlled by any published decision interpreting the same statute.uppal holder,cir citing marmolejo campos,at.
iii.discussion 
in order for guevara,a legal permanent resident alien who is inadmissible or deportable,to be eligible for cancellation of removal,he must meet the requirements set forth in a 
the attorney general may cancel removal in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the united states if the alien 
has been an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than years,
has resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status,and 
has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.
the parties do not dispute that guevara satisfied the first and third requirements.we are required here only to decide at what point guevara has resided in the united states for a continuous period of seven years after being admitted in any status.see a.the parties do not dispute that the approval of guevara adjustment of status would make him admitted in any status.however,because his application for adjustment of status was approved on october,guevara can not meet the requirement of seven continuous years of living in the united states based on his date of adjustment.therefore,we must decide whether guevara was admitted in any status,when he received employment authorization from the united states citizenship and immigration services uscis on january,therefore providing him enough time for the requisite seven years.
while the phrase admitted in any status has not been defined,the term admitted has.see a a lawful entry after inspection and authorization.there is no dispute that guevara does not meet the statutory definition of admitted,because he entered without inspection or authorization.see vasquez de alcantar holder,slip op.at cir.june.the phrase admitted in any status,however,has not been limited to the strict definition of admitted.in in re rosas ramirez,the bia held that the term admitted included those who are lawfully admitted for permanent residence.see also matter of koljenovic.again,in cuevas gaspar gonzales,we held that,for purposes of satisfying the seven years of continuous residence,a parent lpr status is imputed to unemancipated minor children for purposes of admission,cir.lastly,in garcia quintero,we held that participation in the fup was equivalent to being admitted in any status.at.however,guevara situation is not directly analogous to any of these cases.
regardless,guevara argues that we should include aliens who are granted employment authorization in the definition of admitted in any status.he argues that the employment authorization is the equivalent of the fup acceptance held to constitute admission in garcia quintero,because he was authorized by the government to stay in the united states pending the approval of his application for adjustment of status.he argues that the fact that he was not allowed to leave the united states when he requested advanced parole is further evidence that this allowance granted him some status we disagree.according the bia limited deference under skidmore,we conclude that a mere grant of employment authorization does not,without more,confer status employment authorization is not equivalent to participation in the fup and the term unauthorized alien only refers to the eligibility to legally work,not to admission status.
skidmore deference 
because the bia has not issued a precedential opinion on whether the receipt of an employment authorization document equates to admission,we need not accord the agency chevron deference.see garcia quintero,at.in this case,the bia issued a unpublished,nonprecedential decision finding that the starting date for guevara accumulation of seven years of continuous physical presence should not begin on january,when dhs issued him an employment authorization document rather,we conclude that the starting date for guevara accumulation of seven years of continuous physical presence was on october,the date on which his application for adjustment of status was approved the bia found that the holding in garcia quintero,does not extend to an alien who was simply granted an employment authorization document,because guevara circumstances are distinct from a fup beneficiary.although we find the bia conclusions persuasive,its decision lacks a thorough and meaningful analysis.thus,we only accord the bia decision some deference under skidmore.see shin holder,cir t he weight of the board decision depends on the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.quoting skidmore swift.with this limited deference in mind,we analyze whether guevara employment authorization constituted admission in any status.
grant of employment authorization does not constitute admission in any status 
guevara was granted authorization to accept employment pending the adjudication of his adjustment of status application pursuant to c.regulation sets forth the classes of aliens authorized to accept employment.the main three classes of aliens are a aliens authorized employment incident to status b aliens authorized for employment with a specific employer incident to status and c aliens who must apply for employment authorization.subsection a lists classes of aliens who are authorized employment incident to status.a.this employment authorization is granted without restriction.id.all of the aliens described in this section are either admitted or granted status.see a.a sample of this group includes aliens who have been granted asylum,a any alien granted temporary protected status,a and any alien granted fup benefits,a.
subsection c similarly allows aliens to receive employment authorization.however,these aliens are not granted authorization incident to status,but must instead apply for employment authorization.c.aliens listed in this class may or may not have any legal status.for example,this class of aliens includes aliens like guevara applying for adjustment of status,c aliens against whom a final order of removal exists,but who can not be removed due to the refusal of all designated countries,c and aliens applying for temporary protected status,c.
as noted above,c specifically allows adjustment of status applicants,such as guevara,to request employment authorization while their application is pending.c.however,the authorization for such employment is not mandated.a.instead,the uscis grants such authorization within its discretion.id.applicants under c may also have their grant of employment authorization terminated or revoked at any time under the criteria set forth in,which includes,but is not limited to a preset expiration date initiation of deportation proceedings a showing of good cause or a showing that the information in the application is not true and correct.a b.
the language in the statute and the regulations authorizing employment do not support the proposition that aliens provided this benefit are admitted in any status.there is no language in the statute or regulations that suggests aliens,not previously admitted,become admitted,when they are granted employment authorization under c.there is nothing in case law,statutes,or administrative regulations which supports a finding that a grant of employment authorization to an alien not previously admitted is the equivalent to being admitted.as noted,allows several classes of aliens to apply for employment authorization.while subsection a applies exclusively to aliens who have been admitted or granted status and states the authorization is incident to status,subsection c does not.guevara falls under subsection c.the class of aliens to which guevara belongs is not necessarily admitted nor has it necessarily obtained lawful status.without a clear mandate from congress,we decline to extend the definition of admitted in any status in this instance 
employment authorization is not equivalent to fup participation 
we decline to extend the reasoning of garcia quintero,which addressed fup beneficiaries,to all aliens who receive employment authorization mere employment authorization for adjustment of status applicants is not comparable to participation in the fup.further,the employment authorization for the two classes of aliens is not similar.
as we discussed in vasquez de alcantar,the fup was enacted by congress to assist a very narrow group of aliens.vasquez de alcantar,slip op.at.in doing so,it set forth heightened requirements for eligibility.id.at.the fup was enacted to prevent the separation of families and to provide a means by which a qualifying family member already in the united states in illegal status could eventually apply for permanent resident status.see immigration act of.in contrast,congress did not have the same familial concerns in enacting the legislation permitting a nonimmigrant to adjust his or her status to that of a person admitted for permanent residence under.it allowed aliens,who met certain criteria work,family,or otherwise,to apply for adjustment of status.however,does not entitle aliens,who entered without inspection,to any admission status by reason of their application alone.see vasquez de alcantar,slip op.at.
generally,aliens must have lawful status prior to applying for adjustment of status.congress,however,made an exception for those aliens who entered without inspection.see i.section i allows aliens such as guevara,who were not previously admitted,to apply for adjustment if they were the beneficiary of a visa petition filed before april.id.this exception,however,only confers the right to apply.it does not suggest that the undocumented alien becomes admitted due to the mere filing of the application.if congress intended for a status to be conferred at the time of filing,it could have easily done so.thus,merely allowing all applicants regardless of status to work while seeking adjustment can not,without more,equate to admission.
as we noted in vasquez de alcantar,in order for aliens to be allowed to participate in the fup,they must meet heightened eligibility requirements.slip op.at.in return,they also have benefits that are not available to applicants for adjustment of status.id.while both groups are able to work,the fup provides additional benefits,most notably protection from removal for a renewable period,voluntary.see.garcia quintero,at.this benefit is not available to aliens with pending adjustment of status applications.see.these differences in both eligibility and benefits are important in our consideration of whether to extend admission status beyond that set forth in a a.
in garcia quintero,our decision to allow fup participants to qualify as admitted in any status was not based upon the fact that fup participants were allowed to work.our decision instead focused on the aliens acceptance into the fup.id.at.as part of that acceptance,we looked at garcia quintero enrollment in the program,specifically noting that it provided protection from deportation and that fup beneficiaries shall be inspected and admitted in the same immigration status as the alien had at the time of departure.id.at emphases in the original.a review of these eligibility requirements and resulting benefits as a whole supported our conclusion that congress intended that fup beneficiaries be accorded a limited immigration status.id.at.however,we have never discussed each of those individual benefits and concluded that each would be an independent basis for admission status.we again decline to find that grant of one of those benefits employment authorization is equivalent to participation in the fup and thus an independent basis for admission status.
however,even if the individual benefit of employment authorization for fup beneficiaries were compared to guevara employment authorization,they are far from the same authorization.if the agency intended the benefit to be the same,there was no need to separate the aliens into classes.compare a with c separating classes for aliens granted temporary protected status versus aliens applying for temporary protected status.fup
