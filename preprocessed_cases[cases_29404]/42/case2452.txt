anju kokar was taken into custody by the department of homeland security dhs after overstaying her visitor visa.her applications for asylum,withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture were denied by an immigration judge ij.kokar filed an appeal with the board of immigration appeals bia,which summarily affirmed the ij decision.kokar then sought further review in this court.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we now affirm the decision of the board and deny the petition for review.
backgrounda.facts 
kokar is a native of bangkok,thailand.in july,she was admitted to the united states on a visitor visa bearing a false name.
prior to kokar coming to the united states,her mother had borrowed a large sum of money from loan sharks to pay for medical treatment for kokar stepfather.the family encountered difficulties repaying the debt,and kokar explored the possibility of coming to the united states to earn the necessary funds.she obtained a passport from a broker at the time she purchased the passport,the broker informed kokar that she would have to work in the united states to repay the cost of the passport.kokar believed that the cost of the passport was approximately.
upon arrival in the united states,kokar was informed that she owed for her passport and travel costs and that she would have to work as a prostitute to repay these costs.she worked in several different cities until she was apprehended by the dhs in houston,texas.when kokar was taken into custody,she was traveling to new york to make a payment towards her debt.
since the time of her arrest,kokar has been employed at a restaurant in chicago,illinois,which is owned by her boyfriend mother.she has been sending approximately per month back to thailand.she does not know how much of these funds have been used to pay off the original loan and how much of these funds simply have been used by her mother and for living expenses.at her removal proceeding,kokar testified that s he is afraid of the loan sharks and what they might do if she were returned to thailand she also stated that she did not believe that the thai police would assist her if she encountered problems with the loan sharks.
administrative proceedings 
in her initial removal hearing,kokar admitted that she had entered the country illegally,but sought asylum,withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture the ij found that kokar had testified credibly to the above facts.however,the ij denied relief because kokar had failed to establish that she was a member of a particular social group which would be cognizable under the immigration and nationality act,specifically disadvantaged women who are taken advantage of by the system in thailand or by loan sharks.furthermore,the ij determined that she ha d not established that there exists a reasonable possibility of persecution on account of the group characteristics.id.at.additionally,the ij found that kokar subjective fear of mistreatment at the hands of loan sharks was not objectively reasonable given that neither her mother,nor her other relatives,had been harmed or forced into prostitution as a result of the debt owed.finally,the ij denied kokar claims because she failed to establish that the government of thailand would be unwilling or unable to protect her if she was threatened by the loan sharks 
on november,kokar attorney filed a notice of appeal with the bia.the notice of appeal instructed that the appellant s tate in detail the reason s for this appeal.the notice also contained the following highlighted warning 
warning you must clearly explain the specific facts and law on which you base your appeal of the immigration judge decision.the board may summarily dismiss your appeal if it can not tell from this notice of appeal,or any statements attached to the notice of appeal,why you are appealing.
id.the stated basis for kokar appeal was while finding respondent testimony to be credible,ij erred in denying her asylum by refusing to recognize her as a member of the protected social group of victims of women traffiking sic for prostitution under the asylum laws.id.
on the same page of the notice,the form asked the appellant do you intend to file a separate written brief or statement after filing this notice of appeal id.immediately beneath this question was another warning 
warning if you mark yes in item,you will be expected to file a written brief or statement after you receive the briefing schedule from the board.the board may summarily dismiss your appeal if you do not file a brief or statement within the time set in the briefing schedule.
the board later sent the parties a briefing schedule dated july.the briefing schedule again warned kokar that,if she failed to file a brief or statement within the time set by the briefing schedule,the appeal could be dismissed however,no brief was filed on behalf of kokar,nor did kokar or her attorney submit a statement explaining their failure to do so.
the bia summarily dismissed kokar appeal on november.in its opinion,the board recounted that kokar had checked the box indicating a separate brief or statement would be filed.however,the board continued,the record indicates that the appellant did not file such brief or statement,or reasonably explain the failure to do so,within the time set for filing.accordingly,the appeal is summarily dismissed under the provisions of d i e.
kokar timely sought review in this court.
this court has not determined the standard of review which should be applied to summary dismissals by the bia.kokar points to awe ashcroft,cir,for the proposition that t his court should review the summary dismissal to determine whether it is appropriate.petitioner br.at.in awe,this court observed that w e do not see anything in the record here to suggest that the bia inappropriately exercised its power in summarily dismissing awe appeal under d i d,and we therefore affirm its decision on these grounds.at see also ashcroft,cir reviewing summary dismissal for appropriateness.however,there is no discussion in the court opinion regarding standard of review,nor is there any indication that the court meant for this statement to establish the standard to be applied.
the government acknowledges the language in awe,but correctly notes that awe did not expressly articulate a standard of review.respondent br.at.it urges this court to adopt the abuse of discretion standard employed by the fifth circuit in rioja ashcroft,cir,and more recently adopted by the eleventh circuit in esponda united states attorney general,cir.in esponda,the court explained that b ecause the regulation at issue here,d i e,indicates that the bia may summarily dismiss an appeal,it vests discretion in the bia.thus,we review the bia application of the regulation to summarily dismiss the espondas appeal for abuse of discretion.id.at.
the present appeal,however,does not require us to resolve the standard of review question because we perceive no error or abuse of discretion in the bia dismissal of kokar administrative appeal.
this court earlier precedent 
this court previously has addressed the bia dismissal of procedurally defective appeals.awe,at see also stroe ins,cir.in stroe,the petitioners,who were represented by counsel,appealed an adverse asylum decision to the bia.petitioners counsel received an initial extension to file a brief however,counsel failed to file a brief on behalf of the petitioners until three months after the extended deadline.prior to the bia receipt of the brief,it had dismissed the appeal on the ground that a brief had not been filed.before this court,the petitioners argued that the board had denied them due process of law when it dismissed the appeal for failure to file a timely brief without having notified them of the possibility that dismissal might be a consequence of such a failure.stroe,at.we characterized this argument as border ing on the frivolous 
the board was under no duty,either constitutional or statutory,to send counsel periodic reminders.an appellant failure to file a brief is a serious procedural default,and,at least when the appellant is represented by counsel dismissal is an appropriate sanction.
we held similarly in awe,at.as in stroe,the petitioner in awe had received an adverse ruling from an ij on his applications for asylum and withholding of deportation.awe appealed to the bia 
by submitting a notice of appeal,form,on which he checked the box indicating that he intended to file a separate written brief in support of his appeal.also,in the space provided on the notice of appeal itself,awe stated in some detail his reasons for appealing the ij decision.at that time awe requested,and later received,an additional days to file his brief however,he never submitted a brief or an explanation for its absence to the bia.one month after awe brief was due but never filed,the ins filed a brief expressing its support for the ij decision.two months later the bia summarily dismissed awe appeal,citing d i d.
id.at.in his brief before this court,awe did not challenge the bia decision to dismiss his petition for procedural reasons but instead argue d that the bia substantive review of the ij decision was flawed.id.at oral argument,awe attorney acknowledged that he had missed the briefing deadline,but argued that his mistake was not fatal because the notice of appeal gave the bia a fair appraisal of the issues to be addressed in awe appeal.id.at.we held that awe notice argument was waived because he failed to present it to the court prior to oral argument.however,we continued 
even assuming awe had not waived his right to challenge the bia procedural dismissal,we note that d i d explicitly gives the bia authority to dismiss procedurally defective appeals,and we have condoned the bia use of this power in cases similar to this one.see stroe ins,cir holding summary dismissal appropriate where party indicated he would file brief,requested and received filing extension,and never filed brief nor explained why he had not accord rioja ashcroft,cir.we do not see anything in the record here to suggest that the bia inappropriately exercised its power in summarily dismissing awe appeal under d i d,and we therefore affirm its decision on these grounds.
awe,at with these authorities in mind,we turn to kokar arguments.
kokar contentions 
kokar presents two arguments for our consideration.first,she submits that the bia erred when it dismissed her appeal because it failed to give adequate reasons for its decision.second,she maintains that,under the circumstances presented here,the bia dismissal of her appeal violated due process.
with respect to her first argument,kokar submits that,because dismissal under d e is permissive,rather than mandatory,the bia was required to justify its application of the summary dismissal rule in her case.kokar does not point to any authority that has imposed this requirement on the bia.indeed,kokar argument runs counter to this court case law,which has upheld the bia use of the summary dismissal mechanism without requiring further explanation or justification by the bia.see,awe,at stroe,at.
kokar also contends that,under the circumstances of her case,the bia invocation of d i e violated her right to due process.specifically,relying on ashcroft,cir,and ins,cir,kokar claims that,when an appellant has articulated the basis of her claim in the notice of appeal,summary dismissal for failure to timely file a brief violates due process.
as an initial matter,we must consider whether this argument is properly before us.kokar never presented her due process argument to the bia by way of a motion to reopen.although due process claims generally do not require exhaustion because the bia does not have authority to review constitutional challenges,when those issues involve procedural errors correctable by the bia,applicants must raise such claims as part of their administrative appeal.capric ashcroft,cir.here,according to kokar,the bia could have cured the alleged due process violation either by evaluating the adequacy of her claim as set forth in the notice of appeal or by considering her claim on the merits.thus,kokar due process claim appears to be one that is correctable by the bia,and therefore subject to the exhaustion requirement.
however,even if kokar due process claim were properly before us,we nevertheless would reject her claim on the merits.kokar argument rests primarily on the ninth circuit opinion in.the ninth circuit stated 
when an alien gives detailed reasons to support his appeal,either in a separate brief or on the notice of appeal itself,summary dismissal under d i e violates the alien due process rights as guaranteed by the fifth amendment.casaschavez,at.due process requires that aliens who seek to appeal be given a fair opportunity to present their cases.the federal regulation operates within the bounds of this constitutional guarantee.the reason why it is permissible for the bia to summarily dismiss an appeal for failure to timely file a brief is that an alien appealing an order of removal must provide the bia with adequate notice of the specific grounds for his appeal.but when the alien has in fact provided such notice to the bia,this justification falls away,and summary dismissal for failure to timely file a brief violates the alien constitutional right to a fair appeal.see,at.
at additional quotation marks and citations omitted 
as our earlier precedent makes clear,we respectfully disagree with our colleagues assessment for two reasons.first,we believe that the authority for the court initial proposition is illusory.the portion of cited by the court states 
when the petitioner establishes the ground for appeal with sufficient clarity on the notice of appeal form,the mere failure to file a brief after indicating one would be filed may not be a constitutionally sufficient rationale for dismissing an alien appeal without considering the merits.see,at.
at emphasis added.
however,in ins,cir,the entire footnote reads 
an amendment to d,effective january,allows the bia to summarily dismiss an appeal where a petitioner indicates on form that he or she will file a brief or statement in support of the appeal and,thereafter,does not file such brief or statement,or reasonably explain his or her failure to do so,within the time set for filing.d e.even assuming that the amendment states a constitutionally adequate ground upon which to base a summary dismissal,we note that the regulation did not become effective until almost four years after filed his notice of appeal.thus,contrary to the government contention,the amendment does not govern the outcome of this case.
id.emphasis added.in sum,the ninth circuit only suggested in that summary dismissal under the present circumstances may not be constitutionally sound this suggestion,however,was merely dicta and was not accompanied by any analysis.the suggestion was repeated in,again without explanation or elaboration.in,however,this suggestion became,without further explanation or elaboration,an affirmative statement that due process is violated when the bia invokes d i e to dismiss an appeal when the party has explained the basis of the appeal on the notice of appeal form 
in addition to relying on,the ninth circuit in also offered the following justification for its holding,which,with respect,we also find unpersuasive 
due process requires that aliens who seek to appeal be given a fair opportunity to present their cases.the reason why it is permissible for the bia to summarily dismiss an appeal for failure to timely file a brief is that an alien appealing an order of removal must provide the bia with adequate notice of the specific grounds for his appeal.but when the alien has in fact provided such notice to the bia,this justification falls away,and summary dismissal for failure to timely file a brief violates the alien constitutional right to a fair appeal.
at citations omitted.the statement,however,fails to acknowledge that the filing of a brief before the bia is optional.in order for an appeal to be considered by the bia,the alien need only give an explanation of the claim and its factual or legal basis on the notice of appeal form.thus,all aliens have a fair opportunity to present their cases.id.the alien,however,may choose to file a brief to provide
