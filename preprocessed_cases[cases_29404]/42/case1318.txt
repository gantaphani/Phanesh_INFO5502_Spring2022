opinion of the court 
this appeal raises,inter alia,an issue of first impression in this court,that is,what conduct constitutes shielding,harboring,and concealing an alien within the meaning of.
facts and procedural history 
in,appellant hakan ozcelik,then age sixteen,came to the united states from turkey as a stowaway on a merchant ship thereafter,ozcelik earned his ged and a college degree in criminal justice,and worked at various jobs.he obtained legal american citizenship and on december,he began working as a customs and border protection officer in the department of homeland security dhs.he worked principally in port elizabeth,new jersey inspecting cargo on cruise vessels,but also occasionally worked at newark airport inspecting individual passengers.
tunc tuncer,the government principal witness,is a turkish citizen who came to the united states on an student visa to participate in a master degree program at columbia university.when tuncer failed to meet required academic standards,columbia refused him readmission,thereby subjecting him to deportation for being out of status.app.at.
shortly thereafter,tuncer discussed his immigration issue with his friend,uzgar madik,who was the president of the intercollegiate turkish students society.madik phoned ozcelik,who madik said might be able to help,and put tuncer on the phone.the two had a short conversation.tuncer called ozcelik the next day to provide the information ozcelik had requested and ozcelik said he would see what he could do.ozcelik called tuncer back the following day,stating that tuncer case was doable or easy and that all tuncer had to do was pay ozcelik.app.at.ozcelik told tuncer the money had nothing to do with him,but that it was for two of his friends in the immigration and naturalization service ins who were going to change some dates in the system for tuncer visa.tuncer testified that ozcelik told him he had done this for another girl in the past recently and would be happy to help tuncer with his problem.app.at.tuncer stated that he did not have the money and would call ozcelik when he obtained it.within the next week or two,ozcelik called tuncer several times asking about the money,but tuncer said he did not have it and did not know when he could get it.
on march,glenn bartley,an immigration and customs enforcement ice agent,visited tuncer and told him he was out of status.at a second meeting the next day bartley administratively arrested tuncer but did not detain him.at that meeting,the two discussed the possibility of bartley receiving information from tuncer about ozcelik.
from march,until may,tuncer initiated several phone conversations at the direction of law enforcement who recorded the conversations.tuncer told ozcelik that his immigration problem was still continuing.app.at.ozcelik reiterated that tuncer would have to pay at least.in a subsequent recorded conversation,tuncer asked ozcelik if would be enough.ozcelik responded no it ca.there is and than sic there is for the fee,they will give those,they will do the thing for you,they will do the thing from the inside.app.at.ozcelik never told tuncer the names of the two friends,but he continually stated that the money was for them.
ozcelik and tuncer arranged a meeting at the new port mall on march,so that tuncer could pay ozcelik the fee and provide him with a copy of his immigration paperwork.at that meeting,ozcelik took the money and told tuncer that it would take at least three months for anything to happen.following the meeting,tuncer and ozcelik had one more recorded phone conversation in which tuncer asked whether there was anything new and ozcelik said that he had made the necessary contacts and that tuncer would be the one receiving news.app.at.
as a result of those conversations and the controlled meeting between tuncer and ozcelik,a federal grand jury charged ozcelik in a indictment.count one of the indictment charged ozcelik with seeking and accepting a bribe in return for being influenced in the performance of official acts and being induced to do or omit acts in violation of official duties,in violation of b.count two charged ozcelik with attempting to conceal,harbor,and shield from detection an illegal alien,in violation of a a iii.
the jury trial began on march.when the government rested,ozcelik reserved his right to move for judgment of acquittal pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.ozcelik thereafter presented evidence,including testifying on his own behalf.the jury convicted ozcelik on both counts.the district court denied ozcelik renewed motion for judgment of acquittal.
with regard to the bribery conviction,the district court held that there was ample evidence that ozcelik solicited and accepted from tuncer.the court also stated that there was substantial evidence that ozcelik contemplated passing on some or all of the to other immigration officials for the purpose of their taking official action to assist tuncer.the court further held that a reasonable juror could infer corrupt intent in soliciting the bribe because there was substantial evidence of ozcelik consciousness of wrongdoing.with respect to the conviction for an alien,the court held that there was sufficient evidence that ozcelik gave tuncer multiple instructions to conceal his activities in order to avoid detection by immigration authorities.the court characterized ozcelik conduct as instructing tuncer to hide from the immigration authorities,app.at,thereby constituting the crime of shielding.
following a sentencing hearing,the district court sentenced ozcelik.on the bribery conviction,the court imposed a enhancement for obstruction of justice for ozcelik false trial testimony,resulting in an adjusted offense level of.with respect to the shielding conviction,the court imposed a enhancement because ozcelik abused a position of trust,resulting in an adjusted offense level of.the district court denied ozcelik request to group the two offenses pursuant to united states sentencing guidelines or guidelines.instead,the court followed the recommendation of the probation officer,who had calculated the offense level by applying the adjustment pursuant to,resulting in a total offense level of.with an offense level of and a criminal history category of i,ozcelik guidelines range was to thirty months imprisonment.the court sentenced ozcelik to months imprisonment on each count,to be served concurrently.
ozcelik appeals he argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain both the bribery and shielding convictions.he also argues that the court erred in defining the term official act in its instructions to the jury.finally,ozcelik contends that the court erred by not grouping his offenses at sentencing.
sufficiency of evidence on count 
it is black letter law that in order to convict a defendant the government must prove each element of a charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.see in re winship,d.we apply a deferential standard in determining whether a jury verdict rests on sufficient evidence.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,we will sustain a defendant conviction if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states voigt,cir quoting jackson virginia,d.an appellant raising a claim of insufficiency of the evidence bears a very heavy burden.united states dent,cir internal quotations omitted.
although we believe that the issue of the sufficiency of evidence to prove bribery is a very close one,we can not disregard that a jury convicted ozcelik of bribery in violation of b.that statute provides that whoever 
being a public official or person selected to be a public official,directly or indirectly,corruptly demands,seeks,receives,accepts,or agrees to receive or accept anything of value personally or for any other person or entity,in return for 
a being influenced in the performance of any official act 
b being influenced to commit or aid in committing,or to collude in,or allow,any fraud,or make opportunity for the commission of any fraud,on the united states or 
c being induced to do or omit to do any act in violation of the official duty of such official or person 
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than fifteen years,or both 
b.the government must prove that the public official took or sought the funds for one of the three purposes enumerated in subsections a,b,and c in the statute.
under b,there are three essential elements that must be met defendant must be a public official,who directly or indirectly demanded,sought,received,accepted,or agreed to receive or accept anything of value personally or for any other person or entity,and did so specifically for one of the three corrupt purposes set forth in subsections a through c.see united states orenuga.there is no question that ozcelik met the first two elements he is a public official and he received money from tuncer the third element goes to ozcelik intent.
thus the only disputed issue is whether the evidence is sufficient to prove that ozcelik received tuncer money with a corrupt intent,that is,he did so for one of the three reasons prohibited by statute.the government argues that ozcelik violated the statute under both subsection a and subsection c,that he sought the bribe to be influenced in the performance of an official act and that he took the bribe contrary to his official duty to uphold the immigration law.it argues that ozcelik consciousness of wrongdoing is reflected by his consistent statements to tuncer to conceal their arrangement.
section a defines official act as any decision or action on any question,matter,cause,suit,proceeding or controversy,which may at any time be pending,or which may by law be brought before any public official,in such official official capacity,or in such official place of trust or profit.a.
the government argues that ozcelik was guilty under this statutory section in two exclusive ways.appellee br.at.first,he had the corrupt intent to take official action directly by acting in his capacity as a dhs employee to agree to take official action to request others in dhs for official aid for tuncer,and,if need be,to intervene.appellee br.at.second,ozcelik,as a middleman,agreed to importune other immigration officials to take official action to assist tuncer.appellee br.at.both theories require us to consider what is the official action ozcelik took to fall within the bribery statute.
on this record,the jury could find that ozcelik asked other individuals within dhs to take official action on behalf of tuncer thus both theories blend together into one theory of aiding and abetting other unidentified immigration officials to take official action to alter tuncer records.as the government stated at oral argument,there is only one piece of evidence to show that such immigration officials even own statements to tuncer that he had a friend within the ins who would undertake to alter tuncer visa status.
we view the issue before us in light of our obligation to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and to sustain a jury verdict if a reasonable jury believing the government evidence could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the government proved all the elements of the offense.united states rosario,cir quoting united states salmon,cir.we must defer to the jury assessment of witness credibility and recognize that the government proof need not exclude every possible hypothesis of innocence.united states bala,cir internal quotations and alterations omitted.
one who aids and abets another is as guilty of the underlying offense as the principal.united states dixon,cir holding that middleman who facilitated bribery of government official was liable as aider and abettor.to prove that ozcelik aided and abetted another,the government must prove that the other,the principal in this case the unnamed friend at ins,committed all of the elements of the offense.united states cades,cir see also united states nolan,cir.notably,the offense is committed when the official here,the unnamed ins official agrees to accept the bribe in exchange for promising to carry out one of the statutory prohibitions,the promise to alter tuncer visa it is not necessary to actually perform the prohibited act.see orenuga,at stating that acceptance of the bribe is the violation of the statute,not performance of the illegal promise quoting united states brewster,d.
the evidence at trial was as follows tuncer testified that ozcelik told him that he would get other authorities at immigration to change tuncer visa status so that he could remain in the country.during the march recorded telephone conversation,oczelik said that they will give those,they will do the thing for you,they will do the thing from the inside.app.at at the march meeting,ozcelik stated,the only thing i know is that the person i know will do something for you from the ins.app.at.later in the same conversation,ozcelik said,at least months,months will have to go by,because these kind of things have a certain way,it will be in the system,there are a lot of people in front of you in the system.he needs to do something within that system,do you understand what i mean app.at.in a later recorded telephone conversation on may,tuncer asked for assurance that ozcelik had spoken with his friend at the ins and that the friend had undertaken to help.ozcelik was reluctant to talk about such matters by phone but did confirm that he had contacted the people in question for tuncer and that tuncer should be the one receiving news.app.at.
in addition,tuncer testified at trial that in one of the earlier,unrecorded telephone conversations,ozcelik had told him that his case was doable,easy for him.app.at.tuncer testified that ozcelik had asked him for,and tuncer asked what the money was for.ozcelik replied that the money was for two of his friends who worked at ins and they were going to change some dates within the system for tuncer visa.app.at.
if the jury believed that evidence,it could reasonably have concluded that ozcelik had a contact or contacts at ins whom he aided in taking a bribe to violate the contact official duty.the evidence that the friend had undertaken to adjust tuncer visa status was ozcelik own statements to tuncer that his friend was going to adjust the visa within the system for tuncer.although there is no evidence that the friend actually adjusted the visa status,there is evidence from which the jury could infer that the friend agreed to adjust the visa,and it was at that point that the crime of the principal was complete.because there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could rationally conclude that ozcelik had induced a friend at ins to alter tuncer status in exchange for a bribe,there was sufficient evidence to support ozcelik guilt on a theory of aiding and abetting.
ozcelik argues that there is insufficient evidence because the government could not name a specific official whom ozcelik aided and abetted and there is no evidence that such unnamed official actually adjusted the visa.ozcelik raises an intriguing argument.we agree that it is possible that there was no friend at the ins and that ozcelik was lying to tuncer by telling him that his friend at the ins would adjust tuncer status,when,in reality,ozcelik intended to keep the money without taking any action to adjust tuncer status.indeed,the only evidence the government produced at trial that the unnamed friend at ins existed was ozcelik own statements to that effect.but we are not permitted to assess credibility.and as such,we can not say as a matter of law that no reasonable juror could accept the government theory premised upon ozcelik own statements.
although we are concerned that the government could not,through its investigation,discover the identity of ozcelik acquaintance at ins,that concern does not warrant overturning ozcelik conviction.after all,ozcelik own words provide the missing link and he did accept the money tuncer paid for the performance of the official act.
ozcelik proffered an alternative view of the evidence,that he solicited the money to procure a lawyer named sol kodsi to assist tuncer.kodsi testified that ozcelik had requested that he represent tuncer and that he had told ozcelik that tuncer case would probably cost plus for the filing fee and mailings.kodsi testified that if tuncer brought him he would probably more than likely take his case.app.at.kodsi also testified that he had made an appointment with tuncer through ozcelik for march.
the jury was free to reject kodsi testimony,particularly in light of the absence of any evidence that kodsi ever spoke to tuncer or that ozcelik ever communicated any information about kodsi to tuncer.instead,ozcelik statements to tuncer were always in terms of his ins contacts.for example,he stated that they will do the thing for you,they will do the thing from the inside.app.at emphasis added.moreover,although kodsi testified he was a longtime friend of ozcelik,ozcelik had stated in one recorded conversation that he was not very close to the ones who would be helping tuncer,app.at,thereby throwing into question the alleged discussion with kodsi.although ozcelik may have given a viable explanation for the request for funds,we can not say that it was unreasonable for the jury to reject it in favor of the government theory.
ozcelik argues that the district court improperly charged the jury on the meaning of official act as used in b.because ozcelik did not object to the jury instructions at trial,we review for plain error.united states wolfe,cir.a plain error is one that affects substantial rights.id.citing united states olano,d.an error affects substantial rights if it was prejudicial in that it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.id.at citing olano,at.it is the defendant burden to establish that the error prejudiced the jury verdict.id.still,e ven if the defendant establishes the existence of plain error,rule b leaves to the sound discretion of the court of appeals the decision whether to correct the error.while the court of appeals has the authority to order correction when these elements are met,it is not required to do so.id.
the district court charged the jury on the definition of official act as follows 
an official act means any decision or act or any question or matter which at any time may be pending or which may by law be brought before any public official in his or her capacity or in his or her place of trust.the term quote,official act,includes the decisions or actions generally expected of a public official.these decisions or actions do not need to be specifically described in any law,rule or job description to be considered an quote,official act,end quote.official acts that violate an official duty also are not limited to those within the official specific authority.
app.at emphasis added.
the relevant statute defines official act as 
any decision or action on any question,matter,cause,suit,proceeding or controversy,which may at any time be pending,or which may by law be brought before any public official,in such official official capacity,or in such official place of trust or profit.
a emphasis added.the error,ozcelik claims,is that the district court improperly substituted the words in his or her capacity for the statutory language,in such official official capacity.he argues that the substitution eliminated the requirement that he needed to take action in his official capacity and instead implied that he only had to take action in some unspecified capacity.
the government contends that the omission of the word official was the stenographer error,and that at trial the court read the instruction containing the word official.indeed,the government filed a motion to correct the record in the district court,arguing that in fact,the court had used the word official before capacity when it charged the jury.the court concluded,based upon the testimony of the court stenographer,that there was a reasonable probability that there had been a mistake in the transcript.in addition,the written copy of the instructions the court gave the jurors contained the word official and the court had no recollection of omitting the word official.
we defer to the district court conclusion that it did read to the jury the word official.moreover,the jurors had copies of the instructions that contained the word official.ozcelik has not met his burden of showing that the alleged error substantially affected the outcome of the proceedings 
sufficiency of evidence on count 
in his motion for judgment of acquittal,ozcelik argued that the government failed to prove that he attempted to conceal,harbor,or shield from detection an illegal alien.the district court denied that motion,concluding that ozcelik had taken substantial steps to conceal tuncer because he told him to stay low key for months and not to go left and right a lot.app.at.ozcelik raises the same issue on appeal,arguing that his conduct,telling tuncer to keep a low profile and not draw attention to himself,and stating that it was good that he lived at a different address than that on file with the ins,does not constitute harboring,concealing,or shielding under.the government responds that ozcelik general advice to tuncer substantially facilitated tuncer remaining in the united states illegally,and therefore constitutes shielding,harboring,and concealing under.
the question of what conduct constitutes shielding,harboring,and concealing within the meaning of is an issue of first impression in this court.the statute,a a iii,provides,in relevant part 
any person who knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has come to,entered,or remains in the united states in violation of law,conceals,harbors,or shields from detection,or attempts to conceal,harbor,or shield from detection,such alien in any place,including any building or any means of transportation shall be punished 
tuncer was an illegal alien in the united states.he testified at ozcelik trial that he had remained in the united states in violation of the terms of his student visa.in addition,ozcelik did not contest that he knew that tuncer was an illegal alien.indeed,at ozcelik trial tuncer testified that he had told ozcelik that he remained in the united states in violation of the terms of his student visa.thus,the only issue on appeal is whether ozcelik conduct towards tuncer constituted concealing,harboring,shielding,or attempting to conceal,harbor,or shield.it is an issue that has occupied the attention of several appellate courts.
the original version of the statute prohibited only the smuggling or unlawful bringing of aliens into the united states.see united states lopez,cir.in,the statute was amended to add concealing or harboring as a crime,but no punishment attached to concealing or harboring,only to smuggling.id.in united states evans,the supreme court discussed the legislative history of a prior version of,then.the court stated that the section as originally enacted was limited to acts of smuggling.and there is some evidence in the legislative history that the addition of concealing or harboring was meant to be limited to those acts only when closely connected with bringing in or landing,so as to make a chain of offenses consisting of successive stages in the smuggling process.id.at.but,the court noted,the evidence was not conclusive regarding congress intent as to the construction of the version of the statute it could be construed to criminalize as a separate offense,distinct from smuggling,the act of harboring or concealing an alien remaining in the country illegally.id.the version of the statute was at issue in evans.significantly,congress amended the statute after the decision in evans.the congressional debates focused on the necessity of a statutory prohibition for those who wilfully and knowingly conceal or harbor an illegal alien,such as those who provide shelter for aliens.lopez,at.
congress amended the statute in by means of public law,which applied a penalty to as well as to the act of smuggling.the relevant provisions of the statute provided any person who willfully or knowingly conceals,harbors,or shields from detection,or attempts to conceal,harbor,or shield from detection,in any place,including any building or any means or sic transportation shall be punished by a fine not exceeding or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years,or both,
