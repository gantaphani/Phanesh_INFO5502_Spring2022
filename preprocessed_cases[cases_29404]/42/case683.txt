petitioner luis estuardo vanegas ramirez was arrested and detained for removal from the united states during an early morning raid by federal agents,which uncovered evidence of vanegas ramirez guatemalan citizenship.after being transferred from new york,where he had been residing,vanegas ramirez was scheduled to appear for removal proceedings in texas.vanegas ramirez moved to change the venue of the removal proceedings to new york.in his motion,vanegas ramirez voluntarily conceded his removability from the united states 
vanegas ramirez venue change motion was granted,and the removal proceedings against him were transferred to new york.during these proceedings,vanegas ramirez i moved to suppress all evidence of his removability,including the concessions of removability that he had made in his venue change motion,and to terminate these proceedings,both on the basis that the raid by federal agents violated the fourth and fifth amendments the suppression motion and ii applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture cat the asylum application.the immigration judge the ij denied both vanegas ramirez suppression motion and asylum application,and the board of immigration appeals the bia substantially affirmed.vanegas ramirez now petitions us to review the bia decision or,more accurately,the agency decision 
in considering the petition,we revisit an important legal question if the government initiates proceedings to remove an alien from the united states following an egregious fourth amendment violation,do the alien concessions of removability made during the removal proceedings constitute independent,or sufficiently attenuated,evidence of removability that is admissible in these proceedings,or do they constitute inadmissible fruit of the illegal search and seizure in this case,we affirm the principle that where,as here,an alien voluntarily,not under compulsion of law,concedes facts supporting his removability,such concessions constitute independently admissible removability evidence,notwithstanding the allegedly egregious and illegal search and seizure that led to the initiation of the removal proceedings.see katris ins,f d,cir per curiam avila gallegos ins,cir la franca ins,cir.
for the reasons set forth below,we deny vanegas ramirez petition to review the agency decision.
i.the government raid filing of removal proceedings 
on september,vanegas ramirez was temporarily staying with his relatives at a house in levittown,new york according to vanegas ramirez,at approximately am,agents from the federal bureau of investigation and immigration and customs enforcement ice raided the house.
vanegas ramirez testified that,upon entering the house the agents began searching the rooms.during the search,the agents barged through the closed door of vanegas ramirez room,ordered vanegas ramirez to freeze,and interrogated him for minutes at gunpoint.the agents brought vanegas ramirez out to the living room,where they were questioning other occupants of the house.an ice agent informed vanegas ramirez that he and two other occupants were being arrested for lack of documentation.vanegas ramirez,at some point,presented and then surrendered to the agents his guatemalan consular identification card.
the same day,ice agents arrested vanegas ramirez and transported him to their field office in new york city for processing.at that time,an agent,using a interpreter,read vanegas ramirez his miranda rights and took his sworn statement,which indicated,among other things,that vanegas ramirez i was a citizen of guatemala and ii had entered the united states in or about july,near the phoenix,az border illegally and without at.vanegas ramirez was eventually transported from new york to ice detention centers in texas.
on october,dhs filed a notice for vanegas ramirez to appear for removal proceedings before ij eleazar tovar ij tovar in texas in the notice,dhs alleged,among other things,that vanegas ramirez was a citizen of guatemala and not the united states,and that he had come to this country at a time or place other than as designated by the attorney general.id.at.ij tovar thereafter arranged for a master to be held on december.
on october,however,dhs released vanegas ramirez from detention on a bond,whereupon he moved back to his residence in uniondale,new york.
ii.venue change motion 
on november,vanegas ramirez moved to change the venue of the removal proceedings from texas to new york.as part of his motion,vanegas ramirez attached a declaration,in which,among other things,he conceded his removability by acknowledging that he was a native and citizen of guatemala and not a citizen of the united states,and that he had not been inspected or paroled by an immigration officer at the time that he entered the united states.id.at.indeed,vanegas ramirez explicitly conceded his removability 
i admit that i am removable from the united states under section a a i of the immigration and nationality act,as amended,in that i am an alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled,or who arrived in the united states at any time or place other than as designated by the attorney general.
id.emphasis added vanegas ramirez signed and certified that the statements contained in his declaration were true.
on december,ij tovar ordered the transfer of the removal proceedings against vanegas ramirez to new york without a hearing.these proceedings ultimately came before ij philip morace ij morace in new york.
iii.suppression motion 
on july,vanegas ramirez filed the suppression motion,alleging that the government raid was an egregious violation of the fourth and fifth amendments and,thus,required ij morace to exclude all evidence of vanegas ramirez removability and terminate his removal proceedings 
on may,a hearing on the suppression motion was held.at the hearing,counsel for vanegas ramirez argued that the evidence that was obtained concerning vanegas ramirez status was basically a fruit of the poisonous tree,based on the government raid and the fact that anything else that followed after that was the result of egregious circumstances.id.at.
ij morace orally denied the suppression motion on two separate grounds i the government raid was not such an egregious violation of,what he termed,fundamental fairness and ii notwithstanding the egregiousness issue,vanegas ramirez declaration to his venue change motion furnished evidence of removability that was independent from the government raid.id.at.
iv.asylum application 
on july,vanegas ramirez filed the application for asylum and withholding of removal based on an alleged fear of persecution for his membership in a particular social group,the vanegas family,and for cat protection.
according to vanegas ramirez,his father,carlos vanegas carlos,was targeted by two groups in guatemala i a vengeful prisoner named manuel,whom carlos had put behind bars in melchor de mencos,and manuel family and ii covetous merchants in guatemala city,whose businesses competed with carlos.
with respect to the prisoner,manuel,and manuel family,vanegas ramirez alleged that 
in,there was a single incident in melchor de mencos,where the same man that my father arrested,manuel,following his release,stabbed carlos at a party,and another partygoer killed manuel 
manuel family blamed carlos for the death of manuel,and set out to find,but never actually attempted to take revenge against,the vanegas family 
in,the vanegas family moved to jutiapa to get away from manuel family and,after several years of hiding,carlos started his own business in guatemala city 
later,in,several individuals,who carlos believes were members of manuel family,beat carlos at a bus station,poisoned him,and put him in a coma and 
friends of the vanegas family told them that manuel family is still inquiring about our whereabouts back in melchor de mencos.
with respect to the other merchants,vanegas ramirez alleged that 
the other merchants became jealous of carlos business in guatemala city and 
in the beginning of,carlos was robbed and nearly killed by two individuals at his business,w hen his problems with the other merchants began.
at the may,hearing on the asylum application,vanegasramirez further alleged that the same groups that had targeted carlos would likely try to kill him,if they come looking for me.id.at emphasis added.at the conclusion of the hearing,ij morace orally denied vanegas ramirez requests for asylum and withholding of removal,stating that vanegas ramirez testimony,while credible,lacked sufficient details and specifics about his alleged persecutors to establish a fear of being persecuted for membership in the vanegas family,and that the documentary evidence that vanegas ramirez submitted in support of his testimony was very sparse.id.at.ij morace also denied vanegas ramirez request for cat protection.
v.the bia decision 
on february,the bia affirmed ij morace may,decision denying the suppression motion,on the ground that vanegas ramirez declaration in support of his venue change motion independently established his removability.the bia accordingly declined to reach the issue of whether the government raid was egregious.
the bia also affirmed ij morace may,decision to deny the asylum application on both grounds relied upon by the ij,that vanegas ramirez had not testified in sufficient factual detail to prove his entitlement to such relief,and that he failed to provide enough documentary evidence to support his requests for relief.
discussion 
standard of review 
it is that we review the factual findings of the agency for substantial evidence.it is equally that,on appeal,issues of law are reviewed de novo.almeida amaral gonzales,cir citations omitted.while this court has eschewed precise formulations of the substantial evidence standard for reviewing the agency factual findings,it has suggested that this standard is equal to,or stricter than,the clear error standard for reviewing a district court factual findings.mei chai ye dep t of justice,cir see also b b t he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.
ii.denial of the suppression motion 
the main issue on appeal is the agency denial of the suppression motion based on the admissibility of vanegas ramirez concessions of removability in his venue change motion as independent evidence vanegas ramirez contends now,as he did before the agency,that his concessions of removability were inadmissible as fruit of an illegal search and seizure by the government.we need not reach the issue of whether vanegas ramirez has established an egregious fourth amendment violation,because,even assuming so for the sake of argument,his argument must be rejected based on this court clear precedent and the facts before us.
in lopez mendoza,the supreme court held that the exclusionary rule,applied in criminal proceedings,does not apply in civil removal proceedings.at.the court,however,in dicta,suggested that removability evidence is subject to exclusion if it stems from egregious violations of fourth amendment or other liberties.id.at emphasis added at the same time,the court also suggested that,regardless of how the arrest is effected,the removal of an individual could still be supported by otherwise admissible evidence not derived directly from,but rather gathered independently of,or sufficiently attenuated from,the arrest.id.at emphases added.
recently,this court,in pretzantzin,addressed the issue of independent,or sufficiently attenuated,evidence in removal proceedings.at.the removability evidence at issue in pretzantzin was birth certificates and arrest records for the petitioners,which the government had acquired from the united states embassy and municipal transit police department,after raiding the petitioners home.id.at.this court held that,if the nighttime,warrantless raid of a home were an egregious fourth amendment violation,evidence come at by exploitation of that illegality would have to be excluded.id.at,quoting wong sun united states,internal quotation marks omitted.such evidence would include not only evidence obtained during the violation itself,but evidence obtained based on other information obtained during the violation.id.at accordingly,this court found that the bia erred by admitting the petitioners birth certificates and arrest records as independent evidence,absent proof that the government had procured the evidence using only their names and nothing else from the raid.id.
pretzantzin,however,is distinguishable from this case.vanegasramirez concessions of removability did not derive from the exploitation of the presumptively illegal government raid,pretzantzin,at,but,rather,from the mere fact that the raid had occurred,lopez mendoza,at.vanegas ramirez concessions of removability,while obtained during removal proceedings commenced after the unlawful raid,were not obtained using other information obtained during the raid instead,the concessions were the product of a tactical decision by vanegas ramirez to avoid a hearing on his venue change motion.
in making his venue change motion,vanegas ramirez was only required to i establish good cause for granting the motion,and ii identify his fixed street address,including city,state and zip code,where he may be reached for further hearing notification.b,c.to establish good cause,vanegas ramirez could have cited any number of the following discretionary factors administrative convenience,his residence,the location of witnesses,evidence and counsel,expeditious treatment of the case,and the cost of transporting witnesses and evidence to a new location.lovell,at.removability was not one of these factors.
as vanegas ramirez counsel acknowledged to us at oral argument,vanegas ramirez was not legally required to concede removability as part of his venue change motion,but did so believing it would increase the likelihood of his motion being granted without a hearing.in re velasquez,at noting that admissions of fact and concession of deportability in the motion for change of venue are a tactical decision,and conceding removability could heighten the chance that the government would not oppose a change of venue gawel ins,wl,at cir,unpublished suggesting that concessions of removability in a venue change motion might indirectly show the ij that removal proceedings would be expeditious and not impose a burdensome cost of transporting evidence and witnesses to otherwise prove removability.in short,there was no legal requirement,only a strategic choice,for vanegas ramirez to concede his removability.consequently,the concern in pretzantzin about the admission of evidence directly derived from an egregious fourth amendment violation is not present here 
in contrast to pretzantzin,three decisions from this court katris,avila gallegos,and la franca are on all fours with this case in that trio of cases,this court held that an alien voluntary concessions of removability during his removal proceedings are admissible as independent evidence,notwithstanding the fact that these proceedings resulted from unlawful arrests.see katris,at rejecting the petitioner argument that evidence obtained following his unlawful arrest,including his statements at the deportation hearing,should be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree,because the illegality d id not void a subsequent deportation order based on the alien admission of his status at the hearing emphasis added avila gallegos,at holding that,r egardless of the legality of the petitioner arrest,his deportation hearing testimony about the illegal manner of his entry was admissible and,indeed,proved his deportability la franca,at finding that the agency properly refused to reopen the petitioner deportation hearing,based,in part,on the fact that,even assuming the unlawfulness of his arrest,it relied upon the concession of deportability by his counsel at the hearing and not any statements taken or evidence seized at the time of his arrest that is because these concessions are not fruit of the illegality,but of an intervening act of free will,an alien own choice to concede his removability.katris,at,internal quotation marks omitted.it is this intervening act that purge s the primary taint.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the same reasoning applies here,and di
