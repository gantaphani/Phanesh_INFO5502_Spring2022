earl woodrow gallimore petitions this court to review a final order of removal issued by the board of immigration appeals bia.after finding gallimore removable,an immigration judge ij concluded that he is ineligible by law to receive a discretionary waiver of removal.gallimore appealed to the bia,challenging only the ij waiver determination.the bia affirmed on alternative grounds that it raised sua sponte,and this petition followed.we will grant the petition and remand to the bia for further proceedings.
gallimore is a native and citizen of jamaica.he entered the united states on august,pursuant to a valid visa.on september,while driving on a new jersey roadway with a female companion,police officers stopped gallimore and recovered five pounds of marijuana from the vehicle.gallimore was detained and questioned,and although he claims that he did not know he had been formally arrested,he appears to have spent three or four days in custody.joint appendix ja.on december,a grand jury returned a sealed indictment against gallimore,charging him with,inter alia,possession with intent to distribute five pounds or more of marijuana,in violation of stat.ann.a and b b.ja.gallimore claims that he was not aware of the indictment at the time it was returned.
on january,gallimore married a united states citizen.on april,he and his wife filed a joint petition and application for an adjustment of status,seeking that he be reclassified as a lawful permanent resident lpr.on the form that gallimore completed,he answered no to the following question have you ever,in or outside the,been arrested,cited,charged,indicted,fined,or imprisoned for breaking or violating any law or ordinance ja.he answered similarly during an interview in support of the application.on july,the immigration and naturalization service ins approved the application and adjusted gallimore status to lpr on a conditional basis.see 
on november,gallimore was arrested on the indictment.he claims that this was the first time he learned of the drug charges against him.though he originally pleaded not guilty,gallimore ultimately reversed course and entered a guilty plea on march.ja.he was sentenced to time days,which included the three or four days he appears to have served after being detained in september.ja.
on april,gallimore and his wife filed a petition to have the conditions on his lpr status removed.ja.on the form filed in support of the petition,he answered no to the following question since becoming a conditional resident,have you ever been arrested,cited,charged,indicted,convicted,fined,or imprisoned for breaking or violating any law or ordinance ja.gallimore claims that his wife completed the form without knowing about his conviction.he admits,however,that he signed the form.the ins approved the petition on august.ja.
five years later,on december,gallimore applied for naturalization.ja.for the first time,he disclosed on the citizenship application his arrest,his conviction,and his sentence.ja.on july,because of the conviction and his previous failure to disclose it,gallimore application for citizenship was denied for poor moral character.
on april,united states citizenship and immigration services cis issued gallimore a notice to appear nta and later supplemented it,charging him as removable pursuant to three statutory provisions of the immigration and nationality act ina,codified at,et.first,the nta charged gallimore as removable under a a for being,at the time of or adjustment of status,within a class of inadmissible aliens.specifically,the nta alleged that gallimore was inadmissible under a c i for having engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation of a material fact to obtain admission,documentation,or other benefit under the ina.second,the nta charged gallimore as removable under a a iii for having been convicted of an aggravated felony.third,the nta charged gallimore as removable under a b i for having been convicted of a qualifying controlled substance violation.ja 
regarding the first charge of removability,the amended nta alleged 
you procured your admission,visa,adjustment,or other documentation or benefit by fraud or by willfully misrepresenting a material fact,to wit you failed to admit,on your application that was submitted on and while being questioned under oath by a service officer on,and on your form that was executed by you on april,to your prior drug trafficking activities that occurred on december,as is evidenced by an indictment against you and your admission of guilt before the new jersey superior court to a charge in that indictment.those misrepresentations were made by you in order to have the service grant you permanent resident status.
ja.gallimore denied removability and the factual allegations supporting the charges.he also applied for cancellation of removal,waiver of removal,and termination or closure of the proceedings.the ij held five days of removal proceedings,during which gallimore testified.among other things,he claimed that he had been detained for only one and or two hours on september,and that he did not understand at the time that he had been arrested.ja.
in an oral opinion,the ij found that the government had proved by clear and convincing evidence that gallimore was removable on all three charged grounds.ja.with respect to the charge of removability based on gallimore misrepresentations,the ij found that he had willfully failed to disclose his arrest on both the form and the form,and during his june,interview.ja.she found further that gallimore had willfully failed to mention the conviction on the form submitted to remove the conditions on his lpr status.id.the ij rejected gallimore intimation that anyone other than himself bore responsibility for these omissions.ja.the ij concluded that gallimore had made the misrepresentations so he could maintain his eligibility for these application s because clearly if he had revealed th e conviction he would not have been eligible for the benefits he was seeking.id.she was not persuaded by gallimore testimony that he was the innocent dupe in all of these filings with false information.ja.
turning to gallimore requested bases for relief from removal,the ij denied termination and administrative closure of the removal proceedings.ja.she also pretermitted his application for cancellation of removal,as b c clearly rendered him ineligible for such relief.ja.central to this ij held that gallimore was not eligible for a waiver under former ina c because he did not obtain his permanent residence without willfully misrepresenting a material fact.ja.citing matter of t,bia,the ij concluded that gallimore had never been lawfully admitted as a lawful permanent resident a necessary prerequisite for c he had obtained his original status adjustment through willful misrepresentation.ja.the ij therefore denied the waiver application and issued an order of removal.ja.
gallimore timely appealed to the bia,challenging only the ij waiver analysis.the bia affirmed the ij order on alternative grounds and dismissed the appeal.ja.the bia agreed with the ij ultimate conclusion that gallimore had not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence under c,and that he was therefore ineligible for a waiver.but it did so on the basis that his conviction alone precluded such relief.without referencing gallimore initial status adjustment,the bia explained 
t he respondent drug conviction clearly rendered him inadmissible to the united states under a a i ii as it then existed.this inadmissibility rendered the respondent statutorily ineligible for adjustment of status because it precluded him from demonstrating that he was admissible to the united states for permanent residence,as required by a thus,although the respondent status was adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident in in compliance with procedural formalities,he was never lawfully admitted for permanent residence within the meaning of former c of the act because at the time of adjustment he could not satisfy the substantive legal requirements associated with that status.
ja.in support of its explanation,the bia cited decisions from the courts of appeals for the second,fifth,eighth,ninth,and eleventh circuits,as well as two of its own decisions.ja.given its holding,the bia specifically declined to review the ij analysis regarding gallimore alleged misrepresentations,again omitting mention of his status adjustment 
because the respondent drug conviction was sufficient,without more,to preclude his adjustment of status from being considered lawful within the meaning of former c,we need not decide at this time whether,at the time of his adjustment,the respondent was also inadmissible for willfully misrepresenting a material fact.
ja.gallimore then filed this petition for review 
gallimore argues that the bia erred when it held that his conviction alone rendered him ineligible for discretionary relief under ina c.because the bia analysis in all likelihood rests on an historically inaccurate premise,it can not stand.alternatively,to the extent that one can glean from the bia opinion an interpretation theoretically supporting its disposition,we hold that the bia opinion fails adequately to explain its reasoning and,in any event,appears incorrect as a matter of law.whatever the case,the bia opinion is insufficient to support its dismissal of gallimore appeal.we will therefore grant the petition and remand the matter to the bia for further proceedings.
an alien may obtain lpr status under the ina by virtue of his marriage to a citizen of the united states.pursuant to,that status is conditional for the first two years of the marriage.see vasquez holder,cir gonzales,cir per curiam.subparagraph a provides that an alien spouse shall be considered,at the time of obtaining the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,to have obtained such status on a conditional basis subject to the provisions of this section.a.the purpose of this scheme is obvious to ferret out sham marriages entered into for the purpose of obtaining entry into the united states.see,at see also carpio holder,cir congress passed the immigration marriage fraud amendments imfa containing,which sought to deter fraud by aliens seeking to acquire lawful permanent residence in the united states based on marriage to united states citizens or lawful permanent resident aliens.choin mukasey,cir the purpose of the imfa was to deter marriage fraud and other immigration fraud.citation omitted.
under,if at any time before the second anniversary of the alien having obtained conditional lpr status,the attorney general learns that the marriage was fraudulent or has been annulled or terminated,the attorney general shall terminate the permanent resident status of the alien as of the date of the determination.b.termination of conditional permanent resident status renders the alien removable.a d i.
in order to have the conditions removed,the alien and must file a joint petition stating that the marriage,in sum and substance,was not entered into for the purpose of gaining the alien entry as an immigrant,at see also c a,d.this petition must be filed during the period before the second anniversary of the alien admission as a conditional lpr.d a.the statute requires the alien and the to appear for an interview with cis,but the attorney general may waive that requirement.see c b,d b.upon verification that the facts in the petition are true,the attorney general shall remove the conditional basis of the alien status effective as of the second anniversary of the alien obtaining the status of lawful admission for permanent residence.c b see also vasquez,at choin,at 
if a conditional lpr fails to file a timely petition for removal of the conditions,or fails to appear for an interview,the attorney general ordinarily must terminate the alien conditional lpr status as of the second anniversary that status was obtained.c see also vasquez,at.section contains no provision,however,requiring the attorney general to terminate an alien conditional status upon the commission of a criminal offense.additionally,the conditions imposed by from the formalities to which we have restrict the rights nor expand the obligations of a conditional lpr.the attorney general,in fact,has promulgated regulations stating that,except where otherwise specified,conditional lprs enjoy the same rights and privileges as those lprs whose status is not conditional.see generally.
before its repeal by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,stat,ina c permitted certain immigrants found deportable on the basis of a criminal offense to apply for discretionary as waiver from deportation.see ponnapula ashcroft,cir.section c stated in pertinent part aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years,may be admitted in the discretion of the attorney general c.though this provision literally applied only to exclusion proceedings when lprs returned from abroad,judicial and administrative interpretations extended its protection to deportation proceedings as well.see ins cyr,atkinson att y,cir matter of silva,bia.
despite iirira repeal of c,the supreme court held in cyr that discretionary relief under c remains available for aliens whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who would have been eligible for c relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.at.it is undisputed that gallimore satisfies the first portion of this standard,as he pleaded guilty before iirira became effective.but to be eligible for a waiver,gallimore must also have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.this is the overarching issue before us.
an alien who becomes an lpr through fraud has not been lawfully admitted for c purposes.matter of t,at.this is so because t he term lawfully denotes compliance with substantive legal requirements,not mere procedural regularity in re longstaff,cir see also gonzales,cir bia precedent holds that aliens are ineligible for waiver where they have acquired permanent resident status by fraud or misrepresentation,because they have not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.citing in re koloamatangi,bia biggs ins,cir.
thus,an alien whose status has been adjusted to who is subsequently determined to have obtained that status adjustment through not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence because the alien is deemed,ab initio,never to have obtained lpr status.koloamatangi,at.such an alien,therefore,is ineligible for c relief.as set out above,the ij in this case found that gallimore had obtained his lpr status by willfully misrepresenting or omitting his arrest and conviction on multiple occasions,and therefore concluded that he was ineligible for c relief because his status adjustment had not been lawful.
the reasoning of matter of t and koloamatangi has been extended to situations outside of fraud and misrepresentation.koloamatangi,at t he term lawfully admitted for permanent residence d oes not apply to aliens who had obtained their permanent resident status by fraud,or had otherwise not been entitled to it.emphasis added.where an alien obtains lpr status through administrative being ineligible for that status for one reason or of our sister courts of appeals have deferred to bia decisions concluding that the alien has not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.as we have explained,the bia affirmed the ij decision on this alternative basis.specifically,it held that even though gallimore application for status adjustment had been approved in,his conviction rendered him legally ineligible for it because the conviction rendered him inadmissible at that time.thus,reasoned the bia,irrespective of any material misrepresentations he may or may not have made,gallimore status adjustment had not been lawful,thereby destroying his eligibility for c relief.
gallimore does not we are in complete agreement fundamental reasoning of the fraud line of cases koloamatangi and matter of t and the application of that reasoning to what we shall refer to as cases.the agency determination that one does not lawfully obtain lpr status through fraud is certainly a reasonable interpretation of c and that statutory analysis is entitled to deference.further,we discern no principled distinction between finding a status adjustment not lawful because the applicant procured it through fraud and finding a status adjustment not lawful because the applicant was not legally entitled to it for any other reason.
accordingly,we defer to the bia interpretation of c that an alien whose status has been adjusted to lawful permanent resident but who is subsequently determined in an immigration proceeding to have originally been ineligible for that status has not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.de la rosa dhs,cir per curiam citing koloamatangi,at.in doing so,we join the decisions of our sister circuits,which have uniformly adopted the same definition of the phrase lawfully admitted for permanent residence either by finding that the phrase is unambiguous or by granting deference to the bia interpretation.id.citations omitted.
that is not,however,the end of the matter.though gallimore does not attack the reasoning of the cases,he challenges their applicability here.his argument is one of timing.id.at t o be lawfully admitted for permanent residence an alien must have complied with the substantive legal requirements in place at the time she was admitted for permanent residence.emphasis added.factually,this case is unlike any other we have cited,because here there are two points in time potentially relevant to whether and when gallimore was lawfully admitted for permanent residence.these two dates,moreover,straddle the date of the potentially disqualifying conviction.upon marrying a united states citizen in,gallimore obtain ed the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,yet that status by law was considered to be on a conditional basis until the conditions were removed in.a.in the interim,in,gallimore was convicted on the drug charges.
the question,then,is in what year was gallimore status adjusted properly or improperly to that of lawfully admitted for permanent residence was it in,when he first was admitted as a conditional permanent resident or was it in,when the conditions were removed if is the relevant date,then gallimore would not be ineligible for c relief for the reasons stated by the bia.this would be so because he had not yet been convicted in and,as of that date,he otherwise appeared to be in compliance with all relevant legal requirements necessary to obtain permanent resident status conversely,if is the relevant date,then the bia application of the cases will carry the day.
the ina defines the phrase lawfully admitted for permanent residence as the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the united states as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws,such status not having changed.a in support of the bia disposition,the attorney general argues that gallimore can not be said to have been accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the united states in because his status was then subject to conditions.
before addressing the attorney general particular argument in support of the bia opinion,we focus on the opinion itself.the bia applied the cases sua sponte,and in doing so did not explain why a conditional permanent resident has not the time conditional status initially is obtained a definition of lawfully admitted for permanent residence.in fact,what little explanation the bia did provide strongly suggests that it did not consider the issue at all.instead,it appears far more likely that the bia simply overlooked the fact that gallimore status initially had been adjusted pursuant to in.consequently,we believe the bia failed to recognize the relevance of that date,and that that failure tainted its entire legal analysis.
the bia twice elaboration and in contrast to the ij explicit recognition that gallimore status was adjusted to that of lawful permanent resident on july,that his status was adjusted in.more importantly,the bia did not so much as mention.we would expect that if the bia was interpreting whether an alien admitted under is categorically ineligible for a waiver during the conditional period,the agency would have at least cited.instead,the bia cited only a requiring that an alien be admissible at the time of obtaining lpr concluded that gallimore could not satisfy this criterion because his conviction rendered him inadmissible in.but if gallimore had already been admitted in,a determination that he would otherwise have been inadmissible in would have no practical significance.by concluding that gallimore was inadmissible in without acknowledging that he had been admitted conditionally in when he ostensibly was admissible,the bia appears to have mistakenly assumed as fact that was the only year relevant to gallimore eligibility for c relief.
the attorney general proclaims baldly that the bia interpretation that gallimore would not have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence until,when his conditions were removed,is entitled to chevron deference.att y br.at.but if the bia simply overlooked the fact that gallimore status was adjusted pursuant to in we strongly suspect is the are not entitled to sustain its decision on grounds the attorney general articulates ex post.see ro ins,cir a bia decision can be affirmed only on the basis articulated in the decision.accord moret karn,cir a court must evaluate the propriety of an agency action solely on the grounds invoked by the agency in its initial determination.if those grounds are inadequate or improper,the agency action must be set aside.accordingly,our belief that the bia analysis proceeded on a critically inaccurate factual assumption compels us to grant gallimore petition and remand the case for further consideration by the bia.
we can not conclude with certainty,however,that the bia did not consider the interplay between and c.we think it appropriate,therefore,to address the attorney general a conditional lpr is ineligible for c relief so long as his status remains conditional,because he has not yet achieved the privilege of residing permanently in the united states and thus has not been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
as an initial matter,if the bia did indeed interpret and c in the manner that the attorney general now suggests,it did so sub silentio,precluding us from engaging in meaningful review.while we give deference to the decisions of the bia we can not give meaningful review to a decision in which the bia does not explain how it came to its conclusion.awolesi ashcroft,cir here,the bia failure to explain its interpretation if any handicaps entirely our ability to review it for reasonableness.
to the extent one can intuit from the bia opinion an interpretation that conditional permanent residents are ineligible for c relief unless and until the conditions have been removed,that conclusion runs headlong into the plain language of and its accompanying regulations.this language it does not foreclose attorney general claim that gallimore had not been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the united states in,before his conviction.
section,as we have noted,provides that a conditional permanent resident is one who has obtain ed the status of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.emphasis added.it is true that such status is deemed conditional,perhaps suggesting that a conditional lpr is not literally entitled to reside permanently in the united states so long as the conditions remain in place.the american heritage dictionary of the english language,ed,available at http last visited july,defining permanent in part as n ot expected to change in status,condition,or place.
but other language in undercuts decisively a literal interpretation of the word permanently as applied to the residence status of conditional lprs.specifically,the provision governing removal of an alien conditions provides that the conditions are to be removed effective as of the second anniversary of the alien obtaining the status of lawful admission for permanent residence.c b emphasis added.if the conditions are to be removed on the second anniversary of
