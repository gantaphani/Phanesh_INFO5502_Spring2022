petitioner cristian guzman appeals from a ruling by the board of immigration appeals bia that the rule,as enacted by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,div,stat.iirira effective april,was not impermissibly retroactive as applied to his criminal offense.the bia rejected petitioner argument that the application of the rule poses a new disability on his past conduct.for the reasons set forth below,we will affirm.
background 
petitioner is a year old citizen of the dominican republic.he was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident on october,and has continually resided here since that time.a little more than a year after his admission,new york city police arrested petitioner and charged him with criminal possession of a controlled substance,in violation of new york law.petitioner pled guilty to a lesser possession charge on december,and he was sentenced to three years probation.in,new york city police again arrested and charged petitioner with criminal possession of a controlled substance in violation of new york law.petitioner pled guilty and,on december,was sentenced to time served 
the department of homeland security dhs took custody of petitioner and served him with a notice to appear nta for removal proceedings on march,based on his conviction pursuant to immigration and nationality act ina a b i,which authorized removal of 
any alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of or a conspiracy or attempt to violate any law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title,other than a single offense involving possession for one own use of grams or less of marijuana,is deportable.
a i.notably,although iirira made various changes to the immigration laws,the same basis for removal appeared in law as well,which would likewise have rendered petitioner removable for his offense.see a i repealed using the term entry in place of admission.however,the removal proceedings in were based on his,not his,conviction.
statutory framework 
prior to the passage of iirira,an alien in removal proceedings could apply for a discretionary waiver of deportation,known as a c waiver if he could show seven years continuous presence,and that he had not been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies for which a term of imprisonment of at least five years had been imposed.ina c,c repealed perez elwood,cir.iirira repealed this provision and replaced it with a similar procedure known as cancellation of removal.to be eligible for cancellation of removal,a legal permanent resident alien must be lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than years,have resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status,and not have been convicted of an aggravated felony.a.
however,iirira also mandated a new scheme for calculating an alien period of continuous residence,whereby any period of continuous residence or continuous physical presence in the united states shall be deemed to end when the alien has committed an offense referred to in section a of this title that renders the alien removable from the united states.d b.this is commonly known as the rule.briseno flores att y of,cir.
petitioner removal proceedings and the immigration judge decision 
petitioner appeared before an immigration judge ij,conceded removability as charged,and submitted an application for cancellation of removal.the government argued that he was ineligible for this form of relief due to the rule,which stopped his accrual of the requisite seven years presence required for cancellation of removal upon the commission of his drug offense in.petitioner argued that application of the rule of iirira to render him ineligible for cancellation of removal due to his offense would have an impermissibly retroactive effect.while he acknowledged that the offense rendered him immediately deportable with no opportunity for relief because he had been in the country for only one year at the time,petitioner nonetheless argued that he could have tried to delay his deportation proceedings until he accrued the requisite seven years lawful continuous presence to become eligible for discretionary waiver under former ina c.petitioner argued that this strategy was available to aliens prior to the passage of iirira,and the fact that this opportunity was no longer available to him constituted a new disability,which,under landgraf usi film products,would make its application to him impermissibly retroactive.petitioner also urged that retroactive application of the rule was arbitrary and capricious in that it punished lawful permanent residents who committed crimes within seven years of their admission,whereas residents who had accrued seven years presence before committing qualifying offenses were not subject to the rule.additionally,petitioner asked to be able to terminate his removal proceedings in order to pursue naturalization 
the ij held a hearing on february,at the conclusion of which she rendered an oral decision denying petitioner motion to continue or terminate his proceedings and finding petitioner ineligible for cancellation of removal because his offense stopped his accrual of continuous presence pursuant to the rule.the ij found that the rule itself was not arbitrary and capricious under judulang holder.the ij denied petitioner motion to terminate proceedings to pursue a naturalization application for lack of an affirmative communication from dhs regarding petitioner prima facie eligibility for naturalization,as required by the bia decision in in re acosta hidalgo,bia.
petitioner proceedings before the bia and the bia decision 
petitioner raised the same arguments before the bia,and also urged that the ij erred in not permitting him to concurrently apply for both a c waiver and cancellation of removal.the bia affirmed the ij decision.it held that petitioner controlled substance offense stopped his accrual of continuous presence short of the requisite seven years for purposes of cancellation of removal.the bia explained that the rule imposed no new disability on petitioner because the offense rendered him immediately deportable with no possibility of relief had he been placed in deportation proceedings at that time,prior to the passage of iirira,because he lacked the requisite seven years continuous presence for a c waiver.the bia reasoned that a t the time of petitioner conviction in,he was immediately amenable to deportation from this country under law.petitioner options were therefore no different,and the application of iirira rule to him was not impermissibly retroactive.
the bia also rejected petitioner contention that he should have been permitted to simultaneously apply for a c waiver and cancellation of removal.it observed that c explicitly precludes an alien from applying for both c waiver and cancellation of removal and that,even if he could obtain a c waiver notwithstanding his conviction,the conviction would still be deemed to have ended petitioner period of continuous residence for purposes of cancellation of removal because the granting of c relief does not serve to universally pardon,expunge,or eliminate all negative immigration consequences stemming from an alien criminal conviction.id.
in addition,the bia ruled that the ij properly declined to terminate petitioner removal proceedings under f because he failed to attempt to obtain an affirmative communication from the dhs addressing his prima facie eligibility for naturalization.
arguments on appeal 
on appeal,petitioner repeats the same arguments that the bia rejected.relying on cyr,he argues that an alien making the decision to forego his right to trial and plead guilty,like the petitioner in cyr,does so assuming the state of the law of the time when petitioner pled guilty to a deportable offense in,he expected to retain the possibility of obtaining a c waiver from deportation in the future,namely,after being in the country for an additional six years.he urges that applying the rule of iirira to conduct forecloses that possibility and is therefore impermissibly retroactive.petitioner urges that,but for the rule,he would have accrued the seven years requisite presence needed for either type of removal pre and prior to his offense.accordingly,he contends,the stoptime rule should not apply to him.
in the alternative,petitioner argues that the bia wrongly affirmed the ij decision not to terminate removal proceedings to allow him to make a prima facie case of eligibility for naturalization pursuant to f,based on the fact that he did not have an affirmative communication from the dhs indicating such eligibility as the regulation at issue states that an alien must make a prima facie case of eligibility for naturalization,the bia decision in in re acosta hidalgo,which interpreted this regulation to require a communication from the dhs establishing such eligibility,does not comport with the text of the regulation and deprives petitioner of the opportunity to do what the regulation says,establish his prima facie eligibility to the court.
the government argues that no genuine issue of retroactivity is presented here,as petitioner removal proceedings are predicated on his offense,which postdates iirira.since cancellation of removal under iirira did not exist at the time of petitioner conviction,he had no right to it then,and since petitioner does not meet the requirements for cancellation of removal,he has no right to it now.in the alternative,the government argues that we should follow the fifth circuit reasoning in heaven gonzales,cir,and hold that,even if the rule is being applied retroactively here,such application is not impermissibly retroactive.petitioner controlled substance offense rendered him immediately deportable without eligibility for relief under c and,as such,application of the rule created no new disability because d eportation is the consequence he receives upon retroactive application of the rule just as it is the consequence he would have received immediately in following his criminal conduct.brief for respondent at quoting martinez,cir.the government adds congress certainly has never invested petitioner with a substantive right to purposefully delay his proceedings or created a settled expectation of benefiting from delays in the administrative process.brief for respondent at citing cyr,at

discussion 
petitioner has not previously disputed,nor does he now,that both his and offenses rendered him removable when committed.rather,he disputes the application of a provision of iirira,the rule,which precludes aliens who have committed deportable offenses from being spared deportation if they have accrued seven years of continuous presence in the united states,as that ability existed under law.the crux of petitioner argument as it was before the ij and the bia is that the application of the rule to his offense to disqualify him from cancellation of removal relief is impermissibly retroactive because it imposes a new disability on him for conduct that iirira.specifically,he has been deprived of the opportunity to delay deportation proceedings while accumulating the continuous seven years presence required for discretionary relief from removal,an opportunity he had when he pled to his offense.applying the rule of iirira,enacted in,disqualified him from any such relief.as we have never written precedentially on the issue of whether the stoptime rule should apply retroactively,we do so here.
statutory framework prior and subsequent to iirira 
as noted above,under the immigration laws in effect in november,when petitioner committed his first drug offense,legal permanent residents who were subject to deportation,but who had resided in the united states for seven consecutive years,were eligible to apply for a discretionary waiver of deportation under ina c.see c repealed the decision of whether to award section c relief involved only a balancing of the adverse factors evidencing an alien undesirability as a permanent resident with the social and humane considerations presented in his behalf to determine whether the granting of a section c waiver appear ed in the best interests of this country.martinez,at internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original quoting kai tung chan gantner.cir.notably,although the decision to grant a c waiver was a discretionary one,a substantial percentage of applications were granted.cyr,at noting that between and,over section c waiver applications were granted.
a lawful permanent resident in deportation proceedings could seek a discretionary waiver of deportation under former ina c,if he could show seven consecutive years of lawful continuous physical presence and that he had not been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies for which a term of imprisonment of at least five years had been imposed.perez,at.aliens accrued time toward continuous residence and physical presence requirements until they applied for relief.martinez,at.often,an alien would manage to delay his removal process in order to accumulate seven years presence,which was one of the reasons congress passed iirira.id.this delay strategy was the exact abuse of the system congress intended to correct in iirira by eliminating section c,replacing it with cancellation of removal,and enacting the rule.arca pineda att y of the,cir citing.i in re mendoza sandino,b ia same.
iirira,which was enacted on september,and went into effect on april,eliminated the c waiver,and replaced it with cancellation of removal,ina a.under ina a,a legal permanent resident must satisfy three conditions to qualify for cancellation of removal relief the alien must have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence for not less than years,must have resided in the united states continuously for years after having been admitted in any status,and must not have been convicted of any aggravated felony.a.in addition to instituting this new cancellation of removal scheme,iirira established a new rule in ina d for calculating an alien period of continuous residence or physical presence.the accrual of continuous presence for purposes of the seven years terminates when the alien has committed an offense that renders the alien inadmissible to the united states under section a of this title or removable from the united states under section a or a of this title,whichever is earliest.d b.once the period of continuous residence is terminated,it is not restarted by subsequent events.briseno flores,at.
retroactive application of the stop time rule,ina d 
in landgraf usi film products,the supreme court confirmed the longstanding presumption against retroactive legislation,emphasizing that e lementary considerations of fairness dictate that individuals should have an opportunity to know what the law is and to conform their conduct accordingly settled expectations should not be lightly disrupted.at.at the same time,the court acknowledged that congress has the power,within constitutional limits,to enact laws with retroactive effect.the landgraf court articulated a test for determining when a statute could be applied retroactively.under the first step,the court must ascertain whether congress has expressly prescribed the statute proper reach.id.at.if the answer is yes,the inquiry ends there.if,however,the statute contains no such express command,the court must move to the second step and decide whether the application of the statute would have an impermissibly retroactive effect,that is,the court must assess whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.id.at.a statute is impermissibly retroactive if it takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws,or creates a new obligation,imposes a new duty,or attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past.id.at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.
congress was silent with respect to the retroactive application of the rule,while it expressly mandated the retroactive application of certain other provisions of iirira.for example,in the transitional rules,congress expressly mandated that the rule applied retroactively to applications for suspension of deportation that were pending at the time of iirira enactment.briseno flores,at.it also expressly mandated the retroactive application of the expanded definition of aggravated felony.see iirira b,stat.at notwithstanding any other provision of law including any effective date,the term aggravated felony applies regardless of whether the conviction was entered before,on,or after september.see also cyr,at.in contrast,the text of d says nothing whatsoever about retroactive application.therefore,we have no trouble concluding that it is ambiguous,and an analysis of whether the application of the rule is impermissibly retroactive under step two of landgraf is appropriate here.
we disagree with the government that this case presents no issue of retroactivity at all.our focus is not merely on the date of the offense that served as the basis for removal and the law in effect at that time.rather,our focus is broader.as the court reasoned in cyr,the fact that deportation is not punishment for past crimes does not mean that we can not consider an alien reasonable reliance on the continued availability of discretionary relief from deportation when deciding whether the elimination of such relief has retroactive effect.id.at.the application of a provision,namely,the rule,to alter the availability of certain relief based on conduct that took place clearly has a retroactive effect.the issue is whether such effect is impermissibly retroactive.
this brings us to step two of landgraf.as noted above,the rule is impermissibly retroactive if it attaches new legal consequences to events completed before the enactment of iirira,that is,if it takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws,or creates a new obligation,imposes a new duty,or attaches a new disability,in respect to transactions or considerations already past.at internal quotation marks omitted quoting soc y for propagation of the gospel wheeler,cas,story.we note that while the inquiry may be broad,the application under step two is very.in cyr,the supreme court held impermissible the retroactive application of the rule to an alien who had accrued seven years presence prior to iirira but whose removal proceedings did not commence until after the passage of iirira because his right to a c waiver had vested before the passage of the new law.at.cyr had pled guilty to a removable offense,foregoing his right to a trial,under the assumption that the consequence of doing so at the time would not disqualify him from c relief.id.at.iirira replaced c waiver with cancellation of removal and disqualified cyr from removal relief based on the type of offense he had committed.the court held that the application of iirira to cyr created a new disability,defining it as the elimination of any possibility of c relief for people who entered into plea agreements with the expectation that they would be eligible for such relief.id.at.the court reasoned that the quid pro quo nature of plea agreements and the attendant waiver of some constitutional rights by a defendant,particularly when immigration status is at stake,dictates that attaching new legal consequences or a new disability namely,elimination of the availability of c relief would amount to an impermissible retroactive application.id.accordingly,the court held that the section c waiver remains available for aliens whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who,notwithstanding those convictions,would have been eligible for c relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.id.at.
similarly,in sinotes cruz gonzales,the court of appeals for the ninth circuit held that the rule of iirira was impermissibly retroactive when applied to stop an alien accrual of seven years continuous residence when based on a conviction,obtained pursuant to a guilty plea,for a crime that did not render an alien deportable at the time of the plea,cir.in si pled guilty to two counts of attempted aggravated assault.id.at.the court found it undisputed that at the time of his plea,his conviction did not render him deportable.id.citing a a i.iirira reclassified his crime,making him deportable for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude,committed within five years of admission,for which a sentence of a year or longer could have been imposed.id.similar to petitioner case,dhs commenced removal proceedings against si based on a deportable offense he committed after iirira passage.id.at.although si had accrued the requisite seven years continuous presence before iirira passage,the government argued that his time should be stopped on the date of his conviction,which iirira reclassified as a crime of moral turpitude.the court held that the retroactive application of the rule to si conviction was impermissible under the second step of the landgraf analysis,reasoning that he had,in pleading guilty,given up valuable rights,including the right to go to trial,in the justifiable expectation that his plea would have no effect on his immigration status.id.at.
cyr and sinotes cruz are different from the instant case in two important respects.first,while iirira reclassified the crimes that the petitioners in cyr and sinotes cruz committed so as to produce harsher effects,no such reclassification took place here.petitioner offense rendered him deportable and ineligible for c relief,because he had not accrued seven years continuous residence.iirira did not reclassify this offense or change it in any way.a controlled substance offense rendered an alien deportable in,just as it would today,and eligible for removal relief provided the alien has accrued seven years continuous residence,just as it would today.
second,in both cyr and sinotes cruz,the petitioners had accrued the requisite seven years continuous presence to be eligible for c relief prior to the passage of iirira.they pled guilty to a crime under the reasonable assumption that doing so would not affect their immigration status.their eligibility for c relief had vested prior to the time that iirira changed the rules,replacing c with the stricter cancellation of removal procedure.the same is not true in petitioner case.at the time of his conviction,petitioner had been residing in the united states for only a year.when iirira was passed in,taking effect in,petitioner had not come close to accruing the seven years continuous presence required for c relief.he had no vested right because he was ineligible for any form of removal relief when iirira was passed,and is ineligible for any form of removal relief today because the rule disqualifies him.there have been no new legal consequences imposed on petitioner as a result of the application of the rule.cyr,at.
petitioner situation is much more akin to that of the petitioners in martinez and heaven.in martinez,the court of appeals for the second circuit held that the rule did not have an impermissible retroactive effect when applied to an alien deportable drug offense,committed prior to the passage of iirira,to prevent him from obtaining cancellation of removal for a deportable crime committed after the passage of iirira.at.the court reasoned that if the alien had been captured and successfully prosecuted for his crime and the ins had obtained a deportation order promptly after he committed the offense,he could have been deported without the possibility of relief because he would not,at the time,have accrued the seven years required by the repealed ina c.id.at.essentially,iirira,as applied to petitioner here,did not change the consequence of his criminal act.id.at.similarly in heaven the court of appeals for the fifth circuit applied the rule retroactively to an alien who had
