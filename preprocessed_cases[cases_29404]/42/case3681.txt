thomas mielewczyk petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia dismissal of his appeal from the immigration judge ij order of removal.the bia and the ij found mielewczyk removable due to his prior state conviction under california health and safety code section a for offering to transport heroin.we must decide whether mielewczyk section a conviction is a violation of any law or regulation of a state relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title,rendering him removable under a b i.because the statute of conviction by its own terms is a state law relating to a controlled substance,and mielewczyk conviction involved heroin,a controlled substance as defined in,we hold that the bia correctly found mielewczyk removable and deny his petition.
factual and procedural background 
mielewczyk is a native and citizen of poland who was admitted to the united states as a refugee on june,at the age of thirteen.on october,he received a waiver of criminal grounds for inadmissibility and readjusted his status to lawful permanent residency.
on july,mielewczyk was charged by information with two felony counts under california law.count one alleged possession for sale of a controlled substance,in violation of health and safety code section,a felony.count two alleged to sell controlled substance,in violation of health and safety code section a,a felony.both counts alleged that the crimes involved a controlled substance,to wit,heroin.
mielewczyk signed a plea agreement that declared he was accused of possession of heroin for sale and transportation of heroin.he pleaded guilty to count two,charging a violation of california health and safety code section a,for the offense of transportation of heroin for personal use.mielewczyk was sentenced to one hundred days in county jail and months of probation.later,at a hearing to correct its prior order,the california superior court issued a nunc pro tunc order,finding that the factual basis for mielewczyk plea was offering to transport a controlled substance for the codefendant within the meaning of of the health and safety code as a felony.
the department of homeland security served mielewczyk with a notice to appear before an ij for a removal proceeding.the ij found mielewczyk removable as charged under a b i,because his section a conviction for offering to transport heroin was a violation of a state law relating to a controlled substance.the ij denied mielewczyk application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture,as well as his request for voluntary departure.
the bia also concluded that mielewczyk was convicted of a removable offense,affirmed the ij decision,and dismissed mielewczyk appeal.mielewczyk timely petition for review raises the sole issue of whether a conviction under california health and safety code section a for offering to transport a controlled substance constitutes a removable offense pursuant to a b i.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction under a d to review questions of law when a final order of removal is predicated on a criminal offense.see de jesus melendez gonzales,cir.whether a particular conviction is a removable offense is a question of law we review de novo.ins,cir.therefore,we review de novo the bia legal conclusion that a state conviction renders an alien removable under a b i.see id.our review is limited to the grounds relied upon by the bia.andia ashcroft,cir per curiam.
iii.discussion 
categorical approach 
to determine whether a conviction constitutes a predicate offense for removal purposes,we use the analytical model constructed by the supreme court in taylor united states,d.united states,cir en banc,superseded on other grounds by cmt,as recognized in united states,cir.we first apply the categorical approach,examining only the statutory definition of the crime to determine whether the state statute of conviction renders an alien removable under the statute of removal.tokatly ashcroft,cir.
under a b i,an alien is removable if that alien is convicted of a violation of or a conspiracy or attempt to violate any law or regulation of a state,the united states,or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance as defined in section of title.the operative statutory phrase,relating to a controlled substance,modifies law or regulation.see united states,cir.the ordinary meaning of the term relate is to show or establish a logical or causal connection between.webster new international dictionary ed.thus,we look to the language of the statute of conviction to determine whether it establishes a logical or causal connection to a controlled substance as defined in,section of the controlled substances act csa.
california health and safety code section a provides that 
every person who transports,imports into this state,sells,furnishes,administers,or gives away,or offers to transport,import into this state,sell,furnish,administer,or give away,or attempts to import into this state or transport certain substances specified within the california uniform controlled substances act shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for three,four,or five years.
the plain language of the statute establishes a logical connection between the law and certain controlled substances because the offense must involve one of the listed controlled substances.even offenses that do not require personal contact with the drug have the requisite connection because we have construed the relating to language broadly,to incorporate laws specifically aimed at controlled substance activity,even if they do not require the use,possession,transportation,or sale of controlled substances,at.
section a does not,however,categorically establish a logical connection to a controlled substance as defined in section of the csa.section of the csa defines controlled substances as those substances listed in the federal schedules of the csa.in contrast,california health and safety code section a punishes activities involving controlled substances specified in the schedules of the california uniform controlled substances act.see cal.health safety code a.the california uniform controlled substances act defines controlled substance to include numerous substances that are not similarly regulated by the csa.gonzales,cir.because the statutory definition of the crime in section a embraces activity related to drugs both listed in the csa and not listed in the csa,an alien convicted under this statute is not categorically removable under a b i.
modified categorical approach 
we therefore turn to the modified categorical approach to determine mielewczyk removability under a b i.see,at.under this approach,we determine whether a conviction constitutes a predicate offense for removal by examining a narrow,specified set of documents that are part of the record of conviction,including the indictment,the judgment of conviction,jury instructions,a signed guilty plea,or the transcript from the plea proceedings.tokatly,at quoting,at.the government has the burden to prove that the conviction involved a substance that is not only listed under california law,but also contained in the federal schedules of the csa,at.
here,the charging document and plea agreement in the administrative record establish that mielewczyk offense involved heroin,a drug listed in schedule i of the csa.see c listing h eroin.mielewczyk argues that the government can not prove that his conviction involves a federally controlled substance because the california superior court nunc pro tunc order,stating that mielewczyk pleaded guilty to offering to transport a controlled substance for the codefendant,does not specify the controlled substance involved.however,the order silence as to the drug of conviction does not limit our ability to examine other documents in the record of conviction to determine whether the offense involved a drug covered by the federal definition of a controlled substance.because the charging document and the plea agreement establish that the crime involved heroin,the government has met its burden to prove that mielewczyk conviction involved a substance listed in t
