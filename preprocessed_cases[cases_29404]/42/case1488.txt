opinion of the court 
in this appeal,we consider the applicability to petitions for habeas corpus filed pursuant to of both the gatekeeping mechanism by which b limits the filing of second or successive petitions for habeas corpus,and the abuse of the writ doctrine as expressed in the supreme court decision in mccleskey zant,d.we will affirm the district court decision dismissing the petition of appellant raniel perez zayas for abuse of the writ.
factual and procedural background 
raniel perez zayas is a cuban citizen who was paroled into the united states in at the age of two,pursuant to d of the immigration and nationality act ina,d in he acquired permanent resident status retroactive to.on march,zayas was convicted in new york state supreme court,queens county,of two felony offenses attempted robbery in the second degree and criminal sale of cocaine in the fifth degree.he was sentenced to a prison term of one and years to four years.
as a consequence of the conviction for the sale of cocaine,zayas was ordered on january,by the immigration and naturalization service ins to show cause why he should not be deported.on january,he filed an application for relief under c of the ina,c repealed effective april.section c authorized the attorney general to admit,in his or her discretion,an otherwise deportable alien who had established lawful domicile in the united states for seven or more years.such relief was unavailable under the statute if the alien had committed two or more crimes of moral turpitude aliens who were faced with deportation solely on account of having committed a drug offense were eligible for relief 
zayas deportation hearing was scheduled for april,however,due to an intervening arrest and conviction on february,for attempted robbery in the second degree,his immigration case was administratively closed pending his release from state custody.the hearing was rescheduled and held on january.
at the hearing,zayas conceded the truth of all the allegations contained in the order to show cause,and again applied to the immigration judge ij for waiver of inadmissibility under c.a few months earlier,congress had enacted the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat.section d of aedpa amended c of the ina so as to render ineligible for discretionary relief an alien who had been convicted of various drug offenses,including the one for which zayas had been adjudged guilty in.in his january,decision,the ij denied zayas application for c relief and ordered zayas deported to cuba.
the deadline for seeking board of immigration appeals bia review of the ij deportation order was february.and acting pro a perfected appeal challenging the ij decision.with respect to the c issue he wrote 
my case and my petition for waiver preceeds the new laws 
at this time,my waiver for is pending and i made this fact known to the immigration judge 
the language describing who may be eligible for waiver states that a permanent resident or green card holder who has been in the for at least seven years at the time of filing must be considered.section f when the description given is held in comparison to the circumstances of my case then,there can be no question that i am a suitable candidate for some form of waiver.
i must reiterate that i already have an application for pending with the and this information alone should have resulted in the immigration judge staying and or postponing any further action on my case until such time that as a final disposition regarding my waiver is handed down.
the united states constitution promises under the fourteenth amendment which in fact guarantees equal protection to aliens and citizens alike not only has the spirit of the amendment been broken but,in the partial manner in which the judge decided this,the actual letter of the law is being blatantly broken as well 
furthermore,i file d an order to show cause and the accompanying waiver on the ins and the attorney general office dated,and there has been no disposition as of yet both the show cause and the waiver were file d years before any of the recent changes in the ina law went into effect.
according to zayas,he mailed his notice of appeal from prison on february,two days before the february filing deadline however,zayas appeal was not received by the bia until february.the bia dismissed the appeal as untimely on april,
subsequent to the bia dismissal of his appeal,zayas filed a series of habeas corpus petitions.acting pro se,zayas filed two habeas petitions in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania.
in the first petition,filed on june,zayas argued that his indefinite detention pending deportation was unlawful.in a report and recommendation,magistrate judge rapoport found zayas to be in error regarding the applicable law,and recommended that the petition be denied and dismissed.judge reed approved and adopted the report and recommendation on october.
zayas second habeas petition was filed on june.magistrate judge rapoport filed a report and recommendation in which he found that zayas had raised essentially the same issues as he had in the first petition,and that zayas petition should therefore be dismissed.again judge reed adopted the report and recommendation and dismissed the second habeas petition on august.
meanwhile,on july,zayas had filed with this court a petition styled motion for review.in this submission,zayas asked this court to review a decision by the ins district director denying zayas release from detention the ins subsequently moved to dismiss the motion for review.on march,this court denied the motion to dismiss and ordered that the motion for review and an accompanying motion for appointment of counsel be transferred to the district court for the middle district of pennsylvania the district in which zayas was in custody,instructing that the matter be treated as a petition for habeas corpus under.
the grievance that zayas had pressed in his first two habeas wit,his claim that his indefinite detention was resolved on june,when he was released from ins custody on bond pending his removal to cuba.upon his release,zayas moved to dismiss the habeas petition that had its genesis as a motion for review,and which was by that time pending in the middle district.the district court granted zayas motion and dismissed the petition on july.
on july,day after filing in this court the motion for review challenging his continued detention,but several months before the motion for review was transferred by this court to the middle filed in the middle district a new habeas petition under.in this petition,zayas did not raise the indefinite detention issue which he had sought to present in the two eastern district habeas petitions and which,in a later context,was the subject of the motion for review.instead,he sought judiciary review,based on a determination that he is eligible for relief from deportation under section c of the immigration and nationality act a reprise of the issue zayas had attempted to present in the appeal dismissed by the bia as untimely.in his report and recommendation,magistrate judge durkin concluded that the new petition should be dismissed on two alternative grounds.
first,he found zayas petition to be a second or successive petition which can only be filed in a district court if the court of appeals has granted permission for such filing.in his report and recommendation,magistrate judge durkin summarized the process as follows 
p ursuant to b a,prior to filing a second or successive petition,a petitioner must move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.pursuant to b,in order for the court of appeals to grant such an application,it must find that the claim presented in the second or successive petition relies on a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable,or that the factual predicate for the claim could not have been discovered previously through the exercise of due diligence and that the facts underlying the claim,if proven and viewed in the light of the evidence as a whole,would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that,but for constitutional error,no reasonable fact finder would have found the petitioner guilty of the underlying offense 
second,magistrate judge durkin found that zayas was raising a procedural due process claim,and was therefore required to exhaust administrative remedies as required by the ina,d,and that zayas failure to perfect his appeal before the bia constituted a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.on april,judge caputo adopted magistrate judge durkin report and recommendation,but with certain modifications.first,judge caputo considered the applicability of the gatekeeping mechanism of b to habeas petitions filed pursuant to.relying on decisions of the seventh circuit,valona united states,cir,and the ninth circuit,barapind reno,cir,judge caputo concluded that petitions were not subject to b gatekeeping regime.
having concluded that b was inapplicable,judge caputo noted that the petition does raise an issue which could have been raised in his first petition.with matters in this posture,judge caputo concluded that the petition should be considered in the context of the supreme court decision of mccleskey zant,d for abusing the writ.judge caputo determined that zayas was presenting in his middle district petition an,a contention that the restrictions of the aedpa should not have been retroactively applied that could have been raised in his first habeas petition in the eastern district,that zayas had failed to show any cause,prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice for failing to include that argument in his first petition,and hence that the middle district petition had to be dismissed for abuse of the writ.
judge caputo also found that the middle district petition raised procedural due process questions and was therefore subject to dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
the dismissal of zayas middle district petition has given rise to the current appeal.
ii.standard of review 
until a decade ago,the legal principles comprising the doctrine of abuse of the writ were a somewhat amorphous melange of statutes and case law,and administration of the doctrine was primarily committed to the sound discretion of the federal trial judges.sanders united states,d.in we point out infra,in part iii of this doctrine of abuse of the writ underwent a in mccleskey zant,d,the supreme court reformulated the doctrine,replac ing the nebulous and discretionary ends of justice standard with the more concretely defined cause and prejudice standard borrowed from procedural default law,a standard that is an objective one which clarifies the imprecise contours of the test that the district courts are to apply.macklin singletary.the mccleskey reformulation led the eleventh circuit,in macklin,to reexamine at some length the appropriate standard of appellate review of district court decisions relating to claims of abuse of the writ.the eleventh circuit,in an opinion by judge carnes,concluded that in this era,the abuse of the writ doctrine presents objective,threshold questions involving the application of law to facts.we review district court rulings on such issues not under an abuse of discretion standard,but de novo.at.
we agree with judge carnes thoughtful analysis.
iii.discussion 
primary federal habeas corpus statute,zadvydas davis,d is the vehicle by which an alien who is in custody may seek judicial review of ins actions that affect the alien status.ins cyr,d chmakov blackman,cir liang ins,cir.
in zayas middle district petition,he sought to present the argument that,because his immigration case was already pending as of the passage of aedpa,his eligibility for c relief was not affected by aedpa.said zayas t he retroactivity and the restrictions of the aedpa is no longer permitted to proceedings before its enactment citing cases,including sandoval reno,cir.this argument is an elaboration of the argument zayas attempted to present to the bia in the pro se appeal rejected as untimely however,the argument was not mentioned in either of the two eastern district petitions for habeas corpus.that it went unmentioned in the second eastern district petition is notable because the second petition was filed five months after this court decision in sandoval reno.in sandoval,we held that aedpa d,which had the effect of amending c to bar persons convicted of drug offenses from discretionary relief,was not applicable to cases pending on the date of the statute enactment.at cyr,at.
although the government in this case has accepted the ruling of sandoval with respect to the retroactivity issue,the merits of zayas argument concerning the availability of c relief from his deportation order are not under consideration at issue is zayas entitlement to make the argument in his middle district petition for habeas corpus.
since zayas has previously filed two habeas petitions in the eastern district that have not presented the c issue,the government contends that the district court was correct in dismissing the habeas petition filed in the middle district.in the district court,the government relied on b,the aedpa gatekeeping mechanism that requires one who seeks to file a second or successive petition in a district court under to first obtain the permission of the court of appeals,and,in the alternative,the abuse of the writ case law embodied in mccleskey zant,d.in this court,the government has refrained from contesting judge caputo conclusion that the b gatekeeping regime does not govern habeas petitions filed under but the government supports judge caputo further by mccleskey abuse of the writ jurisprudence is applicable to,and operates to bar,zayas petition.
to understand what congress,in,sought to do in enacting b,one must start with mccleskey,decided five years before.in mccleskey,the supreme court comprehensively addressed the problem of abuse of the writ presented by sequential habeas filings.the court undertook to analyze,and to integrate into a systematic whole,the habeas statutes and rules and the court own principal prior case discussions of abuse of the writ.the court announced the following formulation 
when a prisoner files a second or subsequent application,the government bears the burden of pleading abuse of the writ.the government satisfies this burden if,with clarity and particularity,it notes petitioner prior writ history,identifies the claims that appear for the first time,and alleges that petitioner has abused the writ.the burden to disprove abuse then becomes petitioner.to excuse his failure to raise the claim earlier,he must show cause for failing to raise it and prejudice therefrom as those concepts have been defined in our procedural default decisions.the petitioner opportunity to meet the burden of cause and prejudice will not include an evidentiary hearing if the district court determines as a matter of law that petitioner can not satisfy the standard.if petitioner can not show cause,the failure to raise the claim in an earlier petition may nonetheless be excused if he or she can show that a fundamental miscarriage of justice would result from a failure to entertain the claim.
in,in aedpa,congress,concerned that successive habeas petitions filed in federal district courts still seemed to frustrate finality in the criminal process,amended so as to impose tighter constraints than mccleskey on habeas petitioners invoking to present collateral challenges to state criminal convictions.under b as amended,a claim presented in a second or successive habeas corpus application under section that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed,b,and a second or successive habeas corpus application under section presenting a claim not asserted in a prior habeas petition is subject to dismissal by the district court,b,unless the proposed petition has been submitted to,and found acceptable by,the court of appeals,b.a court of appeals permission to file is in turn dependent on the petitioner making a prima facie showing that the petition is keyed to a new rule of constitutional law announced,and stated to be retroactive,by the supreme court,b
