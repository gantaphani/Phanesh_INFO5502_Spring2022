at common law,a person could be convicted of perjury when,under oath,he wilfully and corruptly gave false testimony on a material point in a judicial proceeding.wharton crim.law,westlaw database updated see also in re h,bia.today,many states have adopted expanded definitions of perjury that include false statements made in depositions,declarations,and other proceedings.california penal code section is one such general perjury statute.see witkin epstein.law,ed.california supplement s section with several,or special,perjury statutes,including financial code section prohibiting as perjury intentional false statements in bank reports and government code section prohibiting as perjury false statements made by a public officer while taking the oath of office.id.
within this complex framework,milton bladimir rosales rivera,a citizen of el salvador,pled no contest to a charge under section later,in removal proceedings,the immigration judge ij and the board of immigration appeals bia ruled that this conviction was a crime involving moral turpitude cimt and therefore disqualified rosales rivera from obtaining cancellation of removal.the first issue in this proceeding is whether section is categorically a cimt.because we determine that it is not,we proceed to consider whether section is divisible.we find that section criminalizes two distinct offenses written and oral perjury.finally,applying the modified categorical approach,we hold that rosales rivera offense of conviction written perjury is not a cimt.we therefore grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.
we note that whether section is a cimt is a different question from whether perjury,generally,is a cimt.we recognize that historically common law perjury was considered to be a cimt,but,as we will explain,both section as a whole and the specific offense of written perjury criminalize significantly more conduct than common law perjury.moreover,in focusing on section alone,we leave the rest of california perjury framework untouched.california special perjury statutes,for instance,have distinct elements and therefore require an entirely separate cimt analysis from the one we undertake here.
rosales rivera is a citizen of el salvador who first came to the united states in.he has a son who is a united states citizen.he admits he is present in the united states without having been admitted,paroled,or inspected by an immigration officer,the basis for removal that the department of homeland security dhs cited in its notice to appear.see a a i.rosales rivera may be entitled to cancellation of removal under u.b due to his son citizenship,but conviction of a cimt would bar such relief.b c.
on december,in the county of san bernardino superior court,rosales rivera was charged with perjury application for driver license in violation of california penal code section.he pled no contest to the felony charge,and was sentenced to days in the county jail.
dhs initiated removal proceedings against rosales rivera.the ij ordered rosales rivera removed.in doing so,she concluded that a conviction under section is clearly a crime involving moral turpitude,and therefore rosales rivera was ineligible for cancellation of removal under b.the bia,citing to in re martinez recinos,bia,affirmed the ij decision.in summary fashion,it reasoned that rosales rivera provided no arguments supporting a realistic probability that california would apply its perjury statute to prosecute conduct which was not morally turpitudinous.the bia also noted that the criminal complaint indicated that rosales rivera committed his offense by providing false information to the state of california when he applied for a driver license,and that crimes with fraud as an element are categorically cimts.
rosales rivera timely filed a petition for review.b.we have no jurisdiction to review a final order removing an alien on account of a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude.nevertheless,we have jurisdiction to review the bia determination that rosales rivera conviction is,in fact,a cimt.marmolejo campos holder,cir en banc citing a c see also a d.
in marmolejo campos,we established a framework for evaluating whether a conviction is categorically a cimt.at.in the first step,we must identify the elements of the petitioner statute of conviction,reviewing de novo the bia analysis.id.at.
the second step requires determining whether the petitioner offense is a cimt.id.we employ the categorical approach,as described below,to assess whether a statute of conviction is a cimt.blanco mukasey,cir.to make this determination,we compare the elements of the statute of conviction to the generic definition of a cimt to decide whether the conviction meets that definition.castrijon garcia holder,cir.we rely on our own generalized definition of moral turpitude,which divides almost all cimts into two basic types those involving fraud and those involving grave acts of baseness or depravity.marmolejo campos,at quoting carty ashcroft,cir.
in determining whether the statute of conviction fits categorically within our general definition of moral turpitude,some deference to the bia may be warranted.ordinarily,where the bia determines that certain conduct is morally turpitudinous in a precedential decision,we apply deference regardless of whether the order under review is the precedential decision itself or a subsequent unpublished order that relies upon it.id.at.otherwise,deference applies.id.at.here,as noted above,the bia cited to a published decision,martinez recinos,in which the bia stated without analysis that the respondent aggravated felony offense under california penal code section was a cimt.at.nonetheless,we conclude that the bia decision does not warrant chevron deference because martinez recinos provided no reasoned explanation for its conclusion.
in chevron,the supreme court contemplated an agency engaging in the process of informed rulemaking by consider ing varying interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis.chevron,at.in the immigration law context,the attorney general vested the bia with power to exercise the discretion and authority conferred upon the attorney general by law in the course of considering and determining cases before it.aguirre aguirre,quoting d.chevron deference applies to bia decisions because the bia gives ambiguous statutory terms concrete meaning through this process of adjudication.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
we have limited chevron deference to precedential bia decisions based on similar reasoning.the bia issues precedential decisions where it intend s to issue an interpretation of a statute it enforces.miranda alvarado gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also g.there are,however,rare instances where we withhold deference from precedential bia decisions,including where the bia has failed to provide an explanation for its action.marmolejo campos,at see also mellouli lynch,because it makes scant sense,the bia interpretation,we hold,is owed no deference under the doctrine described in chevron.
this case presents such a rare instance.in martinez recinos,the bia analysis focused on why section is an aggravated felony,without any explanation of why section is a cimt.i at.the only sentence concerning section status as a cimt is we concur with the ij that the respondent conviction under section is also a crime involving moral turpitude,which renders him inadmissible id.at.the decision contains no discussion of the elements required for a conviction under section,nor any explanation of why section constitutes a cimt under the bia definition or our definition of moral turpitude.see id.because the bia did not support its conclusion with any statutory interpretation or reasoning,we accord no deference to martinez recinos under chevron.
where chevron deference does not apply in the cimt context,skidmore deference does.marmolejo campos,at.under skidmore,the measure of deference afforded to the agency varies depend ing upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it the power to persuade,if lacking the power to control.id.quoting skidmore,at.here,the bia decision that section is a cimt is not entitled to skidmore deference because,as we explained,the bia in martinez recinos provided no reasoning whatsoever.see,castrijon garcia,at declin ing to grant deference under skidmore where there is no analysis at all.
as explained above,under the categorical approach,we must first interpret the statute of conviction to identify its essential elements.marmolejo campos,at.california penal code section provides 
a every person who,having taken an oath that he or she will testify,declare,depose,or certify truly before any competent tribunal,officer,or person,in any of the cases in which the oath may by law of the state of california be administered,willfully and contrary to the oath,states as true any material matter which he or she knows to be false,and every person who testifies,declares,deposes,or certifies under penalty of perjury in any of the cases in which the testimony,declarations,depositions,or certification is permitted by law of the state of california under penalty of perjury and willfully states as true any material matter which he or she knows to be false,is guilty of perjury.
as discussed below,infra part v,section criminalizes both written and oral perjury.in the case of a defendant who committed oral perjury,we have articulated the elements of this offense as a willful statement,under oath,of any material matter which the witness knows to be false.chein shumsky,cir quoting cabe.the model jury instructions for section explain that written perjury,by contrast,requires only that the false statement be in writing under penalty of perjury.see people hedgecock,cal d,cal explaining that california jury instruction criminal caljic sets forth the elements of written perjury.the requirements of willfulness and materiality are common to both perjury offenses.code.
the word willful simply means that the witness made the allegedly perjurious statement with the consciousness that it was false with the consciousness that he did not know that it was true and with the intent that it should be received as a statement of what was true in fact.people tolmachoff,d,see also people hagen,cal th,people viniegra,d.that the accused was not to give a false statement is not a defense to a charge of perjury under section.code.
a statement is material if the statement or testimony might have been used to affect the proceeding in or for which it was made,or if the statement could probably have influenced the outcome of the proceedings.people feinberg,quoting people kobrin,cal th,internal brackets in original,and people pierce,cal d.for example,testimony may be material if it has a tendency to impeach the credibility of a witness who testified on a material issue,even if the testimony is unrelated to the case itself.see people gamble,d.it is not a defense to perjury that the accused did not know the materiality of the false statement made it is sufficient that it was material.code.
people darcy illustrates the breadth of the materiality element.d,disapproved of on other grounds by murgia mun,cal d.there,the defendant stated under oath before a deputy registrar of voters that his name was sam darcy and that he was born in new york,even though his true name was samuel dardeck and he was born in the ukraine.id.at.darcy argued that it was immaterial whether he made false statements about his name and place of birth,as he could have registered to vote had he used his real name and given his correct place of birth.id.at.the court,however,reasoned that the false statements were material because the voting authorities were prevented from examining the father naturalization papers for the purpose of verifying darcy citizenship.id.at.indeed,one name and birthplace may serve as a basis for an investigation of qualifications of a person who registers,including citizenship.id.in sum,even though darcy would have been allowed to vote had he given his true name and true birthplace,his false statements under oath were material.
having identified the elements of the statute of conviction in the first step,we move to the second step,where we use the categorical approach to determine whether section is a cimt.almanza arenas lynch,cir en banc,opinion amended and superseded,cir,mendoza holder,cir fernandez ruiz gonzalez,cir citing taylor united states.
under the categorical approach,we compare the elements of the statute of conviction to the generic definition of moral turpitude to determine whether the conduct proscribed by the statute of conviction is broader than,and so does not categorically fall within,this generic definition.fernandez ruiz,at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.the issue is not whether the petitioner actual conduct constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude,but rather,whether the full range of conduct encompassed by the statute constitutes a crime of moral turpitude.id.quoting cuevas gaspar gonzales,cir.in other words,the key is elements,not facts.descamps united states.
when performing a categorical analysis,the court must presume that the conviction rested upon nothing more than the least of th e acts criminalized,and then determine whether even those acts are encompassed by the generic definition of moral turpitude.moncrieffe holder,quoting johnson united states,alterations in original.there must be a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that the state would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of moral turpitude.id.at quoting gonzales duenas alvarez,see also castrijon garcia,at.
crimes of moral turpitude are generally of two types those involving fraud and those involving grave acts of baseness or depravity.castrijon garcia,at.these two categories,however,are not exhaustive.common law perjury lying under oath during a judicial proceeding has historically been regarded as a cimt even though it does not fit neatly into the framework described below.we conclude that section goes well beyond common law perjury and that it categorically involves neither fraud nor grave acts of baseness or depravity 
at common law,a person committed perjury by giving false testimony under oath.see united states dunnigan.historically,and before the development of the cimt approach,courts held with little debate that common law perjury is a cimt.see,masaichi ono carr,cir it is not to be doubted that the commission of perjury before the immigration officials is a felony involving moral turpitude.ex rel.boraca schlotfeldt,cir that perjury is a crime involving moral turpitude,there can be no question,and the crime was completed when she made the false statement under oath.wharton supra explaining that a person committed perjury at common law when,under oath,he wilfully and corruptly gave false testimony on a material point in a judicial proceeding.this conclusion recognizes the implicit harm in obstructing justice and the formality inherent in taking an oral oath in a judicial proceeding.
the conduct prohibited by section extends far beyond the narrow meaning of common law perjury.not only does section reach past false testimony in the courtroom to related lying,it also punishes lies where no oral oath,with its requisite solemnity,was required of the speaker.section essentially creates a crime whenever a document must be signed under penalty of perjury,the penalty of perjury applies.thus,section does not fit within the historical understanding of perjury and can not be deemed a cimt on that basis.nor,as we demonstrate below,does it qualify as a cimt under the modern approach.
cimts generally involve base,vile,and depraved conduct that shocks the public conscience turijan holder,cir.the essence of moral turpitude is evil or malicious intent.gonzalez cervantes.holder,cir internal quotation marks omitted.crimes with such a mens rea offend the most fundamental values of society.robles urrea holder,cir.that an offense contravenes societal duties is not enough to make it a cimt otherwise,every crime would involve moral turpitude.id.internal quotation marks omitted.only truly unconscionable conduct surpasses the threshold of moral turpitude.id.at.
examples of cimts include offenses that necessarily inflict harm,gonzalezcervantes,at,listing several,as well as murder,rape,and incest,robles urrea,at.these and other cimts almost always involve an intent to harm someone,the actual infliction of harm upon someone,or an action that affects a protected class of victim.castrijon garcia,at.
section encompasses conduct that does not qualify as base,vile,and depraved behavior.that one need not be competent to give the false statement demonstrates that not all section convictions result from evil or malicious intent.see code gonzalez cervantes,at.similarly,the fact that lack of knowledge as to the false statement materiality is not a defense to conviction further demonstrates that not all conduct covered by section involves intent to harm someone.see code castrijon garcia,at.for example,a witness may not know that her testimony,which is unrelated to the case at issue,could impeach the credibility of another witness who testified on a material issue.see gamble,d at.such a witness may be convicted under section,even though the false statement is not made with evil or malicious intent.because section does not require the very essence of moral turpitude,gonzalez cervantes,at,it does not categorically qualify as a cimt.
furthermore,section does not categorically offend the most fundamental values of society,robles urrea,at,like murder,rape,incest,and offenses do.see id.at gonzalez cervantes,at.unlike these crimes,perjury does not necessarily involve intent to harm,actual infliction of harm,or an action that affects a protected class of victim.castrijon garcia,at.indeed,darcy,who gave a false birthplace and name when registering to vote and was convicted of perjury in california,intended no harm,inflicted no harm,and did not adversely affect a protected class of victims.see darcy,d.
in sum,we conclude that section is not categorically a cimt.
although section reaches beyond the narrow definition of common law perjury and is not categorically a cimt,it could categorically be a cimt if it required an intent to defraud or sounded in fraud.a crime involves fraudulent conduct,and thus is a crime involving moral turpitude,if intent to defraud is either explicit in the statutory definition of the crime or implicit in the nature of the crime.blanco,at quoting goldeshtein ins,cir.
first,the intent to defraud is not explicit in the statutory definition of section,especially in light of blanco.there,we held that california penal code section a false representation of identity to a peace officer to evade the process of the court,or to evade the proper identification of the person by the investigating officer was not a cimt.we explained that intent to defraud was not explicitly required because the statute require d only the knowing provision of false information.at.conviction required only that the forbidden act wa s done deliberately and with knowledge,and not that the individual act ed with evil intent.id.quoting hirsch ins,cir.similarly,intent to defraud is not required for conviction under section it requires only that the false statements have been made deliberately and with knowledge.see tolmachoff,d at explaining that a false statement under section must be made with the consciousness that it was false and with the intent that it should be received as a statement of what was true in fact judicial council of california criminal jury calcrim lacking any reference to an intent to defraud.because,like section a,section does not require proof of a specific intent to defraud,see people guasti,d,nor of intent to injur e another,darcy,d at,it does not explicitly require intent to defraud for cimt purposes.see blanco,at goldeshtein,at noting that this court has rejected the argument that evil intent exists if a conviction requires proof that a defendant did a forbidden act willfully hirsch,at holding that a federal statute prohibiting false statements was not a cimt because the jury could convict if it found that petitioner had knowingly but without evil intent,made a false but not fraudulent statement.
the converse proposition underscores the rule.we have held that particular statutes are cimts because the intent to defraud is explicit in the statutory definition.see,de martinez holder,cir holding that arizona revised statutes section a is a cimt because it is committed by assuming a false identity with the intent to defraud another planes holder,cir holding that it was reasonable for the bia to conclude that state convictions for passing a bad check with intent to defraud and possession of or more access devices with intent to defraud were cimts.section contains no such language.thus,we conclude that intent to defraud is not explicit in section.
conviction under section does require proof of intent that the false statement should be received as a statement of what was true in fact,tolmachoff,d at,but that requirement does not amount to an intent to defraud in this context.that an accused lack of knowledge as to the materiality of the false statement is not a defense to section,code,demonstrates that section punishes conduct that falls short of the evil intent required for a fraud offense to qualify as a cimt.blanco,at.
the next question is whether intent to defraud is implicit in the nature of section.blanco,at.i ntent to defraud is implicit in the nature of the crime when the individual makes false statements in order to procure something of value,either monetary or nonmonetary.id.because o ne can act dishonestly without seeking to induce reliance,fraudulent intent only exists when the individual employs false statements to obtain something tangible.id.fraud is thus distinguishable from mere dishonesty because fraud requires an attempt to induce another to act to his or her detriment.id.
our opinion in bisaillon hogan provides an example of where intent to defraud was not an explicit requirement for conviction,but this court nevertheless held that the crime was a cimt.cir.there,conviction under required willfully and knowingly mak ing any false statement in an application for passport with intent to induce and secure the issuance of a passport under the authority of the united states.id.at.we held that is a cimt in part because it requires the presence of intent to induce the issuance of the passports under authority of the united states.id.at section,unlike,does not implicate intent to defraud because it does not require procur ing something of value.blanco,at.section is thus overbroad when compared to this category of implicit crimes,because it does not require for conviction proof of attempt ing to induce another to act to his or her detriment or to obtain something tangible.id.thus,section does not fall within the category of cimts where intent to defraud is implicit in the nature of the crime.
there is a realistic probability,not a theoretical possibility,that california would apply section to conduct that falls outside all the established definitions of moral turpitude.moncrieffe.at.once again,the facts of people darcy provide a compelling example.as an initial matter,darcy conduct would not fall within the narrow meaning of common law perjury,which,as noted above,historically has been considered a cimt.further,darcy was convicted under section even though he did not commit a base or vile act,or one involving explicit or implicit fraud.providing a false name and birthplace when one is entitled to vote without the false statements does not implicate intent to harm,actual infliction of harm,or an action that affects a protected class of victims.castrijon garcia,at.darcy actions were therefore not base or vile.further,he was not convicted of an explicitly fraudulent cimt because section does not contain an element of intent to defraud.finally,his actions contained no implicit fraud,as he was not attempt ing to induce another to act to his or her detriment or obtain something tangible.blanco,at.because defendants like darcy are convicted under section without these essential elements,there is a realistic probability that section would apply to cond
