john doe is the pseudonym of a former lieutenant in el salvador army who has sought asylum in the united states.he has been permitted to litigate his claim pseudonymously because of his fear that if he is returned to el salvador he will be killed.an immigration judge denied his claim for asylum and other relief back in,and despite the novelty and importance of the case the board of immigration appeals affirmed the immigration judge decision without opinion.
the roots of the case are in a notorious episode in el salvador vicious civil war,which raged from to and included such atrocities as the murder of a catholic archbishop while he was celebrating mass,the rape and murder of four american nuns,and the jesuit murders out of which this case arises.
doe in was an army lieutenant assigned as an instructor at the military academy in san salvador.the head of the academy,a colonel named benavides,one evening convened a meeting that he ordered doe to attend.at the meeting benavides announced that he had been ordered to kill father ellacuria,a jesuit who was the president of a university in san salvador and was regarded as an ally of the rebels.another colonel,hernandez,ordered doe to accompany the members of the atlacatl battalion which in had massacred the entire,women,and than in all,of the village of el mozote who would conduct the operation under the command of a lieutenant named espinoza,a member of the battalion.
doe expressed to hernandez misgivings about the mission.the two agreed that the order to kill the jesuit was immoral,but that to object would risk their being killed.doe prepared for the mission by donning battle fatigues,painting camouflage on his face,and fetching his rifle and ammunition.he then accompanied the to members of the atlacatl battalion assigned to the mission.
when they arrived at the university,around midnight,doe walked about the university grounds with which he was not the members of the atlacatl battalion,who had reconnoitered the site several days before the attack,saw two women in a room,heard shots,and later saw bodies on the ground.six jesuits,including the university president,were killed,along with a female cook and her daughter.there were no survivors.
doe did not give orders,fire his gun,seize anyone,or block anyone attempted escape.but when he returned to the base,he assisted in destroying log books identifying the soldiers who had participated in the raid.
all this is according to doe testimony,which the immigration judge credited.
the salvadoran ministry of defense appointed an honor commission of military officers to investigate the murders.the commission ordered doe arrest.he was tried for the murders along with benavides.both were convicted and given prison sentences.seven of the atlacatl battalion who had participated in the mission,including the commander,also tried,but they were acquitted,though several of them had confessed to participating in the murders.
the trial took place in.the following year,as part of the accord that ended the civil war,the united nations appointed a truth commission for el salvador to investigate serious acts of violence that have occurred since and whose impact on society urgently demands that the public should know the truth.united nations truth commission,from madness to hope the war in el salvador.officers ordered doe not to cooperate with the commission.but he did cooperate,revealing not only to the commission but also to father tojeira,a leading jesuit,what he knew about the murders at the university.
the commission issued its report the following year.the report condemned the high command of the salvadoran armed forces,criticized the trial in which doe had been convicted,and recommended that he be pardoned.id.at.within a week the government amnestied members of the high command,benavides,and had been accused of or implicated in the murders.on april,doe was released from prison.four days later,having learned that members of the high command suspected that it was he who had spilled the beans to the truth commission and father tojeira,and believing that he would be killed if he remained in el salvador,doe fled the country with the assistance of jesuits,first to mexico and then to the united states.
the immigration judge denied doe application for asylum and related relief on three independent grounds that doe had ordered,incited,assisted,or otherwise participated in the persecution of any person on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,a b,b a i,b b i that he had been convicted of a particularly serious crime,id.b a ii,b b ii,namely murder,and that he lacked a fear of persecution should he be returned to el salvador,since the political situation in that country had improved since.
the murder of the jesuit priests was persecution on account of political opinion.in contrast,the murder of the two women,if unrelated to their political opinions and thus motivated solely by a desire to eliminate witnesses to the murder of the priests,would not be persecution within the meaning of the asylum statute because it would not be on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.nakibuka gonzales,cir vasquez ins,cir per curiam in re mcmullen.it would be different had the women been murdered because they were believed to be involved in the jesuits political activities,chavarria gonzalez,cir,or,as we see,had the murders been a necessary step in the persecution,as they would have been had the women been shot trying to shield the priests with their bodies.but neither point is argued,or bears on the issues in this case it is enough that the murdered priests were victims of persecution.
whether doe assisted or otherwise participated in the persecution of the jesuits who were killed is a close question.his mere presence does not seem like assistance.he was brought in under odd circumstances that do not suggest that he played any role in making the mission more likely to succeed.in contrast to the members of the atlacatl battalion,he was given no intelligence about the mission,no particular assignment to fulfill,did not help plan the mission,and did not know any of its details or even the layout of the university.his subsequent conviction in the face of the acquittals of the culpable defendants is consistent with his having been included on the mission because they might need a scapegoat.true,his presence bulked up the attacking force from to to to,and in other circumstances that could be significant assistance.but since the attack was upon eight unarmed,defenseless civilians,his presence did nothing to embolden the attackers or assure the attack success.because his presence did not increase the probability that the attack would succeed,his case differs from the cases of the former nazi concentration camp guards,who even if they never shot or even detained anyone contributed to the persecution that went on inside the camps by deterring attempts at escape.see,fedorenko united states,and nn,d united states kumpf,cir naujalis ins,cir see also singh gonzales,cir.
we are mindful of a dictum in united states ciurinskas,cir,to the effect that membership in a nazi police battalion tasked with exterminating jews was assistance in persecution even if the member in question had not personally participated in the killings carried out by the battalion.but suppose ciurinskas had not been a member of the police battalion,but a soldier from a combat unit that did not engage in persecution who had been forced to accompany the police battalion on one operation and had made no contribution to the operation success.that would be like this case and the dictum would not be applicable.
doe case differs as well from miranda alvarado gonzales,cir,a case of an interpreter assigned to interrogations in which torture was used.see also higuit gonzales,cir.doe case is closer to that of an individual who did no more than cut the hair of female inmates before they were executed,which the supreme court said in fedorenko can not be found to have assisted in the persecution of civilians,at.or to that of the pe
