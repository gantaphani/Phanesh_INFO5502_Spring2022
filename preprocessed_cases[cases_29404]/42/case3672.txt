we must decide whether our decision in gonzales,cir,compels the conclusion that a parent status as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence may be imputed to an unemancipated minor child residing with that parent,for purposes of satisfying the permanent residence requirement for cancellation of removal under section a of the immigration and nationality act ina,a.because the rationale and holding of apply equally to the permanent residence and the continuous residence requirements,we conclude that it does.

iii.discussion 
mercado eligibility for cancellation of.imputation of status,intent,and state of mind to unemancipated minor children 
b oth the bia and this court repeatedly have held that a parent status,intent,or state of mind is imputed to the parent unemancipated minor child in many areas of immigration law,including asylum,grounds of inadmissibility,and legal residency status,at see also,vang ins,cir imputing a parent firm resettlement under to a minor senica ins,cir imputing a parent knowledge of ineligibility for admission to that parent minor children to deny their application for discretionary admission under k matter of huang,bia abandonment of lawful permanent resident status of a parent is imputed to a minor child who is subject to the parent custody and control.citing matter of winkens,bia.as we have recently explained,w e have allowed imputation precisely because the minor either was legally incapable of satisfying one of these criteria or could not reasonably be expected to satisfy it independent of his parents.ramos barrios holder,cir on several occasions,we have confronted situations in which a parent would qualify for relief under section a or its predecessor,section c while a child who at all times had been in the physical custody of that parent would not.in recognition of the fundamental concerns motivating this form of discretionary relief,we have consistently imputed a parent satisfaction of the provision status requirements to the unemancipated minor children in that parent custody.
section c and 
in,we considered whether,under section c,a parent lawful unrelinquished domicile is imputed to his or her minor children.at.concluding that imputation was appropriate,we first distinguished our holding in that to be eligible for section c relief,aliens must accumulate seven years of lawful unrelinquished domicile after their admission for permanent residence.id.at quoting ins,cir.in light of crucial differences between,who had entered the united states illegally and acquired permanent resident status only after marrying,and,who had entered legally with his parents and was always legally within the country,but nevertheless acquired permanent resident status many years after his parents achieved it,we concluded that did not foreclose the possibility of imputation.id.on the contrary,we found a number of persuasive reasons to hold that a child lawful unrelinquished domicile under section c is that of his or her parents.id.
first,we observed that the position espoused by the government would subvert the fundamental policies animating section c.id.severing the bonds between parents and their children who had resided legally in the united states for the better part of their lives would frustrate the section just and humane goal of providing relief to those for whom deportation would result in peculiar or unusual hardship.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,section c core policy concerns would be directly frustrated by the government proposal to ignore the parent domicile in determining that of the child.id.at.the existence of other sections of the ina giving a high priority to the relation between permanent resident parents and their children lent strength to this analysis id.
second,congress use of the term domicile reinforced the imputation of this form of status,because children are,legally speaking,incapable of forming the necessary intent to remain indefinitely in a particular place,and thus can not determine their own domicile,id.at.we therefore held that parents lawful unrelinquished domicile should be imputed to their minor children under section c.id.at quoting c.the second and third circuits,the only other circuits to consider this issue before iirira repealed section c,reached the same conclusion,imputing a parent accumulation of lawful unrelinquished domicile to that parent minor children.see rosario ins,cir morel ins,cir,vacated on other grounds,cir.
section a and 
we first considered the possibility of imputation under section a in.see at.facing removal due to a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude,satisfied section a permanent residence requirement.
however,the ij found him ineligible for cancellation of removal because he had not satisfied section a continuous residence requirement,although he had lived in the united states since,when he was one year old.id.at a.the bia affirmed in a reasoned opinion,rejecting argument that allowed the imputation of his mother continuous residence as a permanent resident to satisfy the requirement,at.
because the bia interpreted section a in its opinion,we applied chevron deference in our review,asking whether the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,and if so whether the agency interpretation is based on a reasonable,permissible construction of the statute,at quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d.after concluding that section a is silent regarding imputation,id.at,we took up the tools of statutory construction to assess whether the bia interpretation of a as being unamenable to imputation is a reasonable one,id.at.examining,the legislative history of section a,and the statutory framework of the ina,we concluded that the bia interpretation was unreasonable,see id.at,and held that for purposes of satisfying the of continuous residence after having been admitted in any status required for cancellation of removal under a,a parent admission for permanent resident status is imputed to the parent unemancipated minor children residing with the parent,id.at.
the statutory framework and congressional intent 
before its repeal,section c provided that a liens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years,may be admitted in the discretion of the attorney general.c repealed 
in applying section c,the courts of appeals developed conflicting interpretations of its requirement that permanent residents demonstrate a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years.id.our circuit and the fourth circuit followed the bia longstanding interpretation,restricting the accumulation of lawful unrelinquished domicile to immigrants who had been admitted for permanent residence.see,at chiravacharadhikul ins,cir matter of,bia.the second,third,and seventh circuits disagreed,concluding that the domicile requirement could be satisfied by lawful domicile prior to admission as a lawful permanent resident,so long as the immigrant was also eventually admitted for permanent residence.see lok ins,cir morel,at ins,cir.the fifth,tenth,eleventh,and circuits discussed the conflicting interpretations,but did not decide the issue.see ins,cir onwuneme ins,cir melian ins,cir anwo ins.
the legislative history confirms that by enacting iirira,congress intended to address,among other things,the circuits varying interpretations of section c.in,the senate had considered a predecessor bill to iirira entitled the immigration enforcement improvements act,cong.see cong.rec,may.in title iii,section b,the bill set forth a cancellation of removal provision with the same basic requirements as section a five years of permanent residence and seven years of continuous residence in a analysis of the bill,the department of justice stated that section b would clarify an area of the law regarding the cutoff periods for these benefits that have given rise to significant litigation and different rules being applied in different judicial circuits.cong.rec.at.
section a resolved the section c circuit split with the same compromise that had been proposed in the immigration enforcement improvements act,requiring at least five years of residence after being lawfully admitted for permanent residence and seven years of continuous residence after having been admitted in any status.a.it is thus apparent that,in enacting section a,congress intended to clear up a longstanding disagreement between the various courts of appeals and the bia regarding the type of status necessary to qualify for relief under former c,at see also gonzales,cir ultimately,congress designed the dual requirement of a legal permanent residency and continuous residence in any status,a,to clear up prior confusion and to strike a balance between the conflicting interpretations by counting a limited period of time spent in status while still requiring at least five years of permanent resident status.internal quotation marks omitted 
moreover,it is equally apparent that congress modifications to section c were not intended to alter the availability of imputation to the unemancipated minor children of parents who qualified for relief.the circuits did not split as to the underlying policy objectives motivating section c,but simply over the type of status necessary to satisfy lawful unrelinquished domicile.therefore,the fundamental goal underlying this discretionary remedy to provide relief from deportation for those who have lawfully formed strong ties to the united states,at unaffected by this clarification of the requirements to secure that relief.
the bia decision in in re 
in denying mercado direct appeal in an unpublished disposition,the bia declined to apply our holding in to the residence requirement in section a.in re,wl.in a published opinion,the bia also expressed its disagreement with the reasoning of.see in re escobar,bia however,the holding,reasoning,and logic of apply equally to the resident status requirements of both section a and a,and thus imputation of the custodial parent status to the minor is compelled.
a.our deference to the bia 
it is that congress delegated to the bia the authority to promulgate rules,on behalf of the attorney general,that carry the force of law through a process of adjudication,at quoting ins,d.however,only selected decisions of the board rendered by a panel or by the board en banc may be designated to serve as precedents.id.at quoting g.although the bia published,decision in in re escobar requires chevron deference,we have previously applied chevron to find the bia interpretation of section a unreasonable.see,at.indeed,when scrutinized,the bia decision in in re escobar,as well as its decision in in re,can not fairly be characterized as a new interpretation of section a,but is rather the same unreasonable interpretation we rejected in.
b.the requirement of lawful admission for permanent residence and the question of congressional intent 
contrary to the government assertion,is controlling precedent for the imputation of lawful permanent resident status from a parent to a child.in re escobar,at.further,although lawfully admitted for permanent residence is a term of art,defined in a as the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the united states as an immigrant in accordance with the immigration laws,such status not having changed,it does not follow that allowing imputation for the permanent residence requirement would run contrary to the clear intent of congress.in re escobar,at in re,wl.
first,review of the plain language of the statute demonstrates that both sections c and a use a variant of the word lawful in setting out their requirements.section c required lawful unrelinquished domicile,and section a requires an applicant to have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence.thus,the emphasis on section a requirement of being lawfully admitted is clearly misplaced.in re escobar,at.if the change from requiring seven years of domicile to seven years of residence after having been admitted did not preclude imputation,see,at,surely the change from lawful unrelinquished domicile to lawfully admitted for permanent residence should have no such effect.indeed,when we decided,we had already held that to be eligible for section c relief,aliens must accumulate seven years of lawful unrelinquished domicile after their admission for permanent residence.at quoting,at.thus,by allowing imputation for minor children to satisfy the domicile requirement,necessarily held that a parent admission to permanent resident status is imputed to the child for purposes of section c relief,at.accordingly,although the status requirement in section a is distinct,the distinction is not relevant,and we again conclude that the change in terminology is not so great as to be dispositive.id.
second,because mercado actually has been admitted for permanent residence,it is beyond dispute that he has satisfied the substantive and procedural requirements of admission for permanent residence he has failed to satisfy only the component of this requirement,which was imposed to probe the duration of an alien lawful ties to the united states.see,at.
similarly,the bia decision in in re escobar is flawed in two critical respects the decision is factually inaccurate in implying that escobar had not satisfied the mandated statutory and regulatory application process and the substantive eligibility requirements for admission.in re escobar,at.the decision also erroneously suggests that imputing status for the sole purpose of assessing eligibility for cancellation of removal necessarily requires imputing in other contexts and with regard to other forms of relief.see id.at.the bia incorrectly asserts that if imputation of a parent lawful permanent residence would allow a minor alien to fulfill the requirements for cancellation of removal,the child would never have to become a lawful permanent resident in his own right.id.at.this is simply not the case.see also in re,wl i f imputation is all that is needed,why would an alien ever need to be a lawful
