guadalupe rosales gonzales appeals his month sentence following his guilty plea and conviction for being a removed immigrant found in the united states.rosales gonzales contends that the district court erred in not granting him a departure,which the parties jointly requested.we hold that the departure is purely discretionary,such that a joint request does not necessitate departure under the guidelines.because rosales gonzales sentence was substantively reasonable,we affirm the sentencing and judgment.
background 
on february,customs and border protection arrested rosales gonzales as a removed immigrant found in the in violation of.the government filed a information charging rosales gonzales with violating.rosales gonzales pled guilty to the charged violation pursuant to a written plea agreement.under the terms of the plea agreement,the parties agreed to request jointly,among other recommendations,a departure pursuant of the sentencing guidelines based on rosales gonzales participation in a disposition program.
on june,the district court held a sentencing hearing.at the outset of the hearing,the district court judge provided what he termed as preliminary thoughts on the parties sentencing recommendations.specifically,the district court judge noted that he was not inclined to grant the requested departure because of rosales gonzales prior convictions for the same offense and because the requested sentence of nine months imprisonment would be less than rosales gonzales previous month sentence for an identical offense.after the government amended its sentencing request to a month term,the district court judge again stated that he was not inclined to go along with that and was not on board with months.
the district court then heard argument from both defense counsel and the government,and permitted rosales gonzales to speak.defense counsel focused her argument almost entirely on rosales gonzales physical condition,specifically the effects of a stroke he had suffered.the district court judge then questioned the government about why it had recommended the departure in a case in which the defendant had been deported times.the government responded that it had considered the sentencing factors set forth in.the government also noted that rosales gonzales settled his case in an expedient manner and waived both indictment and his right to appeal.following the parties arguments,the district court judge explained that he agreed with the parties as to the first part of the guidelines calculation,including that the base offense level was eight,rosales gonzales four prior felony convictions added four points,but that he had accepted responsibility,which dropped the offense level to ten.the district court also agreed with the parties that rosales gonzales criminal history category was five,thus,the sentence range would be to months.the district court judge disagreed with the parties,however,that the departure under applied and declined to apply it.the district court judge then determined that an upper end guidelines sentence was warranted and sentenced rosales gonzales to months imprisonment.rosales gonzales timely appealed his sentence to this court.

iii.discussion 
this case requires us to determine whether a district court must grant a departure under of the sentencing guidelines for participation in a program when the parties jointly request this departure.in answering this question,we consider both procedural error and the substantive reasonableness of rosales gonzales sentence.
procedural error 
rosales gonzales argues the district court procedurally erred by denying the parties joint request for the departure under of the sentencing guidelines and by not using the sentencing guidelines as its starting point.we evaluate these arguments in turn.
denial of the fast track departure under 
we elect to review the district court application of the advisory sentencing guidelines only insofar as they do not involve departures.to the extent that a district court has framed its analysis in terms of a downward or upward departure,we will treat such departures as an exercise of discretion to sentence a defendant outside of the applicable guidelines range.
united states mohamed,cir see also united states vasquez cruz,cir reaffirming that departures are reviewed as part of the substantive reasonableness analysis and not for procedural error.as such,we do not need to consider whether the district court correctly applied the relevant departure provision rather,we review the district court deviation from the applicable guidelines range for reasonableness.united states tankersley,cir see also united states blixt,cir reviewing the district court denial of a downward departure under of the sentencing guidelines only as part of the substantive reasonableness analysis.
thus,our case law is clear that we do not review the denial of a departure under of the sentencing guidelines for procedural error.see united states ellis,cir.accordingly,we reject rosales gonzales argument that the district court committed procedural error by declining to grant him a downward departure under.we address his additional arguments concerning the denial of this departure below in our analysis of the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.
sentencing guidelines as the starting point 
the sentencing guidelines establish a procedure that district courts must follow in determining the proper sentence calculate the appropriate guidelines range,including the offense level and criminal history category of the defendant consider any applicable departures under or of the guidelines and consider the factors enumerated in a.sentencing guidelines manual see also united states lee,cir per curiam same.the supreme court has held that even though the sentencing guidelines are advisory only,district courts must use the guidelines as the starting point for determining a sentence.see,gall united states,d.while the district court may impose a sentence outside the guidelines range,it may not manipulate the calculations under the sentencing guidelines in order to produce a guidelines range that will allow it to impose the sentence it prefers.lee,at.
although rosales gonzales contends his case is analogous to lee,we find the facts sufficiently distinguishable to conclude the district court did not err.in lee,the district court began by finding a base offense level of.at.the probation officer then recalculated the defendant offense level as,based on a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,resulting in a sentencing range of months and a mandatory minimum of months.id.the government subsequently moved for a reduction under based on the defendant substantial assistance and requested a month sentence.id.at.the district court granted the request for a reduction under.id.the district court then incorrectly calculated the defendant new offense level after the departure as,and,also incorrectly,stated that the appropriate guidelines range was months.id.before the court could impose the final sentence,the probation officer interrupted to explain that,with a departure,the defendant offense level was actually,not,resulting in a guidelines range of months,so a sentence exceeding months would be an sentence.id.at.the government then stated that it believed months was appropriate,whatever level one has to depart to,to get that.id.at.thereafter,the district court granted the government amended request for a departure resulting in a guidelines range of
