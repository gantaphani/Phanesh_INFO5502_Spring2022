this appeal concerns the distinction between an applicant for asylum whose testimony lacks credibility and one who has deliberately fabricated material aspects of her application,and focuses on the heightened protections that condition the latter finding.a n asylum application is frivolous if any of its material elements is deliberately fabricated.if found to have knowingly made a frivolous application for asylum,an applicant will be permanently ineligible for any benefits under the immigration and nationality act,including asylum relief.d.given these harsh consequences,the distinctions between the requirements for an adverse credibility determination and a frivolousness finding are of critical importance.
in this case,we hold that substantial evidence supports the board of immigration appeals bia denial of petitioner asylum and withholding of removal claims based on petitioner yan liu lack of credibility.however,whether liu submitted a frivolous asylum application is a distinct question requiring a separate analysis.although the grounds cited for the adverse credibility determination overlap to some extent with the grounds cited for the frivolousness finding,the heightened requirements for the latter finding were not met.liu was not given an adequate opportunity to address all the grounds for the frivolousness finding,and those she was able to address are insufficient,standing alone,to support the frivolousness determination.accordingly,we grant liu petition in part.
background 
liu is a native of china who arrived in the united states on april.her mother had arranged the trip with smugglers.at liu airport interview,she told the immigration officer she left china because there were no jobs,and the wages were inadequate for her to support her parents.when asked if she feared being sent back,she said she would be arrested and beaten,and would not be treated like a human being.
on april,liu was interviewed by an asylum officer and,for the first time,she mentioned the falun gong she told the officer she left china because,i have no work in china and i am involved with the falun gong,and said if she returned,she would be captured and put in jail.asked why she did not mention the falun gong at her airport interview,she said she was tired,scared,confused and worried that she would be sent back if she discussed it.the asylum officer found her to be credible 
in february,after an asylum hearing at which liu testified and introduced evidence,the ij denied liu application.the ij first ruled erroneously that liu could not qualify for asylum or withholding of removal because her membership in falun gong fell within neither the particular social group nor political opinion categories the ij further concluded that liu did not meet the requirements for relief under the convention against torture.the ij alternatively denied liu asylum and withholding of removal claims based on an adverse credibility determination,citing several grounds for her finding that liu was not a credible witness.
first,the ij noted a date discrepancy.liu testified that her uncle,with whom she lived,taught her about falun gong,and initially said he was arrested for his falun gong practice in the middle of august.later,however,she gave the date of his arrest as september.both dates conflicted with a letter submitted by liu,purportedly written by her uncle,that stated that he was arrested on september.liu explained that his letter was generally reliable but that maybe he is kind of screwed up with the time.the ij was not persuaded,and found the discrepancies undermined liu credibility.
second,the ij found that liu failure to mention falun gong during her initial airport interview called her credibility into question.liu explained that she did not fully understand the translation,was tired and fatigued after her travels,and,when she saw people being sent back,felt too scared to answer what she really want ed to say.the ij did not believe liu explanation,but instead concluded that she had made up her involvement with falun gong after obtaining counsel.
third,the ij thought it suspicious that liu uncle letter mentioned practicing falun gong with a group in a park,but did not specify that he had practiced there with liu,as she had testified.the ij concluded that liu explanation for the she had secretly followed her uncle to the park and hidden behind others so she could practice with his group without his not credible.finally,the ij concluded that liu uncle letter appeared fabricated because it stated that falun gong was outlawed in september,whereas country reports state that it became illegal in july.
after making the adverse credibility determination,the ij further ma de a finding that the applicant ha d filed a frivolous asylum application.the ij decision specified four grounds for the frivolousness finding,including the conflicting dates of liu uncle arrest she previously cited as a ground for her adverse credibility determination the three other grounds were,however,distinct from those previously discussed with regard to the ij adverse credibility determination.
first,the ij noted that the letter from liu uncle said she had gone into hiding in various places and did not dare go out in public during the day,whereas liu testified that she worked in those places.second,although the letter stated that police released liu uncle with orders to turn his niece in or face severe punishment,the ij saw no evidence that he was punished severely as a consequence of his failure to turn his niece in.third,the ij found liu testimony about the time period during which she practiced falun gong to be internally inconsistent.she noted that liu told the asylum officer she stopped practicing falun gong in june,but in the next sentence said she stopped practicing in the middle of august.
in,the bia affirmed the ij decision to the extent that the immigration judge found that the respondent failed to establish any basis for a valid claim under the convention against torture,that she gave testimony that was not credible in support of her applications for relief from removal,and that she filed a frivolous asylum application.while liu appeal to this court was pending,the government submitted an unopposed motion to remand in light of the bia decision in in re,which established new procedural requirements for finding an asylum application frivolous under.we granted the motion.
after we did so,the government asked the bia to remand to the ij because the record was stale and because the ij failed to make an explicit credibility finding.the bia denied the motion,concluding that the ij had made an explicit credibility finding and that the record was sufficient.the bia adoption of the ij adverse credibility finding,therefore,remains the board final decision on liu credibility.
the bia also affirmed the ij frivolousness finding after concluding that the four procedural requirements set forth in in re had been satisfied.first,there was no dispute that liu was given proper notice at the outset of the hearing of the consequences of filing a frivolous asylum application.second,the bia found the ij had separately analyzed and made findings regarding deliberate fabrication.third,the bia discussed specific grounds it identified as supporting the frivolousness finding by a preponderance of the evidence.the bia noted the absence of any reference to falun gong in liu airport interview and concluded that her explanation that she was afraid and confused was inadequate.it also cited the inconsistent dates given for liu uncle arrest and liu shifting account of the time frame during which she practiced falun gong,concluding these inconsistencies supported a finding of knowing fabrication.finally,the bia found that liu was given adequate opportunities to address these grounds.the bia thus affirmed its previous frivolousness finding.
the present petition challenges both this finding and the earlier denial of liu asylum and withholding of removal claims.we have jurisdiction under a.
standard of review 
when the bia conducts its own review of the evidence and law rather than adopting the ij decision,our review is limited to the bia decision,except to the extent that the ij opinion is expressly adopted.shrestha holder,cir quoting hosseini gonzales,cir.because liu application for relief was filed before may,id act standards apply.see kaur gonzales,cir.we review credibility findings for substantial evidence.see ins,cir.whether the ij complied with the bia four procedural requirements for a frivolousness finding is a question of law we review de novo.see khadka holder,cir.
discussion 
liu petition challenges the bia denial of her asylum and withholding of removal claims and its finding that she filed a frivolous asylum application.we deny her petition as to asylum and withholding of removal because the ij adverse credibility determination,as adopted by the bia,was supported by substantial evidence.we grant her petition as to the frivolousness finding,however.although the grounds for the adverse credibility determination overlap with those the ij and bia cited in support of the frivolousness finding,a finding of frivolousness does not flow automatically from an adverse credibility determination.id.the heightened substantive and procedural requirements for a frivolousness finding make that inquiry distinct,and we conclude those heightened requirements were not met here.we reject liu final claim that the ij violated her due process rights.
credibility 
an asylum applicant bears the burden of establishing her claim through credible evidence.see b b singh ashcroft,cir.we need discuss only three of the ij grounds for her adverse credibility determination to conclude that liu did not meet her burden.
first,liu failure to mention falun gong at her airport interview undermines her credibility to some degree.in li ashcroft,cir,we expressed a reluctance to view statements given during airport interviews as valuable impeachment sources because of the conditions under which they are taken and because a alien can not be expected to divulge every detail of the persecution he or she sustained.we nonetheless concluded that substantial evidence supported the adverse credibility finding,explaining that the petitioner had not simply failed to mention an instance of abuse or to provide as much detail in his airport interview,but instead had affirmatively denied any mistreatment by the chinese government and explained that he left china for financial reasons.id.at.
we elaborated on li in yan xia zhu mukasey,cir,explaining that when an arriving alien provides only a vague outline of an asylum claim at an airport interview,the lack of detail can not support an adverse credibility determination.there,the petitioner said in her airport interview that she was being persecuted by her boss.id.at.she later requested asylum because,she alleged,the police began harassing her after she reported that her boss,a local factory owner and politician,had raped her.id.at.we held that the petitioner failure to provide more than a summary of her asylum claim at her airport interview was not inconsistent with her more detailed testimony at the hearing before the ij and therefore could not support an adverse credibility determination.id.at.
here,liu statements at her airport interview fall somewhere between those in li and yan xia zhu.liu did not deny mistreatment in china,but she failed to mention falun gong,the central element of her asylum claim.furthermore,liu affirmative statement that her primary motivation for leaving china was to find a better paying job is in significant tension with her asylum claim,even if it does not directly contradict it.liu was given an opportunity to address this incongruity at her hearing,consistent with the requirements for adverse credibility determinations outlined in holder,cir,but the ij reasonably found unsatisfactory her explanation that she failed to mention the persecution she had experienced because she was tired.although liu statements at her airport interview taken alone might not suffice to support the ij adverse credibility finding,they do so when taken together with other discrepancies in liu testimony.
second,the ij found outlandish liu attempt to explain why her uncle letter did not mention that she practiced falun gong with him in the park.liu explanation that she had surreptitiously followed him there and performed behind other practitioners without his knowledge does not contradict the uncle merely said he practiced in the park with others and did not mention liu.nonetheless,given the improbable nature of liu story,the ij permissibly concluded that it undermined liu credibility.
finally,the ij noted inconsistencies in liu testimony regarding when her uncle was arrested for his falun gong practice.liu initially testified that his arrest took place in august,but quickly changed her testimony,saying it actually occurred in september.she then repeatedly insisted that he was arrested on september,testifying that she remembered the date very clearly.the letter from her uncle,however,stated that he was arrested on september.when she was questioned about this discrepancy,liu offered that her uncle,who wrote in his letter that he was years old,must be too old to remember the date of his own arrest.the ij found this rationale inadequate and concluded that the differing dates and unsatisfactory explanation further undermined liu credibility.
we hold that,taken together,liu statements at her airport interview,her improbable explanation for the omission in her uncle letter and her shifting account of her uncle arrest constitute sufficient evidence to support the ij adverse credibility determination.although liu was not given an adequate opportunity to address some of the ij other grounds for questioning her claims,as will be discussed below,she did have an adequate opportunity to address these three grounds,and together they are sufficient to sustain the adverse credibility determination.see id.accordingly,we deny liu petition as to her asylum claim 
ii.frivolous application 
we turn next to the bia finding that liu knowingly filed a frivolous asylum application rendering her permanently ineligible for any benefits under the immigration and nationality act.d.just as the consequences of a frivolousness finding are more severe than those of an adverse credibility determination,the substantive and procedural requirements for a frivolousness finding are more stringent as well.we conclude that these heightened requirements were not met here.for most of the grounds cited in support of the frivolousness finding,liu had inadequate notice of that intended finding,and therefore did not have the requisite opportunity to explain the perceived discrepancies.the two grounds liu did have some opportunity to address are insufficient to support the frivolousness finding.
heightened substantive and procedural requirements 
as we recently explained in khadka,a frivolousness finding differs from an adverse credibility determination in at least four essential substantive respects.first,an asylum application may be deemed frivolous only if it contains deliberate fabricat ion,and the applicant has thus perpetrated a fraud on the court.see in re,at explaining that the term fraudulent may be more appropriate than the term frivolous when applied to a questionable asylum application.accordingly,there is a heightened scienter conduct giving rise to a frivolousness finding must be much more serious than the omission,inconsistency,or discrepancy that may support an adverse credibility determination.see khadka,at.
second,a frivolousness determination requires a finding that a material element of the claim was fabricated,whereas an adverse credibility determination may be supported by an inconsistency or apparent falsehood that merely relates to a material element of the claim.id.emphasis added third,although the applicant for relief from removal has the burden of demonstrating that he or she meets all of the requirements for such relief,the burden shifts to the government to prove the applicant has filed a frivolous application.in re,at.fourth,a frivolousness finding requires a stronger evidentiary showing than an adverse credibility finding frivolousness must be proven by a preponderance of the evide
