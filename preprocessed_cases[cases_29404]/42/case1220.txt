opinion of the court 
the question presented is whether an alien who has spent more than five years in prison for an aggravated felony is eligible for a waiver of deportation under former immigration and nationality act ina c.we hold that he is not.
a native and citizen of ecuador,jorge espinoza became a lawful permanent resident of the united states in.in january,he was served with an order to show cause charging him with deportability on the basis of a february new york conviction for selling cocaine.in response,espinoza filed an application for a waiver of deportation under former ina c.prior to his deportation hearing,however,espinoza was paroled into the custody of the immigration and naturalization service ins and his proceedings were administratively closed on december.as a result,espinoza application for c relief was never adjudicated by the agency.
after his release from ins custody,espinoza lived and worked in the new york city area until june,when he was arrested again.on february,espinoza was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine,in violation of,a,and b a,and was sentenced to months imprisonment.after his conviction,the department of homeland security dhs reopened espinoza deportation proceedings.in february,dhs served espinoza with an additional charge of deportability based on the conviction,which supplemented the charges that had been lodged in.
in february,espinoza first deportation hearing was held in york,pennsylvania.at espinoza request,immigration judge ij walter durling postponed the proceedings to give espinoza time to seek an attorney.in april,judge durling again postponed the hearing after espinoza requested a list of attorneys to contact.although he agreed to provide the list,judge durling told espinoza that the list is essentially worthless because n o organization on the list will agree to represent any individual who is still serving the terms of imprisonment.three months later,immigration judge jesus clemente took over the proceedings and postponed espinoza hearing for a third time after espinoza expressed uncertainty as to whether his family had retained counsel for him.finally,on september,espinoza deportation hearing proceeded,although he still had not obtained counsel.espinoza told judge clemente that he had reached out to attorneys on the list the court had provided him,but that he had not received any responses.judge clemente asked espinoza if he was ready to proceed notwithstanding the absence of counsel,and espinoza agreed to do so.on may,judge durling ordered espinoza removed from the united states to ecuador 
in july,espinoza appealed to the board of immigration appeals bia,arguing,inter alia,that the government had failed to prove that he was not an american citizen or national and he was eligible for a waiver of deportability under former ina c.on august,the bia affirmed judge durling determination that espinoza was not an american citizen or national,but remanded the case so the immigration court could consider whether espinoza might be eligible for c relief.
during a september,hearing following remand,judge durling requested that the government provide espinoza with a short memorandum detailing the government argument for why espinoza was ineligible for c relief and continued the hearing until november.before the scheduled hearing was conducted,however,on november judge durling held that espinoza was ineligible for relief under c and entered a second order of deportation 
once again,espinoza appealed to the bia,this time arguing he was eligible for c relief his due process rights had been violated because he neither received the government c memorandum nor had an opportunity to present his argument prior to the ij decision and he had been denied his right to counsel.in a march,opinion,the bia agreed with judge durling interpretation of relevant precedent addressing c before ultimately find ing no error in the immigration judge legal conclusion that the respondent aggravated felony conviction is not subject to waiver under section c under controlling third circuit law.app.alternatively,the bia found that espinoza was ineligible for c relief because,by march,he had served five years in prison for his conviction,dating back to february.finally,the bia found espinoza due process and citizenship claims unpersuasive and dismissed his appeal,thereby affirming the ij november,deportation order.espinoza petitioned for review of the bia august,and march,decisions 
in support of his petition for review espinoza claims he is eligible for discretionary relief from deportation under former ina c and his due process rights were violated when he was prevented from presenting his case prior to judge durling november decision and because the ijs failed to ascertain whether he had received the required list of attorneys 
the bia had jurisdiction under b and,which confer appellate jurisdiction over decisions of immigration judges in removal proceedings federal courts generally lack jurisdiction to review final orders of removal based on an alien conviction for an aggravated felony.a c.nevertheless,because espinoza appeal presents only constitutional claims and questions of law relating to the bia final removal order,we have jurisdiction under a d.see papageorgiou gonzalez,cir holding that all aliens,including criminal aliens are permitted to obtain review of constitutional claims and questions of law upon the filing of a petition for review with an appropriate court of appeals.

we begin our evaluation of the impact of the bar by exploring the evolution of the attorney general authority to grant aliens discretionary relief from deportation.section of the ina of,codified at,excludes certain classes of aliens from the united states,including those convicted of offenses involving moral turpitude or illicit narcotics trafficking.see,stat.that section was subject to a waiver provision,c,which was codified at c.the first sentence of c provided aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation,and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years,may be admitted in the discretion of the attorney general stat.at,c repealed.although c was literally applicable only to exclusion proceedings,it has been interpreted by the board of immigration appeals to authorize any permanent resident alien with a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years to apply for a discretionary waiver from deportation.ins cyr,d citing matter of silva.
a few decades after passing the ina,congress began to narrow the class of permanent resident aliens who may apply for discretionary relief under c.of critical significance to this appeal,congress in amended c to bar discretionary relief to any alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony and has served a term of imprisonment of at least years.see immigration act of a,stat,amendment when congress enacted the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,it barred c relief to those aliens who were convicted of a broad set of offenses,including aggravated felonies,drug convictions,certain weapons or national security violations,and multiple convictions involving crimes of moral turpitude.perez elwood,cir see aedpa,stat,amending c.later that same year,congress passed iirira,which repealed ina c,and replaced it with a new section,iirira,codified at.perez,at.under,the attorney general does not have discretion to cancel removal for anyone previously convicted of any aggravated felony.a perez,at.iirira also contains transitional rules that instruct courts not to apply the statute to deportation proceedings initiated before the statute effective date of april.iirira c,stat.
in light of this statutory scheme,we consider espinoza criminal and immigration proceedings to determine whether he may seek discret
