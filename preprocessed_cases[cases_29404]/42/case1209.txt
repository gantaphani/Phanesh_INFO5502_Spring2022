in november,jose pedro verde rodriguez verde filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court for the western district of pennsylvania challenging his removal from the united states.the district court concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the petition and transferred the case to this court.we will dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.
according to his habeas petition,verde is a native of mexico and became a lawful permanent resident of the united states in.after several convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol the dui convictions,verde was sentenced to two years and four months in state prison.in october,verde was charged with removability based on his status as an aggravated felon due to the dui convictions.he appeared before an immigration judge ij with seven other mexican nationals,and the ij ordered verde removal on october.verde returned to the united states,but was removed to mexico for a second time in.he was found in the united states once again in october.verde was served with a notice of to reinstate prior order on october,reinstating his removal order.this time,he was also charged with illegal reentry under.the united states eventually dropped the charge and allowed him to plead guilty to use of a false social security number in violation of a b.he was sentenced to time served and a term of supervised release.
verde filed a habeas petition seeking to be reinstated to his status as a permanent resident or to be granted cancellation of removal.his principal argument was that his initial removal was a gross miscarriage of justice because of procedural shortcomings that occurred during his removal hearing.he also asserted that because the supreme court later decided that a dui conviction was not an aggravated felony,his conviction was not a valid basis for his original removal.
the district court dismissed verde petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.it explained that the real id act of eliminated the availability of habeas corpus relief in the district courts for aliens seeking to challenge orders of removal.appendix app.quoting kolkevich att y of,cir.the district court then provided two reasons for transferring the case to this court.first,it concluded that jurisdiction would have been proper in the court of appeals for the third circuit at the time petitioner habeas petition was filed.app.second,the court noted that it had serious concerns regarding whether the real id act should be construed as eliminating collateral review of deportation orders which were entered prior to the enactment of the real id act,but which could not have been challenged by petition for a writ of habeas corpus until the detention of a petitioner years later.app.
we first consider whether we have jurisdiction.application of the real id act,et,is central to the resolution of this threshold issue.the real id act fundamentally altered the manner in which aliens may seek review of orders of removal.the law eliminated habeas corpus review over removal orders and provides that a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal entered or issued under any provision of this chapter.a a petition for review must be filed within thirty days of the final removal order.b.based on this requirement,the government argues that verde current petition for removal is untimely while it was filed within thirty days of the most recent reinstatement of the order,the government maintains that the window is not renewed when a removal order is reinstated.importantly,we have no jurisdiction over an untimely petition.see kolkevich,
the parties first dispute whether the time limit is altered by a d,which provides that 
n othing in subparagraph b or c,or in any other provision of this chapter other than this section which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.
verde essentially argues that this is a freestanding grant of jurisdiction that eliminates the time limit for constitutional claims or questions of law.but as the government points out,a d clearly limits its scope to subparagraph b or c or any other provision of the chapter other than this section.because b is in,but is not in subparagraph b or c of a,a d can not logically be read to eliminate the window for filing constitutional claims and questions of law.our past interpretation confirms this conclusion.see papageorgiou gonzales,cir congress has provided that nothing in a b,c,or any other provision of the ina shall preclude judicial review of such orders,unless such review is barred by some other provision of.accordingly,the time limit set forth in b is not altered by a d.
verde next asserts that his petition was timely because he filed it within thirty days of the reinstatement of his removal order.he argues that under debeato attorney general,cir,an alien who has been removed may challenge a reinstated removal order in the same manner he would challenge the original order.in debeato,the petitioner came to the united states in and was arrested on drug charges two years later.after serving prison time,she was deported because an ij and the board of immigration appeals bia agreed that she was an aggravated felon.id.at.she left the united states in,but was found in the country again in.she pled guilty to illegal reentry and went to prison again while in prison,her original deportation order was reinstated.in,debeato filed a habeas petition arguing that the ij erred in her original deportation proceedings by determining that she was ineligible for a waiver of deportation.in determining our jurisdiction,we reviewed the real id act,citing papageorgiou for the proposition that a d removed all jurisdictional bars to review of constitutional claims and questions of law except for those limitations in itself.id.at.most importantly,we then addressed the question of how the holding in papageorgiou applied to a,which provides that when a removal order is reinstated from its original date,the alien is not eligible to apply for any relief under the chapter.we relied on ramirez molina ziglar,cir,explaining that a was overridden by a d,and consequently that we retained jurisdiction over debeato petition.debeato,at t here is no principled reason for reading a d as permitting jurisdiction to review a final removal order,yet denying jurisdiction to review a reinstatement of that very same order.
while debeato makes clear that a d overrides a,that conclusion does not lend much assistance to our resolution of the question at hand this is because,as the government points out,neither debeato nor ramirez molina addressed the time limit of b.both of those cases involved habeas petitions that were filed before the existence of a limit and were converted to petitions for review due to the intervening passage of the real id act.further,a is in a different section of title,chapter as noted above,a d overrides other sections of title,chapter,as well as subparagraphs b and c of subsection a,but does not override other provisions contained in.thus,while a should not prevent our review of the constitutional or statutory questions concerning a reinstated removal order in general,the case law relied upon by verde does not make clear whether the time limit can be circumvented by seeking review of the merits of an underlying removal order by filing a petition for review within thirty days of the issuance of a reinstated order.
the court of appeals for the tenth circuit answered the question we face today in cordova soto holder,cir.there,an alien was removed in,but dhs issued a reinstated removal order when she was found in the united states again in.the petitioner made the same argument verde makes here that a d overrides the jurisdictional bar contained in a.the court agreed with that as a general matter,but then cited b time limit.the court easily concluded that because cordo
