background 
on or about july,four pakistani nationals jumped ship from the little lady p,a vessel which was docked in charles parish,louisiana.one of the four sailors was ahmed nephew.none of the pakistani sailors had legal status to be in the united states when not on the ship docked in an american port.the sailors arranged for a local taxi cab driver,burwell harris,to drive them to texas.en route to texas,harris placed a phone call for the sailors to a waco,texas,number but did not get an answer.the sailors then continued their journey with harris but apparently harris abandoned the sailors in lafayette,louisiana,after receiving from them for the trip.
the sailors then arranged to have another taxi cab driver,douglas adams,drive them from lafayette to waco for.en route to waco,adams also placed a phone call to waco for the sailors and received instructions as to where to deliver them.adams dropped the sailors off at a on in bellmead,texas,where they were met by a man the sailors referred to as uncle,according to adams.
apparently,ahmed was the contact in waco who arranged to pick up the sailors once they arrived.once ahmed picked the sailors up from the,he took them to the sandman motel in waco where he got them two rooms in his name,so that they would have a place to stay.the next day,july,ahmed picked up the sailors and took them to get something to eat and to to get some new clothes.ahmed then returned the individuals to the motel and went to work.
meanwhile,an fbi investigation into the missing sailors whereabouts led to interviews with both cab drivers harris and adams.the fbi investigation revealed that the waco telephone number that had been called was for a sam convenience store,which was owned by saleem sam moosa and the appellant,ahmed.the fbi went to the store on july and questioned ahmed about the sailors,showing him pictures of the individuals.ahmed apparently denied any knowledge of the pakistani sailors and then left the store to return to his home.the fbi agents obtained ahmed home address and went to his house to attempt to continue questioning.at ahmed house,the fbi once again attempted to interview ahmed but he continued to insist that he had no knowledge of the missing sailors according to the report psr,the fbi then took ahmed into custody apparently for further questioning.
subsequent to their attempted interviews with ahmed,the fbi learned,from sources other than ahmed,that ahmed had either a friend or relative who owned the sandman motel.based on this information,the fbi went to the motel on july the same day as their attempted interviews with ahmed and showed an employee pictures of the missing sailors the employee informed the fbi that individuals were staying in rooms and.records from the motel showed that the individual who rented the rooms was ahmed.the fbi found all four sailors in room and took them into custody.
ahmed pled guilty to a one count indictment alleging a violation of a a iii and b ii for harboring an illegal alien.following objections by both the government and ahmed,the probation office produced a revised psr,which assigned a total offense level of for the offense of harboring an alien.this total offense level included a two level reduction for acceptance of responsibility but also a two level increase for obstruction of justice.the revised psr also removed a three level reduction,subsequent to an objection by the government,that was previously granted based on b 
at sentencing,the government withdrew its earlier objection to the three level decrease in base level under b.as the government no longer objected,the district court reduced ahmed total offense level to.ahmed then reiterated an objection he had to the psr recommendation that his base level be increased by two levels for obstruction of justice.the psr based this recommendation on ahmed statements to the fbi that he did not know the sailors.the psr concluded that these statements were materially false statements that significantly impeded the investigation because the agents had to spend more time looking for the sailors.
at the sentencing hearing,ahmed counsel argued that these two statements were not significant impediments as the fbi caught the sailors only a few hours later,and that the fbi already had the lead about the sandman motel by the time of the second interview.the government offered no evidence in response as to why ahmed denials of knowing the sailors was a significant impediment.instead,the government simply argued that they had thousands of leads as to where the sailors might be and had ahmed told the fbi where the sailors were,it would have saved them time.the district court agreed with the government argument,stating 
the court would determine that there was a significant impediment to the investigation placed in the way of law enforcement by the defendant and the argument to the contrary seems to be that he should be credited for what turned out to be an excellent investigation by the federal bureau of investigation.i do think that would be appropriate.i overrule that objection.
apparently,the district court reached this conclusion based solely on the brief arguments presented before it at sentencing.after overruling the objection,the district court sentenced ahmed based on a total offense level of,with a guideline range of four to ten months.on november,the district court sentenced ahmed to six months incarceration,three years supervised release,a mandatory special assessment fee,and a fine.on december,the district court denied a motion by ahmed to stay his sentence of imprisonment pending his appeal ahmed now appeals his sentence and the district court application of the obstruction of justice enhancement.
discussion 
did the district court clearly err by imposing a two level upward adjustment for obstruction of justice under 
ahmed asserts that the district court erred in applying the sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice under.we review a district court application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts for clear error.united states smith,cir.section of the sentencing guidelines provides that i f the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded,or attempted to obstruct or impede,the administration of justice during the course of the investigation,prosecution,or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction,increase the offense level by levels.the district court applied based on application note g which states that providing a materially false information to a law enforcement officer that significantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense is a basis for the increase,cmt.g.ahmed claims that his mere denials of knowing the sailors did not amount to a significant impediment.
at the outset of our analysis,the court notes that ahmed denials of knowing the sailors could possibly qualify under application note of which states that a defendant denial of guilt other than a denial of guilt under oath that constitutes perjury is not a basis for application of this provision.in united states surasky,this court found that a defendant false statements that he had nothing to do with a prison escape attempt,when viewed in the light most favorable to him,were nothing more than denials of guilt,cir.however,in united states smith,this court refused to extend the exception to a defendant when her statements went far beyond merely denying her own involvement or refusing to provide information,which would not qualify for the obstruction enhancement,cir but see united states barnett,cir finding that a defendant false statements,not made under oath,that she had invested money rather than fraudulently kept it for herself was nothing more than a denial of guilt.had the fbi ac
