we consider here whether a court of appeals possesses jurisdiction to review the decision of an immigration judge to deny a motion for a continuance filed during an immigration proceeding.
petitioner rasaq opyemi sanusi,a native and citizen of nigeria,seeks review of a february,order of the board of immigration appeals bia dismissing his appeal of a decision by immigration judge ij donn livingston denying sanusi request for relief under the united nations convention against torture cat see in re sanusi,order and oral decision of the immigration judge,file no.jamaica,ny.sanusi argues that the ij made two errors,each of which was affirmed by the bia.first,sanusi argues that the ij should have granted him relief under the cat,stating that the ij applied the wrong legal standard and incorrectly found sanusi testimony not to be credible.second,sanusi contends that the ij erred in denying sanusi motion for a continuance,which he requested so that he might acquire additional medical evidence in support of his cat claim.in addition,sanusi argues that the bia erred when it refused to remand sanusi case to the ij for further proceedings to consider newly available evidence.
we conclude that sanusi arguments are without merit and,accordingly,we deny the petition for review.
background 
sanusi originally applied for asylum and for withholding of removal under sections a and b of the immigration and naturalization act of ina,as amended,a,b.the ij denied sanusi application for asylum and for withholding of removal under the ina on march,and ordered sanusi removed.sanusi declined to appeal,thereby waiving any claims of error he might have had before this court.see d a court may review a final order of removal only if the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.foster ins,cir f ailure to exhaust these remedies constitutes a clear jurisdictional bar.internal quotation marks omitted.regulations enacted after the cat entered into force allowed aliens subjected to removal orders on or before march,to apply for relief under the cat by moving to reopen their cases sanusi did so,and the ij reopened the case on august.the ij conducted a hearing on sanusi cat claim on december,and on march,issued an order denying relief for,inter alia,the same reasons that sanusi asylum application was denied.sanusi now seeks review of the bia order dismissing his appeal of the ij order denying him cat relief his original application for asylum and for withholding of removal under the ina is not at issue here.
in sanusi application for asylum,his credible fear interview,and his torture convention interview,sanusi alleged that he was persecuted and tortured in nigeria on account of his political beliefs and activities.among other instances of mistreatment,sanusi alleged that he was arrested,interrogated,and detained on several occasions because of his activism on behalf of nigeria social democratic party sdp.he stated further that while in detention he was beaten,his ribs were broken,his head was kicked and ripped open,and his arm was broken.in addition,according to sanusi,during a subsequent detention,a pin was stuck into his male part and he was struck until unconscious.he claims to have been warned repeatedly to stop his work on behalf of the party and against nigeria president,whom the sdp opposed.sanusi stated that he fled nigeria after seeing his name on a list of persons whom the government want ed to get rid of.
after leaving nigeria in december,sanusi arrived in the united kingdom,where he attempted,apparently unsuccessfully,to obtain asylum.he stated that he left the united kingdom for the united states,where he arrived in october,because he feared the united kingdom would deport him to nigeria and that nigeria government would torture or kill him were he to return.
on march,the ij denied sanusi original application for asylum and for withholding of removal under the ina on the basis of an adverse credibility determination.among other things,the ij based his adverse credibility finding on the following items in the record sanusi said at one point in his credible fear interview that he had been a member of the christian democratic party,which was inconsistent with his claim at other times to have been in the social democratic party,sanusi demeanor at his hearing before the ij was somewhat hesitant and in the ij opinion was not consistent with credible testimony,and sanusi was vague and inconsistent regarding his employment with the nigerian airways.in addition,the ij found that sanusi presented false documents upon entry to the unites states,indicating a willingness to employ deception in order to gain admission to the united states,and noted that sanusi failed to present documents supporting his claimed political activity in nigeria.
after sanusi case was reopened on august,for review of his cat claim,the same ij heard the case.in a decision dated march,the ij concluded that sanusi cat claim was based on the same basic facts as the original asylum and withholding of removal applications.the ij recounted the grounds on which the previous adverse credibility finding rested and identified additional reasons,based on the reopened proceeding,for finding sanusi story not credible.first,sanusi mentioned his wife during the reopened proceeding,but on his asylum application he had stated that he was unmarried second,sanusi again failed to produce documents supporting his claims 
the ij denied sanusi cat claim on the merits and also denied his request for a continuance.as the ij explained,sanusi counsel requested additional time to provide medical evidence supportive of sanusi claim to having been mistreated by authorities in nigeria.the ij recounted that sanusi had already been granted from the close of the hearing on december,until january,and another from then until february.sanusi counsel sought a third continuance on february,and subsequently represented by telephone that further evidence was coming.in a letter dated february,sanusi counsel indicated that a n appointment to examine sanusi ha d been scheduled for february,and that the doctor would submit the report by the first week of march.because no such evidence was submitted by march,the ij denied the continuance and issued his decision on the merits on that date.
on march,sanusi filed a motion to reconsider and attached an affidavit from a doctor who set forth the results of her interview and physical examination of evidence,we presume,that sanusi counsel had represented would be forthcoming when making the february,request for a third continuance.for various reasons,the ij did not credit the doctor evidence and therefore denied the motion on april.
i.the ij denial of sanusi request for a continuance 
before examining whether the ij erred in denying sanusi final request for a continuance,we must consider the threshold question of whether we possess jurisdiction to review the decision.for the reasons that follow,we hold that we may review a decision by an ij or the bia to grant or to deny a continuance for an abuse of discretion.
the ina allows a court considering a final order of removal pursuant to to review all questions of law and fact,including interpretation and application of constitutional and statutory provisions,arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove an alien.id.b.pursuant to the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,stat.iirira,congress has,however,amended the ina to preclude judicial review of any decision or action of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security,other than the granting of asylum.a b ii.the phrase this subchapter refers to subchapter ii of chapter of title of the united states code,which includes.see,onyinkwa ashcroft,cir.the scope of this provision of the iirira was itself limited by section a a iii of the real id act of,stat,which provides that nothing in any provision of the ina which limits or eliminates judicial review shall be construed as
