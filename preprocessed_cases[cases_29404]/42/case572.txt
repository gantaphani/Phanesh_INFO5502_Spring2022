the petitioner,azzedine lattab,is an algerian national.his case presents a gallimaufry of issues,including yet another in the series of retroactivity problems that have trailed congress enactment of the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of,stat.iirira.broadly stated,the able assistance of the an iirira provision,codified at a,which mandates the reinstatement of a prior deportation order or removal terms are interchangeable on these facts when an alien subject to such an order is found to have reentered the country illegally.he argues that the reinstatement provision is impermissibly retroactive as applied to his case that the regulatory procedure implementing it is ultra vires and that,in all events,the provision deprives illegally reentering aliens of procedural due process.as a fallback,he asserts that the reinstatement provision ought not to have been invoked in this instance because another statute trumped its operation.concluding,as we do,that this asseverational array lacks force,we deny and dismiss the petition for review.
i.the new reinstatement provision 
we begin by limning the parameters of the new reinstatement provision.among many other innovations,iirira repealed the former reinstatement provision,section f of the immigration and nationality act ina,f repealed,and enacted a new reinstatement provision at section a,a section a provides 
if the attorney general finds that an alien has reentered the united states illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily,under an order of removal,the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed,the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under the ina,and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.
this provision took effect on april.it altered preexisting law in at least three salient respects.first,under the old regime only illegal reentrants who had previously been deported on certain specified grounds,conviction for an aggravated felony were subject to having their original deportation orders reinstated.under section a,however,all illegal reentrants now face the prospect of such reinstatement.see arevalo ashcroft,cir.second,under the earlier system an alien had a right to a hearing,presided over by an immigration judge,before reinstatement of the prior deportation order became a fait accompli.under the regulations implementing section a,however,there is no longer a right to such a hearing or to any hearing,for that matter.see.third,preexisting law allowed an illegal reentrant to attempt to fend off execution of a reinstated deportation order by petitioning for discretionary relief in the form of an adjustment of his status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.conversely,section a pretermits an illegal reentrant ability to apply for any relief under the ina.see arevalo,at.
ii.the factual background 
we next recount the facts undergirding the case.the petitioner first entered the united states on february,as a tourist.he overstayed his visa and remained here for some time.on march,an immigration judge found him deportable but allowed him to depart voluntarily on or before june of that year.the petitioner failed to did not leave the united states until august,that default caused the immigration judge ukase to mutate into a deportation order.see repealed.in the eyes of the law,therefore,the petitioner belated departure was tantamount to.id.
while in the united states,the petitioner had become romantically involved with a united states citizen he claims that they had become engaged.he reentered the united states illegally on march,and resumed this courtship.he and his fiancee were married on july.
on may,the petitioner wife filed an immediate relative petition with the immigration and naturalization service ins this petition was approved on august.that approval,standing alone,did not affect the petitioner immigration status,but,rather,paved the way for a possible adjustment.see ina i,i.to that end,he immediately sought to have his status changed to that of lawful permanent resident.during the pendency of that application,the ins approved the petitioner request for temporary authorization to engage in employment.see c.
on august,the petitioner endeavored to renew his employment authorization.while at the cis office in boston,an immigration officer discovered that the petitioner had been deported once before.he was taken into custody and soon thereafter ice,relying on section a,reinstated the deportation order.
dismayed by this chain of events,the petitioner sought judicial review.his petition contends,inter alia,that the government attempt to apply section a to his case has an impermissibly retroactive effect that the summary reinstatement of the prior deportation order disregarded both statutorily mandated procedures and the dictates of the due process clause and that in the circumstances of this case,section a must yield to a different allegedly conflicting ina provision.because an order reinstating a prior removal order is the functional equivalent of a final order of removal,arevalo,at,we have jurisdiction to hear and determine these contentions under.
iii.analysis 
the petitioner and the amicus advance four principal arguments.we consider them in an order that roughly corresponds to the amount of energy that they have devoted to each.
retroactivity.
the centerpiece of the petitioner case is a claim that application of section a to his circumstances is impermissibly retroactive.since iirira took effect after his illegal reentry in,this thesis runs,retroactive application of the new reinstatement proviso would violate his settled expectation that he would be allowed to seek an adjustment of his immigration status following his marriage.
whether application of a statute to a given situation is impermissibly retroactive presents a quintessentially legal question.judicial review is de novo and,accordingly,the agency views garner no special deference.arevalo,at explaining that courts,rather than agencies,are best equipped to make the constitutionally tinged judgment calls inherent in retroactivity determinations.we proceed on that basis.
there is no doubt that congress has the raw power to enact statutes that operate retroactively.see landgraf usi film,d.but because retroactive legislation has the potential to alter the consequences of actions already taken,courts start with a presumption that congress intends to legislate prospectively.id.at.congress can overcome this presumption and give legislation a retroactive effect only by clearly indicating its intent to do so.id.at.
we analyze the possibility that congress intended a statute to apply retroactively under the rubric set forth in landgraf.initially,we decide whether congress has clearly stated an intention to have the statute apply retrospectively.id.at.arevalo,at.although this prong of the test requires congress intention to be unmistakable,our inquiry is not limited to the statutory text but may include an examination of standard ensigns of statutory construction,such as the statute structure and legislative history.see martin hadix,d see also arevalo,at examining these factors in determining the sweep of section a,but noting that the benchmark for finding unambiguous temporal scope is quite high.if this perscrutation leads to a firm conviction that congress intended the statute to have a specific temporal reach,the retroactivity analysis ends and we will apply the statute in accordance with congress prescription.in the absence of such a directive,we will proceed to determine whether the application in question would have an impermissibly retroactive effect.landgraf,at.arevalo,at.that result obtains if the specified application would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.landgraf,at.in that event,the presumption that congress did not intend the statute to apply retrospectively will hold.arevalo,at.otherwise,retroactive application is permissible.id.
in the case at hand,the search for express congressional intent need not occupy us for long.three years ago,the supreme court ruled that congress did not specify the temporal reach of section of iirira.ins cyr,d.building on that foundation,we concluded last year that section a shared this characteristic.arevalo,at.in forming that conclusion,we carefully examined both the text and legislative history of iirira in general and section a in particular.id.at.this exercise left us with the conviction that section a is hopelessly unclear as to whether it applies to those who illegally reentered the united states before april.id.at.this panel is bound by that determination.united states wogan,cir.
the second step of the landgraf pavane requires us to determine whether application of section a to the petitioner circumstances would have an impermissibly retroactive effect.the logical starting point for this inquiry is the ascertainment of what rights and justifiable expectations the petitioner may have had under the law as it existed immediately before iirira effective date.
the law did not change between the date when the petitioner illegally reentered the country march,and iirira effective date april.under that regime,the petitioner was immediately deportable.see specifying grounds for deportation.there is no indication in the record that the petitioner ever sought,or qualified for,asylum.from aught that appears,in the spring of he would not have had any defense to deportation.
to be sure,at that time the petitioner would not have been subject to summary reinstatement of the prior deportation order.instead,deportability would have been determined in a new proceeding before an immigration judge.see repealed.law would have allowed the petitioner,coincident with the commencement of that new proceeding,to apply for adjustment of his immigration status based upon his marriage,notwithstanding the fact that he had reentered the country illegally.ina,i.
given that template,iirira worked relatively few changes in the petitioner situation.substantively,he was still illegally in the country and still subject to deportation after the new law took effect.while section a barred him from applying for any affirmative relief such as an adjustment of status from and after april,that change was inconsequential because there was no relief for which petitioner could then have qualified.after all,his wedding did not occur until july,over two years after iirira took effect.
in fact,the only consequence that iirira added to the petitioner illegal reentry was procedural he was subject to having his prior deportation order peremptorily reinstated and was no longer entitled to a hearing before that reinstatement.that consequence is insufficient to derail the application of the new statute.as a general rule,the application of new procedural mechanisms to the adjudication of past conduct is not impermissibly retroactive.landgraf,at.more to the point,we previously have held that this precise procedural change falls within that general rule,not within the exception to it.see arevalo,at holding that although aliens subject to reinstatement of a previous deportation order had a right to a hearing before the passage of the iirira,that right was procedural and,therefore,can be taken away retroactively.other courts agree.see,ashcroft,cir ashcroft,cir.
the petitioner nonetheless maintains that section a ought not be applied to bar his application for adjustment of status because at the time section a took effect,he planned to marry a united states citizen and thus become eligible for lawful permanent resident status.he points to the government longstanding practice of allowing an alien illegally present in the united states to seek adjustment of status following marriage to a citizen and asserts that he was entitled to rely on this praxis.this assertion comprises more cry than wool.
a statute only has an impermissibly retroactive effect when it would change the legal consequences of actions actually taken or refrained from prior to the statute effective date.see landgraf,at.inchoate plans to act in the future,even when made in anticipation of the legal consequences of those future actions,do not convey the type of settled expectation that retroactivity analysis seeks to protect.see id.at.noting that retroactive application of a statute is not impermissible merely because that application upsets expectations based in prior law.because the petitioner did not marry and thus,did not qualify for adjustment of status until more than two years after iirira effective date,he can not validly complain about the elimination of his ability to apply for a future adjustment of status.the decisive datum is that the petitioner had no sufficiently settled expectation that he could adjust his status at the time section a took effect,because he was not yet married.thus,applying that provision to the petitioner is not impermissibly retroactive.
there are two loose ends.first,the petitioner asserts that because he applied for adjustment of status before the government actually reinstated the prior order of deportation,section a bar to relief ought not to apply.we deem this argument squarely foreclosed by the text of the statute.section a subjects an illegal reentrant to three independent consequences reinstatement of the prior deportation order,ineligibility for any relief,and removal.grammatically,section a does not make ineligibility for relief dependent upon reinstatement of the prior deportation order.and even if it did,section a expressly makes reinstatement retroactive to the date of the original deportation order 
the second loose end is a bit different.in a letter,see fed.j cir.j,the petitioner attempted to embrace the recent decision in ashcroft,cir.that case involved the effect of a pending application for permission to reenter the country,filed after the petitioner illegally reentered,on the relief bar erected by section a.the ninth circuit stated that if the application were approved,that approval would cure the illegal reentry and section a would not apply.id.at.the petitioner now seeks to avail himself of this possible escape hatch.
in this case,unlike in,the petitioner did not argue that approval of an application for permission to reenter would cure his illegal reentry nor did he argue,by analogy,that the government approval of his wife immediate relative petition should be accorded a similar effect.it is readily apparent,then,that turns on a legal theory never explored either in the petitioner briefs to this court or at oral argument.the usual rule,applicable here,is that new theories can not be raised in a rule j filing.united states nason,cir.it is arguable that this theory has been waived at best,it has been forfeited.see bennett city of holyoke,cir.
of course,a forfeited argument occasionally can be resurrected under the plain error doctrine.see,united states duarte,cir.but that doctrine contains fairly rigorous criteria.see,id.it requires,at a bare minimum,that the complaining party point to a clear or obvious error.id.here,however,we have grave doubts about the correctness of the court conclusion.it seems to us that permission to reenter,like adjustment of status,is relief under the ina,which section a precludes an illegal reentrant from seeking.furthermore,we find it difficult to accept the ninth circuit heavy reliance on regulations that antedate iirira in interpreting the reach of section a.we are,therefore,unable to find a clear or obvious error in ice decisionmaking.
although that ends this phase of our analysis,we add a coda.we hold today only that application of section a to deprive an alien who illegally reentered the country before iirira effective date of the ability to apply for relief for which the alien did not theretofore qualify is not impermissibly retroactive.we do not purport to decide the retroactive application of section a to all aliens who reentered illegally before april,nor do we address the case of an alien illegally present in the united states who had a potential defense to deportation before iirira took effect but had not yet applied
