this court has jurisdiction under and a,and for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
procedural background 
an indictment filed on april,charged valdavinos with a single count under a and b for being a deported alien in the united states.in early june,valdavinos filed a motion to dismiss the indictment,arguing his previous deportation was invalid under d.the motion was fully briefed,and the district court held a hearing on june,which culminated in the denial of valdavinos motion.the district court confirmed its ruling in an order dated june.
on july,valdavinos entered a conditional guilty plea to the charged offense,reserving the right to challenge the denial of his motion to dismiss,as well as his sentence.a investigation report was filed,and the government filed a sentencing summary chart.valdavinos also filed a sentencing summary chart,which asserted his prior conviction for possession of methamphetamine in violation of california law was not a deportable aggravated felony under a m.
on december,the district court sentenced valdavinos to months in prison,followed by two years of supervised release.the court entered its final judgment on december,and valdavinos filed his notice of appeal that same day.
factual background 
on october,the san diego sheriff department arrested valdavinos,an adult citizen of mexico,in vista,california,for possession of methamphetamine in violation of cal.health safety code a.valdavinos was booked into the county jail immediately following his arrest.while there,immigration and customs enforcement ice agents determined valdavinos was a deported alien who had not applied for permission to the united states.an immigration detainer was lodged that same day,meaning ice officials intended to seek future custody of valdavinos.valdavinos was eventually convicted of the section a offense,and on november,was sentenced to days in jail.
in,valdavinos was released from jail and transferred to ice custody.a records check confirmed valdavinos was a deported alien who had not applied for.specifically,valdavinos had been ordered removed from the united states by a january,administrative order,and was physically removed that same day through the san ysidro,california port of entry.on april,a grand jury indicted valdavinos for being a deported alien in the united states in violation of a and b.
on june,valdavinos moved to dismiss the indictment under d on the grounds that his deportation was invalid.the district court held a hearing on the motion,during which the parties focused on whether the drug conviction that led to valdavinos deportation was in fact a deportable offense.the dispute centered on valdavinos september conviction for possession of methamphetamine for sale in violation of cal.health safety code.according to the government,that conviction was a controlled substance offense qualifying as an aggravated felony under a b,which includes drug trafficking crimes as aggravated felonies.therefore,the government argued valdavinos was properly deported because an alien convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.a a iii.
not all convictions under section qualify as drug trafficking offenses because,as this court recognized in ruiz vidal gonzales,cir,not all substances punishable under california law are defined as controlled substances under federal law.because the plea form for his conviction does not state he pled guilty specifically to trafficking a controlled substance as defined by federal law,valdavinos argued his conviction lacked a factual basis showing it was a drug trafficking offense and thus an aggravated felony.he based his argument on people west,cal d,cal,which held a guilty plea to an offense does not necessarily mean the defendant admits the facts alleged in the indictment.
rebutting valdavinos position,the government noted he pled guilty specifically to count two of the complaint,which unequivocally identified the controlled substance at issue as methamphetamine.methamphetamine,of course,qualifies as a controlled substance under federal law.see,a sched.iii.therefore,although the factual basis in valdavinos plea form merely stated peo.west,when read in conjunction with the complaint,it became clear the controlled substance at issue was methamphetamine.the district court agreed with the government,holding valdavinos could not show prejudice as a result of his removal.
moreover,the district court,relying on the removal documents showing valdavinos was advised that he would be deported and given the opportunity for counsel,determined he did not suffer a due process violation as a result of his removal.at the conclusion of the hearing,valdavinos attorney requested the district court issue a written order,which it did on june.
on july,valdavinos entered a conditional guilty plea to being a deported alien,but reserved the right to challenge the denial of his motion to dismiss and his sentence.the district court held valdavinos sentencing hearing on december,during which it determined his total adjusted offense level was.when combined with his criminal history category v,the offense resulted in a sentencing guidelines range of to months imprisonment.specifically,the district court calculated the base offense level as under a,and then applied a enhancement for his section offense under u.b a,as well as a adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under b.the presentence investigation report psr recommended a downward variance to months in light of valdavinos supportive family,positive work history,and signs of substance abuse.the psr also recommended three years of supervised release.
the district court heard arguments from both parties regarding sentencing recommendations.valdavinos agreed to his criminal history score,but argued the court should apply only a enhancement for his section conviction under b d,which would result in a sentencing range of to months.given the circumstances of his offense and his background,valdavinos requested an month sentence.valdavinos addressed the court,apologizing for breaking the law,and indicating he did so only to be with his children and support his mother.valdavinos told the district court he had not realized the harsh punishment for returning to the united states,where he had first come at age twelve.
the government requested a month sentence,noting that when valdavinos was arrested for his current offense,he was driving with methamphetamine in his possession,and had a record for trafficking and using while driving.the district court adopted the psr calculations and reasoning,including the need for a variance.the court recognized valdavinos criminal history and that his involvement with drugs showed he was a danger to the community.the district court,however,noted valdavinos record was not the worst it had seen,and also acknowledged his family responsibilities.
the court ultimately sentenced valdavinos to months in prison.in addition,the court imposed a term of supervised release,stating 
because you have family here and to make sure that you understood we mean business in this regard,i am going to impose supervised release,finding the added deterrent value with your family members here makes it a case that is contrary to the recommendations of the advisory guidelines.
valdavinos now claims his conviction must be reversed due to the court erroneous ruling on the motion to dismiss the indictment under section d.valdavinos also argues the record failed to prove his prior conviction was a controlled substance offense qualifying for a b a enhancement.valdavinos lastly challenges the district court imposition of supervised release,arguing it was excessive and contrary to the sentencing commission renouncement of supervised release in ordinary illegal cases.
discussion 
the district court properly denied valdavinos motion to dismiss the indictmentstandard of review 
this court reviews de novo the district court denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment under when the motion is based on an alleged deprivation of due process in the underlying removal proceedings.united states villavicencio burrel,cir citing united states moriel luna,cir.the district court factual findings are reviewed for clear error.united states ramos,cir.furthermore,to prevail in a collateral attack on the underlying removal order in a motion to dismiss,valdavinos must,as a threshold matter,show that he exhausted his administrative remedies.villavicencio burrel,at citing d see also united states ubaldo figueroa,cir.
valdavinos failed to comply with section d exhaustion requirement 
because valdavinos removal order serves as a predicate element of his illegal offense under section,valdavinos may collaterally attack the removal order under the due process clause.see united states reyes bonilla,cir united states pallares galan,cir.to succeed in a such a challenge,however,valdavinos must demonstrate he exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief the deportation proceedings from which the order issued improperly denied him the opportunity for judicial review and the order was fundamentally unfair.d see reyes bonilla,at united states becerril lopez,cir.an underlying removal order is fundamentally unfair if a defendant due process rights were violated by defects in his deportation process,and he suffered prejudice as a result.reyes bonilla,at united states ubaldo figueroa,cir.
moreover,an alien is barred from collaterally attacking his removal order as a defense to a section charge if he validly waived the right to appeal that order during the deportation proceedings.united states muro inclan,cir internal citations omitted.this exhaustion requirement,however,can not bar collateral review if valdavinos waiver of his right to appeal did not comport with due process that is,his waiver was not considered and intelligent.id.at see also united states mendoza lopez,d holding due process requires judicial review of underlying deportation proceedings when waiver of the right to appeal was not considered or intelligent.
valdavinos concedes he did not exhaust his administrative remedies,but urges this court to excuse his because he was denied due process by being removed without a proper,legal basis,by a denial of the right to counsel,and by failure to offer him the opportunity to apply for available relief.these arguments fail.
valdavinos section conviction constitutes an aggravated felony under the modified categorical approach 
first,valdavinos was charged with a proper legal basis for deportation.according to valdavinos,his due process rights were violated and he suffered prejudice because his conviction for possession of methamphetamine for sale under section does not constitute a drug trafficking offense under a b,which classifies trafficking offenses as deportable aggravated felonies.valdavinos argues that,because he was not an aggravated felon,he had a plausible ground for relief from removal by way of voluntary removal under.
in determining whether an offense qualifies as an aggravated felony,this court looks to the statute under which the defendant was convicted and compares its elements to the relevant definition of an aggravated felony under federal law,which in this case,is found in section a b.see taylor united states,d.this court first task under taylor is to make a categorical comparison.under the categorical approach,valdavinos drug conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony if the full range of conduct covered by section falls within the meaning of that term.see united states vidal,cir en banc internal citations omitted.in other words,if section is broader than the generic definition,then it is unsuitable for federal use because there is no assurance it relates to conduct congress intended to punish.see taylor,at.to make this determination,this court looks at the least egregious end of section range of conduct to determine its categorical scope.united states laurico yeno,cir.
making that determination here is an easy task.indeed,this court has held repeatedly that california controlled substances schedules are broader than their federal counterparts.see,ruiz vidal gonzales,cir holding california law punishes some substances not included in the controlled substances act,cabantac holder,wl,at cir,same.therefore,valdavinos correctly asserts that his prior conviction under section can not be a categorical controlled substance or drug trafficking offense under federal law.
the inquiry does not end here,however.when a criminal offense does not satisfy taylor categorical approach because it criminalizes both conduct that does and does not qualify as an aggravated felony,the court must turn to the modified categorical approach.see ye ins,cir vidal,at.under the modified approach,this court conducts a limited examination of documents in the conviction record to determine if there is sufficient evidence to conclude valdavinos was convicted of the elements of the generically defined crime,even though section is facially.see id.this is where valdavinos falls short.
valdavinos contends his conviction can not support the finding that he was convicted of an aggravated felony because,under people west,cal d,a guilty plea to an offense does not necessarily mean the defendant admitted all facts alleged in the indictment.however,it is in this circuit that,in undertaking an analysis of the record of conviction,this court may consider the charging documents in conjunction with the plea agreement,the transcript of a plea proceeding,or the judgment to determine whether the defendant pled guilty to the elements of the generic crime.ruiz vidal,at citing united states corona sanchez,cir emphasis added see also shepard united states,d.moreover,this court recently acknowledged that courts may consider the facts alleged in a specific count of a complaint where an abstract of judgment or even a minute entry specifies that a defendant pled guilty to that particular count.see cabantac,wl,at see also united states snellenberger,cir en banc reading a minute order in tandem with a complaint to conclude the defendant conduct was a crime of violence.
therefore,although a charging paper alone is never sufficient,united states parker,cir,a charging paper may be considered in combination with other documents in the record to determine whether valdavinos pled guilty to an aggravated felony.see ruiz vidal,at citing corona sanchez,at.in this case,the record leaves no doubt valdavinos pled guilty to possession of methamphetamine for sale in violation of section.
the record of conviction for valdavinos drug offense contains four documents felony complaint change of plea form minute entry of the plea colloquy and abstract of judgment.count two of the complaint unequivocally lists the controlled substance underlying valdavinos section conviction as methamphetamine 
on or about april,the crime of possession for sale oz or more,in violation of health and safety code section,a felony was committed by jorge valdavinos torres who did unlawfully possess for purpose of sale a controlled substance,to wit,methamphetamine.
the change of plea form indicates valdavinos pled guilty to count two,which,as just discussed,states he possessed methamphetamine for sale in violation of section.these two documents in conjunction with one another suffice to establish the substance at issue was methamphetamine.the abstract of judgment and the minute entry of valdavinos plea colloquy reinforce this conclusion.both of those documents,like the plea form,indicate valdavinos pled guilty to count two of the complaint.in short,the district court did not err in concluding the record documents in this case showed valdavinos understood that he was pleading guilty to count two of the complaint.
valdavinos citations to vidal and ruiz vidal do not compel a different result.in those cases,we held the charging documents,along with the other documents at issue,were insufficient to establish that the prior convictions satisfied the generically defined crimes.specifically,the defendant in vidal was charged with willfully and unlawfully driv ing and tak ing a vehicle,but the written plea and waiver of rights form showed he pled guilty only to driving a stolen vehicle.at.we concluded the record in that case fail ed to establish the factual predicate for the defendant plea of guilty,because it did not contain a recitation of the factual basis for the defendant plea,a plea hearing transcript,or a copy of the judgment of conviction.id.at.
in vidal,we further emphasized w hen,as here,the statute of conviction is overly inclusive,without a charging document that narrows the charge to generic limits,the only certainty of a generic finding lies in the defendant own admissions or accepted findings of fact confirming the factual basis for a valid plea.id.at quoting shepard,at.simply put,we did not have a record upon which a determination could be made whether the defendant had admitted facts establishing the requisite factual predicate to support finding the conviction was an aggravated felony.that is in direct contrast to the case at hand,where the factual basis for the underlying conviction to which valdavinos pled guilty unequivocally establishes the controlled substance at issue was methamphetamine.
notably,the vidal court relied on united states snellenberger,cir,for the proposition that a minute order,even when read in conjunction with the complaint,was insufficient to establish the defendant conviction was for a crime of violence.vidal,at.that case,however,was overturned by an en banc panel,which concluded district courts may rely on clerk minute orders in applying the modified categorical approach.see snellenberger,at.the en banc snellenberger decision was abrogated recently by another en banc panel only to the extent that snellenberger held a guilty plea to a conjunctively phrased information constitutes an admission of all allegations contained therein.see young holder,wl,at cir,w hen either a or b could support a conviction,a defendant who pleads guilty to a charging document alleging a and b admits only a or.
similarly,in ruiz vidal,the charging document identified the drug at issue as methamphetamine,but the defendant did not plead guilty to either of the crimes charged in that document.at.instead,the defendant pled guilty to violating cal.health safety code a.id.because the record contained no plea agreement or colloquy that revealed the facts underlying the plea,a panel of this court concluded there is simply no way for us to connect the references to methamphetamine in the charging document with the conviction.see also martinez perez gonzales,cir holding facts in the information could not establish the defendant committed an aggravated felony where defendant pled guilty to a different offense from the one charged in the information.
here,there is a way to connect the references as required by ruiz vidal and there is no need to speculate as to the nature of the substance.at.indeed,in contrast to the defendants in vidal and ruiz vidal,three different records confirm that valdavinos was pleading guilty to possession for sale of methamphetamine.in addition,however,valdavinos argues young is dispositive here because it adopted the maxim allegations not necessary to be proved for a conviction are not admitted by a plea,wl,at citation omitted.but young does not affect the outcome in this case,as the complaint is not conjunctively phrased.further,young applies the modified categorical approach,and notes that the record is inconclusive under the modified categorical approach when the record consists only of a charging document that includes several theories of the crime,at least one of which would not qualify as a predicate conviction.id.at.as noted above,the record here consists of more than just the charging document three different records make clear valdavinos was pleading guilty to possession for sale of methamphetamine.therefore,his section offense qualifies as a deportable drug trafficking crime under section a b.see a a iii.accordingly,valdavinos was charged with a proper legal basis for deportation.
valdavinos was not denied the right to counsel 
while the lion share of valdavinos brief is devoted to his argument regarding the modified categorical approach and his section conviction,only a footnote is devoted to his argument that his due process rights were violated by the denial of his right to counsel during removal proceedings.
although there is no sixth amendment right to counsel in an immigration hearing,congress has recognized it among the rights stemming from the fifth amendment guarantee of due process that adhere to individuals that are the subject of removal proceedings.reyes bonilla,at quoting tawadrus ashcroft,cir.in addition to the due process clause,the right to counsel in immigration proceedings is also secured by statute.see b b t he alien shall have the privilege of being represented at no expense to the government by such counsel,authorized to practice in such proceedings,as the alien shall choose.b i the notice of intent shall advise that the alien has the privilege of being represented in removal proceedings.see also b iv requiring ice to provide aliens facing expedited removal a list of available free legal services programs.
in this case,valdavinos admits he was informed he had the right to legal counsel at his own expense,but contends his waiver was not knowing and intelligent because he waived his right five days before he received the document actually explaining the right to representation,as well as the charges and the intended method of removal.according to valdavinos,the denial of counsel was prejudicial because an attorney could have applied ruiz vidal to defeat the basis for removal during his proceedings.this argument fails for two reasons.
first,there is no evidence that valdavinos requested and was denied counsel after being notified of the basis for his removal.indeed,the record clearly indicates that valdavinos chose not to contest his deportation and did not want an attorney.nothing indicates valdavinos later revoked his waiver and requested counsel before his proceedings.second,even if valdavinos established his removal proceedings violated his due process right to counsel,he can not establish the prejudice required for a collateral attack under section d.
to establish the requisite prejudice,valdavinos needs to show that there were plausible grounds on which he could have been granted relief from removal in.reyes bonilla,at citing united states ramos,cir.a plausible claim to relief requires some evidentiary basis on which relief could have been granted,not merely a showing that some form of immigration relief was theoretically possible.id.at.because his prior conviction under section was for an aggravated felony,valdavinos ability to obtain immigration relief in was severely limited.see generally united states amador leal,cir explaining it is virtually certain that an aggravated felon will be removed in light of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of.indeed,clearly instructs that aliens convicted of aggravated felonies,such as valdavinos,are ineligible for discretionary deportation relief.moreover,valdavinos plea for relief under the voluntary departure statute is misguided,as that statute also excludes aliens who have committed an aggravated felony.see a.in fact
