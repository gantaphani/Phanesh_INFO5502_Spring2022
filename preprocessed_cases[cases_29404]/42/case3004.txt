background 
lau entered the united states on june,on a visitor visa which permitted her to stay for six months.she overstayed her visa,and,in may of,the immigration and naturalization service ins began removal proceedings against her.at a hearing before the ij on october,lau admitted that she had stayed after the expiration of her visa without permission.she applied for asylum,withholding of removal,or protection under article iii of the cat.in support of her application,she submitted numerous documents,including her own affidavit.see joint appendix,vol.ii at affidavit of lau may sui.the following is a summary of her affidavit,upon which the ij decision was substantially based.
lau was born in china on july.in,she and her moved to saipan in the mariana islands,a territory of the united states,where they each held a job with a japanese company.while living in saipan,lau gave birth to two children,both of whom are united states citizens.in,lau,her husband,and their two children moved to the city of guangzhou in china.soon thereafter,they began having financial problems.in,lau husband began routinely taking long trips away from home and,by,was no longer supporting the family.lau was required to go back to work.because she had lived abroad,lau was classified as a temporary resident and,as such,was only eligible for temporary jobs.she found a temporary job that paid chinese dollars per month.meanwhile,because her children were american citizens,she was required to pay a sponsor fee of chinese dollars per year for their education.
in,lau became pregnant.only she and her husband knew about the pregnancy.in december of that year,at five months gestation,lau had an abortion.lau explains the circumstances of the abortion as follows 
even as a and a temporary worker,i was still subject to periodical pregnancy check up every six months since i already had two children.this was mandated by the chinese family planning regulations and enforced through the employers and local government family planning office fpo.in middle of september,i found out that i became pregnant again.it was right at the time the periodical pregnancy check up was due.i knew that i would be in trouble because i did not have the pregnancy permission,nor the residency registration if i was found pregnant,i would be taken by the employer or the local fpo to have an abortion.i tried to avoid the test by alleging that i was in the middle of moving to another house.the employer smelled that something was wrong since i could not make the check up.i was suspended without pay at the end of september,and i was formally fired in december.we lost the only source of income and i had to sell our car very cheaply to get the cash for our daily expenses.
upon being suspended from work,i decided to move in with my father although the living space was very small,we would be able to save some rent.however,in october when we were ready to move,i was told that we had to as temporary at the local police station having jurisdiction over my father home.to complete such registration,i had to first sign a contract with local fpo and covenant that i would give no more birth to a child because i already have two children otherwise,we would not be allowed to move in.i lost the job but had two small children to take care of.i had no choice but signing the contract,without telling the fpo officer that i was already pregnant at that time.
having moved in with my father,i started to worry about the child in my body.i converted to christian in when andrew was born in guam.it would be against god wish and also my wish if i went to abort the child.i dreamed to have a miracle to let the child born.on the other hand,i was very clear about the consequences to our family if the child would be born.i and my children would be definitely removed from my father home,and where could we go and how could we survive t he fpo officers were policing around all the time and sent us report cards for us to give more detailed information about our birth control methods and the results of the periodical check up s.if one day my pregnancy was caught by them,then i would not only be forced to abort the child but also be immediately sterilized as well.i also heard many more horrifying stories that when the hospitals find that the child was the third or fourth child,they would be put to death after they were born.i felt so depressed,angry and hopeless without choice,in december of,i went to the hospital quietly and had the child aborted.it was a boy,he was in his fifth month.
once lau had recovered from the abortion,she began looking for another job.as a temporary resident,her job opportunities were limited,so she applied to become a permanent resident.she was informed that,because she already had two children,she could not register as a permanent resident unless she produced a hospital certificate showing that she had been sterilized.she opposed sterilization.she considered registering only her children as permanent residents,in hopes that she could avoid the sponsor fee and other extra expenses that were imposed on her because of their american citizenship.she learned that her children could not become permanent residents unless she did so as well,which again would require her to be sterilized.because she was not willing to be sterilized,neither she nor her children became permanent residents.consequently,she remained limited to,temporary jobs and remained subject to the annual sponsor fee for her children education.
in,lau began a job that required her to enforce the birth control policies at her place of business.she had been unaware of this job requirement at the time she accepted the job.not wishing to be responsible for the murder of her employee children,but also financially unable to quit,she deliberately failed to perform her family planning duties or pretended not to know what they were.she was eventually terminated in march of for failing to perform those duties.
regarding her own birth control practices,lau employers were responsible for ensuring her compliance with the applicable family planning requirements as long as she remained employed.consequently,each time she started a new job,the fpo officer for whom she had signed the no more birth contract would contact her new employer about her situation.when she became unemployed after being fired in march of,the fpo jurisdiction.afterward,
t he fpo officer came to our home several times a week to push me to complete the sterilization.sometimes she came with a police officer to give us more pressure.they told us this would never end until the sterilization is performed.at last,in early may of,fpo and police officers came and told my father that i must have the sterilization done by the end of the month,otherwise i and my children would be removed from the district.
on june,lau and her husband officially divorced.by that time,lau husband had long since stopped supporting the family and had taken up with another woman.on june,lau arrived in the united states at the age of.
in support of her application for relief,lau also submitted a document entitled selected translation of the implementing regulation of guangzhou city regarding the enforcement of family planning statute of guangdong province hereinafter guangzhou city regulations.the guangzhou city regulati
