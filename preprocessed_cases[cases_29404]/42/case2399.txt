background 
tariq was born in pakistan,but lived most of his childhood in the united arab emirates uae.when his father business ventures in the uae failed,the family returned to pakistan to escape his creditors.one of these creditors,a loan shark identified as mustafa,followed the family to pakistan,where he allegedly threatened tariq father and the rest of the family.the family then fled to the united states,where,on december,they entered with nonimmigrant visitor visas.tariq was thirteen at the time he entered the united states.
in march,in response to new regulations issued by the attorney general regarding the national security registration system nseers,tariq registered with the department of homeland security dhs.because tariq had overstayed his visitor visa,removal proceedings were initiated,and,on april,tariq received a notice to appear before an ij.at his initial appearance on april,tariq conceded removability but informed the ij that he was filing for labor certification and that he believed he was entitled to apply for adjustment of status under the grandfather provision of i of the immigration and nationality act ina,i,based on an application for labor certification filed by his mother before april,the ij then advised tariq that he should bring to the next hearing information concerning his eligibility for adjustment of status,as well as any application for asylum or other relief.
on october,tariq submitted his application for asylum,withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture cat to the ij.tariq employer filed a labor certification application for tariq on july,a hearing was scheduled for march,to consider tariq requests for asylum,withholding of removal and cat relief,as well as a motion for a continuance pending the outcome of his application for labor certification.
at the hearing,tariq and his mother both testified in support of his application for asylum and withholding of removal.tariq first explained that the delay in his asylum application had been the result of his parents divorce and volatile relationship,which had caused him to assume some responsibility for the care of his younger siblings.in support of the merits of his asylum application,he testified that the family had been forced to leave the uae when his father businesses had failed in order to escape mustafa.tariq testified that mustafa had followed the family to pakistan and had threatened tariq father as well as the rest of the family.he further testified that the police had come to investigate the threats,but they did nothing to stop them.according to tariq,this prompted the family to leave pakistan out of concern for their safety.however,tariq admitted that he was not aware of any attempts by mustafa to contact his family after they came to the united states.he also stated that he did not know of mustafa present whereabouts or whether he was still alive at that time.
apart from his fear of harm at the hands of mustafa,tariq testified that he feared persecution because he could not speak the language,and he did not regularly practice his muslim faith.tariq asserted that,as a consequence of these factors,he would be persecuted because people would attribute western political opinions to him.
next,tariq mother testified.she corroborated tariq testimony that the family had left the uae because of debts owed to mustafa.she also stated that mustafa had followed the family to pakistan.however,she did not testify that the family actually encountered mustafa in pakistan,nor did she state that the police were called in response to any threats.
tariq also offered an affidavit from his father in support of his application for asylum,which corroborated much of tariq testimony.however,tariq father did not appear as a witness.in response to the affidavit,the government proffered a printout of a nonimmigrant information system niis report which suggested that tariq father,or someone with the same name and birthdate,had traveled to the united states on a visa issued in islamabad in.additionally,the government proffered the asylum application of tariq father,which did not mention the debt or fear of mustafa as a basis for his application.
the ij denied tariq asylum claim because tariq had not filed his asylum application within one year of reaching the age of majority,and he had not established extraordinary circumstances that would excuse his failure to apply in timely fashion.therefore,the ij continued,tariq was required to satisfy the more stringent standards for withholding of removal.the ij determined that tariq had not established a clear probability of persecution necessary to be entitled to that form of relief.first,the ij concluded,tariq had not established that his fear of harm was based on any of the statutorily protected grounds.the ij concluded that any threat posed by mustafa was on account of a personal dispute between mustafa and tariq father,not on account of his membership in any identifiable social group.the ij noted that we have held that personal disputes can not serve as the basis for asylum or withholding of removal.the ij further concluded that tariq had presented no evidence that he faced a clear probability of persecution on account of imputed political opinions owing to his western upbringing,which claim,the ij stated,was supported by no more than speculation.
additionally,the ij noted that tariq father had not mentioned mustafa in his own application for asylum.this,the ij concluded,weakened tariq claimed fear of persecution at the hands of mustafa.the ij also added that the government niis reports indicating that somebody matching the biographical description of tariq father had traveled to pakistan undercut the credibility of his father affidavit.in any event,the ij added,tariq had failed to demonstrate a clear probability that the government of pakistan would be unable to protect tariq from mustafa or that there was any connection between mustafa and the government of pakistan.
the ij also denied tariq cat relief,on the ground that he had not suffered past torture and that it was not more likely than not that he would suffer future torture.
the ij then denied tariq request for a continuance pending the outcome of his application for labor certification.recognizing that tariq was entitled to the benefits of i,the ij nevertheless concluded that,even if tariq were able to obtain la
