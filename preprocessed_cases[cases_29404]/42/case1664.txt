francisco challenges his conviction for the united states after deportation in violation of a.the defendant claims that a virginia state police officer violated his fourth amendment rights by requesting identification from him while he was a passenger in a lawfully stopped vehicle.he also claims that his fourth and fifth amendment rights were violated when the government produced another man,rather than the defendant,at his preliminary hearing,and that his after dismissal of his first indictment for clerical error violated his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial.finally,he contends that department of homeland security regulations governing the testimony of agency employees interfered with his attempt to call an immigration agent as a defense witness,in violation of his sixth amendment rights to confrontation of witnesses and compulsory process.for reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
on the night of april,a virginia state police officer,accompanied by two police trainees,stopped a van with a defective headlight on interstate in spotsylvania county,virginia.trooper rodney ward approached the vehicle and discovered that it also had a cracked windshield and contained an unrestrained infant.in addition to the driver and the front passenger,there were eleven people in the van,including the defendant,francisco.
while a police trainee processed the identification of the driver and prepared citations for the broken headlight,cracked windshield,and unrestrained infant,ward asked the passengers for identification.although asking for passenger identification is not a requirement of virginia state police procedure,ward asserted that he personally did so as a matter of routine at every traffic stop.when it appeared that the passengers did not understand english,ward produced his own id and pointed to it,to communicate that he wished to see their identification.the passengers shook their heads,indicating that they did not have identification.ward observed that the passengers appeared to be nervous.
after returning to his vehicle,ward stated to the police trainee that he was concerned that the passengers might be illegal aliens.at this the driver of the van,who spoke some english,smiled and nodded.when ward asked him to confirm that his passengers were illegal,he again smiled and nodded.ward then contacted immigration and customs enforcement ice.ice advised him to take the van off the interstate at the nearest exit and await the arrival of ice agents.
an ice agent arrived and spoke to ward about what he had observed.when the agent interviewed the driver in spanish,the driver maintained that he did not know anything about the immigration status of the passengers.the agent then spoke to the passenger in the front passenger seat,who stated that he was a second driver of the van and that he and the other driver worked for a transportation company that had paid them to transport the passengers.he stated that he himself and all of the passengers in the back of the van were illegal aliens.
an ice agent then spoke to the other passengers in spanish,asking for name and immigration status.the passengers all stated that they were from mexico and were in the united states illegally.the passengers remained in the van until other ice agents arrived,at which point they were handcuffed and transported to an ice facility in merrifield,virginia,for processing.when the defendant fingerprints were entered into the ice automated fingerprint identification system,it showed that he had been deported from arizona the month before.ice held the defendant and other passengers in administrative custody.
ice agents interviewed the defendant on april,and on april.before each interview,an ice agent read the defendant miranda warnings in spanish,and the defendant indicated that he understood and waived his rights.in each interview,the defendant made a sworn statement that he had previously been deported and did not have permission to the united states.
on may,the defendant was arrested for unlawful after deportation,in violation of a.at a preliminary hearing before a magistrate judge on may,the government mistakenly produced an individual named francisco almaraz soriano,rather than the defendant,francisco.at the time,no one alerted the court to the error.on the stand,ice special agent jason fulton identified the individual present as francisco,though upon fulton stated that he could not be sure the individual was.the judge found probable cause to hold.
on june,a grand jury indicted on one count of unlawful after deportation.on june,in a hearing in district court before the honorable ellis,iii,counsel stated that the copy of the indictment sent to him referred to the defendant,francisco,in the caption but referred to another individual,roberto,in the body of the indictment.judge ellis requested the copy of the indictment from the court safe and found it to contain the same error.
the government later asserted that the error had originated in the attorney office.a member of that office caught and corrected the error on the copy of the indictment that went to the grand jury,but failed to do so on the other copies.at the time of the june hearing,the government had no explanation for the discrepancy and moved to dismiss the indictment without prejudice.judge ellis did so on june,and on the same day the grand jury returned a second indictment.
the defendant was arraigned before the honorable james cacheris on july,and on august,the parties appeared before judge cacheris on the defendant motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial and to suppress evidence.
the defendant argued that,because his second indictment was returned more than thirty days after his may arrest,dismissal was required under the speedy trial act,et.the court rejected this contention,stating that the speedy trial act required dismissal only where no indictment or information is filed within the requisite period,while in this case the first indictment was filed within the thirty days and dismissed without prejudice.id.a emphasis added.
the defendant also moved to suppress all evidence obtained as a result of trooper ward demand for the passengers identification,because it violated the fourth amendment and the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.the court held that it did not violate the fourth amendment for an officer to ask passengers for identification where,as here,he did so for safety purposes and the questioning of the passengers did not prolong the stop.the court also rejected the defendant equal protection claim.
on the scheduled trial date,august,defense counsel moved for a continuance.defense counsel informed the government and the court for the first time that another individual,and not the defendant,had been present at the preliminary hearing.the defendant stated that he did not wish to receive a new preliminary hearing.nevertheless,the defendant moved to dismiss on the ground that the denial of a preliminary hearing violated his fourth and fifth amendment rights.this motion was subsequently denied by the court.defense counsel also expressed an intention to call both francisco almaraz soriano and ice special agent jason fulton as witnesses in support of a misidentification theory of defense.defense counsel asked for a continuance because he had as yet been unable to secure francisco almaraz soriano.the court continued the trial until september.
also on august,at the government behest,the court ordered defense counsel to comply with the department of homeland security dhs touhy regulations in calling ice special agent jason fulton as a witness.those regulations provide procedures for subpoenaing dhs employees and prohibit employees from testifying about information obtained on the job absent departmental authorization.see.on september,however,the defense attempted to serve the government with a subpoena for fulton that was not in compliance with the regulations.the government declined service,and defense counsel made no further attempts to secure fulton as a witness.at trial,the district court excluded fulton as a witness due to the defense failure to comply with the touhy regulations.
a jury trial occurred on september,and the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the single count of unlawful after deportation,a.the defendant was sentenced to time served.
the defendant appeals his conviction on various grounds.
argues first that the fourth amendment did not permit trooper ward to ask the passengers,including himself,for identification during the traffic stop.the defendant does not contest the initial traffic stop rather,he contends that the stop did not give the police a legitimate basis to ask passengers for identification.that request,defendant argues,constituted a separate investigatory detention requiring reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.see terry ohio,d.because the officer lacked reasonable suspicion,the defendant argues,the request constituted an unreasonable seizure in violation of the fourth amendment.
the supreme court recently held in brendlin california that a passenger in a vehicle stopped by the police is seized by the stop within the meaning of the fourth amendment,d.as the court in brendlin explained,a traffic stop necessarily curtails the travel a passenger has chosen just as much as it halts the driver at.at.
if a passenger is considered seized for fourth amendment purposes when a police officer makes a traffic stop,that passenger may then challenge the constitutionality of the actions taken during that stop.see brendlin,at.at.here,that would include the officer request for the passengers identification.
we believe a simple request for identification from passengers falls within the purview of a lawful traffic stop and does not constitute a separate fourth amendment event.assuming a lawful stop,an officer is entitled to some chance to gain his bearings and to acquire a fair understanding of the surrounding scene.just as the officer may ask for the identification of the driver of a lawfully stopped vehicle,see,delaware prouse,d,so he may request identification of the passengers also lawfully stopped.no separate showing is required.
the supreme court has long held that ensuring officers personal safety is of critical importance in the conduct of traffic stops.it is well established that officers performing a lawful stop are authorized to take such steps as are reasonably necessary to protect their personal safety thereafter.united states hensley,d.
for example,the court noted in maryland wilson,d,that a police officer may as a matter of course order the driver of a lawfully stopped car to exit his vehicle.id.at.citing pennsylvania mimms,d per curiam.this safety interest attaches to officers interactions with passengers as well as with drivers,because passengers may likewise present to officers who interrupt their journey a risk of personal harm.because the danger to an officer from a traffic stop is likely to be greater when there are passengers in addition to the driver in the stopped car,wilson,at,the court held that they too could be ordered by the officer to exit a vehicle,id.at.
if an officer may as a matter of course and in the interest of personal safety order a passenger physically to exit the vehicle,id.at,he may surely take the minimally intrusive step of requesting passenger identification.the failure of a vehicle occupants to produce any sort of proper identification may heighten an officer concerns suggesting a possible need for backup,while the production of what appears to be a valid id may serve to allay them.indeed,both the eighth and the eleventh circuits have recognized as much.the eighth circuit has held that an officer may request identification from both the driver and passengers as part of a valid traffic stop.see united states,cir.moreover,the eleventh circuit has made clear that during a valid traffic stop,a request for identification and a subsequent check of the occupants criminal history constitute steps reasonably necessary to protect officers personal safety.united states purcell,cir.we do not require officers to make lawful stops at their peril.when an officer legitimately stops a vehicle,the identity of the persons in whose company the officer suddenly finds himself may be pertinent to the officer.
the request for passenger identification seems especially unobjectionable here.for one thing,it did not prolong the seizure.indeed,the supreme court has already held that police questioning that does not prolong a seizure does not provide a legitimate basis for a fourth amendment claim.see illinois caballes,d.in this respect,this case resembles muehler mena,d.during a lawful search of a residence,police officers asked occupant mena questions about her immigration status.id.at.mena contended that the questioning was an independent investigatory detention that,because the officers lacked reasonable suspicion,constituted a fourth amendment violation.id.at.the court held that,since mena questioning did not prolong her detention incident to the search,it was not a discrete fourth amendment event,and thus no additional fourth amendment justification for inquiring about mena immigration status was required.id.at.see also united states photogrammetric data,cir,overruled on other grounds by crawford washington,d reasonable to detain and interview office employees during execution of valid search warrant.
in this case,trooper ward request for identification did not prolong the stop,as it occurred while the police trainee checked the driver license and registration and prepared his citations.while trooper ward did contact the ice,which asked him to hold the vehicle for an administrative immigration inquiry,that contact came only after the driver of the van indicated that the passengers were illegal aliens.because the request did not extend the stop,it did not alter its lawful character.
moreover,the stopped vehicle had a broken headlight and a cracked windshield,and there was an unrestrained infant on the floor of the van.given the eleven passengers in the vehicle,their high level of anxiety,and the number of obvious infractions,the drawbacks of defendant claims about the officer conduct are apparent 
also contends that he was entitled to dismissal owing to his failure to receive either a preliminary hearing or a timely indictment,in violation of the fourth,fifth,and sixth amendments.we review the district court denial of this claim de novo.see united states pasquantino,cir.
the government concedes that the individual present at the defendant preliminary hearing was not the defendant,francisco,but another individual named francisco almaraz soriano.the defendant argues that this error denied him a probable cause hearing in violation of his fourth and fifth amendment rights.
this contention must fail.to begin with,the defendant did not challenge this defect in the preliminary hearing in a timely fashion.federal rule of criminal procedure b provides that a motion alleging a defect in the preliminary hearing must be raised prior to trial.see.b.rule c provides that the court may set a deadline for such pretrial motions.see.c.in this case,the district court set a motions deadline of july.nevertheless,the defendant did not raise the issue of mistaken identity by the motions deadline he in fact did not raise the matter until the scheduled date of trial.while the defendant contends that he was entitled to use this issue at trial as part of an identity defense,this in no way explains the four month delay in raising the issue or in complying with the rules.
moreover,the defendant indictment mooted any questions surrounding the preliminary hearing.this court has long held that the probable cause requirement may be satisfied either by a preliminary hearing or by indictment by a grand jury.see united states mackey,cir.because both procedures aim to insure the existence of probable cause before an accused is brought to trial,it has been a rule that the return of an indictment by the grand jury eliminates the requirement of holding a preliminary hearing.id.the grand jury indictment of francisco thus rendered moot the confusion at the preliminary hearing.
the defendant nevertheless argues that the confusion at the preliminary hearing carried over to the grand jury proceedi
