bradley arrived in the united states on august,without a valid visa,but was admitted under the vwp.bradley represents that he was intoxicated when he arrived,and he claims to have little recollection of his admission.nevertheless,bradley declaration establishes that,after his arrival,he signed a form,presented that form to a customs officer,and was admitted into the united states.according to bradley,
u pon my arrival at john kennedy international airport in new york,i was given a form to complete,which i vaguely recall completing or even signing for that matter i handed the form to the custom agent,who waived me through after taking a part of my form,without any questions.
bradley decl,errors in original.according to his form departure record,bradley was authorized to remain in the united states for the period ending november.app.it is undisputed that bradley remained in the united states beyond his authorized stay,and that he remains here still.
on july,bradley married cheryl losee,a united states citizen.in december and with the assistance of an attorney,bradley and losee applied to united states citizenship and immigration services to adjust bradley status to that of a lawful permanent resident.in conjunction with that application,bradley wife filed an visa petition,a prerequisite to obtaining a adjustment of status.that petition was denied pursuant to b when bradley and losee failed to appear for a scheduled interview.
on october,bradley was arrested and ordered removed,pursuant to b.on october,bradley filed a petition for review in this court and moved for a stay of removal.on november,we stayed bradley removal order,and on november,bradley was released from incarceration,pending our review.
before we address bradley contentions,we first review the purpose and role of the vwp within our nation body of immigration law.
congress established the vwp to facilitate international travel and promote the more effective use of the resources of affected government agencies while not posing a threat to the welfare,health,safety,and security of the united states.nose att y,cir quoting.under the vwp,a qualifying visitor may enter the united states without obtaining a visa,so long as a variety of statutory and regulatory requirements are met.among other things,a visitor seeking admission under the vwp must execute certain immigration forms,present a passport from a qualifying country,and possess a ticket.a.once admitted under the vwp,a visitor may remain in the united states for days.a.
although the vwp affords visitor aliens with great flexibility and convenience,those benefits come at a cost.most significantly,a vwp visitor must waive his or her right to contest the government admissibility determinations and removal actions,except that the alien may contest removal actions on the basis of asylum a b.accordingly,a vwp applicant must,prior to admission,present officers with a completed,signed form,nonimmigrant visa waiver form,b,expressly waiving,inter alia,any right to contest,other than on the basis of an application for asylum,any action for removal of the alien.b.this requirement is ironclad.indeed,a vwp applicant may not be provided a waiver under the program unless the alien has signed a vwp waiver,and an applicant who does not sign will be refused admission and removed,see a.
for a vwp entrant,the effects of this provision are severe.a vwp entrant waives the right to assert any objection to his removal.b.additionally,unlike the ordinary removal case,a vwp entrant removal shall be determined by the district director who has jurisdiction over the place where the alien is found,and shall be effected without referral of the alien to an immigration judge for a determination of deportability.b.but as the court of appeals for the ninth circuit has recognized,given the ease and convenience with which a vwp visitor may enter the united states,the vwp linchpin is the waiver,which assures that a person who comes here with a vwp visa will leave on time and will not raise a host of legal and factual claims to impede his removal if he overstays.handa clark,cir.with these precepts in mind,we turn to bradley challenge to his vwp waiver.
we first address bradley contention that the department removal order is invalid under woodby ins,at,because it was entered without clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence that he waived his due process right to contest his removal.in particular,bradley contends that because his removal order referred to his vwp waiver,that waiver is a ground for deportation,subject to proof by clear,unequivocal and convincing evidence under woodby.he contends that because the department failed to produce his signed form,it has not met its burden of proof,rendering his removal order invalid.we disagree.
although we doubt bradley assumption that the department must prove his waiver by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence,we hold that the department has easily met that burden.bradley admits that he entered the united states under the vwp,and although his declaration is vague,he concedes that he signed a form,presented that form to a customs officer,and was admitted into the united states.see bradley decl.consistent with that account,the record contains the top portion of a form,nonimmigrant visa waiver form,filled out in handwriting bradley,heathcliffe,date of birth,and stamped with bradley admission date of nov.app.bradley admissions,together with the documentary evidence,constitute powerful evidence that bradley signed a form,including a waiver of due process rights,before he was admitted to the united states.
this evidence becomes nearly irrefutable in view of the regulations and procedures governing admission under the vwp.under the regulations,each vwp applicant must present a completed,signed form,nonimmigrant visa waiver form,b,which contains the vwp waiver resp t app.during the admission process t he departure record at the bottom of the form is retained by the alien,while the immigration official admitting the alien keeps the top portion,including the signed waiver.resp t br.significantly,an alien may not be provided a waiver under the program unless the alien has waived any right to contest any action for removal,b,and any alien who does not sign the vwp waiver will be refused admission,see a.because agency action is entitled to a presumption of regularity,mcleod ins,cir,we presume that the department admitted bradley under the vwp only after collecting the top portion of his completed form,including his signed vwp waiver.although this presumption is rebuttable,bradley has adduced no evidence that the department admitted him in violation of its own regulations,and in fact,his declaration is entirely consistent with a routine admission under the vwp.we conclude,therefore,that the evidence is more than sufficient to prove bradley signed a vwp waiver,even assuming that waiver must be proven by clear,unequivocal,and convincing evidence.as we suggested at oral argument,this contention is underwhelming.
bradley next contends that his vwp waiver is invalid because it was not knowing and voluntary,and he urges us to adopt the knowing and voluntary requirement embraced by the courts of appeals for the fifth and seventh circuits.see bayo napolitano,cir en banc nose att y,cir.tracking the reasoning of these decisions,bradley argues tha
