wilfred and alice cooke petition for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia affirming the decision of an immigration judge ij to deny their applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the united nations convention against torture cat.the cookes are natives and citizens of liberia who allege that they fear persecution in liberia based on cooke political beliefs.we conclude that cooke suffered past persecution on account of his political beliefs but that the ij did not abuse her discretion in determining that conditions in liberia have changed such that the cookes no longer have a fear of being persecuted if they were to return.we therefore deny the petition for review.
the cookes entered the united states as nonimmigrant visitors for pleasure and remained beyond the periods authorized by their visas.in june,within a year of his entry,cooke filed an affirmative application for asylum and withholding of removal that included cooke as a derivative beneficiary.the immigration and naturalization service,now known as the department of homeland security dhs,began removal proceedings against the cookes in july.see immigration and naturalization act ina a b,a b.at an initial administrative hearing on october,the cookes conceded removability.in november,the parties agreed to administratively close suspend the case because the united states had granted liberians temporary protected status tps dhs moved to recalendar the case in november,despite the fact that tps was still in place for liberians.the ij held an additional hearing on march.
cooke seeks asylum based on his membership in the unity party of liberia and his opposition to the party headed by charles taylor,the national patriotic front of liberia.documents in the record and cooke testimony show that cooke joined the unity party in and was responsible for recruiting members to the party.cooke brother peter cooke was also active in the unity party and ran for political office as a member of that party.
in,cooke began working as an accountant for the liberian ministry of finance mof.at that time,samuel doe was the president of liberia.but in december,taylor launched an armed uprising to overthrow doe government.civil war broke out.in may,when taylor rebel troops approached the capital city of monrovia,the cookes left the city and moved with their children to another house that they owned in cape mount,tallah.
cooke testified that in june,he was at his home in cape mount when he heard gunfire in his front yard.when he went outside,he saw about seven of taylor rebels with guns.the rebels asked him if he was the wilfred cooke who used to work for the mof under the doe government.when cooke said yes,the rebels accused him of helping the government squander the peoples sic money.admin.at.they struck him on the head several times with the butts of their rifles.cooke fell unconscious.the rebels stripped him naked and tied him up.then they carried cooke to an abandoned schoolhouse and threatened to kill him.the townspeople began pleading for cooke release and gave the rebels a bribe of around.at that point,the rebels released cooke.he was taken to a clinic and his head wound was treated.the beating left a scar on cooke head and resulted in an enlarged blood vessel on his forehead.the ij observed that cooke has an indent going from side to side on the top of his head.id.at.medical reports indicate that cooke has a sunken ridge between the frontal and parietal regions of his head.id.at.cooke testified that he has a pulsing in his head.id.at.he was treated for this condition in liberia from to,and documents in the record show that he has continued treatment in the united states.he takes prescription medication for head pain.cooke testified that cooke also suffers from memory problems since the beating.
doe was killed by rebels in september.in november,the cookes fled to sierra leone,where they were given refugee status by the united nations.they lived in a refugee camp erected in a sports stadium.cooke was treated at a hospital in sierra leone for pain in his head.in,an interim government was established in liberia and the cookes returned to liberia.cooke went back to work at the mof under the interim government.taylor,however,continued to cause trouble in liberia.
the next alleged act of persecution by taylor troops was suffered by cooke in june,when cooke was in the united states visiting his mother.cooke testified that seven or eight of taylor rebels came to her house in the middle of the night and demanded information about cooke.the rebels said that they had heard that cooke had gone to the united states to raise funds for the unity party.they pushed cooke and struck her back with a belt.her back was cut by the belt buckle and began to bleed.the rebels held her children at gunpoint,threatening to kill them if they cried.the rebels stole clothing and money and then left.cooke was treated at a clinic for the wound on her back.upon being told the next day of the attack,cooke returned to liberia.cooke applied for a passport,which was issued on february.she then got a united states visa,which was issued on may.she entered the united states on june.both cooke and cooke testified that a scar from the beating remains on cooke back.
an election was held in liberia in july.cooke brother peter cooke ran unsuccessfully as a unity party candidate for the legislature.taylor defeated unity party candidate ellen to become president of liberia.cooke remained in his position at the mof.he testified that sometime in early,he leaked information to the press about government corruption by officials in taylor party.cooke exposed that the deputy minister of revenue had embezzled government money.
cooke testified that in august,police from taylor government burst into his office at the mof.the police declared that cooke brother had signed a document that would have allowed to obtain money from the to overthrow taylor government and that cooke was part of it.admin.at.the police took cooke to a police station.he was detained,stripped to his underwear,and put in a cell shared by seven other people and having no toilet facilities.he was later taken to an interrogation room filled with smoke.the police interrogated him about his and his brother involvement with the unity party.they also accused cooke of leaking information about government corruption to the press because he belonged to a party other than taylor party.after about twenty minutes of exposure to the smoke,cooke fainted.after two or three days of questioning,the authorities released cooke but told him to report to the station every few days.
cooke testified that he came to the united states in october.in march,cooke returned to liberia.he testified that he felt compelled to return to help his three children,who were staying with cooke sister.after changing the last names of his children and making arrangements for them,cooke entered the united states a final time on august.cooke placed in the administrative record a letter dated august,allegedly signed by a filing clerk at the mof.the letter advised cooke that the auditor general of liberia had ordered cooke arrested because of the government corruption that he exposed in.
on march,the ij issued a decision finding the cookes removable as charged and denying their applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.although the ij found the cookes evidence credible,she determined that the incidents described by the cookes did not rise to the level of persecution.alternatively,the ij determined that country conditions in liberia had changed such that the cookes could not show a fear of future persecution if they were to return.the bia affirmed the ij decision without issuing a separate opinion.the ij decision is therefore the final agency determination from which the cookes appeal.see e.
the ina gives the attorney general discretion to grant asylum to any individual who is a refugee.b.a refugee is defined by the ina as an alien who is unwilling or unable to return to his or her country of nationality because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.id.a a.an alien petitioning for asylum bears the burden of proving persecution or a fear of persecution on account of one of the enumerated factors.a.persecution is the infliction or threat of death,torture,or injury to one person or freedom,on account of a protected characteristic.ins,cir.intimidation and harassment alone do not rise to the level of persecution.makatengkeng gonzales,cir quotation marks and citation omitted.proof of past persecution entitles an applicant to a presumption that he has a fear of future persecution on the same basis.b.in this situation,the burden shifts to the government to show that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant no longer has a fear of persecution on account of a protected characteristic,or that the applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another area of his native country and it would be reasonable for the applicant to do so.id.b i ii.
we review the ij decision denying the cookes request for asylum for abuse of discretion.see hassan gonzales,cir.in so doing,we consider questions of law de novo and accord substantial deference to the agency interpretations of the statutes and regulations it administers.see bushira gonzales,cir.we review the ij factual findings under the substantial evidence standard and must uphold the ij decision if,based on the record as a whole,it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence.perinpanathan ins,cir quoting kratchmarov heston,cir.we will not overturn the ij decision unless the cookes demonstrate that the evidence was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.id.quoting feleke ins,cir.
on appeal,the cookes argue that the ij erred when she determined that the cookes did not meet their burden of proving that cooke had suffered past persecution on account of a protected status the ij determined that the testimony of the cookes and other witnesses was credible.the ij believe d that cooke was harmed by taylor rebels in and arrested by taylor government in.admin.at.the ij further believed that taylor rebels struck cooke on the back with a belt buckle in.the ij concluded,however,that those incidents of harm did not rise to the level of persecution.id.the ij reasoned that the cookes let some time pass between the occurrence of the incidents and filing for asylum,which indicated that those past incidents in liberia were not that significant.id.at.
persecution is a fluid concept,one this court has defined to include the threat of death,the threat or infliction of torture,and the threat or infliction of injury to one person or one liberty on account of a protected ground.sholla gonzales,cir citation omitted.we have reviewed the entire record in this case and conclude that the evidence compels a finding of past persecution based on a protected status.cooke was taken into custody,threatened with death,and beaten with the butts of rifles until he lost consciousness.this beating caused a permanent ridge in his head and injuries,including chronic headaches and an enlarged vein on his forehead,that require continuing medical treatment.on another occasion,cooke was arrested,interrogated,and imprisoned for at least two days.in a third incident,cooke wife was threatened and hit with a belt buckle in an attempt to learn her husband whereabouts.cooke children were held at gunpoint.he was forced to change the names of his children in an effort to protect them.the undisputed evidence shows that these threats,beatings,and arrests were the result of cooke involvement in the unity party and his acts in opposition to taylor party,including the exposure of corruption by officials of taylor party.viewed together,these incidents fall within this circuit definition of persecution.see,id.at holding that placement in labor camp,death threats,beating,and firing bullets into home fall within the definition of persecution bah gonzales,cir holding that past persecution was established where taylor forces burned petitioner home,threatened him with death,imprisoned him twice,and murdered his father corado ashcroft,cir per curiam ruling that credible evidence of a single threat of death on account of petitioner political opinion could suffice to establish past persecution.vonhm gonzales,cir holding that two detentions by taylor security forces in which petitioner did not suffer physical injury other than a bruised shoulder did not establish conduct sufficiently severe to constitute past persecution.
we disagree with the ij reasoning that the abuse suffered by cooke was rendered less significant by the fact that he did not seek asylum on an earlier trip to the united states.admin.at.cooke first traveled to the united states in may.he testified that he did not apply for asylum at that time because his plan was to raise money during the trip in order to get his wife and children out of liberia.his trip was cut short by the attack on his wife.after cooke was arrested and detained in august and his wife had made it to the united states,he quickly set about making arrangements for travel to the united states,and he arrived here in october.although he returned to liberia in march,he testified that he was compelled to return to help his three minor children who had told him on the telephone that armed men had been coming nightly to the house where they were staying escape from liberia.after taking steps to ensure the safety of his children,cooke came to the united states and sought asylum.we find that the reasons given by cooke for the delay in his asylum application were reasonable.in any event,given that the ij found the cookes evidence of physical beatings,arrests,and interrogations credible,we fail to see how the filing delay could impact the severity of such persecution.see ayi gonzales,cir holding that petitioner failure to apply for asylum on his first visit to the united states was not relevant to the question of whether petitioner testimony about the level of torture he endured was credible 
after considering the record as a whole,we conclude that the evidence compels a finding that cooke suffered past persecution on account of his political beliefs.the ij contrary decision is not supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence.the cookes have satisfied their burden of showing that cooke suffered past persecution,and cooke was entitled to the presumption that he has a fear of future persecution.see b.
this conclusion does not end the matter,however.as we mentioned above,the presumption of a fear of future persecution can be overcome by a showing that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the alien fear of persecution upon return to his home country is no longer.the ij,although erroneously finding no past persecution,went on to perform a analysis.the ij concluded 
e ven if the respondents were to show that they had suffered past persecution based on one of the five grounds enumerated in the act,this court would find that the government has rebutted the presumption of future persecution by showing that there are changed country conditions in liberia such that the respondents would no longer have a fear of future persecution based on one of the five grounds enumerated in the act should they return to liberia.
admin.at.if the ij analysis is sound,then the ij did not abuse her discretion in denying the cookes applications for asylum.
the cookes make two challenges to the ij finding of changed circumstances.first,the cookes assert that the ij did not properly shift the burden of proof to the government to rebut the presumption of a fear of future persecution.this argument is belied by the record.the ij assumed that the presumption was in the cookes favor,but concluded that the government has rebutted the presumption of future persecution by showing that there are changed country conditions in liberia.id.in reaching this conclusion,the ij extensively cited the department of state country report on liberia,a copy of which was submitted by the government as well as the coo
