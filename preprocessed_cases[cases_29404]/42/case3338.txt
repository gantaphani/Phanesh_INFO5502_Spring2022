background and procedural history 
regalado is a native and citizen of el salvador who came to the united states in february to escape the national liberation front for farabundo marti fmln his conflicts with the fmln began in,when several men showed up at regalado house and asked him to join an fmln demonstration that involved burning tires in the street and breaking windows.regalado said that he was opposed to these activities and refused to join the fmln demonstration.before the immigration judge ij,regalado stated that he refused to join because he had always been a neutral person and does not agree with parties that use violence to resolve their political problems.he further testified that he did agree with the fmln political activities,or with their system generally,adding that he has never liked violence and never participated with the fmln.the fmln members said they would settle this later,and attacked regalado on the streets a few days later.they beat regalado with sticks and rocks and told him that if he did not cooperate,next time would be worse.
regalado was attacked a second time in early.he was waiting for a bus when two men began to beat him with sticks.they identified themselves as members of the fmln and they told regalado that if he did not join them,he and his family would regret it.after this incident,regalado went to live with his father in another town but returned to his home in bosque del rio periodically to visit his wife and kids.
regalado was attacked a third time in.as he was exiting a bus,two men approached regalado,identified themselves as fmln members and began beating him.regalado testified to the ij that he almost died from this beating and one of his attackers told him that next time they would kill him.
the fmln is a recognized political party in el salvador that has significant representation in both national and local governments.the reports of the department of state submitted by both regalado and the government describe incidents of violence perpetrated by members of the fmln.
the ij denied regalado application for asylum,stating that he failed to demonstrate that he was attacked on account of a protected ground under asylum law.rather,the ij found that regalado was either the victim of recruitment by what appears to be,essentially,a guerilla operation,or simply the victim of criminal activity.in the alternative,the ij denied regalado asylum application because regalado failed to demonstrate that the government of el salvador is either unable or unwilling to prevent the harm he suffered and the future persecution he fears.the ij noted that regalado did not report the attacks to the police and,during his second attack,fear of the police is the only reason his attackers fled as soon as they did.lastly,the ij found that regalado failed to show that he could not safely relocate within el salvador.
the ij also stated that,as regalado failed to satisfy the burden required for asylum eligibility,he necessarily failed to meet the higher burden required for withholding of removal.moreover,the ij held that regalado failed to demonstrate that he was more likely than not to be tortured if he returned to el salvador,so he was not eligible for relief under the convention against torture.
the bia upheld the ij conclusions that regalado is ineligible for asylum,withholding of removal and relief under the convention against torture.the bia held that regalado did not have a political opinion that could serve as the basis for an asylum claim because he was not politically or ideologically opposed to the ideals espoused by the fmln.rather,regalado merely showed that he was opposed to the fmln violent activities for which he was being recruited,including demonstrations involving the burning of tires and breaking of windows.further,the bia held that regalado did not show that he was persecuted on account of a political opinion.the bia concluded that regalado failed to establish that at least one central reason for the fmln members conduct toward him was tied to his actual or imputed political opinions,rather than to his mere refusal to join their ranks and assist them in their violent activities.finally,the bia found that regalado was ineligible for relief under the convention against torture because he did not show that he was more likely than not to be tortured if returned to el salvador or that any torture would be inflicted at the instigation of or with the consent of public officials.
discussion 
to be eligible for asylum,regalado must prove that he is a refugee that is,that he is an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to,and is unable or unwilling to avail himself of the protection of,a country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.a a.in order to establish past persecution,an applicant must show that he or she suffered harm that rises to the level of persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground.to demonstrate a nexus between the harm an asylum applicant suffered and his political opinion,the applicant must show that he held,or his persecutors believed that he held,a political opinion and that he was harmed because of that political opinion.zhiqiang hu holder,cir quoting baghdasaryan holder,cir.even without having suffered past persecution,an applicant may establish eligibility for asylum based on a fear of future persecution.see lopez galarza,cir past persecution and a fear of future persecution provide separate avenues for establishing eligibility for asylum.
we grant regalado petition and remand with respect to his applications for asylum and withholding of removal.with respect to asylum eligibility,the bia failed to address whether regalado established a fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground,and with respect to withholding of removal,the bia also neglected to address the likelihood of future persecution on such ground.this court review of a bia decision is limited to the decision itself,and does not include the ij decision,except to the extent that the bia expressly adopted the ij opinion.see zhiqiang hu,at.in reviewing the decision of the bia,we consider only the grounds relied upon by that agency.if we conclude that the bia decision can not be sustained upon its reasoning,we must remand to allow the agency to decide any issues remaining in the case.andia ashcroft,cir.
regalado argued before both the bia and this court that he has a fear of future persecution on a protected ground,independent of his alleged past persecution.the bia rejected this contention without explanation.there is no indication,for example,that the bia considered the fmln transition from a guerilla group to a recognized political party with seats in government when evaluating the objective basis for regalado fear of future persecution.absent any reasoning from the bia,we can not find that substantial evidence supports the conclusion that regalado has not established a fear of future persecution or that he is more likely than not to be persecuted if he returns to el salvador.therefore,we remand to the bia to determine whether regalado is eligible for asylum or withholding of removal in view of his avowed fear.see mendez gutierrez ashcroft,cir i t is not for us to determine in the first instance whether the applicant has shown a fear of persecution.
upon remand,when the bia determine
