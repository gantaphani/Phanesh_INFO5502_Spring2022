petitioner jose eulalio seeks review of a dismissal of his appeal to the board of immigration appeals bia.argues that the bia improperly decided that the april,filing deadline in i of the immigration and nationality act ina,i,is a statute of repose,and is thus not subject to equitable tolling for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.he further claims that his counsel ineffective assistance constitutes a due process violation under the fifth amendment.for the reasons set forth below,we deny his petition.
facts and procedural history 
a.the life act and amendments 
the legal immigration family equity act life act,ina codified at,was enacted,in part,to provide a mechanism whereby the spouses and minor children of lawful permanent residents could apply more quickly for immigrant visas.see cong.rec,statement of kennedy congress established a system of temporary visas in order to provide a speedy mechanism for the spouses and minor children of citizens to obtain their immigrant visas in the,rather than wait for long periods of time outside the id.the life act also provided a method whereby an alien that had entered the united states without inspection or parole,but who was otherwise eligible for an immigrant visa,could apply to the attorney general for an adjustment of status.i.this adjustment of that of alien lawfully admitted for permanent allow the alien to remain in the united states,thus avoiding the undesirable alternative of forcing aliens to leave their families in the united states while they applied for a visa abroad.to qualify for this status adjustment,the alien had to file a petition for classification under on or before january,and pay a fee.id.
in,congress amended the life act to expand the class of beneficiaries who could apply for adjustment of status under ina i.among other things,congress moved the deadline for filing a visa petition from january,to april,for all aliens present in the united states as of the statute date of enactment.see i.members of congress encouraged the immigration and naturalization service ins to ensure that all potentially eligible persons have an opportunity to qualify for i.cong.rec.at,statement of kennedy.senator kennedy recommended that,if necessary,ins should accept petitions and applications before the april,sunset date that do not contain all necessary supporting documents,and allow additional documents to be filed after the deadline.id.thus,while members of congress encouraged flexibility,for an alien to take advantage of the adjustment of status provision of ina i after the avoid returning to his or her country of alien must have been present in the united states on december,and must have petitioned the attorney general for an immigration visa prior to april.
application 
is a native citizen of mexico who entered the united states without inspection or parole around august at or near san ysidro,california.on may,in tacoma,washington,he married rebekah hinman,a united states citizen.the have two children,both citizens,currently ages six and three.
in,worked to solidify his immigration status in the united states.hired the dedamm law firm to file a family visa petition and application for adjustment of status on behalf of her husband she signed and dated an immediate relative visa petition,form,on march,and submitted it to her attorney with the appropriate documents and fees.mindful of the april deadline,called the law firm on march,and she was assured that the petition would be on time.
ins,however,did not receive the petition until june,almost a month and a half after the statutory deadline.the learned that the petition had been filed late when appeared for his adjustment interview in july.turned to the dedamm law firm,but no one could provide proof that the petition had been submitted prior to the deadline.gabriel banfi,who supervised the preparation of the,claims that a dedamm paralegal submitted the application to the ins now the department of homeland security dhs prior to april.however,he acknowledges that the application might have been returned because it was not accompanied by the appropriate filing fee,as required by a.regardless of banfi claims,neither the nor anyone at the firm could provide proof that the petition had been submitted prior to the deadline,and on appeal,apparently concedes that he can not provide evidence of a timely filing.although the ins eventually approved the petition on october,it ultimately denied application for adjustment of status based on the untimely filing of the corresponding petition.
removal proceedings 
two years later,on may,dhs served with a notice to appear,charging that he was subject to removal under a a i as an alien who was present without having been admitted or paroled.on august,appeared with new counsel before the immigration judge ij in seattle.at the hearing,admitted to the allegations lodged by dhs and conceded removability.he argued,however,that he should be eligible for an adjustment of status under the life act amendment because he had in fact filed the petition on time,and in the alternative,the statute of limitations should have been tolled due to the ineffective assistance of his prior counsel.
on january,the ij decided that had failed to establish that he had timely filed the appropriate application and filing fee.citing our decision in munoz ashcroft,cir,the ij held that because ina i was a statute of not a statute of deadline was not subject to equitable tolling due to ineffective counsel.because he failed to file his petition on or before april,was thus ineligible for adjustment of status under ina i.accordingly,the ij sustained the charge of removability.
appealed the ij decision to the bia,arguing that the ij incorrectly classified the deadline as a statute of repose instead of a statute of limitations and that the statute should be tolled due to ineffective assistance of counsel.he further argued that the bia should adjudicate the application nunc pro tunc.the bia rejected these arguments,finding that the ij properly determined that ina i was a statute of repose not subject to equitable tolling.the board noted that the ij and the bia might also lack the authority to toll the filing deadline,as only dhs currently has jurisdiction over visa petitions.it further held that nunc pro tunc relief was improper and dismissed the appeal.
ii.analysis 
argues on appeal that the bia erred in determining that the april,deadline was a statute of repose not subject to equitable tolling.he asserts that the deadline is a statute of limitations which should be equitably tolled due to ineffective assistance of counsel.he further argues that the ineffective assistance of his counsel violated his due process rights finally,challenges the bia statement that it might lack authority to toll the statute of limitations merely because dhs now oversees the agency process for accepting visa petitions.
on a petition for review,the bia decisions regarding purely legal questions are reviewed de novo,giving deference to the bia interpretation unless that interpretation is contrary to the plain and sensible meaning of the statute.almaghzar gonzales,cir quoting simeonov ashcroft,cir.we review the bia findings of fact,including credibility findings,for substantial evidence and must uphold the bia finding unless the evidence compels a contrary result.ins,cir.we review due process claims de novo.ashcroft,cir.
as discussed below,our precedent compels the conclusion that the deadline imposed by congress under ina i constitutes a statute of repose,not subject to equitable tolling.we also find that ineffective assistance of counsel in preparing and filing a petition does not implicate the fifth amendment.because we find no error in the merits of the bia decision,we do not discuss the remedies among dhs and ins that were otherwise available to the bia.
statute of limitations or statute of repose 
there is a crucial distinction in the law between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose.statutes of repose are not subject to equitable tolling.munoz ashcroft,cir.whether ina i is a statute of repose or a statute of limitations subject to equitable tolling
