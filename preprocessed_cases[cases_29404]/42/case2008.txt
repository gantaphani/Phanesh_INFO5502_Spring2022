nabeel ashraf,who entered the united states in on a student visa from pakistan,was convicted on two counts of willful failure to sign travel documents that were necessary for his departure pursuant to a final order of removal entered in.he now appeals the district court denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal and its rulings that excluded certain proof that he had sought to present in his defense at trial.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
ashraf failure to obtain documents necessary for his departure 
when ashraf was released from prison in after serving his sentence for willfully failing to sign travel documents,he was transferred to the custody of immigration and customs enforcement ice and placed in expedited removal proceedings.he is subject to removal because of his conviction for being a nonimmigrant alien in possession of firearms or ammunition the firearms conviction,which is considered an aggravated felony.the government maintains that ashraf was also removable based on the fact that he had no lawful status in the united states once his student visa had expired and he had not been granted permanent residence.see ashraf united states,civ,at.
on may,claudia babic,an ice agent assigned to ashraf case,gave ashraf various forms concerning his removal from the country.ashraf refused to sign the forms and instead checked a box indicating his desire to contest his removal,but he did not check any boxes to indicate a specific basis for his objection.the parties dispute whether one of the forms that ashraf was given was a notice of intent to issue a final administrative removal order or was instead an unsigned copy of the final removal order itself.
on may,jay dehmalo,another immigration officer,served a failure to comply form a on ashraf and read him the form contents,which warned ashraf of the consequences for failing to comply with a final removal order.dehmalo mistakenly thought at the time that a final removal order had already been issued against ashraf,even though such an order was in fact not issued until june.
the government sought to remove ashraf to pakistan.dehmalo,as well as the other ice officers who dealt with ashraf,testified that ashraf refused to sign the travel forms because he insisted that he was a kuwaiti citizen who objected to being removed to pakistan.ashraf was born and raised in kuwait by pakistani parents.he maintained this position even though the documents in ashraf alien file,as well as officials at the kuwaiti embassy,confirmed that he was a pakistani and not a kuwaiti citizen.on the other hand,ashraf testified that he did not sign the forms during any of his contacts with the various ice agents because he was contesting his removal from the united states,and not because he disputed his pakistani citizenship.ashraf thought that if he signed the forms,he would be admitting that he was removable.he concedes that even if the government had agreed to send him to kuwait rather than to pakistan,he still would not have signed the travel documents because he believed that he was not legally removable.
ashraf also explains that he did not sign the documents related to his removal in may because he thought that his removal was already final based on his meetings with babic and dehmalo,and because he was in the process of contesting what he thought was the final removal order against him.that is why he sent a letter to ice on june,inquiring as to the proper procedures and deadlines for filing a motion to reopen his final removal order.when he did not receive a response from ice,he conducted his own independent research and came to the conclusion that he had days to file a motion to reopen the final order of removal against him.ashraf then prepared a brief with exhibits and affidavits in support of his motion.based on instructions that he received from the immigration court in late july,ashraf filed his motion to reopen with ice.the parties dispute whether the motion was properly filed,but this issue is not relevant to the present case.
on july,approximately one month after the final removal order was issued,kevin hardy,another ice agent,attempted to get ashraf to complete a pakistani passport application.but ashraf again insisted that he was a kuwaiti citizen and refused to cooperate.hardy then read to ashraf verbatim the government official warning regarding the consequences of his failing to comply with his obligation to obtain travel documents.ashraf responded that he understood,but he still refused to assist the government in obtaining the documents necessary for his removal.
he was next visited on september,by brandon brown,yet another ice agent.ashraf again refused to sign a pakistani passport application.brown then served ashraf with a notice informing him that he would not be released from ice custody and,once again,with a form a,warning ashraf of the consequences regarding his failure to depart from the country.ashraf also refused at that meeting to provide his fingerprints for identification purposes on the form a.
finally,ashraf was visited on october,by james schubert,an ice supervisory agent.ashraf once more refused to sign the travel documents for his return to pakistan and was again presented with form a warning concerning the consequences of his failure to comply.on that date,schubert obtained ashraf fingerprints for identification purposes.ashraf claims that schubert took ashraf hand and forcibly obtained his fingerprints against his will.
the government in the present case charged ashraf with four criminal counts arising out of his refusal to assist the government with his removal from the united states.three of these counts are based on ashraf individual interactions with various immigration officers on july,september,and october,for willfully fail ing or refus ing to make a timely application in good faith for travel or other documents necessary to his departure.a b.the fourth count alleged that,based on all of ashraf actions from june,through november,he connive d or conspire d,or t ook any other action,designed to prevent or hamper or with the purpose of preventing or hampering his departure.a c.
proceedings in the district court 
evidentiary issues 
prior to ashraf trial for his refusal to sign the travel documents necessary for his departure,the parties briefed,and the district court ruled on,the admissibility of evidence that ashraf sought to offer regarding his immigration status and his attempts to reverse his firearms conviction.ashraf also presented an expert witness to testify concerning the complexities of immigration law.he maintained that such evidence was relevant to show that he neither connived to avoid removal nor failed to act in good faith when he refused to obtain travel documents.the government,on the other hand,argued that such evidence was irrelevant because ashraf had already been denied habeas relief on his firearms conviction regarding his claim to legal immigration status in the united states at the time of his firearm arrest.and even if this evidence was moderately relevant,the government contended that its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,the potential to mislead the jury,and by considerations of undue delay.
the district court ruled that ashraf was precluded from introducing evidence that relates to his firearms conviction including evidence of his attempts to file his forms applications for permanent residence,his impression as to his legal resident status or lack of same,and any evidence as to his beliefs about those issues at the time he refused to sign the paperwork at issue in this case.such evidence was deemed inadmissible because t he firearms conviction has been adjudicated to its conclusion and could not therefore be relitigated in the present case.moreover,even though the court acknowledged ashraf belief that he had been dealt a wrong by immigration authorities before his removal process,these matters were not at issue here because the court was constrained by this court precedent and by a c to accept the final removal order and the conviction giving rise to it.
the district court also ruled that the probative value of such evidence would be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,confusion of the issues,and the potential to mislead the jury.ashraf proposed expert was thus limited to testifying about the events that gave rise to ashraf present conviction,and was not permitted to testify regarding ashraf prior immigration issues or about the february denial of his second application for permanent residence.
nonetheless,ashraf was permitted to discuss other background matters,as well as the circumstances relating to ice requests for him to sign the travel forms related to his removal.but he could not discuss his interactions with the immigration and naturalization service ins now part of the department of homeland security dhs or ice that occurred before he was asked to sign the forms.despite these evidentiary rulings,the district court ended up allowing a significant amount of testimony concerning ashraf immigration status,in part because the government opened the door to such testimony.
ashraf trial for refusing to obtain travel documents 
in march,ashraf was tried on the four counts arising out of ice various attempts to obtain his assistance regarding his travel documents.after both parties rested,but before closing arguments,ashraf moved for acquittal pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.the district court overruled his motion.
ashraf was convicted on two counts and acquitted on two counts.the jury convicted him of willfully failing to obtain travel documents in connection with his july meeting with hardy and his october meeting with schubert,but acquitted him of this same charge concerning his september meeting with brown.he was also acquitted of knowingly conniving or taking any other action for the purpose of preventing or hampering his departure.
in july,ashraf moved for a new trial based on evidence that he acquired in may pursuant to a freedom of information act foia request.this evidence consisted of an ins memorandum from regarding an investigation into ashraf immigration status in connection with his firearms conviction.the memorandum contained the opinion of an immigration officer that an application for permanent residency that ashraf had filed in should have been granted.ashraf argued that this new evidence supported his belief that he had a defense against his deportation.
the district court disagreed.in addition to concluding that these documents were not newly discovered,the court determined that,even assuming that these documents were newly discovered,they would still not form the basis for a new trial because the evidence contained in them in no way assists the defendant in asserting any alleged good faith belief that he had a defense to deportation in this matter 
ashraf was sentenced in august to months imprisonment on each of the two counts for which he was convicted,to be served concurrently,in addition to a term of supervised release and a special assessment.the district court also ordered that,upon his release from prison,ashraf would have to surrender to ice for deportation.
ashraf immigration status and firearms conviction 
ashraf initial attempt to become a permanent resident 
although ashraf immigration status and his firearms conviction are not directly at issue in the present case,these matters played a substantial role in his trial and are central to his appeal.this background information is therefore essential to an understanding of the case.
ashraf entered the united states from pakistan on an nonimmigrant student visa in august.in,while still lawfully in the country under his student visa,ashraf married monika taskova,who was a lawful permanent resident,but not a citizen,at the time of their marriage.ashraf applied to become a permanent resident soon thereafter.in january,while his application was still pending,ashraf informed the ins of the fact that taskova had recently become a united states citizen.but,as karyn zarlenga the custodian of ashraf alien file at the united states citizenship and immigration services uscis testified,ashraf application for permanent residency was denied in september because an immigrant visa was not immediately available to ashraf when he filed his application in.the visa was not immediately available because ashraf wife was not yet a naturalized citizen in,and the category of visas for the spouses of lawful permanent residents was backlogged when ashraf filed his application for permanent residency.
this meant that ashraf application for permanent residency had no chance of ever being approved because such applications may be granted only if a visa is immediately available when the alien files his or her application.see a requiring an immigrant visa to be immediately available at the time an application for permanent residence is filed in order for the applicant to obtain the requested change in status a i a an immigrant visa must be immediately available in order for an alien to properly file an adjustment application under section of the act.ashraf argues that his application should therefore have been denied immediately after it was filed rather than remain pending despite having no chance of being granted.had his application been promptly denied upon its being filed in,ashraf contends that he could have filed a new application immediately after his wife became a united states citizen in rather than waiting for the results of his application.
the ins mailed its notice denying ashraf application to the original address that it had on file for him,but he and taskova no longer lived at this address.in ruling on ashraf habeas petition regarding his firearms conviction,the district court for the southern district of florida found,consistent with ashraf claim in the present case,that he had previously notified the ins of his address change.ashraf united states,civ,at.zarlenga,on the other hand,testified in the present case that ashraf file contained a discrepancy regarding his zip code,but she did not recall any change of address in his file.
the firearms conviction 
on october,agents from the federal bureau of investigation fbi conducted a consensual search of ashraf home and car based on a tip from one of ashraf neighbors that ashraf possessed firearms and ammunition.see ashraf,civ,at.the agents discovered a number of firearms and several thousand rounds of ammunition.id.at.although nonpermanent lawful residents are prohibited from possessing firearms,ashraf was not arrested at the time because of confusion on the part of officers regarding his immigration status.
the ins report obtained as a result of ashraf may foia request shows that ashraf was not taken into custody when the firearms were seized from his home because an immigration officer opined that his application for permanent residency should have been granted due to ashraf wife being a united states citizen.this report also shows that an immigration officer advised ashraf around that time to refile his application for permanent residency.
ashraf claims that because the notice regarding the denial of his application for permanent residency was sent to the incorrect address in the year,he did not find out that his application was denied until the fbi agents searched his home in october.he submitted a new application for permanent residency approximately two weeks after the search.this application was not denied until february,after ashraf had already been indicted in the present case.
while ashraf second application for permanent residency was pending,he was arrested and indicted in september,pursuant to g b,for being a nonimmigrant alien in possession of firearms or ammunition based on the seizure of weapons and ammunition from his home and car.ashraf,civ,at.he was convicted by a jury and sentenced by the district court for the southern district of florida to months imprisonment,to be followed by years of supervised release.ashraf served the sentence for his firearms conviction at various federal prison facilities,finishing his time at a facility in youngstown,ohio in may.
his firearms conviction and sentence were upheld by the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit.ashraf was denied postconviction relief under.then,in january,ashraf filed a successive petition for habeas relief with the district court for the northern district of ohio based on his detention at the time in ohio,pursuant to,arguing that he was actually innocent because he was a legal immigrant rather than a alien at the time of his arrest.see ashraf tapia et,at cir.june,unpublished opinion.both the district court and this court denied his successive petition because t he testimony of the government agents,along with ashraf immigration documents,clearly showed that ashraf had not attained permanent resident status when he was arrested and the firearms were seized,contrary to ashraf argument.id.at.
the present appeal is limited to ashraf conviction for his willful failure to obtain travel documents,and does not include his prior firearms conviction or the adjudication of his immigration status.but ashraf raises these background issues in order to show that he had a basis for refusing to sign the travel documents at issue in the present case.the details surrounding his applications for permanent residency and his firearms conviction are therefore before us only insofar as they pertain to ashraf present appeal.
ashraf current status 
ashraf has now completed both his prison sentence for the firearms conviction and his prison sentence for the instant conviction.he was released on october.on august,he filed an emergency motion in this case to stay his removal because of his pending appeal and an alleged understanding with other agencies of the federal government who desire ashraf assistance in matters of national security.he was deported to pakistan the following day.on september,this court denied his emergency motion for a stay of removal because ashraf failed to demonstrate that he had any means to challenge the removal order or any likelihood of success in having that order overturned.united states ashraf,at cir.
the government filed a motion shortly thereafter to dismiss this appeal as moot because ashraf has been deported and is barred from reentering the country because of his earlier firearms conviction.ashraf nevertheless continues to challenge his conviction for willfully failing to obtain travel documents because he claims that this conviction might affect his ability to return to the united states in the future.
ii.analysis 
alleged mootness based on ashraf removal from the country 
the government argues in its motion to dismiss this appeal that ashraf claims are moot because he has already been removed from the country and,even if his conviction for willfully failing to obtain travel documents were to be reversed,he would still not be permitted to reenter because of his earlier firearms conviction.ashraf,on the other hand,argues that his current appeal is not moot because h is chances to obtain a waiver of inadmissibility with the attorney general would certainly be enhanced if he is able to reverse the wrongful convictions reached in the instant matter.he also disputes his future inability to return based on his firearms conviction because he raises arguments that he believes should result in the reversal of that conviction.
ashraf correctly points out that a defendant is presumed to suffer collateral consequences from a conviction even after the sentence has expired.see spencer kemma.although the supreme court in spencer declined to extend this presumption beyond challenges to convictions,such as to parole revocations,the court left the presumption intact where a defendant seeks to overturn a conviction because of the obvious fact of life that most criminal convictions do in fact entail adverse collateral legal consequences.id.at quoting sibron new york.this court has also noted that,in recent decades,the supreme court has allowed federal courts to presume the existence of collateral consequences.gentry deuth,cir holding,based on spencer,at,that the petitioner could bring a habeas corpus petition challenging her conviction for driving under the influence and for manslaughter even though she had already been released from prison.
the government responds by citing united states,cir,for the proposition that where aliens are deported and legally prevented from reentering the country,their challenges to criminal proceedings that would not alter their inability to reenter are moot.id.at because the defendant has been deported to the republic of mexico and is legally unable,without permission of the attorney general,to reenter the united states to be present for a resentencing proceeding as required by rule,there is no relief we are able to grant him and his appeal is moot.but the present case is distinguishable from because the defendant there challenged only the length of his sentence,not his conviction.see gentry,at pointing out that the commonwealth mistakenly relies on a line of decisions that addresses habeas petitions attacking the sentence rather than the conviction emphasis in original.the supreme court in spencer explicitly distinguished between challenges to convictions and other types of challenges to criminal proceedings.spencer,at.we thus conclude that the decision in is not inconsistent with applying spencer presumption of collateral consequences to ashraf appeal.
whether our court interprets spencer presumption as absolute within the context of challenges to convictions is not entirely clear.but even if one presumes that the mere presence of the conviction is not,in and of itself,sufficient injury to give rise to a case or controversy,it is equally settled by gentry that a petitioner need not show much more than the possibility of tangible collateral consequences for the burden to shift to the state to show that the consequences are not in fact possible.gall scroggy,cir citing gentry,at,and spencer,at.in gall,this court rejected kentucky claim that because the petitioner murder conviction would not affect his parole proceedings until the year,such consequences were too remote to constitute an injury.id.at.ashraf contention that his conviction might affect the attorney general discretionary decision to allow him back in the country similarly satisfies whatever minimal collateral consequence that ashraf might be required to show in order for this court to retain jurisdiction over his claim.see a a ii ii,iii providing that the statute prohibition on an alien who is forbidden from reentering the country at any time because of an aggravated felony does not apply if the attorney general has consented to the alien reapplying for admission.
this court has relied on a case from one of our sister circuits that recognizes just such an injury as a legitimate collateral consequence.the petitioner in chong district director,cir,challenged the board of immigration appeals bia determination that her aggravated felonies were particularly serious,even though chong had already been deported.id.at,cited favorably by gonzales,cir noting that an alien may challenge his or her removal even after being deported because the alien continues to suffer an ongoing injury based on his or her being prevented from seeking reentry for five years after the removal.as in the present case,even if chong were to prevail,she would still not have been able to return to the united states because her convictions would have remained on her record.chong,at.but the third circuit held that chong claim was not moot because if the court were to reverse the board finding that chong committed a particularly serious crime,the attorney general could exercise his discretion and grant withholding of removal and allow chong to reenter the united states.id.we conclude that ashraf appeal is analogous and thus not moot.the government motion to dismiss is therefore denied.
b.the district court denial of ashraf motion for a judgment of acquittal 
we now turn to the merits of ashraf appeal.the district court denial of ashraf motion for a judgment of acquittal is reviewed by us de novo,and we must affirm the district court decision if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to
