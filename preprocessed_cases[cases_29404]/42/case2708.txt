background 
jorge angel is a native and citizen of mexico.in the early morning hours of august,was patronizing mexico on main,a restaurant in charles,missouri.at around,local police entered the restaurant without a warrant,apparently acting on a tip that the restaurant was serving alcohol in violation of a municipal ordinance.when asked for identification,produced a valid missouri driver license.and five other mexican nationals were arrested and transported to the police station,where they were fingerprinted and detained.during this time,the charles police department contacted immigration and customs enforcement ice.while was in police custody,ice agent jeffrey othic interviewed him by telephone and determined that was an undocumented foreign national.consequently,agent othic issued an immigration detainer for,and on august,the charles police released to ice custody.then,agent othic conducted a second,more interview with.during this interview,agent othic prepared a form,in which he memorialized the information obtained during the two interviews with,including that was an undocumented alien who had last entered the united states on august,near douglas,arizona without inspection.the form also reflected the results of a computerized records search,which had returned an ident record indicating that had previously elected voluntary departure after an encounter with immigration authorities in,as well as agent othic understanding that had been arrested for a municipal ordinance violation of drinking alcohol after am.
on august,agent othic personally served with a notice to appear,charging him with removability under a a i.agent othic also filed the document with the immigration court to commence removal proceedings.the following day,was released on bond.between one and two weeks later,he received a ticket from the charles police department stating that he had violated a liquor license on august.however,there is no evidence that ever owned or operated the establishment in which he was arrested.on october,the prosecuting attorney for the city of charles decided not to prosecute the charge against,and on december,a charles municipal court judge ordered the arrest record expunged on the grounds that the arrest was based on false information and there was no probable cause at the time of the action to expunge to believe that committed the offense.
first appeared before an ij on december.following that hearing,he moved to suppress the evidence resulting from his arrest on august,including the form,and to terminate proceedings.following a removal hearing on january,the ij issued a summary decision denying motions to suppress and terminate,declining to grant his request for voluntary departure,and ordering him removed to mexico.on february,timely filed his notice of appeal with the bia.on february,the ij issued a written decision and order of the immigration judge,providing written reasons in support of the oral decision of january.the written decision explained that even if the initial arrest was improper,the manner in which ice obtained the information relating to was reasonable and in accordance with routine procedures.indeed,the ij could find no allegations in the record of any misconduct on ice part.this being so,and because the probative value of the evidence obtained by ice was not undermined by the alleged improper and unrelated activities of the charles police,motion to suppress was denied.additionally,the ij explained that request for voluntary departure was denied as a matter of discretion.
on march,filed a motion to strike the ij written decision,arguing that the order was filed after the ij had been divested of jurisdiction over the case.in a written decision on january,a panel of the bia affirmed the ij decision and denied motion to strike.the bia agreed with the ij that because ice officers had no role in arrest or initial detention,the information relating to alienage was not tainted and thus is not subject to suppression.further,the bia held that due process and regulatory claims failed because there was no fundamental unfairness in the process by which agent othic obtained information about identity or alienage,and ice had not violated agency regulations.the bia also found that the ij written decision of february,was properly issued and that the ij denial of voluntary departure was not an abuse of discretion.timely filed a motion for reconsideration,which was denied on october.this appeal follows.

motion to suppress 
i fourth amendment claim 
seeks to suppress all statements and documentation regarding his national origin and citizenship obtained by the form prepared by ice agent a result of his arrest by the charles police he argues that charles police officers egregiously violated his fourth amendment rights by arresting him without probable cause,and,therefore,the use of any evidence resulting from that arrest would render his removal proceedings fundamentally unfair under the fifth amendment.without the form,contends,the government can not meet its burden of proving his alienage and removability,and so his removal proceedings should be terminated.
the united states supreme court has held that the exclusionary rule generally does not apply in civil deportation hearings because the likely costs of excluding probative evidence outweigh the likely social benefits.ins.
important as it is to protect the fourth amendment rights of all persons,there is no convincing indication that application of the exclusionary rule in civil deportation proceedings will contribute materially to that end.on the other side of the scale,the social costs of applying the exclusionary rule in deportation proceedings are both unusual and significant.id.at.the costs of suppression in this context are unusual and significant because a deportation hearing purpose is not to punish past transgressions but rather to put an end to a continuing violation of the immigration laws by provid ing a streamlined determination of eligibility to remain in this country.id.at.thus,suppression would require the courts to close their eyes to ongoing violations of the law by compelling them to release from custody persons who would then immediately resume their commission of a crime through their continuing,unlawful presence in this country.id.at.even the objective of deterring fourth amendment violations should not require such a result.id.at.
however,the court limited its holding to circumstances that do not involve egregious violations of fourth amendment or other liberties that might transgress notions of fundamental fairness and undermine the probative value of the evidence obtained.id.at argues that the court reasoning applies in the instant case because the deterrent value of applying the exclusionary rule in a federal civil deportation proceeding is at least as great when the target of the rule deterrent effect is state criminal enforcement officers rather than federal immigration agents the government counters that application of the exclusionary rule in this context is precluded by the supreme court holding in united states janis.in janis,the court held that evidence gathered in violation of the fourth amendment by state police should not be excluded in a federal civil tax proceeding because common sense dictates that the deterrent effect of the exclusion of relevant evidence is highly attenuated when the punishment imposed upon the offending criminal enforcement officer is the removal of that evidence from a civil suit by or against a different sovereign.at.contends that janis is distinguishable.it is unnecessary for us to decide this issue because,regardless,we conclude that the police conduct at issue in this case does not rise to the level of an egregious fourth amendment violation.at.
what constitutes an egregious fourth amendment violation under is a matter of first impression for this court.the probative value of the evidence obtained as a result of arrest is undisputed we therefore examine whether the alleged fourth amendment violation was sufficiently egregious to transgress notions of fundamental fairness.in introducing the egregiousness exception,the court cited rochin california,as an example of an egregious constitutional violation.in rochin,police officers recovered narcotics,which the defendant had swallowed,by forcing the defendant to swallow an emetic solution to induce vomiting.id.at.the rochin court held that such brutal conduct,which shocks the conscience and offend s the community sense of fair play and decency,constitutes an egregious constitutional violation.at.
while egregious violations are not limited to those of physical brutality,ins,cir,requires more than a violation to justify exclusion,gonzales,cir w hile the lack of any valid basis whatsoever for a seizure sets the stage for egregiousness,more is needed.there is no evidence in the record that the charles police employed an unreasonable show or use of force in arresting and detaining,at finding that credible evidence gathered in connection with peaceful arrests by ins officers need not be suppressed in an ins civil deportation hearing.additionally,has not argued that the decision to arrest him was based on his race or appearance.see,at holding that deciding to stop an individual solely on the basis of his race is an egregious constitutional violation,f d at same.this is not an exhaustive list of the conduct that could constitute an egregious constitutional violation.however,has made no allegations of police misconduct beyond his assertion that the arresting officers lacked probable cause at the time of his arrest.moreover,this is not a case in which police officers invaded private property and detained individuals with no articulable suspicion whatsoever.the record indicates that the arresting officers were acting on information provided to them by the wife of one of the arrestees that alcohol was being consumed on the premises of mexico on main,in violation of a municipal ordinance.based on the record before us,therefore,we are unable to conclude that the charles police perpetrated an egregious violation of fourth amendment rights.
ii due process claim 
next,argues that suppression is required because the conduct of ice agents deprived him of due process within the meaning of the fifth amendment.specifically,contends that ice failure to inform of his rights or provide an explanation for his arrest,and the coercive nature of agent othic questioning,transgressed notions of fundamental fairness.we reject this argument for two reasons.first,the fifth amendment states only that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.const.amend.v.a removal hearing is a civil proceeding,and the fact that an alien has not received warnings will not render his statements inadmissible in a deportation hearing.see,united states,cir ins,cir.second,an alien must show coercion,duress,or improper action on the part of the immigration officer in order to demonstrate that his statements were involuntary.ins,cir.the bia expressly affirmed the ij finding that statements were made voluntarily,and substantial evidence supports this determination.
we accept the bia factual determinations so long as they are supported by substantial evidence on the record,lateef,at,and we give much weight to the credibility determinations of the ij,al milaji mukasey,cir.points to no evidence in the record rebutting agent othic testimony that answered questions freely and that his answers were forthcoming.affidavit does not mention any misconduct by ice agents and contains no reference to interviews with agent othic.indeed,the only suggestions of coercion or duress during interviews with agent othic derive from counsel unsupported assertions in brief,to which we accord no weight.ins phinpathya.consequently,we conclude that the bia did not err in affirming the ij determination that statements to agent othic regarding his alienage and lack of lawful status in the united states were voluntarily made and need not be suppressed.
iii regulatory claim 
finally,contends that suppression is required because ice violated agency regulations a and c.section a requires that an alien arrested without a warrant and placed in removal proceedings be interviewed by an immigration officer other than the arresting officer,unless no other qualified officer is readily available and locating one would entail unnecessary delay.section c requires that such an alien be advised of the reasons for his arrest,of his right to legal representation,and that any statement made may be used against him in a subsequent proceeding.additionally,c requires that the alien be given a list of the free legal services available in the district where the hearing will be held.
under the bia case law,a regulatory violation can result in the exclusion of evidence if the regulation in question serves a purpose of benefit to the alien and the violation prejudiced interests of the alien which were protected by the regulation.in re,bia.as a general rule,prejudice will have to be specifically demonstrated,unless compliance with the regulation is mandated by the constitution,in which case prejudice may be presumed.id.at citing united states,cir see also leslie attorney of,cir.to demonstrate prejudice,the alien must show that the regulatory violation harmed his interests in such a way as to affect potentially the outcome of his deportation proceeding.in re garcia flores,at accord ram mukasey,cir.
the bia decline d to find that a regulatory violation occurred because there was no evidence in the record demonstrating either that another officer,other than agent othic,was available to interview or that agent othic failed to properly warn that any statement he made could be used against him in subsequent proceedings.the bia may have erred in shifting the burden to to demonstrate that ice did not comply with agency regulations.see,singh mukasey,cir finding that the government had not established compliance with a where t he record does not show that no other qualified officer was available to examine the alien.however,we find that any error was harmless because has not demonstrated prejudice.
compliance with a and c is not constitutionally mandated and therefore prejudice can not be presumed.in re,at finding that an alleged violation of the warning requirements set forth in.could not be presumed to have prejudiced the respondent interests ali gonzales,cir finding prejudice can not be presumed for violations of ashcroft,cir same ins,cir finding that compliance with a is not constitutionally mandated and therefore prejudice can not be presumed gonzales,fed.app x,cir unpublished same.has not shown that the alleged regulatory violations potentially affected the outcome of his deportation proceeding.in his brief,contends that he was
