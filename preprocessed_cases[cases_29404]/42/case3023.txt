genet zewdie petitions for review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying her claims for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture convention.we affirm the denial of asylum and withholding of deportation,but we remand zewdie claim under the convention for further proceedings and consideration.
background 
zewdie,a citizen of ethiopia,entered the united states without inspection on august.she applied for asylum in september.after learning of zewdie presence in this country through her application,the immigration and naturalization service instituted removal proceedings.zewdie conceded removability and applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention.
zewdie claims that she was persecuted and tortured prior to leaving ethiopia and that if she returned she would also be tortured.we begin by explaining from the records and the briefs zewdie history in ethiopia and the conditions in the country at the time she fled.zewdie father belonged to the oromo ethnic group,the largest ethnic group in ethiopia,and became an active member in the oromo liberation front olf.the oromo people established the olf in july the olf supports autonomy or independence for the southern provinces of ethiopia where most oromo live.the oromo possess distinct physical characteristics and have their own language they live throughout ethiopia but consider the southern province their heartland.at one time,the olf supported the current regime headed by the ethiopian people revolutionary democratic front eprdf.however,the olf withdrew its support after discovering that the eprdf manipulated the election process.in,the olf took up arms against the government but lost to the government military force.however,the olf remains an active clandestine organization in ethiopia.
since the uprising,the ethiopian government has prohibited the olf from political participation.despite the olf efforts,government interference with elections still occurs.according to the state department report,the last election held in the southern region contained numerous irregularities,including fraud,harassment,intimidation,and political assassination.the olf has not garnered popular support because it has failed to organize an effective movement within oromo communities.thomas ofcansky laverle berry,united states dep t of state ethiopia a country study.the olf continues to oppose the current government in ethiopia and refuses to accept the government as a legitimate authority.
as a member of the olf,her father informed the oromo people of their rights and obligations,criticized the current government,and recruited new members.the ethiopian government arrested zewdie father and kept him imprisoned for two years for supporting the olf.the government also captured and detained other members of her family because they supported the olf 
we now turn to evidence presented by zewdie to the immigration judge.zewdie claimed that she did not actively participate as a member in the olf however,she admitted to sympathizing with the oromo people and supporting the work of the olf.zewdie testified that the ethiopian government did not approve of her support of the olf and retaliated against her by imprisoning her and having her fired from her job.
she claimed that her employer of ten years fired her for her connection to the oromo people and the olf.in an offer of proof,she submitted a letter from her employer stating that her termination followed the receipt of a letter from ethiopian government officials.zewdie believes that the letter from the government informed her employer of her oromo heritage and her connections to the olf.
her imprisonment followed a trip to her father village in mojo where she informed the oromo living in the community of their rights and responsibilities as citizens.during her encounters with the oromo people in mojo,she spoke out against the ethiopian government and encouraged the people to vote in an upcoming election for candidates that best represented the interests of the oromo people.members of the oromo peoples democratic organization opdo,an entity set up by the government to undermine the olf,confronted zewdie and told her to leave the area.
zewdie alleges that on returning to her home in addis ababa,ethiopian government officers arrested her for her political activities,including educating the oromo living in mojo.she testified that the government held her in maekalawi prison for days before releasing her on bail.during her time in captivity,government officers beat the soles of her feet repeatedly with wire whips and sticks.at the hearing,she removed her shoes and showed the scars on her feet and ankles to the immigration judge.she further testified that after her release,the officers informed her she could not leave addis ababa and ordered her to report her activities to them.zewdie disobeyed and fled ethiopia.
the immigration judge questioned zewdie credibility,but made no specific finding that zewdie did not tell the whole truth.the immigration judge denied all three claims of relief on october.the bia affirmed the immigration judge decision and questioned zewdie credibility.zewdie timely appeals the bia decision to this court.
ii.discussion 
zewdie first argues that she qualifies for asylum or withholding of deportation.we have considered her claims regarding these issues and agree with the immigration judge that zewdie does not qualify for either.however,zewdie remaining arguments for relief under the convention merit further consideration.see sivakaran ashcroft,cir holding that adverse decisions on claims of asylum and withholding of removal do not preclude a convention claim habtemicael ashcroft,cir remanding convention claim after upholding denial of asylum and withholding of removal claims.
we give deference to the bia findings of fact and overturn only if the evidence was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find her eligible for relief under the convention.see ins,d habtemicael,at b b.here,the evidence compels us to vacate the bia decision substantial grounds exist for believing that the ethiopian government would torture zewdie if she returned.see sivakaran,at remanding because the bia conducted insufficient to deny the convention claim habtemicael,at remanding the convention claim for further.see also guchshenkov ashcroft,cir discussing the increase in reversals of bia decisions despite the deferential standard of judicial review and criticizing immigration judges for their systematic failure to provide reasoned analysis for the denial of applications for asylum.
both the immigration judge and the bia failed to credit zewdie testimony and corroborating evidence.in addition,both failed to consider zewdie claims in light of the united states department of state report on ethiopia.we remand because the immigration judge failed to articulate a reasoned analysis based on the recorded evidence for denying zewdie claims.in order to put zewdie testimony in context,we begin with an overview of the convention and the conditions in ethiopia when zewdie left.
women and children make up eighty percent of the million individuals displaced from their homes worldwide of these women,twenty to thirty percent left their homes because they experienced torture in their home countries.zewdie testimony puts her in this category and her treatment falls within the specific purposes behind the convention.
the united nations enacted convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman,or degrading treatment or punishment to combat the use of torture throughout the world the united states ratified the convention and it went into effect november.article iii of the convention provides that a signatory country shall not expel,return or extradite a person to another country where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture in that country.foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of,see c habtemicael,at.the convention defines torture as 
any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted o
