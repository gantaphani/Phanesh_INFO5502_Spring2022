mario petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia dismissal of his appeal from the immigration judge ij decision finding him ineligible for cancellation of removal.for the following reasons,we deny the petition for review.
is a native of mexico who was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident in.in,vasquez was indicted in a texas state court for intentionally and knowingly possess ing,with intent to deliver,a controlled substance,namely,cocaine in,on and within feet of premises of a school see.health and safety code ann.a.judgment of conviction states that vasquez pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance in a zone.significantly,the judgment of conviction omitted the words with intent to deliver.received a sentence of six years,which was suspended to six years on probation.in,his probation was revoked and he was sentenced to two years of imprisonment.
was charged with removability via a notice to appear nta on the basis that his texas conviction constituted an aggravated felony pursuant to the immigration and nationality act ina,a a iii and a controlled substance violation pursuant to a b of the same statute at his removal hearing before the ij,admitted the factual allegations in the nta.the ij found that was removable for having committed a controlled substance violation,a b,but determined that the record did not support removability for having been convicted of an aggravated felony under a a iii,as the judgment of conviction stated only that was guilty of possession.the ij concluded that was not an aggravated felon and thus eligible to apply for discretionary cancellation of removal under a.
filed an application for cancellation of removal,and the ij held a hearing on the merits of that application.the government contended that the omission of with intent to deliver from the judgment of conviction was solely a typographical error,and that the record as a whole reflected that was convicted of an aggravated felony and thus ineligible for cancellation of removal.ultimately,the ij found based on the judicial record that had been convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver,and was thus ineligible for cancellation of removal because he had committed an aggravated felony.a.
appealed to the bia.the bia agreed with the ij that had committed a controlled substance violation having determined that he was removable on that basis,the bia did not reach the question of whether he was removable for being an aggravated felon.the bia did,however,uphold the ij conclusion that had been convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver,finding that the record established that was convicted of the crime as charged in the indictment.
the bia also found that had not met his burden of establishing statutory eligibility for relief,as he had not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the aggravated felony bar to eligibility for cancellation of removal did not apply.the bia dismissed appeal.he timely petitions for review.
the bia addressed two issues first,whether is removable and second,whether he is subject to the statutory bar to cancellation of removal under a.however,only the second issue is in dispute on this petition for review.
the bia held that is removable pursuant to a b i,for having committed a violation related to a controlled substance.because the bia found removable on this ground,it pretermitted the issue of removability for being an aggravated felon.
does not appear to contest the bia finding that he is removable for a violation under the controlled substance act thus,the only issue before us is whether the bia erred in holding that is not eligible for discretionary cancellation of removal.
this court has jurisdiction to review only legal and constitutional issues raised pertaining to removal orders.see mukasey,cir a c removing appeals court jurisdiction over final orders of removal but see a d holding that notwithstanding a c,judicial review is permitted of constitutional claims and questions of law presented upon a petition for review.the bia determination that an alien is ineligible for discretionary relief in the form of cancellation of removal is a question of law that we review de novo,deferring to the bia interpretation of the statutes and regulations it administers.see danso gonzales,cir gonzales,cir.
the ina states that the attorney general may cancel removal in the case of an alien who is inadmissible or deportable from the united states if the alien has not been convicted of any aggravated felony.a.an alien applying for relief from removal has the burden of proof to establish that he is not an aggravated felon and is therefore statutorily eligible for relief.see c a i.under the regulations interpreting the ina provisions for cancellation of removal,if the evidence indicates that one or more of the grounds for mandatory denial of the application for relief may apply,the alien shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that such grounds do not apply.d.applying d,the bia held that had adduced insufficient evidence to carry his burden of proving that he was not an aggravated felon.
first argues that the burden is on the government to submit evidence to indicate that the mandatory statutory bar against cancellation of removal applies.in support of his argument,cites a ninth circuit case,gonzales,cir,amended and superseded on denial of reh g by,cir,that he argues holds that the government has a high burden of production to establish that an alien committed an aggravated felony and is thus barred from cancellation of removal.
is inapposite.in,the ninth circuit held that,given the factual ambiguity of the record the government had not provided enough evidence to show that the petitioner conviction was for an aggravated felony.in this case,however,we have limited jurisdiction to consider whether the record is conclusive as to the offense of conviction,since,as a factual question for the bia to determine,it is barred from judicial review.a c barring judicial review of final orders of removal where the alien is found removable based on,inter alia,having committed a controlled substance violation.the bia held that the record of conviction establishes that was convicted of intentionally and knowingly possessing cocaine with intent to deliver in a drug free zone,finding that language of the indictment was incorporated into judgment of conviction by reference,notwithstanding the possible typographical error that was noted by the ij this is a factual determination,not a legal one.thus,we may not review the bia conclusion that was convicted of possession with intent to deliver cocaine as opposed to mere possession 
second,neither nor any case in this circuit establishes the proposition that the initial burden of production of evidence that the alien is ineligible for discretionary relief lies with the government.such a conclusion does not flow from the language of the statute or the concomitant regulation.see c a i d.
accepting the factual finding that was convicted of possession with intent to deliver,then,we may still review the bia legal conclusion that the crime for which was convicted may have been an aggravated felony that disqualified him from cancellation of removal.see a d 
having established that the burden is on to show that he is eligible for cancellation of removal,and treating offense as possession of cocaine with intent to deliver,we now look to whether he has satisfied that burden,reviewing de novo whether the offense qualifies as an aggravated felony under the ina.see omari gonzales,cir.
argues that under texas law,the crime of possession with intent to deliver is broader than,and thus includes conduct that does not fall within,the definition of aggravated felony in the ina.
aggravated felony is defined as including a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title.smith gonzales,cir quoting a b.drug trafficking crime is defined as any felony punishable under the controlled substances act,et.id.quoting c the controlled substances act defines felony as any federal or state offense classified by applicable federal or state la
