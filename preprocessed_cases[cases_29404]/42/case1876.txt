sergio petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia finding him statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal.
a citizen of mexico,entered the united states in.in march,the former immigration and naturalization service ins issued a notice to appear,charging him with removability under a a i as being present in the united states without being admitted or paroled.conceded removability but applied for cancellation of removal,claiming that his departure would impose exceptional and extremely unusual hardship,see b d,on his older son and adoptive parents,and in the alternative for voluntary departure.as a prerequisite to being granted voluntary departure,was required to,inter alia,establish by clear and convincing evidence that he had the means and intent to depart from the united states.b d.the immigration judge ij denied cancellation of removal and granted request for voluntary departure.
filed an appeal with the bia.on august,the bia affirmed and granted him thirty days to depart voluntarily rather than departing,moved to reopen his removal proceedings to introduce new evidence of hardship to his family that would result from his departure he did not accompany this motion with a request to stay removal,to toll the voluntary departure period,or to reinstate the voluntary departure period.the bia nevertheless granted the motion to reopen and remanded to the ij for consideration of new evidence in support of his application for cancellation of removal.
after a hearing,however,the ij held that was ineligible to apply for cancellation of removal pursuant to d providing that an alien who fails to depart voluntarily as scheduled is ineligible for cancellation of removal because even though he had filed his motion to reopen prior to the expiration of the voluntary departure period,he had failed to depart timely while that motion was pending.the bia affirmed.it agreed that d rendered ineligible for cancellation of removal,rejected argument that filing a motion to reopen tolls the voluntary departure period,and held that it the bia had erred in initially granting the motion to reopen.
we have jurisdiction to review the bia denial of a motion to reopen under.zhao gonzales,cir.we review for an abuse of discretion.id.
this case concerns the interaction of several statutory provisions and an administrative regulation concerning voluntary departure and motions to reopen.with respect to voluntary departure,a allows the attorney general to permit an alien to voluntarily depart the united states at the alien expense.permission to depart voluntarily under this subsection shall not be valid for a period exceeding days.b.to ensure that aliens abide by their obligation to voluntarily depart,d provides 
if an alien is permitted to depart voluntarily under this section and fails voluntarily to depart the united states within the time period specified,the alien 
a shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than and not more than and 
b shall be ineligible,for a period of years,to receive cancellation of removal.
the statute concerning motions to reopen states,an alien may file one motion to reopen proceedings.c a.that motion must be filed within ninety days of the date of the final administrative order.c c i.finally,d,provides that a ny departure from the united states,including the deportation or removal of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings,occurring after the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider,shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion.
the bia held that because he had overstayed his voluntary departure date,was in violation of d and was ineligible for cancellation of removal.despite the clarity with which the statute speaks and his undisputed failure to depart timely,argues that he is eligible for cancellation of removal.he contends that the bia is required to toll automatically the voluntary departure period during the pendency of a motion to reopen.according to,the statute and regulation placed him in an impossible situation because,if he complied with the voluntary departure order and left the country,his motion to reopen would be deemed withdrawn pursuant to d.if he stayed,d would render him ineligible for cancellation of removal.
in support of his argument,relies on the ninth circuit decision in azarte ashcroft,cir.the azarte court noted that the bia reasonable interpretation of the immigration statutes are entitled to deference,as provided by chevron,natural resources defense council,d.id.at.the azarte court nevertheless declined to defer to the bia interpretation,holding instead that it would be absurd for congress to provide an alien who elects voluntary departure with the right to file a motion to reopen when that motion would,in the vast majority of cases,be deemed withdrawn when the alien complies with the voluntary departure order.id.at describing this result as nonsensical.see also kanivets gonzales,cir agreeing with azarte sidikhouya gonzales,cir same.we disagree.
voluntary departure is the result of an exchange of benefits between an alien and the government.it is not granted unless the alien requests such voluntary departure and agrees to its terms and conditions.c.by requesting voluntary departure,an alien represents that he has the intent to leave the country within the specified time period.b d.made this representation to the ij but failed to depart.as a result,he gained access to the numerous benefits that voluntary departure provides,including the ability to choose his own destination point the opportunity to put his affairs in order without fear of being taken into custody freedom from extended detention while the government prepares for his removal avoidance of the stigma of forced removal and continued eligibility for an adjustment of status.ashcroft,cir.voluntary departure is not,however,without cost to the alien.as noted,it exposes him to civil fines and renders him ineligible for certain forms of relief if he does not timely depart.d.
the statutory scheme reveals congress intention to offer an alien a specific from the ordinary bars on subsequent return for a quick departure at no cost to the government.ngarurih ashcroft,cir.the purpose of voluntary departure is to provide an incentive to aliens to depart without requiring the agency and courts to devote resources to the matter.alimi ashcroft,cir holding that stay of removal does not automatically toll voluntary departure date.but if the alien does not depart promptly,so that the government becomes involved in further and more costly procedures by his attempts to continue his illegal stay here,the original benefit to the government is lost.ins,cir.what seeks is the opportunity to litigate to the last without bearing the attendant costs and the chance of winning outright,plus benefits the law offers to those who avoid litigation through voluntary departure.alimi,at.
furthermore,the remedy seeks is in tension with,if not opposed to,limits on the length of and authority to extend voluntary departure.first,b provides,permission to depart voluntarily under this subsection shall not be valid for a period exceeding days.see also f in no event can the total period of time,including any extension,exceed days as set forth in b.automatic tolling would effectively extend the validity of his voluntary departure period well beyond the sixty days that congress has authorized.second,a judicial extension of the period of voluntary departure is arguably contrary to f,which states,authority to extend the time in which to depart voluntarily specified initially by an immigration judge or the board is only within the jurisdiction of the district director,the deputy executive associate commissioner for detention and removal,or the director of the office of juvenile affairs.
disputes this conclusion because congress authorized aliens to file a motion to reopen,c,and did not exclude aliens who elect voluntary departure from its application.the bia has reasonably interpreted the governing statutes in light of the purposes of the voluntary departure scheme to permit the filing and resolution of a motion to reopen,so long as it does not interfere with the agreed upon voluntary departure date or the government interest in the finality of an alien voluntary departure.interpretation,on the other hand,permits an alien to request voluntary departure,exhaust his administrative appeals,move to reopen the removal proceedings,and overstay the period of voluntary departure,thereby depriving the government of a speedy departure.this is as if the accused in a criminal prosecution demanded not only the chance of acquittal at trial but also the benefits that go with a guilty plea and the acceptance of responsibility.alimi,at.accordingly,we decline to read into d the requirement that the bia automatically toll an alien voluntary departure period during the pendency of a motion to reopen.
for the foregoing reasons,we deny the petition for review.
the panel majority today unnecessarily creates a circuit split on an important issue of immigration law and ensures that a sizable number of aliens facing departure will be effectively unable to avail themselves of the statutory right to file one motion to reopen,regardless of the merit of their underlying claims.because congress could not possibly have intended this result,i respectfully dissent.
we are the fourth circuit to consider this precise question does a timely filed motion to reopen toll an alien voluntary departure period we are the first to answer in the negative.normally we begin with trepidation in the face of the solid array of federal courts of appeals that have reached the same conclusion,because w e are always chary to create a circuit split.alfaro comm r,cir.here,however,the reasons offered by the majority can not overcome the high hurdle of preserving the uniformity of the circuits.see id.at.
the majority relies on two principal arguments first,that it is sensible for aliens who receive the benefits of voluntary departure to incur the costs associated with not leaving the country in a timely fashion,and second,that courts have no authority to extend the voluntary departure period beyond the sixty days authorized by statute the majority errs by searching for congress intent almost exclusively in the set of provisions governing voluntary departure to the detriment of the provisions concerning motions to reopen.
in azarte,the ninth circuit exhaustively studied the history of motions to reopen and voluntary departure,including the codification of both rights in the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,and concluded that tolling was necessary to avoid creating an incompatibility in the statutory scheme,to implement a workable procedure for motions to reopen in cases in which aliens are granted voluntary departure,and to effectuate the purposes of the two statutory provisions.azarte,at.in particular,before codifying c,which governs motions to reopen,congress directed the attorney general to conduct a study on perceived abuses of these motions,and ultimately concluded that the proper way to curb abuse was to limit aliens to one motion to reopen,to require evidence of the factual basis for reopening,and to limit to ninety days the time for filing a motion to reopen 
in sum,congress addressed the problem of proliferating motions to reopen by regulating their quantity,quality,and timeliness.nowhere,however,did congress suggest that an alien traditional right to file a motion to reopen depends on the nature of the order of removal.in fact,c c i specifically declines to adopt this limitation,stating only that the motion to reopen shall be filed within ninety days of a final administrative order of removal emphasis added,which includes in its terms an order granting voluntary departure.
i do not quarrel with the general proposition that voluntary departure represents a bargain struck between an alien and the government.see c.i object,however,to limiting our search for the terms of that bargain to statutory provisions conferring benefits on only one of the parties to be sure,iirira drastically limited the amount of time available for voluntary departure.see azarte,at.the azarte court,however,correctly refused to read the departure statute in isolation 
v oluntary departure and motions to reopen both are the subject of a long,uninterrupted,historic practice in immigration law we find absurd the proposition that congress,while expressly codifying the tradition of motions to reopen,intended sub silentio to preclude their availability in a significant number of cases,likely a substantial majority.
rather than adopt this more sensible analysis,the panel majority imposes a hobson choice on aliens facing removal.any departure from the united states,including the deportation or removal of a person who is the subject of exclusion,deportation,or removal proceedings,occurring after the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider,shall constitute a withdrawal of such motion.d.under this section,an alien subject to forcible removal will automatically forfeit his motion to reopen once deported.should he attempt to avoid this result by applying for voluntary departure,however,he will still forfeit his motion,under the court analysis,if he remains in the country past his departure date which will often come too soon for the agency to consider his motion on the merits if,on the other hand,he complies with the departure order by leaving the country,his leaving would again constitute withdrawal under d.
it makes little sense why congress would codify a right to file a motion to reopen within days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal,c c i,if,in a substantial number of cases,the order of removal itself would result in forfeiture of the motion.the majority rule puts in the untenable position of having to choose between two equally undesirable alternatives.in re wilson,wl,at cir.march.
the result is particularly harsh when one considers that it operates to disadvantage those aliens whose good behavior has entitled them to the solicitude of the law of voluntary departure.to qualify for voluntary departure,one must show,inter alia,good moral character for at least five years before applying,and must not be removable for reason of aggravated felony conviction or for reasons.b,for example,is employed,has never been convicted of a crime,and has two children who are united states citizens.while his removal proceedings were pending on appeal to the bia,his younger son was born and was diagnosed with reactive airway disease and chronic allergic rhinitis,which in one doctor opinion would require constant medical attention not available in mexico.
the only means had to introduce these facts as evidence of exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the child,b,was a motion to reopen,requesting adjustment of status.this possibility of intervening circumstances is precisely what congress anticipated when it afforded aliens such as the right to file such a motion 
the panel majority believes it sufficient that its interpretation of the statutes permit s the filing and resolution of a motion to reopen,so long as it does not interfere with the agreed upon voluntary departure date or the government interest in the finality of an alien voluntary departure.but,it can not accord with due process for the resolution of motions to turn on the happenstance of how quickly an agency can clear its docket during a given period the possibility that two materially similar motions will be treated differently,depending on the extent of administrative backlog at the time of filing,should convince the panel majority that its interpretation leads to absurd results 
tolling,by contrast,accords with all of congress objectives in iirira.it preserves the right of all removable aliens to file a single,motion to reopen after a final adjudicative order of the bia.it also allows aliens to seek voluntary departure without fear of surrendering other avenues of procedural relief.finally,it does no damage to congress desire to place reasonable limits on the voluntary departure period the total time initially allotted for departure and hence the time available to file to reopen still can not exceed sixty days
