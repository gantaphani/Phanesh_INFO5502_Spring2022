marc antoine joseph petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia decision affirming an immigration judge ij denial of his applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.we have jurisdiction under.the ij found that joseph was not credible.the main issue here is whether an ij,who presides over the same petitioner bond hearing and removal hearing,may use her notes from the unrecorded bond hearing in reaching her decision in the removal hearing.we conclude that she may not.because the other bases of the ij and bia adverse credibility finding were also erroneous,we grant the petition for review and remand to the bia for it to determine whether,accepting joseph testimony as true,he is eligible for relief.
facts and procedural history 
joseph testimony at his removal hearing 
we summarize the testimony joseph gave at his removal hearing on january.joseph,a haitian musician,started his own band in his hometown of petite riviere de artibonite.in,president aristide visited artibonite.after hearing joseph sing,aristide asked joseph to create a musical group to support the aristide movement in the artibonite region.joseph wrote music for the group played the cornet,and was the spokesman and contact person for the group.
after this initial encounter with aristide,joseph became involved with aristide political party,lavalas.joseph organized meetings and protests for lavalas in the artibonite region and attended around to lavalas meetings himself.joseph testified that he supported aristide simply because he thought that aristide would have changed the economy of the country,and he had changed the poverty of the people and because he believed that aristide was the one to change that he tried to change the economy of haiti to put haiti at a higher standard.
on april,joseph held a lavalas meeting at his house.joseph testified that a man named dario,who was a member and director of ramikos,a group opposing lavalas,came to joseph house to disrupt the meeting.dario pressured joseph to join ramikos and threatened to kill joseph if he refused to join.when joseph asked dario to leave,dario threw stones at joseph,hitting him on the head.dario then punched joseph in the face.joseph believes that if the other people present at the lavalas meeting had not separated them,dario would have killed joseph because dario was known as a very dangerous man.later that night,between midnight and one in the morning,dario returned,broke down the front gate of joseph house,and started shooting.joseph believed that dario had returned to kill him.joseph mother told joseph to leave the house and go very far away.
joseph fled from artibonite to lincour,where his friend vladimir lived.vladimir later returned to joseph house and found that ramikos members had severely beaten joseph mother and raped joseph sister.on june,vladimir and his friends were playing dominoes in front of the house when they saw dario and around other ramikos members approaching.joseph,believing that dario had come to kill him,fled from lincour to.when joseph arrived in he stayed with vladimir friend,herold,for days before leaving haiti 
after joseph left haiti,on july,joseph cousin,dumarsais riker,visited joseph mother in artibonite.joseph and his cousin were similar in appearance and wore the same clothes.joseph believes that ramikos shot and killed dumarsais,burned dumarsais car,and destroyed joseph mother house because they mistook dumarsais for joseph.joseph submitted into evidence photographs of dumarsais body,his car,and the destroyed house.according to joseph,his mother and sister moved to avoid further harassment by ramikos.joseph girlfriend ended their relationship because of harassment from dario and ramikos.
joseph left haiti because members of the group of ramikos and dario were looking for him to kill him.joseph explained that ramikos had become even more powerful and is now associated with a group named.joseph testified that ramikos and can do whatever they want in haiti and would kill joseph if he returned.joseph believes that the groups opposed to lavalas,including,would know his name and would eventually kill him anywhere in haiti.
joseph entered the from mexico,without documents,on or around july.on july,border patrol officers apprehended joseph and issued a notice to appear charging joseph with entering the without inspection.on august,joseph appeared without counsel at his master calendar hearing before an ij.joseph was also unrepresented at his august,bond hearing in front of the same ij who denied his application for bond.no transcript of the bond hearing exists.
b.the ij considered her bond hearing notes during joseph removal hearing 
according to the ij bond hearing notes and contrary to the testimony joseph gave during his removal hearing,joseph testified that he left haiti because a group of president aristide wants to kill him.the bond hearing notes indicate that joseph also testified that he was a member of a band that played every easter.according to the ij bond hearing notes,joseph testified that dario was a member of a group,rather than an group as joseph later testified during his removal hearing.further,the ij bond hearing notes reflect that dario argued with joseph and threw rocks at him because dario wanted to break up joseph band,not because,as joseph later testified at his removal hearing,dario wanted joseph to join ramikos,the group.
on january,the same ij presided over joseph removal hearing.at this hearing the ij sought to supplement the record with her notes from joseph bond hearing.joseph counsel challenged the propriety of including the bond hearing notes in the record of joseph removal hearing because there was no transcript of the bond hearing.nonetheless,the ij bond hearing notes were typed into a bond memorandum and included in the record of joseph removal hearing.
c.the ij and bia decisions 
on january,the ij denied joseph claim for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under cat because she had very real concerns regarding the credibility of joseph claim.the ij found that joseph submitted a detailed declaration and detailed testimony at his removal hearing.because of that detail,the ij stated that she would have expected a more thorough explanation,during the bond hearing,with respect to joseph fear,his past persecution.specifically,the ij would have expected to have been told of persecution and assaults on joseph family when she asked joseph at his bond hearing why he had left haiti.
the bia affirmed the ij decision and specifically stated that it found that the record supported the ij adverse credibility finding.the bia found no error on the part of the ij in noting the inconsistencies between the claim presented by joseph during his bond hearing and that presented subsequently during his merits hearing.the bia also denied joseph motion to remand,which joseph had filed alongside his appeal.
ii.standard and scope of review 
where the bia cites matter of burbano,and does not express disagreement with any part of the ij decision,the bia adopts the ij decision in its entirety.see,abebe gonzales,cir en banc.where,however,the bia conducts its own review of the evidence and law,the court review is limited to the bia decision,except to the extent the ij opinion is expressly adopted.hosseini gonzales,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the bia cited matter of burbano and emphasized that it found the ij adverse credibility finding supported by the record.after the bia explained why it agreed with the ij adverse credibility finding,it addressed joseph arguments that the ij had improperly based her adverse credibility finding on joseph testimony at the bond hearing.because the bia expressly adopted the ij decision under matter of burbano,but also provided its own review of the evidence and the law,we review both the ij and the bia decision.hosseini,at.
credibility determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard.holder,cir under the substantial evidence standard,credibility findings are upheld unless the evidence compels a contrary result.don gonzales,cir.
iii.discussion 
a.the ij erred by considering her bond hearing notes during the removal hearing 
we must decide whether the ij erred in considering her unrecorded notes from joseph bond hearing during his later removal hearing.the bia found that the ij had not erred in noting the inconsistencies between the claim presented by joseph during his bond hearing,and that presented subsequently during his merits hearing.joseph argues that the ij consideration of her notes from joseph unrecorded bond hearing was an error.in support of his claim,joseph cites d.this regulation,which pertains to bond hearings,states that c onsideration by the ij of an application or request of a respondent regarding custody or bond under this section shall be separate and apart from,and shall form no part of,any deportation or removal hearing or proceedings.emphasis added 
in response,the government cites a,pertaining to removal hearings,which states that the ij may receive in evidence any oral or written statement that is material and relevant to any issue in the case previously made by the respondent or any other person during any investigation,examination,hearing,or trial.the government argues that this regulation renders the ij bond hearing notes admissible.we hold that a does not apply in this case.
a does not apply here 
at first blush,d and a seem to be in conflict.we need not,however,resolve that conflict here or attempt to harmonize the regulations because a does not apply to joseph case.section a allows the receipt in evidence of an oral or written statement made by the asylum seeker,or another person,during any investigation,examination,hearing,or trial.here,the evidence was not of such a statement rather,the evidence in question was the ij own notes,not part of the record,taken by the ij during joseph unrecorded,uncounseled bond hearing.no transcript exists for joseph bond hearing no effort was made to introduce specific evidence of the precise content of joseph oral statements made at his unrecorded bond hearing.because a does not apply,we need not reconcile this regulation with d or determine which regulation,if any,would govern in the event of a conflict.moreover,as we discuss below,d does not,as a rule,permit an ij sitting in removal proceedings to rely on her notes from a bond hearing.
bond and removal hearings are distinct and evidence from a bond hearing should not be considered in a removal hearing 
the case law,although sparse,supports joseph argument that d precludes the ij from considering evidence from a bond hearing,in this case the ij notes,in determining a petitioner credibility at a removal hearing.the bia has noted that bond and removal are distinctly separate proceedings.in re,citing d see also bobb attorney of,cir noting an ij decision,affirmed by the bia,that a determination at the bond hearing that an alien conviction was not an aggravated felony was not controlling in the removal hearing pina horgan,wl,dist.lexis,at,noting that bond and removal hearings are separate.
although the ninth circuit has not interpreted d,the seventh circuit discussed d in ins,cir.in that case,the petitioner,asserted a denial of his due process rights because the ij presided over both the bond hearing and the removal hearing.id.at.the seventh circuit found that nothing in the regulations precluded the ij from conducting both proceedings.id.further,the court concluded that the ij did not err because the ij did not use any information provided at the bond hearing to render his decision in removal hearing.id.in so holding,the court suggests that it would have been improper for the ij to consider any of the information provided at the bond hearing to render a decision at the removal hearing.this is exactly what happened in joseph case.in this case,although the ij properly presided over both proceedings,unlike the ij in,the ij did use the information she gathered at joseph bond hearing to find joseph not credible in his removal hearing.
the bia has not specifically interpreted this aspect of d in a published opinion.the case most closely on point is in re adeniji,in which the bia held that evidence presented in an alien removal hearing,which was conducted before the bond hearing,could not be considered during the separate bond hearing unless it was made part of the bond record,en banc.although in re adeniji indicates that evidence from a removal hearing,if made part of the record,can be considered in a bond hearing,it gives us strong reason to believe that the converse is not true.that is,in re adeniji suggests that evidence from a bond hearing should not be considered during a removal hearing.in particular,in her concurrence and dissent,bia member lory rosenberg explains that the underlying purpose of the regulation d is not to limit the information an ij may consider in redetermining bond,but to ensure that evidence presented in the far more informal bond hearing does not taint the ultimate adjudication of the charges of removability.id.at.thus,the bia decision that evidence from a removal hearing may be considered in redetermining bond is notwithstanding the rule that evidence presented at a bond hearing can not be used to establish removability.id.we find this explanation highly persuasive in support of our conclusion that d precluded the ij in joseph case from relying on her notes from the bond hearing.
the immigration court practice manual also suggests that joseph interpretation of the regulation is correct.section a cites d and states that b ond proceedings are separate from removal proceedings.further,e iv of the immigration court practice manual states that,in a bond hearing,the ij creates a record,which is kept separate from the records of proceedings for other immigration court proceedings involving the alien.there would be little utility in keeping separate records of the proceedings if the ij could freely commingle these records.
the immigration court practice manual also shows that the purpose of a bond hearing departs significantly from the purpose of an asylum hearing.according to the practice manual,the purpose of a bond hearing is for the detained immigrant to make an oral statement addressing whether the alien release would pose a danger to property or persons,whether the alien is likely to appear for future immigration proceedings,and whether the alien poses a danger to national security.practice manual e vi.thus,the purpose of a bond hearing,to determine whether an alien in custody should be released,markedly differs from the purpose of a removal hearing,which is to determine whether the petitioner is removable and whether he or she is eligible for relief from removal.
therefore,the ij in joseph case strayed from the purpose of a bond hearing when she apparently asked him why he left haiti.further,the ij had no reason to expect to be told of persecution and assaults on joseph family during his bond hearing.the ij impermissibly considered her notes from joseph bond hearing to evaluate joseph credibility during his removal hearing.thus,the inconsistencies between joseph bond hearing testimony according to the ij notes and his testimony during his removal hearing do not constitute substantial evidence to support the ij adverse credibility finding.
statements from less formal proceedings do not undermine an applicant credibility during the applicant removal hearing 
our precedent gives us reason to preclude the ij from relying in removal proceedings on notes from a bond hearing.we have rejected adverse credibility findings that relied on differences between statements a petitioner made during removal proceedings and those made during less formal,routinely unrecorded proceedings.two examples of these less formal proceedings are airport interviews and affirmative asylum interviews.
in singh ins,we recognized that r equiring evidentiary detail from an airport interview not only ignores the reality of the interview process,but would,in effect,create an unprecedented preasylum process,cir.we therefore held that the agency adverse credibility finding could not rest solely on the lack of detail in the applicant initial statements at the airport as compared to his late
