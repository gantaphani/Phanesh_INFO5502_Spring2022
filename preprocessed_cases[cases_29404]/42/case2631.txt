background 
rizaja pelinkovic applied for asylum in.his wife,sanija,and his son,svebor,made derivative claims under d.the pelinkovics are muslims and ethnic albanians from the city of bar in montenegro,a part of the former yugoslavia.they fled their home for the united states in february of due to rizaja fear that the military would forcibly reactivate him and send him to croatia to fight in a war in which he did not believe.the family also complained of generalized discrimination,mistreatment,and economic hardship based on their muslim faith and albanian ancestry.
prior to the pelinkovics departure,yugoslavia consisted of autonomous provinces,including serbia,montenegro,croatia,bosnia and herzegovina,macedonia,and slovenia.capric ashcroft,cir describing in detail the balkan political landscape.under the rule of serbian president slobodan milosevic,many of the provinces seceded,including croatia.croatia secession resulted in armed conflict with serbia and,by association,montenegro.it was this civil war with croatia from which the pelinkovics fled.serbia and montenegro later joined in april of to form the federal republic of yugoslavia fry.see id.
the immigration judge hearing the pelinkovics case determined that rizaja fear of forced military service or punishment for failure to perform such service was unsupported.the judge reiterated the position that a country may require military service of its citizens.he also noted that according to the state department,fry citizens avoiding compulsory military service were not pursued,harassed,or arrested.the fact that rizaja brother resided in bar with similar military service obligations which he had heretofore avoided also cut against rizaja claim that he would be persecuted upon his return to montenegro.
the immigration judge found no other basis on which to grant asylum,noting that the generally poor country conditions cited by the pelinkovics affected the entire population and that there was not enough evidence in the record to support granting them asylum based solely on their religious and ethnic minority status.
on appeal,the board of immigration appeals bia upheld the immigration judge determination.we affirmed the bia may,decision in an unpublished order dated february.
the pelinkovics then filed two petitions requesting the bia to reopen their case.the first petition,filed in september of,was based on changed country conditions in the fry.in late,milosevic was still in power and had begun military action in kosovo a province within serbia,which was struggling for independence.see capric,at.the majority of kosovars were muslim and of ethnic albanian descent,like the pelinkovics.montenegro,although still unified with serbia in the fry,was critical of milosevic policies toward kosovo and his brutal police and military campaign aimed at the ethnic albanian separatists.see id.relations between serbia and montenegro were strained,with predictions of civil war.
in his petition to reopen based on changed country conditions,rizaja reiterated his concern that if deported to montenegro,he,along with his son,svebor,who was now of military age,would be forced by serbia to fight in kosovo against fellow albanians.he stressed that because of milosevic campaign against ethnic albanians in kosovo and the weakness of the montenegrin government,conditions for ethnic albanians in montenegro had also deteriorated.in support of his petition,he attached his affidavit,a military summons dated march,and numerous news reports about the continuing destabilization of the balkans and isolated instances of violence against ethnic albanians.
the second petition,filed in april of,was based on congress enactment of the convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat,of the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of,stat.the cat was made judicially enforceable through c and b.see oforji ashcroft,cir.the pelinkovics asked the bia to remand their case to the immigration judge to permit them all to apply for relief under the cat.because of conditions in montenegro,they urged that they could present credible claims that each of them would be tortured upon their return.specifically,they cited mounting strife between serbia and montenegro and alleged that civil war was imminent,in which case montenegrin ethnic albanians would likely face the same atrocities as the kosovars.the pelinkovics supported this petition with their affidavits and additional news stories on the mounting tension between serbia and montenegro.they also included articles on nato bombing of milosevic forces,which began in march of,in response to his incursion into kosovo.
the bia denied both petitions on july.as to the september motion to reopen based on changed country conditions,it found that the evidence presented by the pelinkovics merely demonstrated escalating conditions that had no direct effect on rizaja asylum claim.the bia stated that the pelinkovics failed to convince the board that there was a reasonable possibility they would be persecuted by serbian nationalists because of their albanian ethnicity.the bia also reiterated its position that a government has the right to require military service and enforce such a requirement with reasonable penalties.as to the april cat claim,the bia found that none of the evidence presented established that any of the pelinkovics would be subject to torture upon their return home.
the pelinkovics now appeal the bia decisions not to reopen their case based on changed country conditions or the cat.we affirm the decisions of the bia and deny the pelinkovics petition for review.
ii.analysis 
we review the bia decision not to reopen an asylum claim under the highly deferential abuse of discretion standard.a dandan ashcroft,cir.motions to reopen are strongly disfavored.selimi ashcroft,cir citing ins doherty,d.
the supreme court has identified three independent grounds upon which the bia can deny a motion to reopen failure to establish a prima facie case for the relief sought failure to introduce previously unavailable,material evidence and a determination that even if these requirements were satisfied,the movant would not be entitled to the discretionary grant of relief which he sought.mansour ins,cir quoting doherty,at.we will uphold the bia decisions to deny the pelinkovics motions to reopen unless they were made without a rational explanation,inexplicably departed from established policies,or rested on an impermissible basis such as invidious discrimination against a particular race or group.mansour,at quoting wijeratne ins,cir.
motion to reopen based on changed country conditions 
the bia refused to reopen the pelinkovics asylum application due to changed country conditions because the evidence presented with the september petition did not establish prima facie eligibility for asylum or withholding of deportation.aliens claiming asylum bear the burden of showing they were subject to persecution in their country of origin or have a fear of future persecution upon their return home on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.see a a capric,at.to succeed in establishing a prima facie case,a petitioner must present specific facts demonstrating that he has good reason to believe that he will be singled out for persecution.petrovic ins,cir see also b i.in other words,the pelinkovics needed to present evidence that rizaja individually would be subject to persecution upon return home based on changed country conditions in montenegro.
a petitioner can also attempt to establish a prima facie case by presenting a pattern and practice of persecution of an identifiable group,to which he belongs,such that his fear of persecution is reasonable.capric,at quoting b iii.to meet this standard,the pelinkovics needed to show that rizaja would be subject to persecution per se because of his ethnic albanian or muslim status.
the pelinkovics based their motion to reopen because of changed country conditions on two separate for military service and generalized discriminatory conditions.we will discuss each in turn.
military service 
the bia determined that rizaja renewed fear that if he returned home to montenegro he and his son would be forced to fight in another war in which they did not believe,or be punished for not doing so,did not overcome the fry right to require military service from its citizens and to enforce that right with reasonable penalties.thus,the bia reasoned,rizaja and svebor eligibility for military service did not amount to persecution.
first,the pelinkovics argue that this determination was patently wrong and unreasonable because the war in kosovo,unlike the croatian war from which they originally fled,was targeted at ethnic albanians.specifically,rizaja predicted that if forcibly conscripted into the military,he and his son would be ordered to take part in human rights abuses against kosovars and be asked to kill fellow albanians leading the revolt.we understand him to oppose such activities based on his shared ethnic heritage with the kosovars.
we have previously acknowledged that in some cases,refusal to enter the army may render one a refugee if for instance,the reason for refusal is a genuine political,religious or moral conviction or for valid reasons of conscience.vujisic ins,cir quoting the handbook on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status,united nations high commissioner for refugees geneva.yet,rizaja failed to present evidence that if he or his son were forcibly conscripted into the fry military they,as individuals,would be forced to serve in kosovo and commit the acts to which they morally objected.
rather,the general evidence submitted paints a picture of strong montenegrin resistance to sending its citizens to fight in kosovo.several articles provided by the pelinkovics with their petition report the montenegrin assembly demand that montenegrin conscripts be released from service in kosovo and returned to stations in montenegro,with one article noting that only fifteen percent of montenegrin conscripts were even deployed in kosovo.indeed,the evidence creates some question as to whether ethnic albanians were desirable army conscripts at all.a news report by the british broadcasting corporation bbc states that it asked fry military leaders why ethnic albanians were not serving in the army.the bbc characterizes the response received as a typical military style answer,which was,i t is not we who decided that they should not serve,and you know very well who did.at.the bbc article squares with a state department report noting that the fry was generally unenthusiastic about arming ethnic minorities.see capric,at.further,although rizaja states in his affidavit in support of the petition to reopen that army conscripts who refuse an order to shoot a fellow albanian are themselves shot on sight,there is nothing in the record to support this allegation.
second,aside from their moral convictions against the war,the pelinkovics urge that the bia should have gleaned from the evidence presented in their petition to reopen that military service was itself a staging area for persecution of ethnic albanian males.rizaja swore in his affidavit attached to the petition that t here have been credible reports of the murder of albanian solders sic,as shown by the exhibits i have attached to this petition.at.yet,out of the news articles provided by the pelinkovics,only one murder of a single soldier is reported.the circumstances surrounding his death are not discussed,but are decried by an montenegrin political party as evidence that the fry military is clearly conducting a policy of expulsion,illtreatment,harassment and crimes.at.except for this one statement by a political party,no neutral source backs up the pelinkovics claim.
third,the pelinkovics argue that rizaja and svebor will be punished for avoiding military service,entitling them to asylum.we recognize that if the military action with which an individual does not want to be associated,is condemned by the international community as contrary to basic rules of human conduct,punishment for desertion or draft evasion could in itself be regarded as persecution.vujisic,at again quoting the handbook on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status.it is beyond question that the kosovar conflict which the pelinkovics sought to avoid was condemned by the international community as contrary to basic rules of human conduct.id.at noting the continued condemnation of yugoslavia campaign in kosovo,as evidenced by nato bombings.yet,the pelinkovics failed to provide the bia with evidence that if rizaja and svebor refused to obey the summons to serve,they would be subject to punishment.
instead,the record documents exhibit only lukewarm,sporadic attempts by the military to punish draft dodgers.according to the single article submitted by the pelinkovics discussing the army attempt to punish those montenegrins avoiding military service,the number sought to be prosecuted was listed as more than thirty,but only two showed up in court over two ethnic serb and one ethnic albanian.they were both promptly fined,but not imprisoned.although the article speaks of progressively worse punishment for those who avoid appearing in court and continue to refuse to answer the call,no other articles report pursuit or harassment of draft dodgers.further,the article fails to confirm the pelinkovics claim,made exclusively in their briefs,that ethnic albanians received more severe treatment for draft evasion than did those of serbian descent.
based on the lack of evidence supporting the pelinkovics claim that rizaja and svebor eligibility for military service in the kosovar conflict rises to the level of persecution,we find that the bia did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition to reopen on that ground.the bia rationally concluded that the fry retained the right to call upon its citizens to serve in the military and to punish them proportionally when they refused.in the case of the pelinkovics,based on the evidence presented,they failed to show that,if conscripted,they would serve in kosovo or,if they chose to avoid military service,they would be punished for such avoidance.they also failed to provide prima facie evidence,either individually or on a per se basis,that ethnic albanians were treated more harshly within the military or as draft dodgers.
we note that the pelinkovics case is distinguishable from vujisic ins,cir and begzatowski ins,cir on which petitioners heavily rely.in vujisic and begzatowski both,we reversed the bia denial of the petitioners asylum applications that presented evidence of yugoslav military abuses directed individually at the petitioners because of ethnicity,and did so under a slightly less deferential standard of review than that applicable here.see at reviewing the bia decision to deny the petitioner asylum application under the substantial evidence test at same.
vujisic was a slovenian ethnic serb who ignored yugoslav military reactivation orders in because of his objections to the invasion into slovenia.at.while previously serving in the military,he was beaten and accused of being a spy because of his slovenian origins.id.importantly,he was able to show fear of future persecution should he rejoin the military based upon the treatment of his father,also in the yugoslav military.according to vujisic,after he failed to appear for service,his father was arrested,questioned about his son whereabouts,and dishonorably discharged without pension benefits.id.at.we held that his experiences while in the military and his family plight after his failure to obey reactivation orders showed that the serbian officials singled out vujisic for persecution above that of other draftees,deserters and slovenian sympathizers id.
begzatowski was an ethnic albanian from macedonia who deserted the yugoslav military in after experiencing discriminatory treatment including segregation,lack of access to bathing facilities,lack of training,physical assaults and threats,and being used as a human shield in battle.at.we reversed the bia determination that begzatowski did not experience past persecution based on his military experience because he provided evidence that he,as an ethnic albanian,had
