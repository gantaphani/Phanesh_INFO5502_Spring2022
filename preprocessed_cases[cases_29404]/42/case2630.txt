when the asylum office did not approve kuschchak application,kuschchak was placed in removal proceedings.
administrative proceedings 
preliminary hearing 
on march,kuschchak and his attorney attended a master calendar hearing before an immigration judge ij.at that hearing,kuschchak counsel indicated that kuschchak would like to apply for adjustment of status based on his selection for the diversity lottery.the ij believed that it was unlikely,based on kuschchak lottery number,that a visa would become available.consequently,the ij determined that it would not be an appropriate use of the respondent money and my time to consider an adjustment application for which he not currently eligible.however,the ij stated that,if it appeared that a visa would become available,he would entertain kuschchak motion for an expedited hearing and his application for adjustment of status.
at the same hearing,kuschchak attorney indicated that kuschchak wished to proceed on his asylum application.after a cursory review of the papers,the ij noted that kuschchak had not filed an asylum application within one year of his arrival in the united states and further noted that there was no such requirement for withholding of removal.kuschchak attorney responded that he would like to make the application a request for withholding of removal,but if,in fact,i discuss with kuschchak and discover that there was,you know,exceptional circumstances which resulted in the late filing i would like an opportunity to file a brief in support of that.id.at.the ij agreed to set the case up for a merits hearing on the application for withholding of removal.id.at.
finally,the ij tended to some scheduling matters.the ij inquired i f you think that you going to be calling more than the respondent to testify,i set it for an afternoon.if you think he going to be the only witness,i schedule it for a morning.id.at.kuschchak attorney responded that he believed kuschchak was going to be the only witness.id.the ij then set the hearing for november.
emergency motion 
on august,kuschchak attorney filed an emergency motion to advance hearing.id.at.in that motion,kuschchak respectfully request ed that this court advance his hearing.id.the motion first acknowledged that the ij had scheduled the next hearing for the respondent on november.id.however,the motion continued,all applications for adjustment of status based on the diversity immigrant program must be completed and adjudicated prior to september.id.in short,if kuschchak did not have his adjustment of status adjudicated prior to september,his opportunity for the diversity lottery would be lost.
the ij granted the motion the same day it was filed.the order provided that the above captioned case is scheduled for a n individual hearing before the immigration court on,at id.at.the order also required a ny additional documents by.id.
merits hearing 
kuschchak and his attorney appeared for the hearing on august.after presenting the arguments with respect to the adjustment of status application,the ij denied the application for lack of eligibility.the ij then asked kuschchak attorney to proceed with the presentation of evidence on any other relief that kuschchak was seeking.the following colloquy between kuschchak attorney and the ij ensued 
well,we not prepared to go ahead with any other relief today.
well,this is the time for it.
we not prepared to go ahead with anything else.the only reason we did the motion was to obtain this one.originally indiscernible that november date.it was advanced in order to allow or proceed with the adjustment based on that.and i like to take an appeal from the decision denying this.
id.at.kuschchak attorney also referenced the march hearing and stated that 
there was a note in there his file that if his number becomes available we should at that time file for that adjustment of status.being that the number is available in september we filed based upon the available number.but i am not prepared to proceed any further at this time.i was here for the sole purpose that it was an emergency hearing due to the availability of numbers,due to the fact that he did qualify for that.that was the sole purpose of our motion.
id.at.the ij then warned counsel that either you go ahead with the asylum application and withholding now or i consider it abandoned if you do.id.at.counsel simply responded that he would take an appeal from that,too.id.
the ij then tried a different approach and asked kuschchak counsel if he could make a suggestion.id.the ij stated 
i would be willing to recess the matter,let you talk to your client,explain to him what happened,and,you know,within a reasonable period of time come back,elicit information from him on his asylum application so you could make a record and you can go forward on this 
id.kuschchak counsel,however,flatly refused he stated no,i not going to talk to him.i will not proceed on it because i not ready to proceed.id.at.
finally,the ij addressed kuschchak directly 
kuschak this,you have a complicated situation.your attorney has sought adjustment of status based on the diversity visa program.i have told him i do believe that you are eligible.he disagrees with me.he already told me he is going to ask another court to review my decision that you not eligible.
now,at the earlier hearing miss cho,your then attorney,stated that you wanted to obtain political asylum and withholding.in other words,be allowed to remain in the united states because of a claim of persecution.i have told your attorney that since i am denying the request for permanent residence on the diversity visa program that he should now go ahead by presenting your case on political asylum so all matters can be completed today.he said that he is not prepared to proceed with that now.now,kuschak,i told him that i am going to go give you my decision on all matters today,and if he does proceed on the asylum i consider it,and withholding i consider it abandoned.i also told him that i willing to delay proceeding on that for a time this afternoon to give you time to discuss this before you are called to testify.he is insistent that he is not willing to do that.
i am telling you this so that you know the conversations that i just had with him.i also want you to know that since you are the one directly affected that you may lose the opportunity to present information on your asylum claim if you refuse to testify and your attorney refused to call you today.
id.at.the ij then allowed kuschchak to discuss the matter with his attorney in private.
after the recess,and after counsel again refused to elicit testimony from kuschchak on his asylum application,the ij explained to kuschchak that the consequences of his attorney decision were that the applications for asylum and withholding of removal would be deemed abandoned.t
