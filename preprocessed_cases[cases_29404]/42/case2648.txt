jeannette uwase seeks review of a removal order issued by the board of immigration appeals bia summarily affirming the immigration judge ij denial of uwase asylum application,petition for withholding of removal,and request for relief under the convention against torture act.because the ij adverse credibility determinations were not based on substantial evidence and because the ij gave undue weight to uwase alleged lack of corroborating evidence,we vacate the removal order and remand uwase case for rehearing.
uwase,a native of rwanda,was fourteen years old when the former rwandan president died in an april plane crash.following the president death,members of a hutu militia,known as the interahamwe,launched an ethnic cleansing campaign against tutsi rwandans and those with mixed tribal heritage.tutsi rebel soldiers,called the rwandan patriotic front rpf,rose up to meet the interahamwe,resulting in civil war.
prior to the war,uwase lived in the capital city,kigali,with her parents and seven siblings.her father,a prominent hutu businessman,had married a tutsi woman thus,uwase and her brothers and sisters were of mixed ethnicity.when the violence broke out and they learned they were targeted for extermination,the family fled kigali,believing they could not hide their identities because of the father prominence and rwanda small size.in july,after moving from city to city in the hope of escaping the fighting,uwase parents heard on the radio that the war was over and that it was safe for people to return to their homes.uwase and her older sister,francine uwamahoro,were too frightened to go back,but her parents left with the six younger children.uwase and her sister fled rwanda for the refugee camps in the democratic republic of congo drc.
once in the drc,the sisters moved from camp to camp in search of safety.because of their mixed ethnicity,they struggled to gain acceptance in the camps largely filled with hutus seeking protection from the rpf.at some point,the sisters were separated.uwase suffered various deprivations during the two years she spent in the camps,and was ultimately herded back to kigali when her camp was attacked by rpf soldiers in october.
in kigali,the rpf detained the uwase in a collection center.there they interrogated her due to her mixed ethnicity and because she was found in a hutu refugee camp.they accused her of participating in the interahamwe genocide and subjected her to abuse,including putting her feet in very cold water,tying her hands and legs,threatening her with violence,and withholding food.they ultimately released her in december,due in part to her young age.
upon release,uwase found her way back to her family home.there she discovered her family gone and rpf soldiers occupying the house.uwase testified that the soldiers at first seemed friendly,and allowed her to sleep in what used to be her room until she could find a place to go.later that night,though,two soldiers woke her,raped her at gunpoint,and beat her.they accused her of taking part in the genocide,as they had discovered she was part hutu.afterwards,they confiscated her identification papers and left her bleeding at a bus station,threatening her with death if she told anyone what they did.according to uwase,the soldiers took her identification papers because if she was found without them,she would be accused of being a member of the interahamwe and killed.
uwase made her way from the bus station to the home of her mother friend,frida umutoni.frida allowed uwase to live with her in kigali and helped her to enroll in secondary school.the two also sought to bring the rape to the attention of the authorities,but,according to uwase,none would act for fear of retribution.at some point after coming to live with frida,uwase was reunited with her older sister,francine.they never discovered the fate of the rest of their family,except that frida told them their father was killed in prison.
uwase lived with frida for two years until frida and another family friend living in the united states,jean ntakirutimana,helped uwase and her sister francine come to america to study english.the sisters entered the in december on student visas to attend the south bend english institute.uwase,now nineteen,overstayed her student visa,resulting in the removal proceedings and her asylum application.she testified before the ij that she fears returning to rwanda because she believes she will be subjected to further persecution due to her mixed ethnicity and imputed political opinion.she also fears retribution from government soldiers because she sought to prosecute them for raping her.
the ij denied uwase application.although he found uwase request for asylum plausible and reasonable based on evidence of the country conditions in rwanda,he did not find uwase testimony internally consistent or persuasive.the ij concluded that she did not meet her burden of proving she was subjected to past persecution specifically,he found that she did not establish that she is of mixed tribal heritage.
uwase appealed.the bia affirmed the ij determination without opinion under its streamlining procedure.see a formerly a.having appropriately exhausted her administrative remedies,uwase now seeks review from this court.
ii.analysis 
in streamlined cases,the ij decision becomes that of the bia for purposes of judicial review.georgis ashcroft,cir.we apply the substantial evidence standard when reviewing immigration court decisions denying petitions for asylum and requests to withhold deportation.id.at.the bia decision must be affirmed if it is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.id.quotations omitted.
here,the bulk of the evidence consists of uwase testimony,much of which the ij found to be incredible and uncorroborated.since it is uwase burden to demonstrate she qualifies for asylum,her failure to convince the ij of the truth of her claim doomed her case.see krouchevski ashcroft,cir.the ij credibility determinations are entitled to great deference,and we are not at liberty to overturn the agency decision simply because we would have decided the case differently.georgis,at quotations omitted.yet,we will not automatically yield to the ij conclusions when they are drawn from insufficient or incomplete evidence.id.at.further,an ij credibility determination must be supported by specific,cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.krouchevski,at quotations omitted.corroborating evidence is essential to bolster an otherwise unconvincing case,but when an asylum applicant does testify credibly,it is not necessary for her to submit corroborating evidence in order to sustain her burden of proof.georgis,at citing a the testimony of the applicant,if credible,may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.
in denying uwase application for failing to prove that she suffered persecution because of her mixed ethnicity,the ij pointed to four alleged problems with the internal consistency and persuasiveness of her testimony her inability to explain a stamp on a letter from frida umutoni testimony inconsistent with her form documentation testimony inconsistent with her national identity documentation and her failure to produce her sister francine as a witness.we disagree with the ij conclusions based on the record before us and discuss each issue listed above in turn.
letter from frida 
uwase entered as an exhibit,without objection,a letter from frida in support of her asylum application.in the letter,frida,who still resides in kigali,wrote that following uwase departure,frida had been subjected to interrogations by local police to answer how i helped you to escape thou sic you was interahamwe mixed of.at.frida goes on to state that she later found out the two soldiers who raped uwase were involved in the interrogations and that they feared uwase return in case she attempted to prosecute them.id.frida wrote please jeannette do attempt to come back here to kigali,because i know for sure you will be killed.after the death of your father,i have been trying to locate the rest of your family,including your loving mother unsuccess
