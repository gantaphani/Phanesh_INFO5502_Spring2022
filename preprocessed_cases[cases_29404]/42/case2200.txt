defendant was convicted of assault resulting in serious bodily injury while within the special territorial jurisdiction of the united states,in violation of a.defendant appeals his conviction and sentence of months incarceration representing a upward departure.jurisdiction is proper under.
introduction 
the underlying events giving rise to defendant prosecution took place at approximately four on june,in and around the defendant cell at the federal correctional institution in milan,michigan.at that time and on that date,defendant and his cell mate,abel perez perez,were involved in a scuffle,which ended when defendant cut perez with a razor blade.perez suffered deep cuts on his left shoulder and arm,which required more than sixty stitches.
at trial,perez and defendant painted starkly different pictures of what transpired.according to perez,he had returned to their cell his and defendant for the afternoon inmate count and slipped into the lower bunk bed,when on the top agitated at the noise perez was making.defendant became extremely angry,came down from his top bunk,yelled at perez,then tried to strike perez while he was still in his bunk.perez then walked away from the incident,leaving the cell and walking just outside the cell door,where he was required to be for the inmate count.as perez leaned on the railing of the walkway outside the cell,waiting for the count,defendant slashed him twice from behind with a razor blade,and cut perez arm when perez turned around and warded off a second blow.perez would later require stitches in his left shoulder and in his left forearm.defendant later told police that,as perez lay bleeding,he walked away and disposed of the blade.
defendant version was predictably different.according to defendant,it was perez who became agitated,and it was defendant who attempted to be a calming influence and to end the hostilities.defendant testified that perez entered the cell with the intention of fighting him,and that perez had roused him from sleep and had insulted his mother.defendant further testified that when perez left the cell defendant believed him to be retrieving a weapon.
the jury believed perez,and defendant was convicted of assault resulting in serious bodily injury.at sentencing,both parties moved for departures defendant sought a downward departure on the basis of his two years incarceration as an immigration hold,the government an upward departure on the basis of the nature of the crime itself in a federal prison and the defendant history of criminal conduct and disciplinary complaints.the district court determined that the case fell outside the heartland of offenses covered by the sentencing guidelines and departed upwards by months,sentencing defendant to months incarceration.
ii.defendant conviction 
defendant challenges his conviction on two grounds.first,defendant maintains that the interpreter difficulty in translating his testimony violated his right to a fair trial.second,he argues that the district court erred in failing to instruct on what he deemed to be the lesser included offense of assault by striking,beating,or wounding,a.
a.the translation problems 
critically,defendant made no objection in the district court to the purported translation errors.accordingly,this court reviews for plain error.united states collins,cir.plain error is defined as an egregious error,one that directly leads to a miscarriage of justice,united states frazier,cir,or error that is obvious,affects substantial rights,and seriously impairs the fairness or integrity of the judicial proceedings.united states modena,cir.
defendant generally complains that the government interpreter charged with translating from spanish to english the testimony of defendant cell mate and victim,abel perez,was incompetent,and that his multiple translation mistakes rendered defendant trial fundamentally unfair.defendant alleges that perez translator,among other things,failed to translate verbatim,translated in the third person,confused and failed to identify pronouns,and improperly summarized perez testimony.the record supports defendant contention that there were,at times,difficulties.
courtroom use of interpreters is governed by the court interpreters act.the statute both provides rules for the appointment of interpreters and outlines a minimal,general standard of interpreter performance.specifically,e requires that 
i f any interpreter is unable to communicate effectively with the presiding judicial officer,the united states attorney,a party including a defendant in a criminal case,or a witness,the presiding judicial officer shall dismiss such interpreter and obtain the services of another interpreter in accordance with this section.
e.the statute appears to place the burden of ensuring competent translation on the presiding judicial officer,in this case,the district judge.
in the instant appeal,however,the district court can not be said to have plainly erred in failing to replace the interpreter.for one,it is significant that,however inelegant,the interpreter translation was not sufficiently poor so as to provoke objection.also,a review of the trial transcript reveals that,though the interpreter struggled,the district judge handled the problems as they arose.as well,it is significant that the translation problems did not involve the testimony of the defendant rather,the problems were with that of the victim,abel perez.perhaps most telling of defendant and his lawyer spoke spanish.it was not as if defendant and his counsel were relying on the interpreter to understand the victim testimony.
in the final analysis,there can be little doubt but that,while the interpreter performance was as even the government concedes not a model of clarity and efficiency,any mistakes were corrected and there was no substantive effect on the proceedings.error,if any,was certainly not plain.
b.the district court refusal to instruct on assault by striking,beating,or wounding 
defendant,charged and ultimately convicted of assault resulting in serious bodily injury a,contends that the district court erred in declining defendant request to instruct on what defendant alleged to be the lesser included offense of assault by striking,beating,or wounding a.at trial,the district court found that the latter offense was not,in fact,a lesser included offense of the former,and elected instead to instruct on the lesser included offense of simple assault a.
a criminal defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser included offense if a proper request is made the elements of the lesser offense are identical to part of the elements of the greater offense the evidence would support a conviction on the lesser offense and the proof on the element or elements differentiating the two crimes is sufficiently disputed so that a jury could consistently acquit on the greater offense and convict on the lesser.united states colon,cir.in the instant appeal,the district court found that defendant could not satisfy this standard because the elements of assault by striking,beating,or wounding are not identical to part of the elements of assault resulting in serious bodily injury.
despite some suggestion by one of our sister circuits that assault by striking,beating,or wounding is a lesser included offense of assault resulting in serious bodily injury,see,united states mccloskey,cir the defendant was also convicted of assault by striking in violation of a,a lesser included offense of assault resulting in serious bodily injury.united states felix,cir assault by striking,beating,or wounding is a lesser included offense of assault resulting in serious bodily injury.united states young,cir defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his request for a jury instruction on the lesser included offenses of simple assault and assault by striking,beating or wounding,the district court was undoubtedly correct in its determination that assault by striking,beating,or wounding is not a lesser included offense of assault resulting in serious bodily injury this is so because assault by striking,beating,or wounding requires proof of an element not required for the greater is,some form of co
