this appeal concerns two final board of immigration appeals determinations that impact ali jaber right to remain in the united states.the first determination involves the bia initial decision on jaber removal from the united states,while the second final determination concerns the bia subsequent decision not to reopen its initial decision on removal.in his habeas petition,jaber petitioned the district court to review the bia final determination to remove him and,arguably,the ij decision not to reopen.the district court,pursuant to the real id act,converted jaber habeas petition into a petition for review only of the original bia final determination on removal.on appeal,however,jaber challenges only the bia final determination not to reopen,a final decision for which he never filed a petition for review and a decision that remains outside of the scope of the district court limited transfer of the case to this court.because jaber has not filed a petition for review of the bia final determination on whether to reopen and because the district court did not transfer jaber challenge to the bia final determination on whether to reopen,we can not review jaber arguments as to the merits of the bia most recent decision,and we deny jaber petition for review.
this case has a long and convoluted history.jaber,a native of lebanon,married danielle darwish,an american citizen,in october.on june,jaber entered the united states on an immigrant visa as the spouse of a united states citizen,as a conditional permanent resident.on august,however,darwish filed for annulment of the marriage alleging,among other things,that jaber married her in order to obtain permanent residence status in the united states.the wayne county circuit court entered a default judgment of annulment on january.
on september,the immigration and naturalization service served jaber with notice that it intended to terminate his conditional permanent resident status because of the annulment of his marriage.jaber promptly responded by filing a form petition to remove the conditions on residence in which he requested a waiver of the requirement that he and his wife file a joint petition for permanent residence.in his form petition,jaber argued that his conditional residence is based on his marriage to a citizen or permanent resident and that he entered into the marriage in good faith,but the marriage was terminated through.on october,the ins terminated jaber conditional permanent resident status and informed him that he could request review of that determination during deportation proceedings.also on october,the ins issued an order to show cause and notice of hearing charging that jaber was subject to deportation,and on november,the wayne county circuit court denied jaber motion to set aside the default judgment of annulment.
on january,the ins informed jaber that it reviewed affidavits from friends and relatives and found that jaber failed to demonstrate that he married in good faith.the ins also informed jaber that it reviewed a police report of an alleged assault and concluded that jaber failed to demonstrate that deportation from the united states would result in an extreme hardship.the ins,therefore,determined that jaber had not met the requirements of either of the two relevant bases for a waiver under c he failed to demonstrate that extreme hardship would result if he were removed,c a and he failed to demonstrate that he married darwish in good faith and was not at fault in failing to file his form jointly,c b.a third basis,not applicable here,is that the alien was battered by or was the subject of extreme cruelty perpetrated by his or her spouse.c c.
on november,jaber married another citizen,brandy kay parr,who filed a petition for alien relative form on december,seeking to allow jaber to apply for a visa.
on april,an immigration judge held the deportation hearing that was noticed on october,and decided jaber application for voluntary departure and his application for a waiver of the joint petition requirement.the ij found that,although jaber entered into his marriage in good faith,jaber was not entitled to a waiver because he did not show that he would also face a hardship if he returned to lebanon.the ij accordingly denied jaber application for a waiver of the joint petition requirement.
on april,the ins filed a motion to reconsider the ij decision that jaber needed to show both a good faith marriage and hardship if returned to lebanon,and argued that a marriage was sufficient for relief even without a hardship showing.accepting that jaber was not required to show hardship if the marriage was in good faith,the ins to the ij jaber failed to demonstrate that he entered into his marriage with darwish in good faith.the ins therefore requested that the ij reconsider his decision on the latter point.the ij denied the motion to reconsider,although still finding that jaber had married darwish in good faith.
the ins itself filed a notice of appeal to the bia in which the ins argued that the ij erred by concluding that jaber had entered into his marriage with darwish in good faith.jaber did not appeal the ij decision,apparently in reliance on the fact that the ins,in its appeal,itself challenged the ij decision that jaber needed to prove both a good faith marriage and extreme hardship.the ins,however,withdrew its appeal on july,leaving no notice of appeal before the bia.on october,the bia issued an order returning the record to the ij.two days later,on october,jaber counsel,david wenger,filed a motion to accept untimely appeal in which he argued that jaber did not file a notice of appeal because the ins had done so and a decision of the ij in this case will be final even when it is clearly in error and should not be allowed to stand.there is no copy of an appeal in the record.the bia denied the motion to accept untimely appeal on july.
on december,while jaber motion to accept untimely appeal to the bia was pending,jaber filed a grievance against wenger for failing to file a timely appeal from the ij decision.on june,the state of michigan attorney grievance commission formally admonished wenger for violating the michigan rules of professional conduct,concluding that he had failed to ensure that the immigration forms filed on behalf of jaber were accurate,complete,and timely filed.jaber did not seek new counsel,however.according to jaber affidavit filed with the attorney grievance commission,wenger convinced him that if i filed anything it would hurt my case and prevent me from getting my green card and reassured jaber that his immigration proceedings would work out favorably but did not make jaber aware of the status of those proceedings.
on january,the ins approved parr form application on behalf of jaber,granting jaber the opportunity to apply for lawful permanent resident status.nevertheless,in june,jaber received a letter from the ins requesting that he appear on july,to be removed from the united states.jaber and his met with wenger,and wenger told jaber that the deportation people do know what they are talking about and that he will again take care of everything.jaber then decided to retain new counsel.
on august,through his new counsel,jaber filed a motion to reopen the april,ij decision on the basis of the ineffective assistance of his prior counsel.the ij denied the motion as untimely on october.the ij reasoned that the motion to reopen was untimely because the ij order became final when the government withdrew the only notice of appeal in the case.jaber filed a motion to reconsider,which the ij denied on november.on march,jaber filed a motion with the bia to accept his untimely appeal of the denial of the motion to reopen.the record does not contain an official appeal.there is just a motion with a attachment describing how the ij erred.
on april,while jaber appeal to the bia from the ij decision not to reopen was pending,he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court.in his habeas petition,jaber alleged that his immigration proceedings violated his substantive due process and equal protection rights.he did not,however,specify which decision he was seeking
