opinion of the court 
adnan muhanna muhanna appeals the affirmance by the board of immigration appeals bia of the decision by immigration judge ij annie garcy finding that muhanna knowingly filed a frivolous asylum application and is thereby rendered permanently ineligible by d to receive any benefits under united states immigration laws and denying muhanna applications for withholding of removal and for protection under the united nations convention against torture,and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment convention.because we conclude that the ij failure to adhere to the administrative regulations regarding frivolous findings resulted in a denial of due process,we grant muhanna petition for review of the bia order and remand muhanna case to the bia.
background 
following his marriage to an american citizen in ramallah in,muhanna entered the united states on october,as a conditional permanent resident after living in the united states for a time with his wife,muhanna obtained a divorce from islamic authorities in ramallah on september.because he had failed to file a joint application for the removal of the conditions on his permanent residency as required by section c a during his marriage,on december,muhanna applied to the immigration and naturalization service ins for a waiver under section c b.under that provision an alien failure to file a joint petition for the removal of the conditions on permanent residency may be excused if the alien shows that the marriage qualifying him for conditional status was entered into in good faith but has been terminated and if the alien was not at fault in failing to file the petition.muhanna application for the good faith marriage waiver was denied by the ins on september.
on november,the ins commenced removal proceedings against muhanna,asserting the termination of his conditional status.in the course of those proceedings muhanna admitted the factual allegations put forth by the ins and conceded that he was removable,but he asked the ij to review the denial of his good faith marriage waiver and presented evidence that in addition to the divorce from islamic authorities in ramallah he had obtained a divorce from a new jersey court.on june,following several master calendar hearings and continuances,muhanna also filed applications for asylum,withholding of removal and protection under the convention,all based on the ongoing conflict between israeli and palestinian forces in the middle east.in particular he related several incidents of persecution he and his family had endured.muhanna was warned of the consequences of filing a frivolous asylum application.
at an august,master calendar hearing the ij set the case for a merits hearing and stated she would bifurcate the proceedings 
so maybe we have to do the waiver application first and then if i do grant the waiver we can move on to the asylum application and then we would do that,i suppose,on some other day.
when the merits hearing began on june,however,the ij said she was going to address both the waiver application and the asylum application.although muhanna counsel responded that he was prepared to address only the waiver application and that he did not take on palestinian asylum cases as a matter of principle,the ij replied 
well i do know what your principle is,but we may end up doing this case.we see how it goes today.
in response to questions posed by his counsel,muhanna testified regarding his marriage,his arrival in the united states and his divorce.following some testimony that was somewhat inconsistent on those matters,the ij sought to determine whether the fear of living in ramallah that muhanna asserted as the basis for his asylum application predated his marriage.she asked whether a stabbing to which muhanna had referred in the asylum application he there claimed that his jewish employer in ramallah had stabbed him on may,occurred before or after his marriage.muhanna initially responded,nobody stabbed me,but he then said he had been stabbed by a man named mohammed when he tried to break up a fight.warning muhanna that his answer was inconsistent with his asylum application and also warning him of the consequences of filing a frivolous asylum application,the ij allowed muhanna to confer with counsel.after he then did so,muhanna showed the ij a major scar on his arm wholly consistent with his having been stabbed,with his asylum the stabbing had in fact been inflicted by his jewish employer,and he explained that he had lied earlier during the hearing because he was afraid that if his employer discovered his testimony he would be harmed if he were sent back to ramallah.
conceding that she had stumbled onto the line of inquiry regarding the asylum application while initially addressing only the waiver application,the ij halted the proceedings and made a finding under section d that muhanna asylum application was frivolous,making him ineligible to receive any immigration benefits.that finding was expressly based entirely on the inconsistency between his hearing testimony and the original asylum application as to the stabbing incident.on that ground the ij found muhanna asylum application was a case of a fabricated application that is frivolous in every respect.she further concluded that because the information regarding the stabbing was the most important,decisive information that there could be about muhanna experiences in his country,its materiality was undeniable.
based on that finding of frivolousness,the ij held muhanna ineligible for the good faith marriage waiver,for asylum and for voluntary departure.she further denied his applications for withholding of removal and protection under the convention on the ground that he was not credible and ordered that he be removed to jordan.after the bia then affirmed the ij decision without opinion,muhanna timely filed this appeal.
we have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal pursuant to section a mulanga ashcroft,cir.and where as here the bia affirms the ij decision without opinion,we review the ij opinion and scrutinize its reasoning dia ashcroft,cir en banc.
muhanna due process claim 
it has been established for more than a century that aliens are entitled under the fifth amendment to due process of law in removal proceedings reno flores,d.due process requires three things in the context of those proceedings abdulai ashcroft,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted 
an alien is entitled to factfinding based on a record produced before the decisionmaker and disclosed to him or her must be allowed to make arguments on his or her own behalf and has the right to an individualized determination of his or her interests.
muhanna due process claim centers on the first and second of those rights,and he argues that they were violated in two ways.
first,muhanna makes much of the fact that the ij addressed his asylum application in the course of a hearing that he believed was being held only to address his good faith marriage waiver application.he claims that the sua sponte change in plans left him and his counsel unprepared to proceed with the asylum claim.but that argument can not prevail.ijs are entitled to broad though not uncabined discretion over the conduct of trial proceedings so long as those proceedings do not amount to a denial of the fundamental fairness to which aliens are entitled see ins,cir iliev ins,cir.though counsel indicated he would not pursue muhanna asylum claim for personal reasons,the ij frivolousness finding brought an abrupt halt to the proceedings so that the issue never arose.moreover,the initial counsel reluctance would not necessarily have blocked consideration of the asylum claim,because it appears that one of his partners would have been available to do so,perhaps later that same day.and even accepting that muhanna and his counsel were unprepared to address the asylum claim,we can not say that it was fundamentally unfair for the ij to question muhanna about an incident described in an asylum application that muhanna himself had filed almost one year earlier.because that incident could be viewed as relevant to his good faith marriage wai
