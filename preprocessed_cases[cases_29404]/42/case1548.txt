in this appeal,we review consolidated petitions filed by richard jesus amos,a citizen of the philippines,challenging decisions of the board of immigration appeals the bia,or the board,which dismissed amos appeal from an immigration judge order of removal and denied amos motion for reconsideration.the bia determined that amos was removable based on his conviction in for causing abuse to a child,in violation of maryland law.
the bia held that this offense qualified as an aggravated felony under the generic federal crime of sexual abuse of a minor,as listed in a a.we are not persuaded by the bia analysis and its conclusion,because the least culpable conduct under the former maryland statute prohibiting sexual abuse of a child does not necessarily qualify as the generic federal offense of sexual abuse of a minor,as interpreted by the bia.we therefore grant amos petitions for review and vacate the order for his removal.
amos entered the united states in as a lawful permanent resident,when he was about nine years old.in,he was convicted in a maryland state court of the crime of causing abuse to a child the child abuse conviction,in violation of former maryland code,article.that statute stated in relevant part 
a definitions 
in this section the following words have the meanings indicated.
abuse means 
i the sustaining of physical injury by a child as a result of cruel or inhumane treatment or as a result of a malicious act by any parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child under circumstances that indicate that the child health or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby or 
ii sexual abuse of a child,whether physical injuries are sustained or not.
child means any individual under years.
i sexual abuse means any act that involves sexual molestation or exploitation of a child by a parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for supervision of a child.ii sexual abuse includes,but is not limited to.incest,rape,or sexual offense in any degree.sodomy and.unnatural or perverted sexual practices.
b violation constitutes felony penalty.a parent or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of a child who causes abuse to the child is guilty of a felony and on conviction is subject to imprisonment in the penitentiary not exceeding years.
the maryland statute,or the former maryland statute,emphasis added.the maryland court sentenced amos to a term of months imprisonment,with the entire sentence suspended,and to three years of supervised probation.
in april,the department of homeland security dhs issued a notice to appear and initiated removal proceedings against amos based on a a iii,which authorizes the attorney general to remove a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission.dhs contended that amos child abuse conviction qualified as an aggravated felony,namely,the sexual abuse of a minor,under a a subsection a,which lists murder,rape,or sexual abuse of a minor as qualifying aggravated felonies 
although amos admitted the fact of his conviction,he disputed that it qualified as an aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor.the immigration judge ij rejected amos argument,and held that amos was removable under subsection 
on appeal from the ij order of removal,the bia reviewed the language in the former maryland statute and concluded that while the part of the statute addressing sexual abuse of a child conformed to the meaning of sexual abuse of a minor under subsection a,the remainder of the statute prohibiting physical injury to a child did not.the bia therefore approved the ij application of a modified categorical analysis,which permitted review of amos underlying record of conviction to determine which portion of the maryland statute formed the basis of amos conviction because the record of conviction revealed that amos put the year old victim penis in his mouth,the bia concluded that amos had been convicted under former section a ii and that this offense qualified as sexual abuse of a minor within the meaning of subsection 
in reaching this conclusion,the bia did not define the meaning of sexual abuse of a minor,but instead cited an earlier bia decision,matter of rodriguez rodriguez,stating that this prior decision defin ed sexual abuse as employed in to cover a broad range of acts of a sexual nature.under a,sexual abuse is defined as the employment,use,persuasion,inducement,enticement,or coercion of a child to engage in,or assist another person to engage in,sexually explicit conduct or the rape,molestation,prostitution or other form of sexual exploitation of children,or incest with children.see rodriguez rodriguez,at.the bia determined that this broad range of acts necessarily encompassed the crime of sexual abuse of a child under the former maryland statute and,accordingly,dismissed amos appeal from the ij removal order.
in a later decision denying amos motion for reconsideration,the bia expanded its analysis and stated that under maryland law,a conviction for sexual abuse under former section a ii required proof of three elements that the defendant sexually molested or exploited the victim by means of a specific act that the victim was under the age of and that the defendant was a parent or someone responsible for the care,custody,or supervision of the victim.see schmitt state.
the bia observed that to satisfy the first element under maryland law,an affirmative act of molesting or exploiting a child is not required,because the statute also encompasses an omission or failure to act to prevent molestation or exploitation when it is reasonably possible to act.see degren state,discussing different maryland statute using same language as relevant portion of the former maryland statute.nevertheless,the bia concluded that,under degren,the least culpable conduct qualifying as causing sexual abuse of a child satisfied the generic federal offense of sexual abuse of a minor.the only reasoning the bia provided for this conclusion is that the generic federal offense,as construed in rodriguez rodriguez,does not require physical contact with the victim and includes a broad range of maltreatment of a sexual nature as detailed in a.accordingly,the bia denied amos motion for reconsideration.
amos filed two petitions for review with this court,from the initial bia decision and from the bia denial of his motion for reconsideration.we consolidated amos two petitions,in accordance with b.see crespin valladares holder,cir citing stone ins,d.
the central issue presented in this appeal is whether the bia erred in concluding that amos conviction under the former maryland statute qualifies as the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor,within the meaning of subsection a.we consider this question of law de novo castillo holder,cir.
amos argues that the bia erred in holding that his maryland child abuse conviction qualifies him for removal under subsection a for the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor.according to amos,the bia misapplied the decision in rodriguez rodriguez,and incorrectly concluded that the least culpable conduct under the former maryland statute fell within the generic federal offense listed in subsection thus,amos contends that his maryland conviction does not render him removable under subsection a,because the conduct proscribed by the former maryland statute is not encompassed within the generic federal offense of sexual abuse of a minor.
in response,the government argues that the bia correctly determined that the elements of sexual abuse under the former maryland statute fell within the broad meaning of sexual abuse of a minor in subsection unlike the bia,the government does not maintain that the board articulated a particular definition of sexual abuse in rodriguez rodriguez.rather,the government asserts that we owe significant deference to the bia reliance on an interpretive touchstone,namely,the definition of sexual abuse provided in a.additionally,the government contends that the bia application of that guide in the present case permitted the bia to conclude that amos conviction,which was based on charges of sexual abuse rather than of physical abuse,qualified as a removable offense under subsection a.we disagree with the government arguments.
under the immigration and nationality act ina,a is removable if he is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission.a a iii.the ina defines aggravated felony in a the aggravated felony statute by enumerating an extensive list of crimes,including in subsection a the crimes of murder,rape,or sexual abuse of a minor.
in determining whether a conviction under a particular state law qualifies as an aggravated felony for removal purposes,we generally apply the categorical approach set forth at see also estrada espinoza mukasey,cir en banc applying categorical approach to determine whether state crime qualified as sexual abuse of a minor under subsection a.under a categorical approach,we do not look to the facts of the particular prior case,but instead to whether the state statute defining the crime of conviction categorically fits within the generic federal definition of a corresponding aggravated felony.moncrieffe holder,d quoting gonzales duenas alvarez,d.a state offense is a categorical match with a federal offense only if a conviction of the state offense necessarily involved facts equating to the generic federal offense.castillo,at quoting moncrieffe.at citation and brackets omitted.
when applying a categorical approach,we typically begin by considering the required elements of the generic federal crime.see taylor,at,explaining that a federal statute describing a generic crime must employ a uniform,categorical definition to capture all offenses of a certain type regardless of technical definitions and labels under state law.this approach allows federal laws to be applied uniformly to determine the effect of prior state convictions.see id.at estrada espinoza,at.
the generic federal crime at issue in the present case,sexual abuse of a minor under subsection a,is not defined in the ina.we therefore turn to consider the bia interpretation of the meaning of this generic federal offense.
we generally give substantial deference to the bia precedential decisions interpreting the ina,because congress conferred on the bia decisionmaking power to decide such questions of law.martinez holder,cir citing ins aguirre aguirre,d,and chevron,natural res.def.council,d.under the holding in chevron,we are required to accept the bia construction of an otherwise silent or ambiguous statute,unless such construction is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.at.also,we may not substitute our own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation by the bia.id.at.
in prior cases,we have applied the principles of chevron to the bia precedential interpretation of generic federal crimes listed in the aggravated felony statute see castillo,at considering bia interpretation of theft offense in the aggravated felony statute,and assuming that bia definition was reasonable under chevron soliman,at engaging in chevron analysis but declining to apply deference because bia definition of theft offense conflicted with congress intent to exclude crimes involving obtaining property by fraud.however,the principles of chevron deference are not applicable to the board decision in amos case because,although issued by a panel of the bia,it was an unpublished decision that does not carry precedential weight.
a potential complication nevertheless arises in our analysis here,because the bia relied in amos case on rodriguez rodriguez,a precedential bia decision to which chevron deference can apply.see hernandez holder,cir explaining that nonprecedential bia decision relied on precedential decision that was entitled to deference.thus,we first must consider the decision in rodriguez rodriguez to determine whether and to what extent it impacts our review of amos case.
the question before the bia in rodriguez rodriguez was whether a texas statutory offense of indecency with a child by exposure constituted sexual abuse of a minor under subsection a,even though the texas crime did not require as an element that the perpetrator have physical contact with the child victim.at.addressing the undefined,generic federal crime of sexual abuse of a minor found in subsection a,the bia observed that unlike other subsections of the aggravated felony statute,congress did not cite in subsection a any federal criminal statute defining sexual abuse.id.at.thus,the bia concluded that congress did not intend that the generic federal crime of sexual abuse of a minor be limited to the federal statutes that criminalize sexual abuse and sexual abuse of a minor.id.at citing.those statutes limit sexual abuse to acts involving physical contact with specific body parts of the victim.see.the bia explained that because states categorize and define sex crimes against children in many different ways,the definitions of the federal offenses in sections,and were too restrictive to encompass the numerous state crimes that can be viewed as sexual abuse and the diverse types of conduct that would fit within the term as it commonly is used.at.
the bia also discussed in rodriguez rodriguez a statute providing procedural protections for child victims and witnesses,a.the bia observed that this statute defines sexual abuse more broadly as the employment,use,persuasion,inducement,enticement,or coercion of a child to engage in,or assist another person to engage in,sexually explicit conduct or the rape,molestation,prostitution,or other form of sexual exploitation of children,or incest with children.id.at quoting a.
three of our sister circuits have concluded that the bia,in its discussion of section a in rodriguez rodriguez,adopted that statute as its definition of sexual abuse for purposes of determining whether a state offense qualifies as sexual abuse of a minor under subsection see mugalli ashcroft,cir describing rodriguez rodriguez as adopting a definition applicable nationwide restrepo attorney,cir deferring under chevron to the bia definition in rodriguez rodriguez by reference to a see also velasco giron holder,cir,cert.denied sub nom.velasco giron lynch,lexis may,explaining that the seventh circuit repeatedly has applied chevron deference to the bia reasonable approach in rodriguez rodriguez.respectfully,we disagree with this conclusion reached by our sister circuits.
although the bia recognized that the broad definition in section a is consistent with the common understanding of sexual abuse,the bia expressly stated that it was not adopting that statute as a definitive standard or definition for purposes of application in subsection rodriguez rodriguez,at emphasis added.instead,the bia invoke d the definition in section a as a guide in identifying the types of crimes it would consider to be sexual abuse of a minor.id.at emphasis added.
we therefore conclude that the bia did not adopt in rodriguez rodriguez a particular definition of the generic federal crime of sexual abuse of a minor for application of subsection a.we observe that the ninth circuit drew a similar distinction in declining to defer to rodriguez rodriguez,by focusing on the bia adoption of an advisory guideline rather than a uniform definition of sexual abuse of a minor.estrada espinoza,at.
using section a as a guide,the bia held in rodriguez rodriguez that the crime of sexual abuse of a minor in subsection a was broad enough to encompass the texas statute of indecency with a child by exposure,because the generic federal offense does not require as an element that the perpetrator have physical contact with the victim.at.beyond this limited holding,however,the bia did not provide direction regarding the elements of the generic federal crime of sexual abuse of a minor.see estrada espinoza,at explaining that rodriguez rodriguez did not offer a particularized meaning of the generic offense necessary to perform a taylor analysis.
the methodology employed in rodriguez rodriguez stands in stark contrast with the bia approach in castillo,in which the board provided a fixed definition of the generic federal c
