in these consolidated petitions for review,petitioner letekidan ukabanikiel haile challenges two decisions of the board of immigration appeals bia.the first challenge is to the finding that she was statutorily ineligible for asylum,withholding of removal and protection under the convention against torture cat in the form of withholding of removal based on the terrorism bars in b a v,and the second is to the finding that she is not entitled to deferral of removal under the cat.because we hold that the bia conclusions that the elf is a terrorist organization and that haile engaged in terrorist activities are supported by substantial evidence and that we lack jurisdiction to address other arguments raised by haile,we deny in part and dismiss in part those aspects of the petitions for review.however,because the record compels the conclusion that the petitioner has demonstrated that it is more likely than not that upon a return to eritrea she will be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the eritrean government,we grant the relief of deferral of removal under the cat.
haile is a native of ethiopia and a citizen of eritrea she entered the united states with a tourist visa in but stayed beyond the authorized period.in,haile filed an application for asylum but her application was denied,and the department of homeland security dhs initiated removal proceedings against her on the charge that she had remained in the united states without authorization.a b.in removal proceedings,haile conceded removability and applied for relief from removal in the form of asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat.
according to haile testimony,which the immigration judge ij found credible,she joined the eritrean liberation front elf in.the elf is an organization that fought for eritrea independence from ethiopia.haile stated that the elf used violence and employed weapons,guns in the fight for independence and for the forcible overthrow of the ethiopian government.haile had heard about members of the elf attempting to hijack an ethiopian airline flight,but denied knowing about other specific elf activities.dhs submitted a set of incident profiles from the website of the memorial institute for the prevention of terrorism mipt that described terrorist acts perpetrated by the elf,including kidnappings,hijackings of aircraft,shootings,and car bombings.the incident profiles were admitted over the general objection of haile counsel.
as a member of the elf,haile organiz ed women and would gather and collect fund sic or contribute fund sic to the elf.using the funds she collected,she sent provisions like sugar,cigarettes,and shoes to the elf through a contact.haile also collected and passed on documents,the precise contents of which she did not know,but she believed that the documents contained information about how to attack or target the enemy and that the documents would have had a negative impact on the ethiopian government.a letter from an elf official confirmed that haile was a member of the cells in asmara and that she was participating in collecting informations sic of the enemy,gathering necessary materials for the elf army,and organi z ing eritrean women to join the organi z ation and struggle for their emancipation secretly.
haile testified that,in,she was arrested by members of the eritrean people liberation front eplf,a rival organization and detained for a month under poor conditions.haile was arrested again in,this time by agents of the ethiopian government,and detained for about a year.she was interrogated and subjected to brutal treatment a judge sentenced haile to five years imprisonment,and she served about three years of that sentence.conditions in prison were poor there were mice and rats,few bathrooms for many prisoners,and criminals and crazy people mixed in with political prisoners.when she returned to asmara,the elf had left the area,but she remained an elf member until.
haile fled eritrea in.a local official and eplf member named mohammed ibrahim had asked to marry her and she had declined.he then showed her a list of members of the elf who were targeted for arrest,and the list had her name on it.haile believes that because she refused his marriage offer,if she returns anywhere in eritrea,ibrahim would have her killed.haile testified that elf members are arrested in eritrea for voicing their views.she also testified that soldiers had taken her father from his home about ten months prior to the removal hearing,and that her father was interrogated by local officials about haile and her escape from the country.this account was in part corroborated by a letter from haile son that was admitted into evidence,although haile blamed ibrahim for the arrest of her father while the letter referred to soldiers.the letter said that haile father died at home from pneumonia after his period of detention,during which he was made to sleep on a cold cement floor.haile sister was also arrested,and haile son was taken to the police station because he accused the government of causing the death of haile father.haile also submitted supportive reports and articles regarding country conditions in eritrea,including information on human rights abuses and treatment of political prisoners.
the ij denied all relief and ordered haile removed.after reviewing all testimony and evidence,the ij found,among other things,that the elf falls within the definition of a terrorist organization,that haile was a member of the elf,and that haile had engaged in terrorist activities.the ij concluded that haile was statutorily barred from eligibility for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat protection in the form of withholding.the ij denied cat protection in the form of deferral of removal because haile did not show that it is more likely than not that she would suffer torture upon removal to eritrea.
haile appealed to the bia,but to no avail because the bia dismissed the appeal,agreeing with the ij that haile was ineligible for asylum and withholding and that she did not demonstrate entitlement to deferral of removal under cat.the bia found no error in the ij finding that the elf was a terrorist organization.while the ij appeared to have found haile ineligible for relief because she had engaged in terrorist activities under a b i i,the bia held that the ij properly found that haile was ineligible based on her membership in a terrorist organization,citing a b i vi.
after haile filed an opening brief on appeal to us,the government filed a motion to reopen with the bia.the bia agreed sua sponte to reconsider its decision and issued a second decision supplementing its earlier decision.in its second decision the bia reaffirmed its decision that the ij correctly determined that the elf was a terrorist organization affirmed the ij conclusion that haile was barred from relief for engaging in terrorist activities based on her activities with and material support of elf and expanded its reasoning with respect to the denial of deferral of removal under cat.haile petitioned for review of the second decision of the bia.
we have jurisdiction over the petitions for review under a.see khan holder,cir noting jurisdiction over similar claims and recognizing that bellout ashcroft,cir,which held to the contrary,was decided before passage of the real id act.where,as here,the bia conducts a de novo review of the ij decision,the court review is limited to the bia decision,except to the extent that the ij opinion is expressly adopted.hosseini gonzales,cir quotation marks omitted.questions of law are reviewed de novo.hamazaspyan holder,cir.we review factual findings and determinations of mixed questions of law and fact for substantial evidence.khan,at.findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.b b ins elias zacarias.
aliens who have engaged in terrorist activities are precluded from seeking several forms of relief from removal,including asylum,withholding,and cat protection in the form of withholding,but remain eligible for deferral of removal under the cat.see khan,at see also a b i stating grounds of inadmissibility a b providing for grounds of deportability by reference to a b,f b a v west stating,in effect,that an alien who is inadmissible or deportable on grounds is ineligible for asylum b b iv same for withholding of removal d same for withholding under the cat directing that aliens eligible for cat protection but subject to bars be granted deferral of removal thus,if an alien has engaged in a terrorist activity under a b iv at any time,he is ineligible for both asylum and withholding of removal.khan,at.
the ina defines engage in terrorist activity,terrorist activity,and terrorist organization broadly.see id.the definition of terrorist organization includes a group of two or more individuals,whether organized or not,which engages in,or has a subgroup which engages in,the activities described in subclauses i through vi of clause iv.a b vi iii.
the term engage in terrorist activity,as applied to an individual or an organization,includes the following to gather information on potential targets for terrorist activity to solicit funds or other things of value for a terrorist activity or a terrorist organization described in clause vi iii,unless the solicitor can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he did not know,and should not reasonably have known,that the organization was a terrorist organization to solicit any individual to engage in conduct otherwise described in this subsection or for membership in a terrorist organization as described in clause vi iii again unless the solicitor can demonstrate lack of knowledge and 
to commit an act that the actor knows,or reasonably should know,affords material support,including a safe house,transportation,communications,funds,transfer of funds or other material financial benefit,false documentation or identification,weapons,explosives,or training to a terrorist organization described in clause vi iii,or to any member of such an organization,unless the actor can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the actor did not know,and should not reasonably have known,that the organization was a terrorist organization.
a b iv iii vi.
a terrorist activity is 
any activity which is unlawful under the laws of the place where it is committed or which,if it had been committed in the united states,would be unlawful under the laws of the united states or any state and which involves any of the following 
i the highjacking or sabotage of any conveyance including an aircraft,vessel,or vehicle.
ii the seizing or detaining,and threatening to kill,injure,or continue to detain,another individual in order to compel a third person including a governmental organization to do or abstain from doing any act as an explicit or implicit condition for the release of the individual seized or detained.
iii a violent attack upon an internationally protected person as defined in section b of title or upon the liberty of such a person.
iv an assassination.
v the use of any 
a biological agent,chemical agent,or nuclear weapon or device,or 
b explosive,firearm,or other weapon or dangerous device other than for mere personal monetary gain,with intent to endanger,directly or indirectly,the safety of one or more individuals or to cause substantial damage to property.
vi a threat,attempt,or conspiracy to do any of the foregoing.
the bia held that the ij correctly found that the elf qualifies as a terrorist organization because the group committed a number of violent acts including assassinations,kidnappings,and hijackings,which come within the definition of terrorist activity under a b iii.the bia also upheld the ij finding that haile engaged in terrorist activities based on her activities with and material support of elf,including recruiting members,collecting funds,passing along documents,collecting information on the enemy,and providing materials and provisions to elf.the bia expressly cited subsections iii through vi of a b iv,which refer to gathering information on potential targets soliciting funds for a terrorist organization soliciting membership in a terrorist organization and committing an act that the individual knows or reasonably should know affords material support to an individual who has committed or plans to commit a terrorist activity or to a terrorist organization.the bia concluded that haile was statutorily ineligible for asylum and withholding because she engaged in terrorist activities.
haile asserts that two of the bia central conclusions that the elf is a terrorist organization and that she engaged in terrorist activities are not supported by substantial evidence.we disagree.
substantial evidence in the record supports the bia finding that the elf falls within the broad statutory definition of a tier iii terrorist organization.there is documentary evidence in the record,in the form of the mipt incident profiles,that the elf carried out several activities described in a b iii,including kidnapping,assassination,bombing,and hijacking as well as other attempts to carry out these acts.haile testimony was consistent with the documentary evidence she testified that the elf employed violence,including the use of guns,to fight for the overthrow of the ethiopian government,and that she had heard about members of the elf attempting to hijack an airplane.
haile argues that the mipt incident profiles are hearsay and bear no indicia of reliability or trustworthiness,and that the bia reliance on them as evidence of elf terrorist activities violated due process haile misapprehends the evidentiary rules governing proceedings in federal agencies such as the bia.the sole test for admission of evidence is whether the evidence is probative and its admission is fundamentally fair.espinoza ins,cir.haile has not cast doubt on the probative value or fairness of the evidence presented,nor did she present any contrary evidence to challenge the reliability of the incident profiles.rojas garcia ashcroft,cir see also khan,at relying in part on newspaper reports of terrorist attacks to satisfy elements of the statutory terrorism bars hussain mukasey,cir citing to the mipt website in discussion of a terrorist organization activities.under these circumstances,the admission of the mipt incident profiles did not violate due process,and her hearsay challenges to the mipt reports are unavailing.
haile also contends that,to meet the definition of a terrorist organization,dhs must show that the group in question qualifies as a terrorist organization both at the time of the removal hearing and during the period when the alien was engaged in terrorist activities,and that the record in this case does not support such a conclusion.we need not decide whether haile interpretation of the statutory term is correct,because substantial evidence in the record supports that terrorist activities were perpetrated by the elf from through,including during the period when haile was an active member and haile testified that elf was engaging in violent activities for the overthrow of the government as late as.haile does not direct us to any evidence in the record to suggest much less compel the conclusion that the elf ceased planning or perpetrating terrorist activities at some point before the removal hearing.the record reasonably supports the bia finding that the elf satisfies the statutory definition of a terrorist organization,even under haile interpretation of its requirements.
haile also challenges the bia conclusion that she engaged in terrorist activities with two principal contentions that the record can not support a finding that haile activities constituted material support of a terrorist organization and that the bia did not properly consider whether haile knew or reasonably should have known that the elf was a terrorist organization.both arguments fail in light of the record in this case,and even were we to assume they had merit,they are not dispositive of the petitions for review because haile does not challenge several other independent statutory bases for the bia decision that haile engaged in terrorist activities.
section a b iv vi states that the term engage in terrorist activity includes commit ing an act that the actor knows,or reasonably should know,affords material support for a terrorist activity or to a terrorist organization,and that material support includes a safe house,transportation,communications,funds,transfer of funds or other material financial benefit,false documentation or identification,weapons,explosives,or training a b iv vi.the bia did not err in determining that haile activities,including collecting funds for the elf,supplying the elf with provisions such as sugar,shoes,and cigarettes,and passing along secret documents,amount in the aggregate to material support.we have previously remarked on the broad scope of the terrorism bars,khan,at,and the definition of material support is broad enough to cover haile activities in this case.see singh kaur.ashcroft,cir noting that material support is a broad concept that is not limited to the enumerated examples and deferring to the bia determination that the provision of food and setting up tents was within the definition of material support in re s k,i n,bia explaining the lack of any legislative history which indicates a limitation on the definition of the term material support and observing that congress has not expressly indicated its intent to provide an exception for contributions which are de minimis.the bia findings that haile contributions constitute material support of a terrorist organization under a b iv vi survive substantial evidence review.
haile has not contested the bia finding that she engaged in terrorist activities in other ways apart from providing material support.the bia determined that haile had engaged in terrorist activities under subsections iii through vi of a b iv because of her activities with and material support of elf,including recruiting members,collecting funds,passing along documents,collecting information on the enemy,and providing materials and provisions to elf.the bia found that haile collected and passed on information that would be used by the elf against the enemy,the government of ethiopia,satisfying subsection iii on gathering information on potential targets for terrorist activity collected funds for the elf,satisfying subsection iv on soliciting funds or other things of value for a terrorist activity or organization organized and recruited members,satisfying subsection v on soliciting any individual to engage in terrorist activity or for membership in a terrorist organization and provided material goods to the elf and collected and passed on information in support of its mission,satisfying subsection vi on committing an act that affords material support to a terrorist organization.thus,whether haile provided material support to the elf under subsection vi is not dispositive of whether she engaged in terrorist activities.
the material support provision,as well as several other portions of a b iv outlining the definition of engage in terrorist activity,provide for an exception if the actor can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he or she did not know and should not reasonably have known that the organization was a terrorist organization.contrary to haile assertions,the bia addressed whether haile knew or reasonably should have known that the elf was a terrorist organization in its first decision,stating,the respondent haile has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that she did not know,and should not reasonably have known,that the elf was a terrorist organization.although it did not provide extensive analysis of the issue,the bia considered and decided that aspect of the statutory bar.
haile had the burden to establish by clear and convincing evidence that she did not know,and should not reasonably have known,that the elf was a terrorist organization,and the bia finding that she did not meet this burden is supported by substantial evidence.haile testified that the elf used armed violence against the ethiopian government,and that she had heard about elf members hijacking an airplane haile did not present testimony or other evidence showing that she had a different and mistaken understanding of the nature of the elf.
but even if that were not the case,haile argument on this point would fail because of the alternative grounds for the bia conclusion.the bia relied on four different subsections of a b iv in finding that haile engaged in terrorist activities,and only three of those subsections have an exception if the alien can show by clear and convincing evidence that he or she did not know and should not reasonably have known that the organization was a terrorist organization.subsection iii,which refers to gathering information on potential targets for terrorist activity,does not contain such an exception.as explained above,haile does not challenge the bia reliance on subsection iii,focusing instead on the question of whether she committed acts that afforded material support to a terrorist organization.because subsection iii does not contain a knowledge exception,haile arguments urging that the bia inadequately addressed whether she knew or reasonably should have known that the elf was a terrorist organization can not support her request for relief in the form of remand on the issue of knowledge.
in light of the record as a whole and the facts as found by the ij,the bia correctly concluded that haile is ineligible for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the cat in the form of withholding because she engaged in terrorist activities in support of a terrorist organization,the elf.
on account of her prior membership in the elf,haile is statutorily barred from asylum and withholding of removal under the ina.see a b i.ordinarily an alien may seek relief under the cat,in at least these two forms withholding of removal under c for aliens who are not barred from eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal and deferral of removal under a for aliens entitled to protection but subject to mandatory denial of withholding.see aguilar ramos holder,cir see also hosseini,at.haile,because she is ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal as an alien who engaged in terrorist activities,is only eligible for the cat relief of deferral of removal under a.
haile contends that the bia erred in denying deferral of removal.we have jurisdiction over this claim because the ij denied haile request for deferral of removal on the merits.see lemus galvan mukasey,cir.we review whether substantial evidence supports the bia findings of fact.silaya mukasey,cir.substantial evidence means the bia determination is supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record.morales gonzales,cir quotation marks omitted.
to receive deferral under the cat,an applicant must establish that it is more likely than not he or she will be tortured upon return to the country to which the alien is deported.a.torture is any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.a.the torture must be inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.a see also arteaga mukasey,cir.
neither of the bia decisions denying cat deferral in this case was based on substantial evidence.the board decisions were based either on factual inaccuracies or hypothesized assumptions not grounded in the record.after issuing a cursory initial decision that flatly misstated key evidence the board supplemented its reasoning with a decision that includes a litany of suppositions that the bia thought haile was about future events which would have to come to pass for haile to be tortured or killed.this marshaling of purported suppositions of haile did not constitute due consideration of the corroborated evidence that was presented by haile.
the regulations implementing cat explicitly require the ij to consider all evidence relevant to the possibility of future torture.aguilar ramos,at see also hernandez velasquez holder,cir.this was not done here.rather than point to evidence to support its conclusion,the board recast ha
