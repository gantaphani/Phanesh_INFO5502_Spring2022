background 
juan and guillermina mora entered the united states unlawfully in and respectively.they left the country together for a trip to tlapanala,mexico in april,got married there,and reentered the united states without inspection a month later.
in august,the moras were served with notices to appear charging them with being removable under a a i because they entered the country without being admitted or paroled.see a a i an alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled,or who arrives in the united states at any time or place other than as designated by the attorney general,is inadmissible.the moras appeared before an ij and admitted the factual allegations in the notices to appear.specifically,juan mora admitted in an affidavit that he unlawfully entered the country in,left for mexico in,and then returned a month later,entering unlawfully for a second time.based on an approved worker visa petition in juan name with a priority date of april,however,juan moved to adjust his status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,and guillermina moved for derivative adjustment of status as juan wife.in the alternative,the moras sought cancellation of removal or voluntary departure.
the ij found that juan was inadmissible under a b because he had departed the united states for mexico and reentered the country unlawfully in.see a b i ii rendering inadmissible an alien who has been unlawfully present in the united states for one year or more,and who again seeks admission within years of the date of such alien departure or removal from the united states.based upon this conclusion,the ij further determined that juan was ineligible for adjustment of status on the basis of the approved visa application.see i permitting beneficiaries of worker visas to apply for adjustment of status,but allowing attorney general to grant relief only to aliens who are admissible.as a result,the ij denied the moras applications for adjustment of status.he also rejected their applications for cancellation of removal,but granted their request for voluntary departure,giving the moras until july,to depart the country,after which time they would become subject to a final order of removal.
the moras appealed to the bia from the denial of adjustment of status,but did not challenge the denial of cancellation of removal.the bia adopted and affirmed the ij decision.although it determined that juan was more properly deemed inadmissible under section a c i i,as opposed to section a b,because he entered the united states without inspection after accruing more than a year of prior unlawful presence,see a c i i rendering inadmissible any alien who has been unlawfully present in the united states for an aggregate period of more than year and who enters or attempts to reenter the united states without being admitted,the bia agreed with the ij that juan mora inadmissibility made him ineligible for adjustment of status on the basis of the approved visa application.it therefore dismissed the appeal.
having now become subject to a final order of removal,see thapa gonzales,cir a n order of voluntary departure that includes an alternate order of removal is a final order subject to judicial review,the moras petition for review of the bia decision denying their applications for adjustment of status.
discussion 
because the bia adopted and modified the ij decision,we review the decision of the ij as modified by the bia xue hong yang dep t of justice,cir.while factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence,questions of law and applications of law to undisputed fact are reviewed de novo.chambers office of chief counsel,cir.pursuant to chevron,however,we defer to the bia interpretation of ambiguous provisions of the immigration laws,unless this interpretation is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute,emokah mukasey,cir quoting chevron,at.see also delgado mukasey,cir we accord chevron deference to decisions of the bia interpreting the immigration statutes.
under i,an alien who has entered the country unlawfully may apply to adjust his immigration status to that of a lawful permanent resident in certain circumstances.see delgado,at.paragraph of that section provides in relevant part that 
a n alien physically present in the united states who entered the united states without inspection,who is the beneficiary of a petition for classification under providing,among other things,for worker visa petitions that was filed with the attorney general on or before april,and who,in the case of a beneficiary of a petition for classification that was filed after january,is physically present in the united states on december,may apply to the attorney general for the adjustment of his or her status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.
i.paragraph,however,allows the attorney general to adjust the status of the alien to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence only if,inter alia,the alien is eligible to receive an immigrant visa and is admissible to the united states for permanent residence,i emphasis added.to qualify for adjustment of status under section i,therefore,an alien who has entered the country unlawfully must be otherwise admissible to the united states.delgado,at quoting i a.
whether an alien is admissible is determined by reference to a.according to paragraph a i of that section,a n alien present in the united states without being admitted or paroled,or who arrives in the united states at any time or place other than as designated by the attorney general,is inadmissible.a a i.in other words,any alien who is present in the country after having entered unlawfully is inadmissible.additionally,paragraph c i establishes two more specific prohibitions,stating,in relevant part,that 
any alien who 
i has been unlawfully present in the united states for an aggregate period of more than year,or 
ii has been ordered removed,
and who enters or attempts to reenter the united states without being admitted is inadmissible.
a c i.the introductory language to section a,however,notes that e xcept as otherwise provided in this chapter,aliens who are inadmissible are ineligible to receive visas and ineligible to be admitted to the united states.a emphasis added.this language acts as a savings clause,allowing admission of otherwise inadmissible aliens where the statute so provides.gonzales,cir.
the moras concede that they satisfy the criteria for inadmissibility set forth in section a c i i because they have been unlawfully present in the united states for more than one year and they departed and reentered the country in connection with their marriage in mexico.because section i allows the attorney general to adjust the status of an alien only if that alien is admissible,it would appear the moras are not entitled to section i relief.but the moras argue that section i can not reasonably be read to foreclose relief to all aliens who are inadmissible under section a.section i,specifying the circumstances in which aliens who have entered the country unlawfully may apply to adjust their status,applies only to aliens who are physically present in the united states and entered w
