on behalf of his three stepsons,ghulam nabi sarwari prepared,signed,and submitted applications for united states passports.on each application,sarwari listed himself as the child father,when in fact,sarwari is neither the birth father nor the adopted father of any of the children.a jury convicted sarwari of three counts of willfully and knowingly making a false statement on a passport application,in violation of.sarwari appeals.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
born in afghanistan in,sarwari entered the united states in after successfully applying for political asylum.in,sarwari married parveen and gave his last name to her and her four children,and parveen and the children were born outside of the united states and lived in pakistan for the first years of her marriage to sarwari.parveen first husband and the children biological father,zalami attai,died in afghanistan prior to the marriage of sarwari and parveen.
in,sarwari became a naturalized united states citizen and,in,filed i,petition for alien relative forms on behalf of parveen and the children in order to bring them to the united states.the united states citizenship and immigration services approved the petitions and parveen and the children legally entered the united states in to live with sarwari in stafford,virginia.
in,sarwari prepared,signed,and submitted united states passport applications on behalf of,and the passport application instructions do not define the term father.the instructions do state,however,that united states passports are issued only to united states citizens or nationals,and directs applicants born outside of the united states to submit certain documents as proof of the applicant united states citizenship.an applicant born outside of the united states,claiming united states citizenship through the naturalization of a parent,must submit his foreign birth certificate,proof of his admission to the united states for permanent residence,and his united states citizen parent naturalization certificate.
on the passport applications,sarwari wrote his name in box,labeled father full name,and signed his name in box,labeled father legal guardian signature.with the applications,sarwari also submitted birth certificates that he obtained from the embassy of afghanistan naming him the father of the children.the united states department of state then issued united states passports to,and 
in march,a federal grand jury indicted sarwari on three counts of willfully and knowingly making a false statement on a passport application in violation of.the indictment charges sarwari with three counts of falsely stat ing in a passport application that he was the applicant father when,in fact,sarwari knew that statement to be false.prior to trial,sarwari moved to dismiss the indictment,contending that his answers on the forms were literally true and thus he did not violate as a matter of law.the district court denied the motion.
at trial,an adjudication officer at the department of homeland security citizenship and immigration services testified that,in her experience,no country would allow a stepfather,as opposed to a biological father,to be considered a father on a birth certificate.a special agent with the department of state diplomatic security services similarly testified,without contradiction,that a stepchild of a naturalized citizen is not eligible to receive a united states passport.the government also presented evidence that sarwari worked as a linguist for the department of state translating pashto and dari into english,and in that capacity,was expected to know the meaning and nuance of english words.
two of sarwari stepchildren and sarwari himself testified that he loved his stepchildren,supported them,considered them to be his children,and that they,in turn,loved him and considered him to be their father.sarwari further testified that he paid for his stepchildren to come to the united states,provided for their daily needs,helped them with their homework,and taught them to speak english.sarwari acknowledged that he knew he was not the biological father of his stepchildren and that he knew the children original birth certificates listed their biological father,zalami attai,as their father.he admitted that nevertheless he obtained from the embassy of afghanistan birth certificates naming him as the children father in order to secure united states passports for the children.sarwari explained that a united states passport officer instructed him to obtain birth certificates for the children from the embassy.he further testified that he believed his stepchildren were united states citizens because of his own status as a citizen.
the government sarwari regarding two documents he submitted subsequent to the passport applications.in,sarwari completed a standard form for security clearance purposes relating to his job as a department of state translator in which he identified his stepchildren as his children even though the form gave sarwari a choice between identifying them as stepchildren and children.in,sarwari completed a n,application for certificate of citizenship,for one of the stepchildren and checked a box which read i am a citizen parent applying for a certificate of citizenship on behalf of my minor under years biological child.form n,application for certificate of citizenship,at emphasis in original.
at the conclusion of the government case,sarwari moved pursuant to rule for a judgment of acquittal.he asserted that the government produced insufficient evidence that he had made a false statement on the passport applications.the district court denied the motion.
during the charge conference,sarwari requested that the district court instruct the jury as to the lack of a definition of the word father in the statutes and regulations governing passport applications.the district court denied the motion.the district court did,however,instruct the jury that good faith constituted a complete defense to the crimes charged against sarwari.
the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all three counts.following the verdict,sarwari renewed his motion for a judgment of acquittal and moved for a new trial.the district court denied both motions and sentenced sarwari to three concurrent terms of twelve months and one day in prison.
sarwari timely filed this appeal.
relying on bronston united states,sarwari initially argues that his answers on the passport applications were literally true,and therefore his convictions can not stand as a matter of law 
in bronston,the supreme court held that an individual can not be convicted of perjury when the allegedly false statement was literally true but not responsive to the question asked and arguably misleading by negative implication.at.the government charged bronston with perjury based on his allegedly intentionally misleading answer to an unambiguous question in a bankruptcy proceeding

have you ever 
a.the company had an account there for about six months,in zurich.
id.at.in fact,bronston had held a personal bank account in zurich,although the negative implication of his answer suggested that he had not.the supreme court reversed his conviction,emphasizing that a perjury conviction is a drastic sanction,and identifying a serious literal problem in basing a violation of a statute that criminalizes willfully stat ing any material matter that a defendant does not believe to be true on a statement that is literally true,even if nonresponsive or misleading.id.at.
we and our sister circuits have,on occasion,applied bronston to reverse a conviction based on a literally true answer.for example,in united states good,cir,we reversed a false statement conviction because the defendant negative response to a question on a security badge application as to whether she had been convicted of burglary,theft,armed robbery,possession or distribution of stolen property,dishonesty,fraud,or misrepresentation was literally true.although the defendant had been convicted of embezzlement,virginia law treated embezzlement as a distinct offense,which was not one of the crimes listed on the application.id.at.we therefo
