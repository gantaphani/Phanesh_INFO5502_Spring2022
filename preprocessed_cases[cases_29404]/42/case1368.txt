kesner francois appeals the district court denial of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus that he filed pursuant to,seeking relief from removal based upon alleged violations of the convention against torture cat.for the reasons that follow,we will convert francois habeas petition into a petition for review,and deny his petition.
facts and procedural history 
francois,a native and citizen of haiti,was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident on march.on may,francois was convicted of possession of a controlled substance in state court.on october,he was convicted of aggravated assault in state court and sentenced to six years in prison.
francois returned to haiti three times in.on august,francois arrived at jfk international airport in new york city and sought admission to the united states as a returning resident.entry was denied,and he was taken into the custody of the bureau of immigration and customs affairs ice because his criminal convictions made him inadmissible.he was eventually served with a notice to appear,charging him with being a removable alien under provisions of the immigration and nationality act ina based upon his criminal convictions in state court.
in the removal proceedings that followed,francois conceded removability,but applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under article of the convention against torture cat.in support of the latter claim,francois alleged that,as a criminal deportee being returned to haiti,he would be indefinitely imprisoned by haitian authorities and tortured if returned.that allegation was supported by official and unofficial reports describing the conditions faced by criminal deportees and haitian prisoners the immigration judge ij denied francois claim for asylum and withholding of removal,but granted relief under the cat based upon the reported conditions in haitian detention facilities.the department of homeland security dhs appealed the ij decision to the board of immigration appeals,and the bia reversed.
francois thereafter filed a petition for habeas corpus in district court pursuant to.the district court denied habeas relief concluding that francois failed to show more than isolated instances of torture occur in haitian prisons.francois ashcroft,d.this appeal followed.
ii.effect of real id act 
district courts had jurisdiction over habeas petitions alleging violations of the cat when francois filed his habeas petition in.ogbudimkpa ashcroft,cir.review was confined to questions of constitutional law and statutory interpretation.bakhtriger elwood,cir.t he broader species of review for substantial evidence and abuse of discretion typical of apa challenges was wholly out of bounds.id.at.accordingly,habeas proceedings did not embrace review of the exercise of discretion,or the sufficiency of the evidence.id.at.instead,the habeas court jurisdiction was limited to pure questions of law,and to issues of application of law to fact,where the facts are undisputed and not the subject of challenge.id.at.
however,t his jurisdictional framework was radically overhauled with the passage of the real id act of,stat.kamara att y of the united states,cir.section a of the real id act,the provision we are concerned with,amended a of the ina by eliminating the district courts habeas corpus jurisdiction,and over final orders of removal in nearly all cases.consequently,a petition for review filed in the appropriate court of appeals is now the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of any cause or claim under the united nations convention against torture and other forms of cruel,inhuman,or degrading treatment or punishment,except as provided in subsection e of this section.real id act a b,a.section a a iii of the real id act also amended by adding a new provision,a d,which states 
nothing in subparagraph b or c,or in any other provision of this act other than this section which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.
a d.with this amendment,
congress evidenced its intent to restore judicial review of constitutional claims and questions of law presented in petitions for review of final removal orders.this now permits all aliens,including criminal aliens,to obtain review of constitutional claims and questions of law upon filing of a petition for review with an appropriate court of appeals.
kamara,at quoting papageorgiou gonzales,cir.
in explicitly making these amendments retroactive congress provided that habeas petitions filed under,which were pending in the district courts as of may,shall be transferred to the court of appeals for the circuit in which a petition for review could have been properly filed and treated as if it had been filed pursuant to a petition for review,with an exception not relevant to our discussion.real id act c.kamara,at,
as we recognized in kamara,the real id act is silent as to the exact procedural posture which faces us here,an appeal from a district court habeas decision that is now pending before the court of appeals.at citing bonhometre gonzales,cir.in kamara,we affirmed congress intent to provide aliens with one chance for judicial review in the court of appeals.we therefore concluded that the appropriate way to treat a pending appeal from the district court habeas petition,is to vacate and disregard the d istrict c ourt opinion and address the claims raised in the habeas petition as if they were presented before us in the first instance as a petition for review.at citing bonhometre,at.accordingly,we will consider francois claims as if they were first presented in a petition for review of the bia decision.
iii.standard of review 
even though francois habeas petition has been converted into a petition for review,our standard of review remains the same.a review for constitutional claims or questions of law,as described in a a iii of the real id act,a d,mirrors our previously enunciated standard of review over an alien habeas petition.kamara,at.accordingly,in examining francois claims,we are limited to pure questions of law,and to issues of application of law to fact,where the facts are undisputed and not the subject of challenge.id.citations and internal quotations omitted.we review the bia legal decisions de novo,but will afford chevron deference to the bia reasonable interpretations of statutes which it is charged with administering.id.citations omitted.
iv.the convention against torture 
on october,the president signed into law the foreign affairs reform and restructuring act of farra,div,stat,authorizing the implementation of article of the convention against torture and requiring implementing regulations to be promulgated by the applicable agencies within days.as directed,the department of justice,which then included the immigration and naturalization service,promulgated regulations setting forth the procedures by which aliens could obtain relief under the cat.see,codified at c,a.
a,the regulatory definition of torture,mirrors the definition of torture contained in article of the cat,which is then clarified by six additional provisions,several of which are relevant here 
a torture is defined as any act by which severe pain or suffering,whether physical or mental,is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession,punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed,or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person,or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind,when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.
a torture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that does not amount to torture.
a torture does not include pain or suffering arising only from,inherent in or incidental to law
