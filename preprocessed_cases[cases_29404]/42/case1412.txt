opinion of the court 
jimmy johnson moves for attorneys fees pursuant to the equal access to justice act eaja,d a.for the reasons that follow,we grant his motion.
background 
johnson petitioned our court for review of the decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his asylum application.johnson is a native of liberia who fled that country after being forcibly recruited into and then deserting the army of the national patriotic front of liberia npfl a group associated with charles taylor,who later became the president of liberia and subsequently abdicated that position.the bia determined that johnson ha d failed to show that he was persecuted on account of his political opinion,and that his persecution was not solely the result of the guerillas aim in seeking to fill their ranks in order to carry out the war with the government and pursue their political goal,their political motive being irrelevant.
we granted johnson petition for review,holding that the bia decision was not supported by substantial evidence when it failed even to consider johnson testimony from his second asylum hearing which the immigration judge ij determined credible in a finding not disturbed by the bia in reviewing the ij decision resulting from that hearing see johnson ashcroft,cir 
johnson motion for attorneys fees relating to his petition for review is now before us.
ii.jurisdiction 
under the eaja,a motion for attorneys fees must be filed within thirty days of final judgment in the action.d b.in this context,final judgment means a judgment that is final and not appealable d b.we have held that the thirty day for eaja petitions begins when the government right to appeal the order has lapsed.taylor united states,cir per curiam.
the government time to petition for a writ of certiorari in this case expired on march.johnson,however,filed his motion on march.this technicality need not concern us,as we have noted that t he eaja establishes only a deadline after which petitions may not be filed earlier filing is possible.id.at.johnson motion for attorneys fees thus is properly before us,and we now turn to the merits of that motion.
iii.discussion 
t he essential objective of the eaja is to ensure that persons will not be deterred from seeking review of,or defending against,unjustified governmental action because of the expense involved in the vindication of their rights clarke ins,cir internal quotation omitted.the eaja thus provides,in pertinent part,as follows 
except as otherwise specifically provided by statute,a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses incurred by that party in any civil action including proceedings for judicial review of agency action,brought by or against the united states in any court having jurisdiction of that action,unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.

accordingly,we must first determine whether johnson was the prevailing party in this action under the eaja.if we conclude that he is,we must then consider whether the position of the united states in this case was substantially justified.
prevailing party 
the question we are faced with an alien who prevails on petition for review before us but whose case is remanded to the bia for further proceedings and who therefore may not ultimately prevail in immigration proceedings is a prevailing party for eaja one of first impression in our circuit.the court of appeals for the ninth circuit,in a decision later adopted by the court of appeals for the seventh circuit,has answered that question in the affirmative.see ins,cir rejecting government argument that petitioners were not prevailing parties within the meaning of the eaja because they merely secured a remand for further agency action,and did not obtain affirmative relief on the merits of their underlying claims for asylum and withholding of deportation see also muhur ashcroft,cir agreeing with and holding that when a court of appeals,as in this case,reverses a denial of asylum because the denial was erroneous,and sends the case back to the immigration service for further proceedings,the applicant is a prevailing party.
both courts held that this result was dictated by the supreme court decision in shalala schaefer,d.muhur,at,at.in schaefer,the court opinion explained that i n cases reviewing final agency decisions on social security benefits,the exclusive methods by which district courts may remand to the secretary are set forth in sentence four and sentence six of g at.the court ruled that a social security claimant who secured a remand to the opposed to a further proceedings was a prevailing party under the eaja because such a remand terminate d the litigation with victory for the plaintiff.id.at.
in reaching this conclusion,the court emphasized that a remand results in the immediate entry of judgment and relinquishment of jurisdiction by the district court,whereas in the remand context judgment is not entered and the district court retains jurisdiction until agency proceedings are complete.id.at.thus,a remand terminates federal court litigation in favor of the plaintiff,but a remand does not.the court further reasoned that a person who obtained a remand reversing the secretary of health and human services denial of benefits certainly met its description of a prevailing who has succeeded on any significant issue in litigation which achieve d some of the benefit sought in bringing suit.id.at.quoting texas state teachers ass garland indep.sch,d.
the seventh and ninth circuits determined that a remand to the bia in an immigration case is essentially the same as a remand in a social security case.see muhur,at holding that the court could not see any difference between a remand to the bia and the remand at issue in schaefer,at holding that both remands and remands to the bia terminate judicial proceedings and result in the entry of final judgment we agree with this conclusion.as the seventh circuit stated,the social security claimant in schaefer 
who persuade d the court of appeals to set aside the social security administration denial of benefits was a prevailing party in the judicial proceeding because nothing remain ed to be done by the court,which having found error ha d finished with the case and relinquished jurisdiction.
muhur,at emphasis added.
we have the same situation here.johnson secured the setting aside of an erroneous bia decision in his case.we entered judgment in his favor and relinquished jurisdiction.thus,pursuant to the reasoning of schaefer,he is the prevailing party in this proceeding for eaja purposes regardless whether he ultimately prevails in his underlying immigration proceeding 
accordingly,we join our sister circuit courts in holding that an alien whose petition for review of a bia decision is granted by our court and whose case is then remanded to the bia is a prevailing party under the eaja,and may therefore be entitled to attorneys fees.having determined that johnson is a prevailing party,we turn to whether the government position in this litigation was substantially justified,a second leg of analysis in johnson quest for fees.
substantially justified 
the supreme court has held that,as used in the eaja,substantially justified does not mean justified to a high degree but instead means justified in substance or in the is,justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.pierce underwood,d.put another way,substantially justified means having a reasonable basis in both law and fact.id.internal quotation omitted.thus,a court must not assume that the government position was not substantially justified simply because the government lost on the merits.kiareldeen ashcroft,cir.
we have held that,in immigration cases,the government must meet the substantially justified test with regard to the underlying agency action and again with regard to its litigation position in the proceedings arising from that action.see id.at first,the government must independently establish that the agency action giving rise to the litigation was substan
