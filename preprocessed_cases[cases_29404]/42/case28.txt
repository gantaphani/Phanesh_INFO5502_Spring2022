frank edney monteiro miranda,who was once deemed to be a citizen by an immigration judge ij in and escaped the possibility of removal,now petitions for that determination to be considered binding in removal proceedings before a second ij,who ordered miranda removed based on his conviction for a drug felony.the board of immigration appeals bia dismissed miranda appeal,and he petitions for review.miranda argues that the doctrine of res judicata should have barred the second ij and the bia from readjudicating the issue of his citizenship,finding that he is not a citizen,and ordering him removed.he asks that we vacate his removal order.
this is a novel issue for this circuit.we hold that the applicability of res judicata becomes immaterial before this court because of the jurisdictional limitations imposed by the immigration and nationality act ina,pub,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of.under the ina,this court must undertake a plenary review of the question of miranda citizenship in order to determine whether we have jurisdiction to hear his petition for review.see a c barring jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable for the commission of certain criminal offenses,b a requiring determination of petitioner nationality claim when there is no dispute of fact.we conclude that miranda has failed to meet his burden of proving that he is a citizen.accordingly,the jurisdictional bar in a c applies and precludes judicial review of the final order of removal against him.we dismiss his petition.in doing so,we agree with the tenth circuit decision in shepherd holder,cir.
the facts of this case are undisputed.miranda was born out of wedlock in angola on june,to a mother and father,both of cape verde citizenship.on august,miranda mother and father appeared as informing parents at the embassy of cape verde in angola and signed miranda record of birth before two witnesses.miranda has two sisters,and both were also born in angola.
on december,miranda,his mother,and his two sisters were admitted to the united states as lawful permanent residents.shortly thereafter,his father also relocated to the united states.on december,miranda mother and father were married in massachusetts.
miranda mother became a naturalized citizen on january.at that time,miranda was sixteen years old.miranda and his two sisters filed applications for certificates of citizenship.miranda sisters attended their interviews and received their certificates of citizenship,based on citizenship derived through their mother naturalization.miranda was unable to attend his interview,scheduled for may,because he was in the custody of the massachusetts department of youth services at the time.as a result,miranda never received a certificate of citizenship.
on may,the department of homeland security dhs initiated removal proceedings against miranda after he pled guilty to failing to register as a sex offender,in violation of massachusetts law.miranda moved to terminate the proceedings on the ground that he was a citizen because he had allegedly derived citizenship through his mother when she was naturalized in.the ij,charles,continued the proceedings in order to allow miranda to pursue an application for a certificate of citizenship,but the united states citizenship and immigration services uscis denied miranda application.the uscis did so after examining,inter alia,miranda original birth record which included his father signature and concluding that miranda paternity had been legitimated.under applicable law in,miranda could have derived citizenship through his mother naturalization only if his paternity ha d not been established by legitimation.a.
notwithstanding the uscis denial,ij convened a hearing to determine whether miranda was a citizen.at the hearing,miranda mother testified that miranda father was not involved in her children lives and that she continued to be their sole economic provider even after she married their father in.miranda also submitted as evidence letters from public schools about his mother responsibility for his education,a letter that his counsel had sent to his mother,and his sisters certificates of citizenship.at the conclusion of the hearing,ij issued an oral decision granting miranda motion to terminate removal proceedings on the ground that he was a citizen.ij found that miranda ha d presented credible evidence that he derived citizenship through his mother as a child born out of wedlock whose paternity ha d not been established by legitimation.dhs never appealed this decision.
on february,miranda was convicted for distributing cocaine base,in violation of a.after miranda release from prison,dhs initiated new removal proceedings against him.the notice to appear dated september,charged miranda as removable under a a ii,a iii,and b i.see a a ii removability for multiple criminal convictions,a a iii removability for aggravated felony,a b i removability for crime relating to controlled substance.miranda once again filed a motion to terminate removal proceedings,citing ij determination that he was a citizen and arguing that res judicata barred the second ij,steven day,from readjudicating miranda citizenship.
ij day denied miranda motion,refusing to apply res judicata in the context of an administrative proceeding where doing so would frustrate congressional intent.while ij day acknowledged that most circuits that have considered the applicability of res judicata in removal proceedings have held that the doctrine does apply,he also noted that the doctrine is more flexible in administrative proceedings than in judicial proceedings.v arious courts have affirmed bia decisions that decline to apply the doctrine when doing so would frustrate congress interest in removing aliens convicted of certain crimes,ij day observed.ij day then concluded that miranda was not a citizen because he had been legitimated by his father under both angolan and massachusetts law and thus could not have derived citizenship through his mother naturalization.miranda was ordered removed from the united states to cape verde or,in the alternative,to angola.
the bia dismissed miranda appeal,agreeing with ij day conclusion that res judicata was inapplicable and that miranda paternity had been established through legitimation under the laws of angola and massachusetts.
miranda now petitions for review of the final order of removal against him.he advances two related arguments in his petition.first,he argues that he is a citizen of the united states and thus not subject to removal.second,he argues that ij day and the bia erred by not applying res judicata to ij determination that miranda was a citizen.
statutory jurisdictional framework 
we first determine whether we have jurisdiction to hear miranda petition.section a c provides 
notwithstanding any other provision of law and except as provided in subparagraph d,no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in section a a iii,b,c,or d of this title,or any offense covered by section a a ii of this title 
a c emphasis added because miranda was charged as removable under a a ii,a iii,and b i,this jurisdictional bar would ordinarily apply to preclude our review of his petition.
here,however,miranda argues that he is a citizen and thus not an alien who is removable under a c accordingly,in order to determine whether the jurisdictional bar applies,we must adjudicate miranda claim of citizenship.indeed,the ina requires us to do so under b a,which provides if the petitioner claims to be a national of the united states and the court of appeals finds that no genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner nationality is presented,the court shall decide the nationality claim.id.b a.further,b ecause nationality includes citizenship,the statutory reference to nationality claims in b a is understood to include citizenship claims.shepherd,at citations omitted.
as the material facts in this case are undisputed,we undertake a plenary review of miranda claim of citizenship in order to determine wheth
