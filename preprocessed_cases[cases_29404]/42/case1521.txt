after pleading guilty to a statutory burglary offense in virginia,daniel jorge a native of panama admitted to the united states on a visitor visa in was subjected to expedited removal proceedings.the department of homeland security the dhs initiated those proceedings because castendet was not lawfully admitted to this country for permanent residence and his burglary offense is,in the dhs view,an aggravated felony for purposes of immigration law.castendet unsuccessfully sought review in the immigration court of the dhs aggravated felony determination,petitioned for our review,and then was removed to panama.following the dhs subsequent cancellation of castendet removal order,the attorney general moved in this court to dismiss castendet petition for review.as explained below,we stand by a prior panel ruling denying the attorney general motion to dismiss,and we grant castendet petition for review,vacate the dhs order of removal,and remand.
castendet was born in panama on february,he grew up in colon,where criminal activities were a substantial part of his life.castendet father,jorge daniel castendet marcia,was a police officer in the noriega government.marcia physically and psychologically abused castendet,as well as other members of the family.marcia also trafficked in drugs,accepted bribes,and provided weapons for illegal gangs.one of castendet brothers,jorge wilkerson,regularly joined his father in illegal pursuits that included drug trafficking.
although marcia did not live with castendet,various associates of marcia and wilkerson including corrupt police officers and members of a gang called the cold coffin kids were frequent visitors at castendet family home.they often came there to retrieve items containing illegal drugs.during such visits,marcia and wilkerson criminal associates occasionally threatened castendet and other family members.on one occasion,corrupt officers seized tires that wilkerson had stored on the house balcony tires that castendet believed to contain drugs.those officers threatened to harm castendet and his family if they divulged what had occurred.another time,a corrupt officer came to the home seeking electronic speakers in which wilkerson had concealed drugs.when castendet told the officer that wilkerson had removed the speakers from the house,the officer threatened to hurt castendet.
in,the cold coffin kids shot and killed one of castendet friends,a boy named jack,while the pair were together walking home from school.castendet believes that the gang killed jack because jack knew of the gang activities from staying at castendet house.the cold coffin kids left castendet unharmed,but warned him that he did not see anything,or else.see 
on april,castendet along with his mother and younger brother fled panama and entered the united states on visitor visas for nearly six years,castendet did well in this country by attending school,joining a church,and spending time with more upstanding family members.even here,however,criminal elements came to permeate castendet life.when castendet was eighteen years old,on january,two of his friends ryan rice and malik best broke into the home of a mccree in newport news,virginia.after pilfering several items,including nike shoes and three watches,rice and best came to castendet home to conceal the stolen goods.the pair told castendet to come with them and see how mccree is living.see.after first declining to accompany rice and best to mccree house,castendet gave in to the peer pressure.he went with his friends to mccree home and waited while rice and best went inside.at some point,castendet also entered the mccree home and rice stole a dell laptop computer from it.
in early,castendet was arrested and indicted in newport news for grand larceny and statutory burglary.on july,he pleaded guilty to the statutory burglary offense.see.code.pursuant to his plea agreement with the state prosecutor,the grand larceny charge was dismissed.two months later,on september,the state court sentenced castendet to five years in prison with all five years suspended,essentially a sentence of time served.
on september,two days after castendet was sentenced,the dhs initiated its expedited removal proceedings against him.those proceedings were conducted under b,which provides for the expedited removal of an alien not lawfully admitted for permanent residence who has been convicted of an aggravated felony as explained in a a iii.the dhs contended that castendet was subject to expedited removal because his virginia statutory burglary offense qualifies as an aggravated felony.that same day,the dhs issued castendet a final administrative removal order the removal order.
castendet subsequently requested and received what is called a reasonable fear interview.following that interview,an asylum officer determined that castendet possessed a reasonable fear of persecution or torture if he was removed to panama.in january,the asylum officer referred the matter to an immigration judge an ij for a proceeding.castendet then filed applications for asylum,withholding of removal,and protection under the convention against torture the cat.he contended therein that the dhs removal order was improper,in that his virginia statutory burglary offense is not an aggravated felony under a a iii.
on august,the ij denied castendet applications for withholding of removal and protection under the cat.the ij also concluded that he lacked jurisdiction to consider castendet asylum application.additionally,the ij deemed himself unauthorized to assess castendet challenge to the dhs categorization of his burglary offense as an aggravated felony.see etienne lynch,cir.concluding that alien in expedited removal proceedings can challenge legal basis for removal in appropriate court of appeals only.
castendet promptly appealed to the board of immigration appeals the bia.on january,the bia ruled that castendet was not entitled to challenge the legal basis of his removal,whether his burglary offense qualifies as an aggravated felony because he had been placed in expedited removal proceedings.the bia also agreed that the ij lacked jurisdiction to consider castendet asylum application,but remanded for further consideration of castendet requests for withholding of removal and cat protection.
at the conclusion of the remand proceedings,on june,a different ij denied castendet withholding of removal and cat relief.castendet again appealed to the bia,which on october,again affirmed.on november,castendet petitioned for our review,and he was thereafter removed to panama.we possess jurisdiction pursuant to a 
on june,six months after removing castendet to panama,the dhs cancelled his removal order three days later,the attorney general moved to dismiss castendet petition for review,making two contentions.the attorney general first argued that cancellation of the removal order negated the statutory basis for this court exercise of jurisdiction.see motion to dismiss,sessions,at cir.june,ecf.next,he contended that a regulatory provision d iii of title of the code of federal regulations vested the dhs with the authority to cancel the removal order.
castendet opposed dismissal,contending that the dhs does not have the authority to cancel a final administrative removal order for the purpose of defeating the jurisdiction of a court of appeals.see response in opposition,sessions,at cir.july,ecf.castendet argued that we should reject the attorney general transparent attempt to avoid judicial review in this case.id.at.he urged us to adhere to an approach taken by the third circuit,which recently rejected similar efforts by the dhs to cancel removal orders and then have those cancellations used by the attorney general to seek dismissal of petitions under review in that court of appeals.see walker att y,app x,cir.att y,app x,cir.
in september,we denied the attorney general motion to dismiss the petition for review,observing that we find no authority that would allow the dhs to cancel a final administrative removal order under the circumstances presented in this case.see order,sessions,at cir,ecf the order denying dismissal.the attorney general nevertheless renewed his dismissal request in his response brief.
we first assess and deny the attorney general renewed motion to dismiss.we then proceed to the merits of castendet petition for review,which contends that his burglary offense is not an aggravated felony.because we agree with castendet contention,we grant the petition 
we begin with the attorney general renewed request for dismissal of the petition for review.the premise of that request is that we can not review the removal order because the dhs has cancelled it.in his initial motion to dismiss,the attorney general raised only two contentions in support of dismissal that we lack jurisdiction to review a removal order cancelled by the dhs,and that d iii of title of the code of federal regulations authorizes the dhs to cancel a removal order.the attorney general now advances a total of five grounds for dismissal,including the two we already rejected.his three new arguments are that the dhs has prosecutorial discretion to cancel a removal order,the dhs has inherent authority to cancel a removal order,and castendet petition for review is moot in the absence of a removal order.
we need only address one of the attorney general restated contentions.we do not reconsider the ruling of our order denying dismissal that d iii fails to authorize the dhs to cancel the removal order,as that ruling is the law of the case.see united states rosen,cir.explaining that earlier legal ruling is binding through all subsequent stages of proceeding.we again assess the attorney general jurisdictional contention,however,because the law of the case doctrine does not bar us from revisiting a prior ruling of a motion panel on the court jurisdiction.see cnf constructors,donohoe const,cir.
the attorney general maintains that we lack jurisdiction because a final order of removal does not exist.our jurisdiction stems from a,which provides that a court of appeals may review a final order of removal.according to the attorney general,the dhs cancellation of the removal order rendered the removal order nonexistent and unreviewable.that proposition,however,ignores the facts in these proceedings.the dhs removed castendet pursuant to the removal order,as to which he then sought review.we possessed a jurisdiction when castendet filed his petition for review.the dhs thereafter cancelled the removal order.we know of no authority of the dhs and none has been presented here to strip us of jurisdiction in a pending case simply by writing cancelled on a removal order the dhs has used to remove an alien 
next,we address only one of the attorney general three new contentions.he has waived two of those arguments by not timely raising them in the motion to dismiss that the dhs has both the prosecutorial discretion and the inherent authority to cancel a removal order.we nevertheless address the attorney general mootness contention even though not raised in the motion to dismiss because the question of whether we are presented with a live case or controversy is a question we may raise sua sponte since mootness goes to the heart of the article iii jurisdiction of the courts.see friedman,dunlap,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.
the attorney general maintains that the dhs cancellation of the removal order has mooted this matter because castendet is no longer subject to removal.we disagree for two sound reasons.first,the dhs classification of castendet as an aggravated felon spawns collateral consequences unrelated to the removal order.see smith ashcroft,cir.t hough the petitioner is no longer in the united states,he is unmistakably affected by the legal implications of our decision.if he prevails,there is a possibility he can beneficially unravel his untoward immigration status.for example,castendet status as an aggravated felon could preclude him from ever receiving permission to reenter the united states.see united states,cir.rejecting mootness argument because conviction could impact petitioner ability to reenter.
second,this proceeding has not been mooted because the dhs conduct under challenge could be repeated.if castendet reentered the united states,the dhs could recommence its removal proceedings,likely on the premise that he is an aggravated felon.the attorney general has not foreclosed the possibility of the dhs later reasserting that castendet is an aggravated felon.see wall wade,cir.it is well established that a defendant voluntary cessation of a challenged practice moots an action only if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore decline to dismiss castendet petition on mootness grounds,and the removal order yet exists.
turning to the merits of castendet petition for review,the dispositive issue is whether the offense of statutory burglary in virginia constitutes an aggravated felony for purposes of immigration law.whether a crime is an aggravated felony is a question of law that we review de novo.see mbea gonzales,cir.
castendet removal order is predicated on a a iii,which provides that a ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.an aggravated felony includes,inter alia,a burglary offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year.see a g.
to determine whether a state offense qualifies as an aggravated felony,we generally utilize the categorical approach described by the supreme court in taylor united states,and descamps united states.see omargharib holder,cir.under the categorical approach,we will consider only the elements of the offense of conviction,not the underlying conduct.id.if the offense of conviction has the same elements as the generic federal offense,then the offense of conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony.id.but,if the offense of conviction sweeps more broadly and criminalizes more conduct than the generic federal crime,then the offense of conviction is not an aggravated felony even if the defendant actually committed that offense in its generic form.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
the attorney general contends,however,that virginia statutory burglary is a divisible offense,requiring us to apply the modified categorical approach.the modified categorical approach helps implement the categorical approach when a defendant was convicted of violating a divisible statute.see descamps,at.to that end,the modified categorical approach applies only when a statute is divisible,when it sets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative,id.at,and so effectively creates several different crimes,id.at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.as justice kagan explained in descamps,if one of the alternative elements 
matches an element in the generic offense,but the other does not,the modified categorical approach permits sentencing courts to consult a limited class of documents,such as indictments and jury instructions,to determine which alternative formed the basis of the defendant prior conviction.
id.at.in such a situation,the reviewing court can then compare the elements of the offense of conviction with the elements of the generic crime.the court is not entitled,however,to apply the modified categorical approach to an indivisible statute that is,a statute that does not contain alternative elements.
just last year,in mathis united states,the supreme court explained that elements are the constituent parts of a crime legal definition the things the prosecution must prove to sustain a conviction.see,internal quotation marks omitted.an element is,in other words,what the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt to convict the defendant and what the defendant necessarily admits when he pleads guilty.id.facts,on the other hand,are mere things extraneous to the crime legal requirements.id.facts are circumstance s or event s having no legal effect or consequence.id.alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted.statutes that enumerate various factual means of committing a single element,rather than statutes that list multiple elements disjunctively,are indivisible.id.at.
