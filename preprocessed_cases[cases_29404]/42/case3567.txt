daniel millis challenges his conviction under a for placing full,plastic bottles of water on trails in the buenos aires national wildlife refuge to help alleviate exposure deaths among undocumented immigrants crossing into the united states.millis concedes that he placed water on refuge trails,but argues that his actions did not violate a.we have jurisdiction under and reverse millis conviction.
on february,united states fish and wildlife service officers allen kirkpatrick and scott kozma observed four individuals in a toyota while patrolling in the buenos aires national wildlife refuge.as kirkpatrick approached the vehicle,he noticed several plastic bottles of water through the lowered back window the back window was then remotely raised.
in the were daniel millis and three other volunteers from no more deaths,an organization that provides humanitarian aid to migrants.one such service is the placement of water in the desert along frequently traveled routes for unlawful entrants into the united states.millis,the driver of the,later testified that he had placed water on the refuge on at least several dozen occasions.he also testified that he had raised the back window when kirkpatrick approached to make visible his decal.
upon questioning,millis admitted that the volunteers had been placing plastic bottles of water on refuge trails,but indicated that they had also picked up discarded empty bottles.kirkpatrick responded that the group actions constituted littering and requested that the group retrieve the bottles.kirkpatrick later testified that litter problems had placed the refuge on a list of the ten most imperiled national wildlife refuges in the country.according to his testimony,the refuge remains the last habitat in the united states for the masked bobwhite quail and houses other endangered plant and animal species.
kirkpatrick also informed millis that special permits were required to leave water on the refuge and that a permit application to place plastic bottles of water on the refuge would be denied.according to his testimony,refuge managers had granted another organization,humane borders,a special use permit to keep large water drums on the refuge.one of these drums was located less than two miles away.also in close proximity was a united states border patrol rescue beacon.
after the volunteers retrieved three bottles of water on a nearby trail,the officers drove off in an eastbound direction on brown canyon road.soon,kirkpatrick noticed fresh tire marks on the side of the road alongside another trail and suspected the volunteers had left bottles in that area as well.kirkpatrick exited the car to recover the bottles and instructed kozma to stop the if it passed,which he did.the witnesses gave differing accounts of the conversation that followed.kozma testified that he told the volunteers to meet him on the next trail where they had placed water.millis testified that kozma told the volunteers to meet him on the next trail where they had placed water that would be easy to retrieve.
the officers again drove eastbound on brown canyon road,expecting to meet the volunteers at the next trail that had bottles of water.they noticed fresh tracks and stopped and recovered bottles from the next two trails.however,the volunteers did not stop.believing that the volunteers had not complied with their instructions and were leaving the refuge,the officers decided to locate them and issue a citation.
the officers encountered the and its occupants for the third time further east on brown canyon road.millis and the three passengers were standing outside the.millis testified that they had picked up several bottles at this location and believed themselves to have complied with kozma instructions.
the officers disagreed.kirkpatrick issued millis a citation for disposal of waste on a national wildlife refuge,as a first offense,in violation of a and asked millis for the location of any remaining plastic bottles of water.millis produced a notebook that detailed the volunteers water drop route.the notebook included gps coordinates for each drop off spot and a numbering system.the numbers listed in the notebook corresponded to numbers written on the bottles alongside the date.in total,officers retrieved seventeen bottles of water from refuge trails and seized several more from the back of the,for a total of.
at his bench trial,millis admitted that he had placed the bottles of water on the refuge.however,he testified that leaving water out for illegal immigrants constitutes humanitarian aide and that humanitarian aide is never a crime.
the magistrate judge found millis guilty of the charge and imposed a suspended sentence.millis appealed to the district court,contending that the placement of bottles of purified water on a national wildlife refuge does not violate a as a matter of law.the district court affirmed millis conviction.
we review questions of law de novo.united states cabaccang,cir en banc.the regulation under which millis was convicted,is entitled disposal of waste and provides that 
a the littering,disposing,or dumping in any manner of garbage,refuse sewage sludge,earth,rocks,or other debris on any national wildlife refuge except at points or locations designated by the refuge manager,or the draining or dumping of oil,acids,pesticide wastes,poisons,or any other types of chemical wastes in,or otherwise polluting any waters,water holes,streams or other areas within any national wildlife refuge is prohibited.
b persons using a national wildlife refuge shall comply with the sanitary requirement established under the provisions of this subchapter c for each individual refuge the sanitation provisions which may be included in leases,agreements,or use permits,and all applicable federal and states laws.
millis concedes that he placed water on refuge trails,but argues that his conduct did not violate a because the bottles of purified water did not constitute garbage,refuse sewage,sludge,earth,rocks,or other debris within the meaning of the regulation.the united states counters that the bottles constitute garbage.
we begin by noting that the rule of lenity requires courts to limit the reach of criminal statutes to the clear import of their text and construe any ambiguity against the government.united states romm,cir see also united states,cir.the rule of lenity applies only where after seizing every thing from which aid can be derived,the court is left with an ambiguous statute.united states nader,cir quoting smith united states.in such a case,fundamental principles of due process mandate that no individual be forced to speculate,at peril of indictment,whether his conduct is prohibited.nader,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
we next turn to the language of the regulation.when construing a word,we generally construe the term in accordance with its ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.cleveland city of,cir quoting san jose christian coll.city of morgan hill,cir.to that end,we may consider a dictionary definition.see see also mac shell,shell oil prods,wl,using dictionary definitions to inform statutory construction of words.webster defines garbage as food waste or discarded or useless material.webster collegiate dictionary ed discard,in turn is defined as to get rid of,esp.as useless or unpleasant.id.at.applying those definitions in the present context,the text of a is ambiguous as to whether purified water in a sealed bottle intended for human consumption meets the definition of garbage.
a second fundamental canon of construction is that words must be read in their context,with a view to their place in the overall regulatory scheme,and to fit,if possible,all parts into an harmonious whole.fda brown williamson tobacco,quoting ftc mandel.there is little doubt that the overarching purpose of the underlying statute and implementing regulations is the conservation,management,and restoration of wildlife and natural habitats.pursuant to the refuge improvement act 
the mission of the national wildlife refuge system is to administer a national network of lands and waters for the conservation,management,and where appropriate,restoration of the fish,wildlife,and plant resources and their habitats within the united states for the benefit of present and future generations of americans.
a.in administering the system,the secretary is instructed to ensure that the mission of the system and the purposes of each refuge are carried out,id.at a d plan and direct the continued growth of the system in a manner that is best designed to accomplish the mission of the system,id.at a c and to ensure that the biological integrity,diversity,and environmental health of the system are maintained for the benefit of present and future generations of americans,id.at a b.additional uses of system areas are permitted only if the secretary of the interior determines that such uses are compatible with the major purposes for which such areas were established.id.at d a see also.as the district court correctly noted,therefore,the intent of the regulatory scheme is to prevent the disposal or abandonment of unauthorized property on refuge land.
however,the structure of the regulatory scheme achieves that end in a number of ways.section a,as we have noted,forbids the littering,disposing,or dumping in any manner of garbage,refuse sewage,sludge,earth,rocks,or other debris.another provision prohibits a bandoning,discarding,or otherwise leaving any personal property in any national wildlife refuge.a third provision anticipates that some property might be placed in the refuge upon receipt of a special use permit.see also requiring the exhibition of permits upon request.the structure of the regulatory scheme thus suggests that a was not intended to be a comprehensive implementation of the congressional mandate to minimize human impact on wildlife refuges rather,it formed part of a larger regulatory scheme indeed,as the government concedes,special use permits have been granted to allow the placement of water drums within the refuge for humanitarian purposes.
the narrow question we consider today is whether the term garbage within the context of the regulation was sufficiently ambiguous that the rule of lenity would apply in this case.here,given the common meaning of the term garbage,coupled with the regulatory structure,we conclude that a is sufficiently ambiguous in this context that the rule of lenity should apply.millis likely could have been charged under a different regulatory section,such as abandonment of property or failure to obtain a special use permit.however,that is not the question presented here.the only question is whether the rule of lenity should be applied to the offense charged.we conclude that it does apply,and we reverse the judgment of the district court.
daniel millis,motivated by humanitarian concerns,scattered plastic water bottles with bright blue caps throughout the buenos aires national wildlife refuge in southern arizona.when millis failed to pick up all of the bottles after fish and wildlife service employees asked him to do so,he was cited for littering on a national wildlife refuge.a.after a bench trial,a magistrate judge found millis guilty of the charge,and the district court affirmed his conviction.the majority overturns his conviction on the grounds that the common meaning of the term garbage is sufficiently ambiguous to require invocation of the rule of lenity.i believe that the rule of lenity does not apply here because leaving plastic bottles in a wildlife refuge is littering under any ordinary,common meaning of the word.
the buenos aires national wildlife refuge is located in arizona on the border between the united states and mexico.in,the fish and wildlife service the service purchased the area in order to restore the area grasslands and to protect endangered animals such as the pronghorn and the masked bobwhite quail.fish wildlife service,buenos aires national wildlife refuge,http last visited.among other things,under the refuge improvement act,a,the service must provide for the conservation of fish,wildlife,and plants,and their habitats ensure that the environmental health of the system is maintained contribute to the conservation of the ecosystems and ensure that the mission of the system and the purposes of each refuge are carried out.a a,b,c,d.the refuge act also states that n o person shall disturb,injure,cut,burn,remove,destroy,or possess any real or personal property of the united states,including natural growth,in any refuge or enter,use,or otherwise occupy any such area for any purpose unless such activities are performed by persons authorized to do so.id.c.in furtherance of this prohibition,the service issued a regulation prohibiting anyone from littering,disposing,or dumping in any manner of garbage,refuse sewage,sludge,earth,rocks or other debris on any national wildlife refuge.a.
in my view,the regulation readily encompasses the act of scattering water bottles in a wildlife refuge.although the regulation is poorly drafted,it can be understood by persons of ordinary intelligence.the regulation forbids littering in the wildlife refuge or disposing of or dumping garbage,refuse sewage,sludge,earth,rocks,or other debris.id.a.i see no need to invoke the rule of lenity.
the rule of lenity is founded on the policy that a fair warning should be given to the world in language that the common world will understand,of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.united states bass.we use the rule to aid us in interpreting an ambiguous statute by resolving doubt in favor of the defendant.see id.at.the rule of lenity only applies when,after consulting traditional canons of statutory construction,we are left with an ambiguous statute.united states hayes.the simple existence of some statutory ambiguity is not sufficient to warrant application of th e rule of lenity,for most statutes are ambiguous to some degree to invoke the rule,we must conclude that there is a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute,such that after seizing everything from which aid can be derived,we can make no more than a guess as to what congress intended.muscarello united states,quotation marks,omission,and citations omitted.
largely ignoring the term littering,the majority focuses instead on the term garbage,which it defines as food waste or discarded or useless material op.at.the majority concludes that because the water in the bottles is intended for human consumption,the bottles have value,and,therefore,are not garbage.op.at.the majority holds that given the common meaning of the term garbage,a is sufficiently ambiguous in this context that the rule of lenity should apply.op.at.
i think the critical term here is not garbage,but littering.millis citation was not for dumping garbage but for littering in a national wildlife refuge.millis testified that wildlife refuge workers told them that leaving water jugs on that trail constituted litter,and that he was going to be cited for littering.officer kirkpatrick similarly testified 
i told millis that placing water out on the refuge was littering.i explained to him that under the national wildlife system administration act that was a class b misdemeanor and he could face up to six months in jail five thousand dollars in fines for littering on a national wildlife refuge.
after mills and those with him failed to pick up the jugs they had deposited,officer kirkpatrick explained to them that he was going to cite them for littering at that point because he felt they had no intention of complying with the service regulations.littering is not the same thing as dumping garbage.the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably,but as long as we are using dictionaries littering means to strew with scattered articles,and the example cited refers to one who litters the scene with papers,boxes,and cans.webster third international dictionary.such items may constitute garbage,but strewing an area with papers,boxes,and cans may be evidence of mere untidiness or,more appropriately here,items valuable to someone,but not to the person or entity controlling the area.
the first amendment handbill cases supply a good example.we have struck down regulations that prohibited soliciting or leafleting in public fora on first amendment grounds,despite the government positi
