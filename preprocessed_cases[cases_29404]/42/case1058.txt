petitioner xiao ji chen,a native and citizen of the people republic of china,petitions this court for review of a september,order of the board of immigration appeals bia summarily affirming a november,decision of an immigration judge ij.the ij found petitioner application for asylum,which was filed more than one year after her arrival in the united states,untimely.see a b.he further found that she had not established either changed circumstances which materially affect ed her eligibility for asylum or the existence of extraordinary circumstances that would have excused her tardiness in filing her application.id.a d.finally,the ij denied petitioner application for withholding of removal based on his finding that she failed to establish that were she to return to china,it was more likely than not that she would be subject to persecution or torture.see id.b a c.
in her petition for review to this court,petitioner urges that her lateness in filing her asylum application should have been excused by the ij because she demonstrated both changed circumstances materially affecting her eligibility for asylum and extraordinary circumstances that prevented her from timely filing her application.specifically,she asserts that there were changed circumstances because,shortly before her hearing before the ij,she gave birth in the united states to her second child,who automatically,by operation of law,is a citizen of the united states.she claims also that extraordinary circumstances affecting the timeliness of her asylum application existed because the immigration and naturalization service ins failed to have a procedure in place that would have permitted her to preserve a request for asylum when she was first detained by the ins within her first year of being in the united states.pet r br.at.petitioner avers,inter alia,that,in finding that she did not demonstrate circumstances that would excuse her lateness in filing her asylum application,the ij and the bia violated her right to due process and fail ed to apply the law.id.at.finally,petitioner alleges that the ij determination that she is ineligible for withholding of removal under either the immigration and nationality act of ina,as amended,or the united nations convention against torture cat is not supported by substantial evidence.
for the reasons that follow,we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction petitioner contention that the ij committed an error of law or otherwise abused his discretion when he declined to excuse her lateness in filing her asylum application.we hold that we are without jurisdiction to review the ij discretionary determination that petitioner failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances,and because there is no disputed issue of statutory construction,we lack jurisdiction to review petitioner claim that the ij fail ed to apply the law and therefore committed error purportedly giving rise to questions of law within the meaning of section a a iii of the real id act of section,pub,stat,codified at a d.
insofar as petitioner contention that the ij fail ed to apply the law may be construed as a claim under the due process clause of the fifth amendment,we hold that we possess jurisdiction to review the claim under section but conclude that the claim lacks merit.finally,we conclude that the ij decision denying petitioner application for withholding of removal is supported by substantial evidence and it is clear that the ij would reach the same decision in the absence of the noted deficiencies.
background 
in her removal hearing before the ij,petitioner alleged past and future persecution based on her opposition to the chinese family planning policy,testifying that she had been forced to undergo an abortion in october and that she would be sterilized were she to return to china.petitioner stated that she had been required to sign a family planning agreement upon her marriage in november,and that,as a factory worker,she had been designated as living in an urban household,a status that limited her to having only one child.five months after the birth of her first child in september,petitioner alleged,the chinese government forced her to undergo the insertion of an intrauterine device iud,after which she was required to attend quarterly examinations to confirm that she was not pregnant and that the iud remained in place.according to petitioner,the iud fell out at some unidentified time,and she became pregnant again in june.petitioner asserts that she then missed her next two iud scheduled for july and october,during this time period,petitioner went into hiding at her mother home in another village,despite continuing to report to work.according to petitioner,the local birth control officials became suspicious of her and,as a result,called her mother home and came to petitioner workplace on october.petitioner testified that she was then taken to a doctor,at which time her pregnancy was discovered,and she was forced to undergo an abortion.rather than return approximately ten days later for sterilization,as she had been instructed,petitioner states that she made arrangements to flee to the united states,where she arrived on or about may.petitioner gave birth in the united states to a second child in april.
in a decision issued at the conclusion of petitioner hearing,the ij rejected petitioner application for asylum on the grounds that she had failed to file her application within one year of her arrival in the united states,as required by a b,and that she had failed to establish either changed circumstances materially affecting her eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances excusing her untimely filing.the ij then concluded that,even if petitioner asylum application was not in fact,she had failed to establish a credible case of past or future persecution entitling her either to asylum or withholding of removal.citing several specific examples,the ij stated that petitioner testimony was inherently improbable,internally inconsistent,inconsistent with her written application as well as some of her supporting documents,and contradicted by the state department profile of country conditions in china.decision of the immigration judge,ij decision,at.accordingly,the ij concluded that petitioner had failed to satisfy her burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility for the relief requested.
on september,the bia summarily affirmed,without opinion,the decision of the ij.this petition for review followed.
discussion 
where,as here,the bia has affirmed the ij decision without an opinion,we review the ij decision directly under a standard of substantial evidence.see yu sheng zhang dep t of justice,cir e setting forth procedures for affirmance without opinion.we consider first whether we have jurisdiction to review the ij discretionary determination,with respect to petitioner asylum claim,that petitioner failed to establish either changed or extraordinary circumstances under a d.we then evaluate petitioner claim that the ij improperly rejected her request for withholding of removal under both the ina and the cat.
title,section a of the united states code provides,in relevant part,that a ny alien who is physically present in the united states or who arrives in the united states may apply for asylum.that statutory provision,however,is limited by a b,which states that a shall not apply to an alien unless the alien demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application for asylum has been filed within year after the date of the alien arrival in the united states.a discretionary exception to a b bar is created by a d,which provides that 
a n application for asylum of an alien may be considered,notwithstanding an alien failure to apply for asylum within one year of the alien arrival or the denial of a prior asylum application,if the alien demonstrates to the satisfaction of the attorney general either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application within the period.
a d emphases added.finally,a provides that n o court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the attorney general under a.
based on the foregoing,our sister circuits have uniformly recognized that we lack jurisdiction to review an asylum application that the bia has deemed untimely or as to which the bia has found neither changed nor extraordinary circumstances excusing the untimeliness.see,njenga ashcroft,cir zaidi ashcroft,cir ins,cir tarrawally ashcroft,cir tsevegmid ashcroft,cir fahim att y,cir hakeem ins,cir ismailov reno,cir.
the statutory landscape,however,has changed somewhat since these courts held that a deprives our court of jurisdiction to review such an asylum application.specifically,on may,the real id act of,pub,stat,real id act took effect.among its other reforms the real id act amends section of the ina to provide that n othing in any provision of this act other than this section which limits or eliminates judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals in accordance with this section.real id act a a iii section codified at a d.because section applies to all appeals from removal orders issued before,on,or after the date of the enactment,may,that provision governs our jurisdiction to review petitioner claims.see real id act b see also ins,cir acknowledging that the real id act governs review of removal orders.
section confers jurisdiction on our court to review constitutional claims or questions of law.the term constitutional claims clearly relates to claims brought pursuant to provisions of the constitution of the united states.
by contrast,questions of law does not have a similarly clear meaning,and the terms of the real id act provide no guidance as to the precise content of that phrase,which is subject to countless interpretations.construed in the broadest sense possible,questions of law would encompass any question related to law or having any legal is,anything pertaining to the work in which courts are engaged,including virtually all decisions in the immigration field.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that questions of law could not have been intended to expand our jurisdiction in such a boundless fashion.
first,vested with its broadest meaning,questions of law would,at a minimum,include all constitutional claims,which by definition raise legal questions.yet the statute refers to two separate categories constitutional claims or questions of law.had congress intended questions of law to be understood as questions pertaining to law generally,it would have been redundant to include constitutional claims in section.because,as a matter of statutory construction,we do not assume congress intended to include pure surplusage in its enactments,we can not read questions of law in the broadest possible light.see duncan walker,d a statute ought,upon the whole,to be so construed that,if it can be prevented,no clause,sentence,or word shall be superfluous,void,or insignificant.internal quotation marks omitted dunn commodity futures trading comm n,d recognizing the doctrine that legislative enactments should not be construed to render their provisions mere surplusage.
second,the broadest meaning of questions of law would bring within our jurisdiction questions raised in certain kinds of claims that the ina expressly removes from our jurisdiction.see,a b i depriving courts of jurisdiction to review any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section h,i,or of this title emphasis added a b ii depriving courts of jurisdiction to review any other decision or action of the attorney general the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general emphases added.all questions arising in the context of such claims could not,therefore,have been included in the meaning of the phrase in section,for this would suggest that congress intended to repeal the provisions of the ina,even if only in part,by implication.because absent a clearly established congressional intention,repeals by implication are not favored,we can not read questions of law so broadly.see branch smith,d plurality opinion internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
third,in light of our obligation to interpret questions of law in the context of the real id act as a whole,see,united sav.ass of timbers of inwood forest,d s tatutory construction is a holistic endeavor,we are mindful of the fact that the title of the subsection containing the phrase questions of law is judicial review of certain legal claims,real id act a iii emphasis added codified at a d,thereby suggesting that only a subset of legal claims is included.although the title of a section does not control the meaning of the text in that section,see ins cyr,d,the title may nevertheless be useful if it shed s light on some ambiguous word or phrase.dep t of corr.yeskey,d internal quotation marks omitted alteration in original.here,the title suggests that questions of law does not mean all questions having a legal dimension because the section covers only certain legal claims.
it is,therefore,evident that questions of law can not be construed in the broadest possible light.nevertheless,the statutory text provides no guidance as to how congress intended to limit the phrase.accordingly,we turn to the legislative history of the real id act in order to ascertain congress intent.see,watt alaska,d the circumstances of the enactment of particular legislation may persuade a court that congress did not intend words of common meaning to have their literal effect.united states,cir noting the need to consult legislative history when statutory language is ambiguous.
as committee reports are the most authoritative sources on the meaning of legislation we look to the house conference committee report on the real id act.that report explains that the original draft of the statute used the phrase pure questions of law,but that the word pure was later deleted because it is superfluous,at.the word pure add ed no meaning because t he purpose of section a a iii is to permit judicial review over those issues that were historically reviewable on and questions,not discretionary or factual questions.id.emphasis added accordingly,for the purposes of the real id act,a question of law is a question regarding the construction of a statute.id.recently,in ramadan gonzales,cir,the ninth circuit concluded that the legislative history makes it abundantly clear this term refers to a narrow category of issues regarding statutory construction.id.at.we agree with the ramadan court analysis and hold that the term questions of law in section refers to a narrow category of issues regarding statutory construction.id.
because the real id act only provides us with jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or matters of statutory construction,we remain deprived of jurisdiction to review discretionary and factual determinations.see,grass gonzales,cir section grants no jurisdiction to review an ij purely discretionary decision to deny a continuance of a removal hearing,unless that ruling resulted in such procedural unfairness as to implicate due process.vasile gonzales,cir notwithstanding a of the real id act,discretionary or factual determinations continue to fall outside the jurisdiction of the court of appeals entertaining a petition for review.gattem gonzales,cir holding that,under section,the courts of appeals have jurisdiction to consider question s of law raised in petitions for review,but not discretionary decisions of the attorney general,such as whether to continue removal proceedings.
we are therefore without jurisdiction to review petitioner claims to the extent that she asserts that the ij abused his discretion when making factual determinations that she had failed to demonstrate either changed or extraordinary circumstances.see ramadan,at t he existence of changed circumstances that materially affect eligibility for asylum is a predominantly factual determination,which will invariably turn on the facts of a given case.att y,cir the timeliness of an asylum application is not a constitutional claim or question of law covered by the real id act changes.vasile,at concluding that factual determinations regarding the bar and the existence of changed or extraordinary circumstances simply do not fit in the question of law category.
an ij finding as to whether a petitioner has established changed or extraordinary circumstances,moreover,entails not only a predominantly factual inquiry,see ramadan,at,but also constitutes a discretionary determination.the plain language of the statute specifically provides that changed or extraordinary circumstances must be established to the satisfaction of the attorney general,a d emphasis added language that clearly entrusts the decision to the attorney general discretion,see kalkouli ashcroft,cir construing phrase in the opinion of the attorney general.see also vasile,at permissive language that refers to demonstrating something to the agency satisfaction is inherently discretionary.a d providing that an untimely asylum application may be considered upon a showing of changed or extraordinary circumstances emphasis added.judicial review of such discretionary decisions,we conclude,falls outside the scope of section of the real id act and thus remains precluded by the jurisdictional bar established at a no court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the attorney general under a.
petitioner further contends that,in rejecting her claim of changed or extraordinary circumstances,the ij violated her rights by fail ing to apply the law.pet r br.at petitioner suggests that the ij either committed legal error or violated her rights to procedural or substantive due process.inasmuch as petitioner alleges that the ij erred in resolving a question of law,we are without jurisdiction to review her claim because she does not argue that the ij engaged in erroneous statutory construction.see ante at.to the extent that she intends to assert a claim pursuant to the due process clause,she has brought a constitutional claim that we may review.see id.nevertheless,that constitutional claim is plainly without merit.petitioner points to nothing in the record suggesting that she was denied a full and fair opportunity to present her claims nor has she established that the ij or bia otherwise deprived her of fundamental fairness.
for the reasons stated,we dismiss the petition insofar as petitioner contends that the ij committed legal error or otherwise abused his discretion in denying her application for asylum as untimely,and we deny the petition to the extent petitioner contends that the ij violated her constitutional rights.
ii.withholding of removal 
in addition to seeking review of the bia refusal to consider her untimely asylum application on the merits,petitioner challenges the ij by the her application for withholding of removal.as the ij recognized,eligibility for withholding of removal is not subject to a b bar and,accordingly,must be considered by the bia regardless of the timeliness of the initial asylum request.compare b a t he attorney general may grant asylum to an alien who has applied for asylum emphasis added,with b a t he attorney general may not remove an alien to a country if the attorney general decides that the alien life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.emphasis added.
to qualify for withholding of removal under the ina,an applicant must establish that there is a clear probability that if she were removed,her life or freedom would be threatened on account of political opinion or the other protected grounds listed in b a.see,ins,cir.similarly,to qualify for withholding of removal under the cat,an applicant must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that she will be tortured if she returns to the proposed country of removal.see wang ashcroft,cir citing c.evidence of past persecution creates a rebuttable presumption that there is a clear probability of a future threat should the applicant be returned,at see also b.
in the instant case,petitioner argues that she is entitled to withholding of removal under both the ina and the cat because her alleged subjection to a forced abortion in china would create a rebuttable presumption that it is more likely than not that she will be sterilized,or otherwise persecuted,if she returns to china.she contends that forcible sterilization is particularly likely since,in contravention of china policy,she has had more children since arriving in the united states.
the bia has recognized that c oerced sterilization should be viewed as a permanent and continuing act of persecution.in re,wl bia see also a treating coercive family planning as persecution on the basis of political opinion.consequently,if petitioner had demonstrated to the ij that there was a clear probability that she would be sterilized if she returned to china,she would be entitled to withholding of removal under the ina.such relief was denied,however,because the ij found that petitioner had not met her burden of proof,given that her testimony was inherently improbable,internally inconsistent,and inconsistent with her written application as well as some of her supporting documents.ij decision at.
because asylum and withholding of removal determinations require intensive factual inquiries that appellate courts are to conduct,the ina tightly circumscribes our review of factual findings,including adverse credibility determinations,by an ij.see b b providing that on appeal the administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary emphases added.under this strict standard of review,we defer to the factual findings of the bia and the ij if they are supported by substantial evidence,see zhou yun zhang ins,cir,and where,as here,the ij bases his denial of asylum and withholding of removal on a finding that a petitioner application is not credible,our review is highly deferential.see zhou yi ni dep t of justice,cir xu duan dong ashcroft,cir jin hui gao att y,cir see also guan gonzales,cir reviewing a factfinder determination of credibility is to attempts to fashion rigid rules of law.zhou yun zhang,at when a factual challenge pertains to a credibility finding made by an ij we afford particular deference in applying the substantial evidence standard.quoting montero ins,cir.accordingly,w here the ij adverse credibility finding is based on specific examples in the record of inconsistent statements by the asylum applicant about matters material to his claim of persecution,or on contradictory evidence or inherently improbable testimony regarding such matters,a reviewing court will generally not be able to conclude that a reasonable adjudicator was compelled to find otherwise.zhou yun zhang,at internal quotation marks omitted.
consistent with our exceedingly narrow scope of review,melgar de torres reno,cir quoting ins,cir,we will look to see if the ij has provided specific,cogent reasons for the adverse credibility finding and whether those reasons bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.zhou yun zhang,at quoting,at.that review is designed to ensure merely that credibility findings are based upon neither a misstatement of the facts in the record nor bald speculation or caprice.id.thus,in reviewing an ij findings for substantial evidence,our limited role as an appellate court does not permit us to engage in an independent evaluation of the cold record or ask ourselves whether,if we were sitting as in the first instance,we would credit or discredit an applicant testimony.see zhou yun zhang,at t he reviewing court may not itself hypothesize excuses for inconsistencies in a petitioner testimony,nor may it justify the contradictions or explain away the improbabilities.its limited power of review will not permit it to reverse the bia simply because it disagree s with its evaluation of the facts.last two alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted.
of course,that an ij has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application can not insulate the decision from review.ramsameachire ashcroft,cir.if the testimony provided is otherwise generally consistent,rational,and believable,the presence of some inconsistent testimony need not necessarily be fatal to a petitioner claims if the disparities are relatively minor and isolated and do not concern material facts.see diallo ins,cir citation omitted.likewise,an ij credibility determination will not satisfy the substantial evidence standard when it is based entirely on flawed reasoning,bald speculation,or conjecture.see,at.moreover,where an ij decision omit s potentially significant facts so fundamental to the claim that we are unable adequately to consider whether substantial evidence support ed the bia determination,we may remand for further consideration.see chen ins,cir nevertheless,we may affirm an adverse credibility finding even when the ij reasoning is deficient in certain respects,provided that despite any in the context of the ij entire can state with confidence that the ij would adhere to his decision if we were to remand.see cao he lin dep t of justice,cir.
although we customarily afford particular deference to the credibility determinations of the ij,wu biao chen ins,cir quoting montero ins,cir,in this case we are troubled by the fact that the ij opinion occasionally lapses into the sort of bald speculation we warned against in zhou yun zhang,at.for example,the ij stated that it made absolutely no sense that petitioner decided to risk her pregnancy to go back to work shortly after discovering that she was pregnant for the second time,ij decision at commented that he could not understand petitioner testimony regarding officials wanting to sterilize her after forcing her to undergo an abortion,id.at and expressed skepticism about petitioner veracity because nothing happened to petitioner husband other than brief detention and almost losing his job,id.at.
there is nothing extraordinary in petitioner claim that she continued working in the early months of her second pregnancy nor would it require a great leap of faith to credit petitioner contention that officials might attempt to sterilize her after forcing her to undergo an abortion.finally,we do not believe that detention combined with threatened deprivation of economic livelihood is nothing.we do not,consequently,rely on the ij findings to the extent that he erroneously mischaracterized petitioner testimony or determined that petitioner was not credible due to perceived implausibilities or inconsistencies that were based solely on the ij bald speculation.see zhou yun zhang,at o ur review is meant to ensure that credibility findings are based upon neither a misstatement of the facts in the record nor bald speculation or caprice.
notwithstanding the foregoing,it is not enough for petitioner to point to some deficiencies in the ij factual analysis because,here,the ij denial of petitioner claim for withholding of removal was supported by substantial evidence and we are confident that the ij would reach the same decision in the absence of the noted deficiencies.the ij found petitioner testimony inconsistent with her medical records her written asylum application other documents she submitted in support of her application and the state department profile for her region these findings of fact by the ij qualify as specific,cogent reasons that bear a legitimate nexus to the ij adverse credibility finding,at internal quotation marks omitted,and substantially support the ij ultimate determination that petitioner failed to provide a credible account of persecution and thus failed to satisfy her burden of proof.see zhou yun zhang,at.
we note that recently,in cao he lin dep t of justice,cir,another panel of our court identified three circumstances in which a petition challenging a rejection of an asylum claim could be denied despite errors committed by the ij.these are where the ij explicitly relies on a valid alternative ground for denying relief that is not tainted by error,where the error is so tangential to the ultimate ruling that there is no realistic possibility of a different result on remand,or where the untainted evidence in support the ij conclusion is so overwhelming that there is no realistic possibility of a different result on remand.see id.at.these circumstances present variations of the general principle of error does not require a remand if the remand would be pointless because it is clear that the agency would adhere to its prior decision in the absence of error.see,nlrb,d emphasizing that sec chenery,does not require that we convert judicial review of agency action into a game and that remand is not required where it would be an idle and useless formality nlrb am,cir r eversal and remand are not required each and every time an administrative agency assigns a wrong reason for its action rather,remand is required only where there is a significant chance that but for the error,the agency might have reached a different result.
in cao he lin,the panel rejected every ground for the ij adverse credibility finding,as well as the ij determination that the petitioner had failed to satisfy his burden of proof.see cao he lin,at concluding that the ij principal reasons for generally discounting petitioner credibility are seriously flawed and that i n reviewing certain subsidiary findings regarding both credibility and sufficiency of the evidence,we find that each one is flawed.accordingly,the court remanded because it could not state with confidence that the ij would make the same decision in the absence of such systemic error.see id.at.the panel thus held that a remand was appropriate under such circumstances by also identifying potential circumstances where a remand would not have been required,the panel was of course offering dicta.see carroll lessee of carroll,how.curtis,i f a point of law might have been decided either way without affecting any right brought into question,then,according to the principles of the common law,an opinion on such a question is not a decision.see also united states garcia,cir calabresi,concurring dicta is not and can not be binding.is necessary to a binding.matter how strong or how not.accordingly,cao he lin did not provide a binding,comprehensive test for determining all the circumstances where ij errors need not require a remand.
it suffices for us to hold in this case that substantial evidence in the record relied on by the ij,considered in the aggregate,supports the ij finding that petitioner lacked credibility,and disregarding those aspects of the ij reasoning that are tainted by error,we can state with confidence that the ij would adhere to his decision were the petition remanded.indeed,we do not believe that the erroneous aspects of the ij decision in this case were entirely tangential to his decision nor are we persuaded that overwhelming evidence supports the ij adverse credibility finding.cao he lin,at.in suggesting by way of dicta that remand of an finding could be avoided if overwhelming evidence supported the ij ultimate finding,or if the ij error is sufficiently tangential,the panel in cao he lin was simply illustrating two circumstances under which a remand would be futile.see id.at observing that t he futility of a remand would support affirming despite legal error in at least those two circumstances emphasis added.the overarching test for deeming a remand futile,as cao he lin recognized,is when the reviewing court can confidently predict that the ij would reach the same decision absent the errors that were made.see id.at.the strength of the portions of an ij ultimate finding that will permit a panel to state with confidence that a remand would be futile can not be precisely quantified.whether the evidence supporting the findings is characterized as overwhelming,significant,highly persuasive,or some other comparable wording is more a matter of linguistics than law.if the reviewing court undertakes to determine whether remand would be futile,it should assess the entire record and determine whether,based on the strength of the evidence supporting the findings and the significance of those findings,it is clear that the ij would adhere to his decision were the petition remanded.accordingly,although we certainly retain our ability to remand where appropriate,see,we also retain our ability to affirm an ij factual an adverse credibility error,where that analysis is otherwise supported by substantial evidence and we can state with confidence that the same decision would be made on remand see jin chen dep t of justice,cir affirming adverse credibility finding as supported by substantial evidence even though one of the ij grounds d id seem to defy logic zhou yun zhang,at concluding that any error in requiring corroboration did not merit relief because the ij adverse credibility findings,by themselves,constitute d substantial evidence to support the denial of petitioner asylum application ramsameachire,at affirming adverse credibility finding despite disagreeing with one of the bases for that finding because the other inconsistencies on which the bia relied we re sufficient to support its judgment see also tarrawally ashcroft,cir affirming adverse credibility finding as supported by substantial evidence even though s ome of the ij reasons for his adverse credibility determination were based on presumptions not grounded in the record hakeem ins,cir finding part of ij reasoning un persuasive but denying petition for review where t he ij offered alternative reasons that we re supported by substantial evidence ins,cir affirming adverse credibility determination e ven though one of four reasons cited by the bia wa s not supported by the record because the bia determination of incredibil ity found substantial support in the record jin shui qiu ashcroft,cir stating that we will vacate bia conclusions insofar as the bia has not supported its findings with record evidence.
applying this standard of substantial evidence to the facts of this case,we deny the petition for review of the ij denial of withholding of removal because,although the underlying analysis of the ij contains errors,the ij ultimate,that petitioner failed to provide a credible account of persecution and thus failed to satisfy her burden of supported by substantial evidence and it is clear that the same decision would be made on remand.
petitioner claims that the ij erred in other respects by failing to articulate specific reasons for denying her cat claim beyond his adverse credibility finding,by making insufficient findings with respect to the corroborating documents she submitted in support of her application while improperly faulting her for not producing others,and by relying on the state department similarly without merit.
first,as we explained in ramsameachire ashcroft,cir,because a cat claim lacks a subjective element,focuses broadly on torture without regard for the reasons for that treatment,and requires a showing with respect to future,rather than past,treatment,id.at citing c,it must always be considered independently of the resolution of the alien claims under the ina.id.the fact that a cat claim does not turn on the applicant subjective state of mind and that it must be considered separately from the applicant ina claim,however,does not shift the burden of proof.under the applicable regulations,it is still the applicant seeking cat relief who is required to establish that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.see c.accordingly,where,as here,the applicant relies largely on testimonial evidence to establish her cat claim,and does not independently establish a probability of torture apart from her stated fear,an adverse credibility finding regarding that testimonial evidence may provide a sufficient basis for denial of cat relief 
second,in rejecting an applicant claim,the ij should consider all the evidence in the record that has probative value.cao he lin,at.but he need not enumerate and evaluate on the record each piece of evidence,item by item,or specifically find,when faulting an applicant for not producing sufficient evidence,that additional documentation was reasonably available to her.see yan lan wu ashcroft,cir t he immigration judge need not discuss each and every piece of evidence presented by an asylum applicant when rendering a decision,as long as that decision is substantially supported.morales ins,cir where,as here,the bia has given reasoned consideration to the petition,and made adequate findings,we will not require that it address specifically each claim the petitioner made or each piece of evidence the petitioner presented.internal quotation marks omitted united states crosby,cir noting that a statutory duty to consider matters relevant to sentencing does not require robotic incantations by district judges.petitioner contends that the ij not only failed to consider corroborative documents she submitted,but also failed to explain why she should have provided other documents in support of her claim.in jin shui qiu ashcroft,cir,we recognized that in certain circumstances,an ij may not deny relief for failure to produce corroborative evidence,unless the ij has a identifi ed the particular pieces of missing,relevant documentation,and b show ed that the documentation at issue was reasonably available to the petitioner.id.at.however,as we stated in zhou yun zhang,the requirement for corroborative documents identification and availability articulated in jin shui qiu as derived from diallo ins pertains when the ij or bia cites inadequate corroboration as a basis for denying relief to an applicant who is otherwise credible.zhou yun zhang,at see jin shui qiu,at stating that the bia expressly found no reason to deem petitioner incredible diallo,at noting that the bia made no pronouncement on the credibility of petitioner underlying testimony or of his explanations for the lack of additional corroborating evidence.that is not the case here,as the ij did not base his rejection of petitioner claim on an absence of corroborative evidence,but rather,on his finding that petitioner largely uncorroborated,testimony was insufficient to establish withholding of removal.
third,the ij reliance on the state department country report for the fujian province of china was not in error.as we recognized in zamora ins,cir friendly,a report from the state department is usually the best available source of information on country conditions.id.at the obvious source of information on general conditions in the foreign country is the department of state which has diplomatic and consular representatives throughout the world.see also melgar de torres,at,relying on state department profile as substantial evidence of the changed country conditions in el salvador.although we have cautioned that the immigration court should be careful not to place excessive reliance on published reports of the department of state,chen,at emphasis added,the weight to afford to such evidence lie s largely within the discretion of the ij.see asociacion de compositores y editores de musica latinoamericana copyright royalty tribunal,cir w e must review a challenge to the tribunal evidentiary rulings with some deference,for the type of proof that will be acceptable and the weight it should receive lie largely in the discretion of the tribunal.internal quotation marks omitted.the ij here did not treat the country report as if it were binding,nor did he place excessive reliance on that report,chen,at,particularly in light of the ij determination that petitioner testimony was otherwise lacking in credibility.cao he lin,at remanding to bia because reliance on report produced by state department was error,inasmuch as the ij failed to consider any contrary or countervailing evidence provided by the applicant,and every other ground for the ij adverse credibility finding was erroneous internal quotation marks omitted chen,at,instructing immigration court to consider on remand any contrary or countervailing evidence as well as the particular circumstances of the applicant case,in addition to the state department country report,where the ij and bia had erroneously ignor ed a significant aspect of petitioner testimony.accordingly,the ij properly considered the inconsistency between petitioner statements and the country report as part of his overall determination that petitioner account was not credible.
because we find that there is substantial evidence supporting the ij adverse credibility determination,and petitioner has not shown it is more likely than not that she would be persecuted or tortured were she returned to china,we uphold the ij determination,affirmed by the bia,that petitioner has failed to make the requisite showings to qualify for withholding of removal under either the ina or the cat.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction to the extent that petitioner contends that the ij committed an error of law or otherwise abused his discretion when he declined to excuse her lateness in filing her asylum application.specifically,we hold that we are without jurisdiction to review the ij discretionary determination that petitioner failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances and petitioner claim that the ij fail ed to apply the law,and therefore committed error purportedly giving rise to questions of law within the meaning of section of the real id act,because there is no disputed issue of statutory construction.
we deny the remainder of the petition for lack of merit.insofar as petitioner contends that the ij violated her rights pursuant to the due process clause,we hold that we possess jurisdiction to review under section,but conclude that the record does not support her claim.finally,we conclude that the ij decision denying petitioner application for withholding of removal is supported by substantial evidence and it is clear that the same decision would be made were we to remand.
