guo huang applied for asylum alleging that chinese family planning cadres forced his wife to have an involuntary abortion.an immigration judge denied the application,finding that huang was not credible and had not demonstrated either past persecution or a reasonable fear of future persecution.because the ij adverse credibility finding was based on substantial evidence,including huang submission of a certificate purportedly documenting his wife forcible abortion,we deny the petition for review.
at his asylum hearing before an immigration judge,guo huang testified that he,his wife,and their son are from lianjiang county in fujian province.after his son birth,his wife had an iud implanted according to mandatory birth control practices.but in the huangs paid a private doctor to remove the iud,and in march she learned that she was pregnant.the pregnancy was in its very early stages at that point,and the huangs moved to a nearby town,purportedly to prevent family planning authorities from discovering her condition.she subsequently missed her mandatory physical examination,given every three months.
huang alleged that his wife failure to appear for the physical alerted the family planning authorities that she might be pregnant,and that on may,the family planning cadres found her.huang testified that when he came home and found his wife missing,someone told him that she had been seized by family planning cadres as she was taking out the trash.he asserted that he went to the local clinic to find her,but by the time he arrived she had already had an abortion.huang specifically testified that the abortion was involuntary.he also offered a certificate,signed by a physician and bearing an official seal from the lianjiang county hospital,which states that jin fang huang underwent an artificial abortion on may.the certificate does not specify whether the procedure was voluntary or involuntary.huang testified that she was given the certificate after he asked the hospital for proof in case later on my wife suffer any complication afterwards they can help.finally,he testified that if he were returned to china he feared imprisonment because of his wife pregnancy.also,he was concerned about his illegal exit,a reference to his once having a valid passport that he relinquished to the snakeheads who helped smuggle him to the united states 
after huang testified,the ij read aloud portions of a background report prepared in march by the canadian embassy in beijing describing conditions in lianjiang county.the ij noted that according to the report,forced abortion and forced sterilization were no longer accepted methods for enforcing birth control,even though local government officials acknowledged problems with this in the past.the ij also referred to the state department profile of asylum claims and country conditions,which states that the embassy was unaware of any abortion certificates,which are often presented as part of asylum applications as evidence of a forced abortion.that report says that the only document that might resemble such a certificate and result in confusion is a document issued by hospitals upon a patient request after a voluntary abortion.
the ij then issued his decision,ruling that huang failed to establish his claim for asylum because he was not credible.specifically,the ij stated that he did not believe huang story and believes that huang wife either never went for an abortion,or perhaps agreed to have a voluntary abortion on may.the ij based this finding on several perceived inconsistencies in huang story.first,the ij noted that huang failed to explain how the authorities located the family after their move to guantou town less than two months earlier,or why they would be searching for her so early in the pregnancy.the ij also doubted huang testimony that his wife missed physical examination accounted for her being seized by family planning cadres and forced to undergo an abortion.moreover,the ij noted that huang testified that his family was not threatened with fines or pressured in any other way before the alleged abortion.the ij also emphasized that forcible abortions were not being performed at the time in fujian province and that certificates are given not to women who have involuntary abortions,but rather to women who undergo voluntary abortions and want proof of the procedure to qualify for medical leave from work.having found him incredible,the ij ruled that huang had not shown that he or his wife had suffered past persecution or that he had a fear of future persecution if returned to china.the board of immigration appeals adopted and affirmed the ij ruling.
credibility determinations must be supported by cogent and specific reasons and bear a legitimate nexus to the finding.gjerazi gonzales,cir mansour,cir.this court affords substantial deference to an ij stated reasons,and will overturn a credibility finding only in extraordinary circumstances.giday gonzales,cir.no such deference is due,however,to credibility findings that are drawn from insufficient or incomplete evidence.georgis ashcroft,cir.the credibility analysis in this case is not affected by the real id act of,stat,because huang filed his asylum petition before the passage of that statute.see diallo gonzales,cir.
huang correctly argues that some of the ij bases for his credibility finding were not founded in cogent and specific reasoning.for instance,the ij merely speculated,without support in the record,that family planning cadres could not or would not take action so quickly after discovering that huang wife was pregnant.nor does the record support the ij conclusion that huang testimony was simply too weak to establish a credible or plausible claim because he failed to testify that he had been threatened with fines or lesser sanctions.the ij had no basis in the record to find that the family planning authorities would resort to lesser sanctions in a case where the family had already fled.if the ij had based his credibility determination on this reasoning alone,the credibility finding would be unsupportable we can not uphold credibility assessments unmoored from the record,based on nothing but the ij personal speculation or conjecture.tabaku gonzales,cir see also lin ashcroft,cir.
but the ij did base his finding on one ground that is sufficient to support the determination.the ij specifically alluded to the state department asylum profile to suggest that the chinese government does not issue certificates of involuntary abortions,and found that huang testimony and his characterization of the abortion certificate were inconsistent with the report.the ij relied on the state department profile of asylum claims and country conditions report,which disclaimed any knowledge of involuntary abortion certificates 
the embassy and consulate general are unaware of any abortion certificates,which often are presented as part of asylum applications as evidence of a forced abortion.according to embassy officials,the only document that might resemble such a certificate and result in confusion is a document issued by hospitals upon a patient request after a voluntary abortion.this certificate is used by patients as evidence to request weeks of sick leave after an abortion has been performed,a right provided by the law.
the ij held that when viewed in light of the profile,huang explanation as to the issuance of an abortion certificate in may of suggests that his wife agreed to have the abortion,it was not forced.
we have not yet directly addressed whether an official certificate offered as proof of a forced abortion constitutes evidence of such persecution despite a contrary state department profile,but we have twice relied on the profile to hold that ijs may not demand such certificates as corroboration of claims of a forcible abortion.see zhang gonzales,cir lin ashcroft,at.in both cases,we cited the same passage from the state department profile relied upon in this case and held that the petitioners failure to present documentary evidence of an involuntary abortion was excusable because any such documentation would imply that the procedure was voluntary as opposed to forced.lin ashcroft
