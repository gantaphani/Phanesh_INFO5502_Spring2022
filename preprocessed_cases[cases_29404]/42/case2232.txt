despite the denial of her applications,liang was not removed from the united states nor did she leave the country voluntarily.on august,almost years after entry of the final order of removal,liang filed a motion to reopen the proceedings and again apply for asylum,withholding of removal and cat protection,this time on the ground that she feared persecution in the form of forced abortion and sterilization under china rule.the board denied liang motion to reopen on october,and she petitioned this court for review.finding no abuse of discretion by the board,we deny liang petition.
background 
as noted above,liang initially sought asylum and related relief shortly after her arrival in the united states on july,on the ground that she was subjected to mistreatment because of her membership in the democratic party.liang was nineteen years old at the time.at the hearing on her application,the questioned liang about her claimed fear of political persecution and found her not credible.liang testified that she had joined the democratic party in,was accepted as a member and was sworn in at the end of.she did not know the platform of the party,however,and did not have a membership card or any other proof of membership.the noted there was no indication the party referred to by liang exists.the stated that he had reviewed the reports issued by various organizations,particularly the state department and the united kingdom,and asked liang whether she recognized any of the political organizations listed in those reports which were known to suffer persecution.liang did not recognize any of them.thinking that she may have meant the china democracy party,the asked liang if she recognized the names of any of its leaders,but she again said she did not.transcript of oral decision of the at.
the also found that liang account of how she had arrived in the united states was not credible.liang testified that on december,she was caught by the authorities distributing pamphlets for the propaganda section of the party,beaten all over her body and woke up at home.she testified she remained in hiding from the end of until july of,when she was smuggled to the united states.however,she was extremely vague about how she traveled to the united states.she did not know if her parents paid a smuggler or what her itinerary was.as recounted by the,liang testified she traveled through yunan province from her home in the city of fuzhou located in fujian province,then entered laos and used a boat to arrive in thailand.she testified that she arrived at chicago international airport on a flight from south korea.she maintained that she boarded the flight in south korea after she received a passport from singapore,which she then lost or ripped up on the flight before she arrived in the united states.id.at.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the orally denied liang applications.he concluded it was almost certain that liang did not belong to the china democracy party since she was unaware of its activities,its leaders and what had happened to them,or when it was founded.her testimony was inconsistent with the statement she initially gave at the airport upon her arrival in the united states,and her account of how and why she left her home in fujian province was vague and implausible.noting that the existence of a smuggling ring in fujian province was a fact and the average fee for smuggling someone into the united states from china,according to official reports,was between and,the concluded 
i think it is most unlikely,in fact,probably impossible for the respondent to have made the trip she described on her own.i think the respondent,when questioned by the court,has given misleading information when she was asked direct questions about how she came here and why she came here.i am convinced that the respondent presence in the united states had nothing to do with any political activities of any kind and it does have to do with her family and her desire to find work in the united states.
id.at.the board affirmed without opinion on march,making the decision the final agency decision.liang did not seek further review.
on august,liang filed a motion to reopen the proceedings,alleging that she now feared persecution under china policy.see a b a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization or subject to persecution for such failure,refusal or resistance shall be deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.liang alleged that since her last hearing she had married guihua lin,also a citizen of china,and given birth to a daughter.at the time she filed her motion to reopen,liang was also pregnant with her second child whose due date was on or about november.liang later gave birth to a second daughter in late october.liang also alleged that since her hearing on her initial application for asylum,conditions in china had changed.she claimed that she had obtained evidence that there had been an increase in enforcement of china family planning policy through forced abortions and forced sterilization procedures.having violated china family planning policy by becoming pregnant with a second child,liang claimed that china increased enforcement of the policy gave rise to a fear of persecution if she returned.
in her affidavit in support of her motion,liang recounted the dates of her marriage,the birth of her first child,and the expected birth date of her second child.liang also noted that both she and her husband desired to have additional children.liang stated that in telephone conversations with her family in china,she had learned that over the past year the chinese government had increased the intensity of its enforcement of the family planning law in her home city of fuzhou in fujian province.family members had told her of several incidents in which women who had given birth to a second child were forcibly sterilized.she had also been told of one woman who was forced to abort her second child and was later sterilized because she became pregnant during a required waiting period liang stated her had gone to the local family planning office and inquired about their current practice.he was told that couples with one child were targeted for iud insertions couples with two children were targeted for sterilization and subjected to monetary penalties.liang stated that her pregnancy with a second child so soon after the birth of her first child and without a birth permit was a serious violation of china family planning law,even though her children were born overseas.once she and her husband arrive home,they will be required to register their children in order for them to receive schooling or medical care.her children will then be considered chinese citizens,and she will be forced to undergo sterilization.it was to avoid persecution in the form of such forced sterilization that liang claimed she was seeking the protection of the united states.
along with her affidavit,liang submitted numerous other documents,some of which were specific to her case,such as letters from her father and describing the events she recounted in her affidavit.liang also included an april notice from the qianyang village committee of fuzhou city mawei district tingjiang town.the notice,which appears to have been sent in response to her husband inquiry about the family planning policy,states that her pregnancy is in violation of china nationality law and directs liang and her husband to report to the family planning office within one week after her return to china for an abortion or,if she has already given birth,sterilization.the notice also indicates she is to pay a social compensation fee between and of annual income as a fine.most of the documents submitted in support of liang motion,however,were copies of materials of a more general nature that fall roughly into four categories internal documents purportedly issued by chinese provincial or local government family planning agencies relating to the implementation of the policy excerpts from united states governmental reports such as the annual country reports issued by the department of state,or from proceedings before congress regarding conditions in china excerpts from reports of international organizations concerning china family planning policy and various articles from the and international press reporting incidents of forced abortions and sterilizations in various provinces throughout the country.
upon its review of the motion and supporting materials,the board concluded that liang had failed to meet her burden of showing that if the proceedings were reopened the new evidence would likely change the result.according to the board,liang failed to show that the family planning policy at the time of her initial hearing differed significantly from the current policy.the board noted that the state department country reports on human rights practices indicated that the chinese government has continued its family planning policy,relying upon education,propaganda,and economic incentives,as well as on more coercive measures,including psychological pressure and economic penalties that enforcement of the family planning law varied significantly that central government policy formally prohibited forced abortion or sterilization,though there were reports that local officials had used forced abortion and sterilization to meet family planning targets in violation of national policy.board decision at.some of the materials liang submitted,the board noted,predated her hearing and did not support her claim of a material change in conditions within the country since that hearing.other material had been previously considered by the board and found not sufficient to show a material change in the family planning policy.much of the documentation the board found did not pertain to the area of liang home and thus was of little relevance,given the country reports statement that enforcement of the policy varies from place to place.
addressing the accounts of forced sterilization described in liang affidavit and the letter from her father,the board observed that such anecdotal evidence does not suffice to show that the family planning policy has materially changed since the hearing below,since accounts of isolated tragic events in documented reports,without more,do not necessarily indicate that any one person is at potential risk of that harm.id.additionally,the board noted that liang had not shown that her situation as the mother of a united states citizen child who is expecting a second child is similar to the situations of the women who were sterilized after bearing children in china.the board stated it gave little weight to unsworn relatives statements that describe the experiences of others and were apparently prepared for the purpose of litigation.
turning to the notice to liang and her husband from the village committee,the board concluded it was entitled to virtually no weight,particularly in view of the prior adverse credibility finding.id.at.the notice was unsigned and had not been authenticated pursuant to,and the board noted that the may department of state profile of asylum claims and country conditions,of which it took administrative notice,described widespread fabrication and fraud in documents from fujian province.the board further noted that according to liang own evidence,village committees did not have authority to make family planning decisions,and it questioned why her husband would choose to bring the couple situation to the attention of village officials if they truly feared mistreatment.finally,as to the various newspaper articles liang submitted,the board noted that it gave less weight to anecdotal media accounts than to the more recent department of state profile and country reports.id.
the board also concluded that liang had failed to make a prima facie showing that she would be subjected to economic or other harm amounting to persecution.to the extent she sought reopening for cat protection,the board noted that her motion was untimely and she had failed to make a prima facie showing of a probability of torture by or with the acquiescence of a government official.finally,the board concluded that liang had not shown an exceptional situation that would warrant the exercise of the board limited discretion to reopen sua sponte.it thereupon denied liang request to reopen.
ii.discussion 
generally,a motion to reopen removal proceedings must be filed within days of the date of the final administrative order.c c i.here,there is no dispute that liang motion was filed beyond the deadline.her motion was filed on august,more than five years after the motion was due.it was therefore untimely.
there is no time limit,however,if the basis of the motion is to apply for asylum based on changed country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered id.c c ii.in assessing such a motion,it is important to note the distinction between changes in country conditions and changes in personal conditions.while a change in country conditions can warrant reopening removal proceedings after the time limit has expired,a change in the applicant personal conditions will not.this is because an alien can change his or her personal conditions over time.it makes no sense to allow an alien who manages to elude capture by the immigration authorities for years after he has been ordered to leave the country,and has exhausted all his legal remedies against removal,to use this interval of unauthorized presence in the united states to manufacture a case for asylum.chen gonzales,cir citing wang bia,cir.
from the foregoing,it follows that the facts that liang had gotten married,given birth to one child,and was pregnant with another since her previous hearing do not constitute grounds to reopen the proceedings.these events represent changes in her personal conditions.see zhao gonzales,cir t he birth of zhao children is merely a change in personal circumstances in this country.in order to reopen her removal proceedings,liang was required to show that a material change had occurred in the conditions within china.in an effort to meet this burden,liang alleged that china policy was being enforced more stringently in her home province than when she first applied for asylum.the board concluded that the materials she submitted failed to show that either china family planning policy or the enforcement of it had materially changed and that,in any event,liang had failed to make a prima facie showing of eligibility for relief.it is this decision we are called upon to review.
motions to reopen are comparable to motions for rehearing or for a new trial,and thus are strongly disfavored.fessehaye gonzales,cir citing doherty.indeed,this is especially true in immigration proceedings where,as a general matter,every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the united states.doherty,at.because the board has broad discretion in this area,its decisions are reviewed under the deferential,standard of review.kucana holder,juarez holder,cir.under this highly deferential standard,we will uphold the board decisions to deny liang motion to reopen unless it was made without a rational explanation,inexplicably departed from established policies,or rested on an impermissible basis such as invidious discrimination against a particular race or group.mansour,cir pelinkovic ashcroft,cir.
a major obstacle to liang motion to reopen her removal proceedings based on changed country conditions was the fact that china policy did not represent a change in the country conditions.the policy is not new in fact,it is more than thirty years old.see stanford lin,china,family planning policy as grounds for granting asylum,harv.int l.it was in response to
