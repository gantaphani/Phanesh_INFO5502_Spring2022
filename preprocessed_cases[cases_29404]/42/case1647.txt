luis puentes fernandez,a native and citizen of chile,petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia ordering his removal from the united states.the bia ordered fernandez removal based on his conviction in virginia state court for distribution of oxycodone and percocet.fernandez seeks to avoid removal by arguing that under our decision in united states morin,cir,he has demonstrated that he owes permanent allegiance to the united states and thus qualifies as a national under a b of the immigration and nationality act ina,a b west.that provision defines national of the united states as a person who,though not a citizen of the united states,owes permanent allegiance to the united states.id.the bia rejected fernandez argument,concluding that a b itself does not provide a means for acquiring national status.
although we agree with fernandez that he would qualify as a national under morin,our decision in morin did not purport to set forth the only possible interpretation of the definition of national of the united states.under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,we must afford deference to the bia contrary,interpretation of the ina if it is a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.we hold that it is.accordingly,because fernandez does not qualify as a national of the united states under the bia interpretation of the ina,and because we conclude that the bia interpretation is not arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute,id.at,we deny fernandez petition for review.
fernandez was born in chile and was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident on august,at the age of one.he has been in the united states continuously since that time.at the age of eighteen,fernandez registered for the selective service.
in,fernandez applied for citizenship,and on june,he attended his naturalization interview.according to fernandez,he signed the affidavit of allegiance to the united states that is part of the citizenship application,and an application inspector told him that he would receive a notice in the mail advising him of the date of his oath ceremony.
after failing to receive a notice for some time,fernandez began inquiring about the date of his oath ceremony.fernandez never received the notice,and it is undisputed that he did not complete the naturalization process and is not a citizen.
on july,fernandez pleaded guilty in virginia state court to distribution of oxycodone and percocet.the court sentenced him to twenty years imprisonment,with seventeen years suspended.
on february,the department of homeland security dhs served fernandez with a notice to appear before the immigration court,charging him with removability under a a iii west for having been convicted of an aggravated felony an offense related to the illicit trafficking of a controlled substance and under a b i west for having been convicted of a controlled substance offense after admission to the united states.in response,fernandez argued for termination of the removal proceedings against him on the ground that he is an unremovable national of the united states.at.
on march,an immigration judge ij conducted fernandez removal hearing.the hearing focused on whether fernandez is a removable alien or an unremovable national.on april,the ij terminated the removal proceedings against fernandez,concluding that under our decision in morin,fernandez is a national of the united states because his permanent allegiance to the united states was established by virtue of his application for naturalization.although the ij stated that he agreed with the better analysis in the ninth circuit decision in ashcroft,cir,and the majority opinion in our decision in daly gonzales.cir unpublished,both of which held that a does not itself provide a means of acquiring national status,he believed that morin compelled the conclusion that fernandez is an unremovable national.the ij concluded his decision by citing approvingly to the dissenting opinion in daly,which disagreed with the majority distinguishment of morin based on its criminal context.see daly.at duncan,dissenting i do not agree that the existence of different contexts gives us license to interpret the exact language in a differently in different cases.
the dhs appealed,and on october,the bia reversed the ij decision and ordered fernandez removed from the united states.citing to its recent decision in matter of,bia,the bia rejected fernandez argument that an alien may become a national through means other than birth and full naturalization.also,like the daly majority,the bia distinguished morin on the basis of its criminal context and thus treated as dicta morin interpretation of a.
board member filppu filed a concurring opinion in which he expressed skepticism about the board majority conclusion that morin interpretation of the ina definition of national of the united states is dicta.specifically,he stated that it is unlikely that the criminal law context of morin permits us to construe the same statutory text differently in the case before us.at.nevertheless,board member filppu concurred in the result,for the following reason 
the department of homeland security is not permitted to seek circuit court review of our decisions and could not obtain fourth circuit review of this nationality issue were we to follow morin today.in these highly unusual circumstances,and especially given the unpublished decision in daly gonzales,i believe reversal of the immigration judge is warranted in order to seek clarification from the fourth circuit as to whether we are to follow morin,despite our own reading of the statute,which is consistent with substantial circuit law subsequent to morin.

fernandez timely petitioned for review.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a west providing for appellate review of final orders of removal.
because this section of the opinion covers substantial ground,we will briefly lay out its course.in part a,we discuss our decision in morin.in part,we conclude that we must afford chevron deference to the bia interpretation of a and the ina other nationality provisions.in part,we discuss the interplay between morin interpretation of the ina and the deference that we owe under chevron to the bia contrary,interpretation.we ultimately conclude that chevron dictates that we follow the bia interpretation if it is not arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the ina.and in part c,we apply chevron and conclude that the bia interpretation,though contrary to morin,is a permissible one and thus is entitled to deference.
only aliens are subject to removal under the ina.see a west listing c lasses of deportable aliens.the ina defines alien as any person not a citizen or national of the united states.a west.all citizens of the united states are nationals,but some nationals are not citizens.the ina defines national of the united states as a a citizen of the united states,or b a person who,though not a citizen of the united states,owes permanent allegiance to the united states.a.in turn,the word permanent is defined to mean a relationship of continuing or lasting nature,as distinguished from temporary.a west.congress did not,however,expressly describe the circumstances under which a person demonstrates a relationship of continuing or lasting nature with the united states.in other words,congress has not specified whether a b describes,rather than confers,nationality.
fernandez argues that he qualifies as a national of the united states under a b because he is a noncitizen who owes permanent allegiance to the united states.according to fernandez,he has demonstrated his permanent allegiance by filing a citizenship application,which required that he swear allegiance to the united states completing all steps to naturalization except for attending the oath ceremony a deficiency he attributes to the government inaction,not his own negligence registering for the draft and living in the united states for over forty years.petitioner br.at.fernandez believes that,given these facts,our decision in morin compels the conclusion that he is a national.
morin was a criminal case in which the defendant morin argued that he had not violated a,the federal statute,which requires interstate or foreign travel or use of the mails with an intent that a murder be committed in violation of the laws of any state or the united states.a west supp.one such law of the united states is a,which criminalizes the murder of a national of the united states.a west.morin argued that he did not violate a because his intended victim was a mexican citizen and not a national of the united states.morin,at.our attention properly turned to the ina definition of national of the united states because,which defines the terms in a,the ina definition of national of the united states.see west supp t he term national of the united states has the meaning given such term in section a of the immigration and nationality act.
we rejected the defendant argument and held that his intended victim was a national under a.we reasoned as follows 
citizenship is not the sine qua non of nationality.a national of the united states may also be a person who,though not a citizen of the united states,owes permanent allegiance to the united states.a.the district court found that because the intended victim was a permanent resident alien of the united states who had applied for united states citizenship,he was indeed a national of the united states.we application for citizenship is the most compelling evidence of permanent allegiance to the united states short of citizenship itself.
in fernandez view,his status as a national is ironclad in light of morin holding that naturalization applicants come within a s definition of national of the united states.just like the mexican citizen in morin,fernandez has applied for citizenship.
as is apparent from our discussion above,the morin court did not arrive at its construction of a by way of chevron.thus,it did not address the bia decision in matter of tuitasi,bia,in which the bia held that the acquisition of nationality for a noncitizen national is not governed by a but instead by,the provision describing categories of noncitizen nationals.id.at emphasis in original.the bia concluded that a noncitizen may become a national only by completing the naturalization process,by birth to national parents,or by birth in an outlying possession of the united states.id.
subsequent to our decision in morin,the bia has reaffirmed and expounded on its position in its decision in.drawing on the historical meaning of the word national and the statutory framework of the ina,the bia held that nationality under the act may be acquired only through birth or naturalization.id.at.in ordering fernandez removal in this case,the bia has once again adhered to its interpretation,which is contrary to morin interpretation that a noncitizen can become a national merely by filing a naturalization application.
we face two questions in determining whether we must defer under chevron to the bia interpretation of the ina nationality provisions whether,in the ina,congress has directed that courts interpret the ina nationality provisions,including a,without affording chevron deference to the bia views and whether we must follow morin interpretation of a or the bia contrary,interpretation.we address these questions in turn.
citing to the fifth circuit decision in alwan ashcroft,cir,fernandez argues that courts must review claims of nationality de novo without affording chevron deference to the bia interpretation of a.petitioner br.at.the government disagrees,urging us to apply chevron in this case and defer to the bia interpretation of the ina nationality provisions.
acknowledging that courts normally owe deference to the bia interpretations of the ina,the alwan court held that it owed no deference to the bia determination of nationality claims because congress,through b west,explicitly places the determination of nationality claims in the hands of the courts and thus has not consigned them to the discretion of the bia.id.at.according to the alwan court,b grants courts the power to decide nationality claims irrespective of whether any ambiguity exists in the ina language that would typically require agency deference.both the eleventh and ninth circuits have joined in this conclusion that b frees courts from applying chevron in deciding nationality claims.see attorney,cir per curiam citing b and alwan and not applying chevron to the bia interpretation,at citing b as proof that congress did not grant discretion to the bia to decide questions of law related to nationality.
other circuits have implicitly sanctioned such reasoning,deciding nationality claims without addressing the issue of deference to the bia.see,at interpreting a definition of national of the united states de novo without considering the bia interpretations,at holding that petitioner was not a national of the united states under a without applying chevron our holding is consistent with the bia own interpretation of the statute and the decisions of other circuits.emphasis added citation omitted see also salim,at expressly declining to decide whether chevron deference is due the bia determination of questions of law related to nationality claims.it should be noted that,despite not affording deference to the bia,all of these courts ultimately adopted an interpretation of a similar to the bia.
the relevant statutory language,however,does not allow us to ignore the bia statutory interpretation.section b provides the following 
treatment of nationality claims 
a court determination if no issue of fact 
if the petitioner claims to be a national of the united states and the court of appeals finds from the pleadings and affidavits that no genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner nationality is presented,the court shall decide the nationality claim.
b transfer if issue of fact 
if the petitioner claims to be a national of the united states and the court of appeals finds that a genuine issue of material fact about the petitioner nationality is presented,the court shall transfer the proceeding to the district court of the united states for the judicial district in which the petitioner resides for a new hearing on the nationality claim and a decision on that claim as if an action had been brought in the district court under section of title.
c limitation on determination 
the petitioner may have such nationality claim decided only as provided in this paragraph.
we can not conclude,like some of our sister circuits,that the statute calls for us to abandon our normal mode of which we interpret ambiguous provisions of the ina against a chevron backdrop,deferring to the bia permissible constructions of the one that requires us to interpret a sans chevron.we will briefly explain our reasoning 
the ina provides that t he secretary of homeland security shall be charged with the administration and enforcement of the statute and that the determination and ruling by the attorney general with respect to all questions of law shall be controlling.a west.the supreme court has repeatedly stated that judicial deference to the executive branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context where officials exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations,d quoting abudu,d.and as the holder of much of the attorney general delegated power,the bia should be accorded chevron deference as it gives ambiguous statutory terms concrete meaning through a process of adjudication.id.at.quoting,d.this means that the bia interpretations of ambiguous parts of the ina must be given controlling weight unless those interpretations are arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron,at.see,ahmed ashcroft,cir we defer to the bia interpretation of the ina unless the interpretation is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.internal quotation marks omitted.for us to remove our chevron glasses in interpreting the ina,the statutory language must make clear that congress desired such unfettered review.
we do not believe b clearly calls for such a retreat from our mode of review.rather,the unremarkable statute mandates that when circuit are to decide genuine disputes of faced with nationality claims presenting disputed material facts,the proceeding must be transferred to the district court for a hearing.thus,i n making de novo review by the district court hinge on the existence of genuine issues of material fact,congress intended the language to be interpreted similarly to that in federal rule of civil procedure.jahed acri,cir quoting agosto,d.in carving out nationality claims for this kind of treatment,congress was aware of past supreme court decisions holding that the constitution requires that there be some provision for de novo judicial determination of claims to american citizenship in deportation proceedings.agosto,at.such judicial determination of claims to nationality is not,however,the same as judicial interpretation of the statute against which such claims are decided.the effects of interpretations of ambiguous statutory provisions,whether by an agency or a court,extend well beyond the individual facts and cases through which such interpretations arise.
this brings us to our second point.in pronouncing that the courts shall decide the nationality claim,we believe that the statute calls for the same kind of de novo review that we always employ when interpreting ambiguous provisions of a statute committed to agency administration.t hat we review legal questions de novo does not detract from the fact that we owe chevron deference to the bia.hughes ashcroft,cir fernandez,concurring in part and dissenting in part footnote omitted criticizing majority conclusion that b frees courts from applying chevron to questions of nationality.it is one thing for a court to bring statutory interpretations to bear on a specific set of facts,to decide a claim.it is quite another for a court to give meaning to the ambiguous terms in a statute,which is decidedly not the general practice for courts with respect to statutes.we think b directs the former,not the latter,which is unremarkable given that we always review legal conclusions without deference.see,markovski gonzales,cir legal conclusions are reviewed without deference however,an agency interpretation of the applicable statutes is entitled to deference and must be accepted if reasonable.internal citation omitted see also nwolise,cir same.
in relying on alwan,fernandez neglects to point out that the fifth circuit,considering the effects of amendments made to the ina by the real id act,stat.real id act,has called into question alwan holding that no chevron deference is afforded to the bia on questions of nationality.see gonzales,cir.prior to congress enactment of the real id act,the ina provided that courts did not have jurisdiction to review final orders against aliens removable on the basis of criminal conviction.see a c west,amended by a c west notwithstanding any other provision of law,no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense covered in.because a c only barred judicial review of final removal orders against an alien,a court of appeals review of the merits of a petitioner nationality claim often merged with the ultimate question of the court own jurisdiction to review the removal order at issue.see,lewis,cir holding that,notwithstanding a c jurisdictional bar,court had jurisdiction to consider whether petitioner was an alien and had committed a deportable offense brissett ashcroft,cir the question of whether petitioner is an alien whose petition is unreviewable under a c is with the sole argument that petitioner presents in his petition,that he is a citizen and therefore not removable.we therefore have jurisdiction to consider petitioner contention.in,the fifth circuit characterized alwan holding as partly based on the jurisdictional nature of the nationality inquiry in that case alwan,too,involved a criminal alien,at in alwan we held that,because our jurisdiction was predicated on b a and c and we were directed to decide the issue,we hence did not give deference under chevron to the bia legal conclusions respecting the meaning of a national of the united states.
the real id act,which became effective on may,and applies retroactively to any removal order,see real id act b,amended in important ways.first,it made petitions for review filed with the courts of appeals the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of most removal orders,a west,and expressly eliminated district courts habeas jurisdiction over removal orders id.second,corresponding with the elimination of habeas jurisdiction,the act expanded courts of appeals jurisdiction over petitions for review by stating that none of the ina provisions including the bar in a c which limit or eliminate judicial review,shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals.a d west.this amendment permits all petitioners,including both criminal aliens and,to obtain appellate court review of constitutional claims and questions of law through a petition for review.see mbea gonzales,cir observing that,although a c generally bars judicial review of final removal orders when those orders are entered on the ground that the alien committed an aggravated felony or a crime involving moral turpitude,it permits review of constitutional claims or questions of law internal quotations marks omitted see also gonzales,cir stating that a d grants us jurisdiction to hear petitioner legal and constitutional claims,regardless of whether he is an alien jordon attorney,cir stating that the ina now permits criminal aliens to obtain review of constitutional claims and questions of law.
in light of the real id act granting courts of appeals jurisdiction to review constitutional and legal questions presented by criminal aliens in petitions for review,the court questioned alwan holding given that the holding arose in the context of the alwan court jurisdiction to consider the petition for review at all.specifically,the court noted that because its jurisdiction no longer turned simply on b but was also supplied by a d,it appeared that alwan conclusion was no longer binding on the court.at.although the court declined to resolve the chevron deference issue because it would have affirmed the bia interpretation with or without chevron deference,id.internal quotation marks omitted,it is clear that alwan resolution of the chevron deference issue may not have survived the real id act in the fifth circuit.
in short,the alwan court reading of b is not persuasive,and we are convinced that the far better reading is that congress has directed courts to decide nationality claims without altering their normal practice of deciding legal questions against the backdrop of chevron.in fact,nothing in the statute language suggests that passing the to alter normal principles of administrative law.accordingly,we conclude that b directs us to decide nationality claims through our customary mode of inquiry,affording deference to the bia interpretation of the ina.
there remains the question of whether we must follow morin interpretation of a or the bia contrary interpretation.fernandez contends that we must apply morin and declare him to have attained national status.the government urges us to defer to the bia interpretation and deny fernandez national status.fortunately,the supreme court has illuminated our way in its recent decision in national cable telecommunications ass brand x internet services,d.
in brand x,the court examined the relationship between the stare decisis effect of an appellate court statutory interpretation and an administrative agency subsequent,but contrary,interpretation.reiterating that chevron premise is that it is for agencies,not courts,to fill statutory gaps,the court concluded that chevron application should not turn on the order in which the judicial and agency interpretations issue.id.at.accordingly,the court held that a court prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.id.at.see also elm grove coal director,owcp,cir citing brand x and holding that because the court relevant precedent did not hold that the statute in question unambiguously foreclose d an agency interpretation,the court was required to defer to the agency subsequent interpretation if it met the prerequisite for chevron deference,namely,if it was based on a permissible construction of the statute internal quotation marks omitted.
of course,brand x in no way calls into doubt our many previous judicial interpretations that rested on the unambiguous words of the statute.chevron step one remains chevron step one after brand x,so that if the court has previously held that congress has spoken directly to the precise question at issue,that is the end of the matter,chevron,at,and no amount of chevron posturing on the part of the agency will undo the court interpretation.
we thus do not hold that a court must say in so many magic words that its holding is the only permissible interpretation of the statute in order for that holding to be binding on an agency.in many instances,courts were operating without the guidance of brand x,and yet the exercise of statutory interpretation makes clear the court view that the plain language of the statute was controlling and that there existed no room for contrary agency interpretation.in this instance,however,for the reasons that follow,we do not think that the morin court intended to foreclose all subsequent agency interpretation of a.
in interpreting a,morin held only that an application for citizenship is the most compelling evidence of permanent allegiance to the united states short of citizenship itself.morin,at.this interpretation rested on the morin court implicit,but crucial,interpretation that a confers,rather than describes,nationality,an interpretation that the morin court merely assumed was correct without saying anything,one way or the other,about whether the statute dictated such an interpretation.certainly,morin did not hold that its interpretation flowed from the unambiguous terms of the ina,or that its interpretation was the only permissible construction of the statute.the morin court,faced with the question of whether a noncitizen naturalization application is enough to confer nationality,settled upon what it thought was,at the least,a sensible construction of national of the united states,but it did not hold that its interpretation was the only one possible.see brand x,at.before a judicial construction of a statute,whether contained in a precedent or not,may trump an agency,the court must hold that the statute unambiguously requires the court construction.consequently,morin must yield to a reasonable interpretation by the bia of the ina and its provisions regarding nationality,including a.
we thus turn to our application of chevron.as our earlier discussion suggests,congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue here,chevron,at,because the ina does not provide express guidance as to the circumstances under which a person owes permanent allegiance to the united states.see dragenice gonzales,cir per curiam congress provided no explicit guidance as to the circumstances under which a person owes permanent allegiance to the united states.see also maximilian koessler,subject,citizen,national,and permanent allegiance,yale,noting that permanent allegiance has become a mystic concept which dims,instead of clarifying,definitions of nationality.accordingly,the bia possesses whatever degree of discretion the statutory ambiguity allows,and we must defer to its interpretation of a if that interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.as noted above,because congress has not merely failed to address a precise question but has also made an explicit delegation of rulemaking authority to the agency,the agency regulation is given controlling weight unless it is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.household credit,pfennig,d quoting chevron,at.alteration in original.
the bia position,expressed in both this case and its decision in,is that one acquires nationality only by birth or naturalization.see,at.a brief recounting of the historical and textual bases for the bia interpretation reveals that this construction is undoubtedly a permissible one.
historically,the term national has referred only to noncitizens born in territories of the united states.oliver dep t of justice,cir.the term was originally intended to account for the inhabitants of certain said to belong to the united states,including the territories acquired from spain during the war,namely the philippines,guam,and puerto rico,at citing charles gordon et,immigration law and procedure,b see also rabang,cir noting that the term national came into popular use in this country when the united states acquired territories outside its continental limits,and was used in reference to noncitizen inhabitants of those territories.nationals were deemed to owe permanent allegiance to the united states and were recognized as members of the nationality community in a way that distinguished them from aliens,at.
the phrase owes permanent allegiance in a b is thus a term of art that denotes a legal status for which individuals have never been able to qualify by demonstrating permanent allegiance,as that phrase is colloquially understood.id.in this regard,the ina definition of nationality,which explain s the latter by referring to permanent allegiance,is tautological,for permanent allegiance is simply a synonym for nationality.koessler,supra,at.
the historical understanding of the term national thus supports the bia interpretation.
the text and structure of the ina also support the bia interpretation of a,and on many different sides.
section a,the provision defining national of the united states,is a subsection of a,which defines numerous terms as they are used throughout chapter of title of the.elsewhere in chapter,the ina describes four categories of persons who are classified as nationals,but not citizens,of the united states at birth.west.these categories include persons who were born in an outlying possession of the united states,who were found in an outlying possession at a young age,id,or who are the children of noncitizen nationals,see id,there is no other provision in the ina besides that categorizes noncitizen nationals.given a placement in a definitional section of the ina and description of the categories of noncitizens who become nationals at birth,a straightforward understanding of the provisions relationship is that establishes a category of persons who qualify as noncitizen nationals and that those who qualify are in turn described in a as owing permanent allegiance to the united states the bia has thus stated that whether one owes permanent allegiance to the united states,is not simply a matter of individual choice instead the phrase reflects a legal relationship between an individual and a sovereign,at see also,at t he term permanent allegiance merely describes the nature of the relationship between nationals and the united states,a relationship that has already been created by another statutory provision.
the ina elaborate framework for attaining nationality through naturalization also supports the bia view.section a,the statutory provision immediately following the definition of national of the united states,provides that naturalization means the conferring of nationality of a state upon a person after birth,by any means whatsoever.a west.on its face,a makes no provision for the attainment of nationality short of full naturalization,at.our review of the ina section entitled nationality through naturalization,west supp,lends support to the conclusion that congress did not even remotely indicate that a demonstration of permanent allegiance alone would allow,much less require,the attorney general to confer national status on an individual,at.
the textual support for the bia interpretation does not end there.an interpretation of a that confers national status on naturalization applicants is difficult to reconcile wit
