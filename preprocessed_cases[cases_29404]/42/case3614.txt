nai yuan jiang jiang,a native and citizen of the people republic of china,petitions for review of the board of immigration appeals bia denial of his application for asylum,withholding of removal,and relief under the convention against torture cat.we must decide whether the bia conclusion that jiang has not demonstrated persecution for other resistance to a coercive population control program under the immigration and nationality act ina a,a,is supported by substantial evidence.because the bia expressly found jiang credible,we consider whether the bia correctly applied the law to the record before it,including jiang credible testimony.because we conclude that jiang suffered persecution for demonstrating other resistance to china coercive population control policy,we grant the petition in part and remand to the bia.
factual and procedural background 
jiang entered the united states on may,and was immediately detained.the immigration and naturalization service ins filed a notice to appear on may,charging him with removability for violating ina a c i,a c i.jiang timely filed an application for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.in his application,jiang claimed past persecution and fear of future persecution under china coercive family planning policies and on the basis of his religion 
in a hearing before the immigration judge ij,jiang testified that he met his girlfriend,jiang,in high school,and that they were both expelled after they were caught holding hands,a violation of prohibitions against romantic relationships.undeterred,they began living together in the same household in july,and they began to share a room on september.on november,they decided to marry and applied for an official marriage license.because they were both under the legal age of marriage imposed as part of china population control policy,local authorities denied their application for the marriage license and asked the couple if they were cohabiting.jiang admitted that they were.later that day,two police officers arrived at their home and seized both jiang and.local officials detained jiang and subjected to a physical examination,under her protest.during the physical examination,it was discovered that she was two months pregnant.the local officials forcibly subjected to an abortion that day.meanwhile,local authorities held jiang in custody.they released him the next day upon payment of a rmb fine after the abortion had been completed.
despite the minimum age requirement for a marriage,jiang and decided to be married in a traditional chinese ceremony to be held on christmas day,december.on the morning of their traditional ceremony,police and local officials from the family planning division interrupted the wedding preparations and attempted to arrest jiang.fearing that the police and family planning officials would detain,beat,and fine him,jiang escaped with the help of his friend,who had not yet arrived at the ceremony,also went into hiding.
jiang also credibly testified that,after the raid on his traditional wedding ceremony,he retreated to ginshi village to stay with his friend.during this stay,jiang attended a worship session,where he helped to prepare fliers about christianity for public distribution.police officers armed with batons disbanded the meeting,beating the participants.police hit jiang before he escaped across a nearby river other participants were also severely beaten,including one who suffered a broken leg.after the incident,police arrested and interrogated jiang parents about his whereabouts and detained and beat his father.
jiang conceded removability,and on january,the ij denied his petition for asylum,withholding,and cat relief.following jiang timely appeal,the bia upheld the ij decision on april.the bia found that jiang failed to meet the burden of proof required to show persecution under matter of,bia,which had established that the spouse of an individual forced to undergo an abortion is prima facie eligible for asylum.because the respondent and his girlfriend were underage,and therefore did not have a legally recognized marriage in china,the bia denied jiang claim.the bia also found that jiang had not been persecuted in the past on the basis of his christian religion and that jiang had not proven likelihood of future persecution on these grounds.
jiang then timely appealed to this court.upon the government motion,we referred the case to mediation and thereafter granted the government unopposed motion to remand to the bia for reconsideration.on december,the bia found jiang credible,but again denied jiang appeal.citing its recent decision in matter of,bia,the bia held that jiang did not suffer past persecution because he was not a legal spouse of the victim of a forced abortion,and found that he did not demonstrate other resistance to a coercive population program.the bia also rejected jiang religious persecution claim.
jiang subsequently filed a motion to reconsider,arguing that in,the bia recognized that its ruling does not mean that an unmarried applicant may never demonstrate past persecution in the context of a partner forced abortion or sterilization,at.the bia denied his motion.
jiang again timely appealed.in october,the government again requested that we remand to the bia for reconsideration,this time because of our decisions in ma ashcroft,cir,and tang gonzales,cir.in ma,we held that an individual whose spouse was persecuted under china population control policies,and who was married in a traditional,but not a wedding,is eligible for asylum.in tang,we held that two people living together as husband and wife should be treated as spouses for purposes of asylum claims based on population control policies.we again granted the government motion to remand to the bia.
on june,the bia denied jiang claim for the third time,again based upon an intervening change in the law.the bia observed that,subsequent to our remand,the attorney general had determined that an alien is not per se entitled to refugee status solely upon the fact that his spouse was forced to undergo an abortion or sterilization.pursuant to matter of,the bia concluded that jiang was not entitled to rely upon evidence of forced abortion,failed to demonstrate any resistance to family planning policies,and failed to establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution due to such resistance.jiang timely filed this third appeal.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over a final order of removal pursuant to a.where,as here,the bia conducts its own review of the evidence and law rather than adopting the ij decision,our review is limited to the bia decision,except to the extent that the ij opinion is expressly adopted.hosseini gonzales,cir.we review questions of law de novo.fisher ins,cir en banc.we review findings of fact for substantial evidence.khan holder,cir.
iii.discussion 
agency deference 
in denying jiang claim,the bia determined that a spouse or unmarried partner of a victim of forced abortion is not presumptively eligible for refugee status under.the bia further concluded that jiang had not demonstrated persecution for other resistance to a coercive population control program as required by for refugee status under ina a,at.
in,the attorney general concluded that ina a can not be read to confer automatic or presumptive refugee status on the spouses of persons who have been physically subjected to a forced abortion or sterilization procedure pursuant to a foreign government coercive population program.id.at.the attorney general in thus overruled the bia earlier decisions in,bia,which held that the spouse of an individual forced to undergo an abortion or sterilization is prima facie eligible for asylum,and matter of,bia,which limited to hold that only officially recognized spouses of victims of forced abortion or sterilization benefitted from a per se finding of past persecution,at.
we must first decide whether the attorney general most recent interpretation of ina a in is legally controlling.when reviewing decisions by an administrative agency,we apply chevron deference.under chevron,we first ask whether the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,and if so,we then ask whether the agency interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron natural res.def.council.
the attorney general conclusion in is contrary to our precedent in he ashcroft,cir,in which we agreed with the bia prior decision in.in he,we affirmed the bia conclusion that spouses of victims of coercive population control policies are presumptively eligible for asylum under ina a.however,in national cable telecommunications ass brand x internet services,brand x,the supreme court held that a court prior judicial construction of a statute trumps an agency construction otherwise entitled to chevron deference only if the prior court decision holds that its construction follows from the unambiguous terms of the statute and thus leaves no room for agency discretion.id.at.the government argues that,under brand x,we must defer to the agency reinterpretation of ina a in.we agree.
first,we conclude that the attorney general interpretation of ina a is entitled to chevron deference.ina a is silent as to the provision of refugee status to spouses of victims of coercive population control policies 
the term refugee means a any person who is outside any country of such person nationality and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of,that country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion,or b for purposes of determinations under this act,a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization,or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program,shall be deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion,and a person who has a well founded fear that he or she will be forced to undergo such a procedure or subject to persecution for such failure,reversal,or resistance shall by deemed to have a well founded fear of persecution on account of political opinion.
no language in the statute explicitly denies asylum relief to spouses of victims of coercive population control policies or precludes the attorney general from construing that statute in a manner that affords them such relief.moreover,as the agency new interpretation of the statute in indicates,the statutory language of ina a is susceptible to more than one interpretation.although the attorney general in noted that ina a does not explicitly exclude spouses from its purview,at,his decision in reverses the bia earlier conclusion in,which held that the spouse of a victim of coercive population control policies is prima facie eligible for asylum under ina a,bia.we conclude that ina a is silent and ambiguous as to the refugee status of spouses of victims of coercive population control policies.
proceeding to the second step in the chevron analysis,we would typically decide whether the agency interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.in this case,however,we defer to the agency new interpretation of ina a,pursuant to brand under brand x,o nly a judicial precedent holding that the statute unambiguously forecloses the agency interpretation,and therefore contains no gap for the agency to fill,displaces a conflicting agency construction.brand x,at.we have clarified that,under brand x,w hile agencies retain discretion to fill ambiguous statutory gaps,it does not follow that an agency may repeatedly put forward an interpretation that we have already examined under chevron and found unreasonable at its second step.escobar holder,cir.here we have had no occasion to hold unreasonable the agency current view as to the presumptive eligibility of a victim spouse.
in he,we agreed with the bia prior decision in that spouses of victims of coercive population control policies are presumptively eligible for asylum under ina a.however,our decision in he affirmed the bia prior position in without analyzing whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute under the second prong of the chevron test.chevron,at.because our prior decision failed to foreclose the agency current interpretation,we must defer to it.we note that our deference to the attorney general new interpretation in is in accord with every other circuit to have addressed this issue.see dong.holder,cir finding that overruled and chen holder,fed.appx.cir,same wu.holder,fed.appx.cir,same jin holder,cir same zhao holder,cir same yu att y,cir same att y,cir same.
merits of jiang political opinion claim 
having concluded that the attorney general interpretation of ina a in controls,we next examine whether the bia committed legal error in concluding that jiang failed to demonstrate other resistance to a coercive population control program under the statute,and whether the bia conclusion that jiang did not suffer persecution on the basis of that resistance is supported by substantial evidence.
persecution due to other resistance to a coercive population control program 
in,the bia concluded that spouses can not rely upon the sole fact of their spouse persecution automatically to qualify for political asylum under the statute coercive population control resistance provisions.the attorney general interpretation,however,does not prevent the spouse of a person who has physically undergone a forced abortion or sterilization procedure from qualifying for political asylum.id.at.such a person may qualify for asylum under ina a if he or she can demonstrate that 
i he or she qualifies as a refugee on account of persecution for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program ii he or she has a fear of being forced to undergo an abortion or involuntary sterilization procedure or of being persecuted for failing or refusing to undergo such a procedure or for other resistance to a coercive population control program iii the specific facts of his or her case justify asylum on grounds other than those articulated in section a or iv he or she satisfies the requirements for derivative asylum expressly set forth in section b a of the act.
thus stands only for the limited proposition that ina a can not be read to confer automatic or presumptive refugee status on the spouses of persons who have physically been subjected to a forced abortion or sterilization procedure pursuant to a foreign government coercive population program,at emphasis added.indeed,the attorney general concluded in that applicants may present proof,of which their spouse treatment may be a part,of persecution for refusing to undergo forced abortion or sterilization procedures or for engaging in other resistance to a coercive population control program,at emphasis added.we thus consider a spouse forced abortion or sterilization as proof that an applicant resisted a coercive population control policy,and in analyzing whether persecution occurred as a result.id.however,an applicant must provide evidence of resistance in addition to the spouse forced abortion or sterilization to avoid what the attorney general described as the fatal flaw in the per se eligibility analysis some spouses may not have resisted,and in fact may have affirmatively supported,the forced abortion or sterilization procedure that was performed on the spouse who remains in china.such applicants should not be permitted to use the sole fact of their spouse persecution automatically to qualify for political asylum under the statute coercive population control resistance provisions.id.at.
a.other resistance to a coercive population control program 
jiang credible testimony amply demonstrates the other resistance to a coercive population control program required by.the bia erred as a matter of law in concluding otherwise.
first,forced abortion is proof of jiang resistance to china population control policy,at.jiang neither supported nor acquiesced in the forced abortion.family planning officials arrested both jiang and for cohabiting in violation of china prohibition against underage marriage,after t
