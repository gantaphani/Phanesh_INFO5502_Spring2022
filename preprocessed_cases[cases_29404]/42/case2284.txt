background 
sobitan is a nigerian citizen.in,he attempted to enter the united states at international airport,where he was detained and arrested by glud for illegally reentering the united states.he subsequently was prosecuted by podliska.neither glud nor podliska informed sobitan of his right to consular notification provided by article of the vienna convention sobitan was convicted on the charge.
in,sobitan filed a complaint against glud and podliska in which he sought compensatory and punitive damages for their alleged failure to inform him of his rights under article during his arrest,as well as his subsequent detention and prosecution the government filed a motion for substitution and dismissal under the westfall act,b.
the district court granted the government motion.it substituted the united states as the defendant and dismissed sobitan claim with prejudice.it held that,under the westfall act,the government was the proper defendant.specifically,it rejected sobitan argument that his vienna convention claim arose under a federal statute and therefore was excepted from the westfall act coverage.see b.because the westfall act mandated that the government be substituted for the individual defendants,the district court continued,sobitan was required to adhere to the procedural requirements set forth in the federal tort claims act,a ftca.the district court found that sobitan had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before instituting his action as required by a.the court therefore dismissed with prejudice sobitan complaint.
discussion 
on appeal,sobitan claims that the district court erred in substituting the government as a defendant pursuant to the westfall act.sobitan acknowledges that the act provides for the substitution of the united states as a party in any action brought for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death arising or resulting from the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment.b.he argues,however,that his action falls within the exception set forth in b for actions brought for a violation of a statute of the united states.id.b b.according to sobitan,the term statute encompasses treaty.therefore,because his action seeks relief for violations of his rights under a treaty,specifically the vienna convention,the substitution provision of the westfall act does not apply to his action.we begin our consideration of sobitan argument with the language of the act.see,bass stolper,koritzinsky,brewster neider,cir as with all issues of statutory interpretation,the appropriate place to begin our analysis is with the text itself,which is the most reliable indicator of congressional intent.citations omitted.

section of title provides in relevant part 
b the remedy against the united states provided by sections b and of this title for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death arising or resulting from the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment is exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding for money damages by reason of the same subject matter against the employee whose act or omission gave rise to the claim or against the estate of such employee.any other civil action or proceeding for money damages arising out of or relating to the same subject matter against the employee or the employee estate is precluded without regard to when the act or omission occurred.
paragraph does not extend or apply to a civil action against an employee of the government 
a which is brought for a violation of the constitution of the united states,or 
b which is brought for a violation of a statute of the united states under which such action against an individual is otherwise authorized.
d upon certification by the attorney general that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose,any civil action or proceeding commenced upon such claim in a united states district court shall be deemed an action against the united states under the provisions of this title and all references thereto,and the united states shall be substituted as the party defendant.
upon certification,any action or proceeding subject to paragraph,or shall proceed in the same manner as any action against the united states filed pursuant to section b of this title and shall be subject to the limitations and exceptions applicable to those actions.
section b shelters federal employees from liability for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death arising or resulting from the negligent or wrongful act or omission of the employee while acting within the scope of his office or employment it accomplishes this by transforming the action against the employee into one against the federal government.there are only two discrete categories of cases to which this protection does not apply a claim brought for a violation of the constitution of the united states,and a claim brought for a violation of a statute of the united states under which such action against an individual is otherwise authorized.b.
when a claim of wrongful conduct is brought against a government official in his individual capacity,and the claim does not fall within the specified exceptions to immunity in b,the attorney general certification that the defendant was acting within the scope of his employment requires substitution of the united states as a defendant.the suit then proceeds as though it had been filed against the united states under the ftca.as such,it is subject to the limitations and exceptions applicable to cases brought pursuant to the ftca.d.
substitution 
in this case,the parties agree on most aspects of the westfall act application to the facts as alleged in sobitan complaint.the parties agree that sobitan action is for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death arising or resulting from the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the government while acting within the scope of his office or employment and,therefore,falls within the general coverage of the westfall act.b.furthermore,they agree that,absent an exception to coverage,the united states properly was substituted as a party.finally,they agree that the action can not proceed against the united states because the united states has not waived its sovereign immunity generally with respect to claims brought pursuant to international treaties.
the only issue on which the parties disagree,and,therefore,the focus of our efforts,is whether the present action is brought for a violation of a statute of the united states and,as a result,is exempted from the westfall act substitution provision.sobitan claims that his action for damages for violation of consular rights afforded him by article of the vienna convention is an action brought for a violation of a statute of the united states under which such action against an individual is otherwise authorized.in short,sobitan believes that the vienna convention should be considered a statute for purposes of b b.
sobitan first claims that the plain and ordinary meaning of the term statute includes treaties ratified by the united states,including article of the vienna convention.appellant br.we can not accept this argument.
section b b creates an exception for statute s of the united states.the plain and ordinary meaning of the term statute of the united states is a bill enacted in accordance with the procedures set forth in article i of the constitution,that is,passed by both houses of congress and signed by the president.judicial use of the term statute bears out this meaning.see,united states vuitch,d observing that a piece of legislation applicable only in the district of columbia is nevertheless a statute in the sense that it was duly enacted into law by both houses of congress and was signed by the president ins chadha,d r epeal of statutes,no less than enactment,must conform with art.hamdan rumsfeld,d scalia,dissenting noting that the language of the statute that was actually passed by both houses of congress and signed by the president is our only authoritative and only reliable guidepost as to statutory meaning in re sanders,cir observing that t he most conspicuous place to look for the purpose of a law of course is the text of the statute that both houses of congress passed and that the president signed into law emphasis added united states fields,cir we should never forget that the law is what the statute itself says after it is approved by both houses of the legislature and signed by the president.atlantic city,observing that a regulation can not be the basis for denying the petitioners their rights provided by a statute enacted by both houses of congress and signed into law by the president.indeed,on more than one occasion,the court has observed that there is abundant support for the conclusion that the power to enact statutes may only be exercised in accord with a single,finely wrought and exhaustively considered,procedure,specifically,passage by both houses of congress and signature by the president.clinton city of new york,d quoting chadha,at.emphasis added.
in contrast to the multiple examples of common usage previously set forth,sobitan has not come forward with any example,either in statutory or common law,that has defined or interpreted the term statute to include treaties.instead,sobitan points to american federation of labor watson,in which the court held that a state constitutional provision constitutes a statute for purposes of of the judicial code similarly,sobitan relies on stevens griffith,in which the court commented on its authority to review a state enforcement of a law of the confederacy.the court stated 
if enforced as a law there it would be considered as a statute,not of the confederacy,but of the state,and treated accordingly.any enactment,to which a state gives the force of law,whether it has gone through the usual stages of legislative proceedings or been adopted in other modes of expressing the will of the state,is a statute of the state within the meaning of the acts of congress touching our appellate jurisdiction.
id.at.in short,the court held that,because the state enforced a law of the confederacy as its own,the court had jurisdiction to examine the claim that the law was contrary to the constitution.
neither of the cases on which sobitan relies,however,speaks to the issue here whether the plain meaning of the term statute includes treaties.at most,the cases relied upon by sobitan demonstrate that,in some contexts,the term statute may take on a special meaning.
seizing on this idea,sobitan next argues that the term statute is ambiguous,and,therefore,the court must look to legislative history to inform our interpretation.
however,a mbiguity is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory context.brown gardner,d citing king vincent,d.here,the statutory context makes it clear that statute does not have the broader meaning of any as the constitution or a has the force of law.as previously set forth,b provides 
paragraph does not extend or apply to a civil action against an employee of the government 
a which is brought for a violation of the constitution of the united states,or 
b which is brought for a violation of a statute of the united states under which such action against an individual is otherwise authorized.
b.if congress had meant the term statute of the united states in b b to include all enactments with the force of constitutions and would have been no reason to have a separate section,here b a,which excepts claims for violations of the constitution.indeed,adopting the broader definition of the term statute urged by sobitan would render subsection b a superfluous,a result we try to avoid.see,united states berkos,cir we avoid interpreting a statute in a way that renders a word or phrase redundant or meaningless.
sobitan next maintains that treaties are recognized as laws of the united states,a term generally synonymous with statutes.appellant br.in essence,sobitan posits that,because treaties are laws and because statutes also are laws,the two are one in the same.there is no reason,however,to believe that two subsets statutes and treaties of the same larger set laws are interchangeable with one another.indeed,sobitan has not pointed to a single authority that uses the terms statute and treaty interchangeably.instead,all of sobitan authorities stand for the unremarkable principle that treaties,along with the constitution and the laws of the united states,shall be the supreme law of the land.const.art.vi,cl.for example,sobitan points to whitney robertson,which states 
by the constitution,a treaty is placed on the same footing,and made of like obligation,with an act of legislation.both are declared by that instrument to be the supreme law of the land,and no superior efficacy is given to either over the other.when the two relate to the same subject,the courts will always endeavor to construe them so as to give effect to both,if that can be done without violating the language of either but,if the two are inconsistent,the one last in date will control the other 
again,the court merely acknowledges that the constitution places treaties and statutes on the same footing however,both the constitution and the court explicitly differentiate between act s of legislation and treat ies.id.
finally,we note that every court to consider the issue has determined that the westfall act exemption for statutory claims does not include claims brought pursuant to a treaty.in bansal russ,d,the plaintiff asserted,among other claims,a violation of his consular rights under article and invoked the alien tort statute,as the basis for his right to recover.the district court held 
article of the vienna convention on consular relations requires that an arrested foreign national be informed of his right to contact his consulate.vienna convention on consular relations.the alien tort statute ats establishes jurisdiction in the district courts over civil actions by aliens for torts committed in violation of a treaty of the united states.jogi voges,cir citing sosa,d.the ats does not itself create a cause of action rather,it provides a procedural mechanism through which an alien pl
