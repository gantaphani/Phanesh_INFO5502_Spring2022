opinion of the court 
an alien unlawfully in this country may have his removal blocked under certain circumstances.one is withholding of removal under immigration and nationality act ina b a,b a,which prohibits removal if the attorney general believes that the alien life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal eligibility for withholding of removal is erased,however,if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the alien is a danger to the security of the united states.ina b b iv,b b iv.in this case we consider the attorney general interpretation of that exception commonly referred to as the national security exception.
in in re,the attorney general construed the exception as referring to any nontrivial level of danger or any nontrivial degree of risk.he further interpreted the provision to establish a reasonable person standard,which he deemed to be satisfied if there is information that would permit a reasonable person to believe that the alien may pose a danger to the national security.id.at.
the board of immigration appeals bia or the board relied on this interpretation in the decisions under review here it affirmed the determination that petitioners,two aliens from uzkbekistan,were entitled to deferral of removal under the cat because they faced likely persecution or torture if returned to that country it also concluded that the national security exception barred petitioners from withholding of removal.
petitioners argue that we should reject the attorney general interpretation of the national security exception.for the exception to apply,they believe the danger must be current,it must be serious or grave,and that this must be established by at least a probable cause standard the attorney general responds that his interpretation of the exception is entitled to deference under the principles announced in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.
we agree with the attorney general on all points save one.the challenged interpretation ignores clear congressional intent to the extent that,instead of following the statutory language and asking whether an alien is a danger to the security of the united states,it inquires whether an alien may pose a danger to the national security emphasis added.because we can not discern from the record whether this error in the attorney general interpretation led to a result contrary to the intent of congress in petitioners cases,we remand for application of the correct standard.
factual background 
petitioners bekhzod bakhtiyarovich yusupov and ismoil samadov are uzbek nationals.they claim to be independent muslims who attended the mosque of imam obidkhon nazarov,whose followers,they assert,have been subject to continued persecution by the uzbek government.yusupov and samadov stated that they left uzbekistan to pursue educational opportunities in america but refused to return to their former country for fear of persecution.
petitioners entered the united states separately in on student visas to learn english.with the exception of a course in english attended by samadov,petitioners did not attend educational institutions.instead,despite lacking permission to work,they both found employment in philadelphia,living together in a house with other uzbek nationals,including erkinjon zakirov.
in,agents from the federal bureau of investigation fbi visited yusupov and samadov at their home.the agents asked questions about criminal charges asserted by the uzbek government and received permission from them to search the house and the shared household computer.the fbi found no evidence of criminal activity on the premises,but took the computer for further analysis.a search of its hard drive revealed the following in the internet cache 
a of a speech by osama bin laden in december 
a of a speech by chechen militant shamil basayev 
a video clip from november,including a view of what appear to be afghan fighters 
of what appear to be attacks on russian troops and vehicles 
a publicly available state map showing locations of pennsylvania state police facilities and 
an sent to zakirov that read as follows 
your exit from there might bring some difficulties to the things we are taking care of here.therefore,if you do not have very strong difficulties,for you to stay where you are and work for islam is also a big jihad 
following the fbi visit,samadov was detained by the immigration and naturalization service ins predecessor to the department of homeland security dhs and served with a notice to appear for overstaying his visa.he was released on bond on the basis that he posed no danger to the community,the terms of which he followed.
in,yusupov moved to virginia purportedly to get a job.he worked as a school bus driver for a private muslim grade school,where he was given access to a small storeroom with a mattress and an computer.he also obtained a job at a factory,falsely claiming to be a citizen on a federal employment eligibility verification form.the bureau of immigration customs enforcement bice of dhs arrested him for making a false statement on a federal form,and seized a computer and his duffel bag from the school storeroom.bice found some film containing pictures of the new york skyline and an intersection near the historic fulton ferry in the brooklyn area of new york city,as well as cached pictures from the internet of violent activities in central asia.yusupov pled guilty to making a false statement on the form and was sentenced to payment of a special assessment and probation.bice also detained him and he entered removal proceedings.
in,samadov was detained again after the uzbek government sent a notice of criminal charges along with an extradition request for him,yusupov,and zakirov 
ii.removal proceedings and appeals to the bia 
yusupov conceded that he was removable for violating the terms of his student visa,but applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.the ij denied the asylum application as untimely.but he made a positive credibility determination,and concluded that yusupov had established,on the basis of his support for imam nazarov,a clear probability of persecution sufficient for meeting the standard for withholding of removal.
the ij also found that there were no reasonable grounds to believe that yusupov was a danger to national security because he had engaged in no violent activities nor had he shown a propensity for doing so in several years of residence here,there was nothing to suggest that he espoused violence,the extradition request was likely a tool of persecution,and the cached pertained to world events near his home region that were of general interest and have become generally available to the public in recent years.in re yusupov,no.a,at ij.accordingly,the ij granted yusupov application for withholding of removal.
dhs appealed to the bia,which dismissed yusupov appeal from the denial of asylum and reversed the ij determination that there were no reasonable grounds to believe that yusupov was a danger to our nation security,thus making him ineligible for withholding of removal the board emphasized that the level of danger required under the statute need not be particularly high,and that dhs evidence sufficed to meet this relatively low burden of establishing reasonable grounds,namely the uzbek extradition request and an interpol warrant with allegations that yusupov conspired with others to use violence,the fbi discovery of cached video files of speeches by bin laden and others as well as of bombings in chechnya,the jihad sent to yusupov roommate zakirov,the fact that yusupov entered the united states on a student visa but never attended school,and yusupov conviction for making a false statement on a federal form.in re yusupov,no.a,at bia.nevertheless,the bia agreed with the ij determination that yusupov would face persecution torture upon return to uzbekistan,and thus granted the more limited remedy of deferral of removal under the cat 
samadov also conceded removability and applied for asylum,withholding of removal,and cat relief.the ij denied his application for asylum as untimely,but granted withholding of removal under the ina on the basis of the finding that samadov testimony was extremely credible that,if removed to uzbekistan,he would face persecution on account of his beliefs as an independent muslim.the bia affirmed in july.
dhs moved the bia to reopen in september on the ground that it had obtained new evidence that had been previously,the mentioning jihad found during the fbi search of the computer hard drive and an interpol search warrant based on uzbek criminal charges in connection with bombings in uzbekistan in march and april.dhs later acknowledged that the jihad was addressed to zakirov rather than samadov and that it had no evidence connecting samadov to the uzbek bombings,which occurred while he was in the united states.but the bia already had reopened and remanded the case to the ij.
on remand,samadov testified that he had not viewed the video clips and now points to yusupov credited testimony that he,yusupov,had viewed the clips,never engaged in violent activities,and that islam condemns violence.in response to a question whether he had sent money to followers of imam nazarov,samadov answered that he had sent approximately to uzbekistan in charitable donations.he said that he could not recall whether he had wired additional money for charity,but that if he did it would have been to his brother.at a later hearing,samadov conceded that he had sent to his brother,but asserted that he had not mentioned this sum previously because it was a repayment of a debt rather than the type of charitable donation about which he was asked.the ij made an adverse credibility determination on the basis of this exchange.
the ij denied samadov second application for asylum as untimely.she concluded that samadov was ineligible for withholding of removal because the national security exception applied.the basis for the finding stemmed from the computer files found on the hard drive of the computer in samadov residence,his lack of candor concerning the money sent to uzbekistan,and opening his house to uzbek nationals,one of whom received an mentioning jihad.in re samadov,no.a at ij.at the very least,the ij stated,samadov provided material support to an individual whom he knew or should have known had committed or intended to commit terrorist activity.id.citation omitted.nevertheless,the ij granted deferral of removal under the cat on the ground that samadov faced likely persecution upon return.both parties appealed to the appealing the denial of asylum and withholding of removal,and dhs appealing the grant of deferral of removal.
the bia dismissed both appeals.it agreed that samadov was ineligible for withholding of removal because there is sufficient evidence that would permit a reasonable person to believe that the respondent may pose a danger to the nation defense,foreign relations,or economic interests.in re samadov,no.a,at bia.may.declining to state conclusively whether it agreed with the ij that the material support to terrorism bar is satisfied by the facts of this case,the bia held that samadov was ineligible for withholding of removal because the attorney general stated that reasonable grounds exist where there is information that would permit a reasonable person to believe that the alien may pose a danger to the national security.id.citing in re,at emphasis added.it based this decision on the following evidence the extradition request,the interpol notice,the aforementioned from the computer in samadov house,a dhs memorandum of investigation describing the contents of those videos,the pennsylvania state police map taken from the computer in samadov residence,the jihad to zakirov,and dhs special agent mark olexa testimony that zakirov later fled to canada.id.at.nevertheless,the bia upheld the ij grant of deferral of removal because t he record is replete with documentary evidence which supports the finding that it is more likely than not that samadov,an independent muslim,would be subjected to torture if removed to uzbekistan.id.at.
petitions for review 
yusupov and samadov now petition us for review they argue that the bia erred in applying the attorney general interpretation of the national security exception.petitioners contend that this interpretation is unreasonable,and thus not entitled to chevron deference,because it is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statute and its statutory context,and is contrary to united states treaty obligations 
iii.jurisdiction standards of review 
jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction to review the board final orders of removal under ina a,a.see sukwanputra gonzales,cir an order of removal becomes final upon,inter alia,a determination by the bia affirming such order.a b i.the supreme court has specified that administrative orders are final when they mark the consummation of the agency process,and when rights or obligations have been determined or when legal consequences will flow from the decision.bennett spear,d.
o rdinarily a remand to an administrative agency is not a final order for purposes of appellate jurisdiction,office of workers comp.programs brodka,cir.but several of our sister circuit courts of appeals have concluded that an order is final for jurisdictional purposes when a removability determination has been made that is no longer appealable to the bia,regardless whether a formal order of removal has been,lazo gonzales,cir t he statutory requirement of an order of removal is satisfied ij either orders removal or concludes that an alien is removable.emphasis in original gonzales,cir holding that bia reversal of ij cancellation of removal created a final order of removal nreka att y,cir asserting jurisdiction over a bia determination denying asylum without an express final order of removal because denial of asylum is so closely tied to removal and even if the bia has remanded for limited further proceedings.see,saldarriaga gonzales,cir finding jurisdiction when voluntary departure motion still pending before ij del pilar att y,cir finding jurisdiction where country of removal at issue before ij ins,cir holding that a bia order reversing an ij decision to grant suspension of removal and remanding for a determination of voluntary departure in lieu of deportation was a final order of removal,as nothing was pending before the bia and the petitioner had no reason or basis for appealing the ij decision in his favor.
we agree with these decisions and conclude that we have jurisdiction over these petitions.the bia affirmed the ij denial of each asylum application as untimely,vacated the decision to grant withholding of removal for yusupov,denied withholding of removal for samadov,and upheld the decisions to grant the limited remedy under the cat of deferral of removal for both.
the bia remanded both cases to the ij pursuant to d for the purpose of allowing dhs the opportunity to complete or update identity,law enforcement,or security investigations or examinations,and further proceedings,if necessary,and for the entry of an order as provided by h.these administrative matters do not affect the controlling removal determination.accordingly,the bia determinations here are final within the meaning of the ina,and we have jurisdiction to review them 
standards of review 
we uphold the bia determinations if they are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.li att y,cir quoting ins,d.we review the ij factual findings under this same substantial evidence standard where,as here,the bia directs us to the opinion and decision of the ij who originally assessed the application.shah att y,cir quoting dia ashcroft,cir en banc.

the judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction and must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent.chevron,at.however,judicial deference to the executive branch is especially appropriate in the immigration context where officials exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations,at.quoting ins abudu,d.the supreme court has explained that i t is clear that principles of chevron deference are applicable to the ina because that statute charges the attorney general with the administration and enforcement of the statute,makes controlling the determinations and rulings of the attorney general with respect to all questions of law,and confers decisionmaking authority on the attorney general with respect to an alien entitlement to withholding of removal.id.at.quoting a,h.we also afford chevron deference to the bia reasonable interpretations of statutes which it is charged with administering.kamara,at citing,at,and chevron,at.see also tineo ashcroft,cir there is also no longer any question that the bia should be accorded chevron deference for its interpretations of the immigration laws.gao ashcroft,cir explaining that bia interpretations of the ina are entitled to chevron deference because the attorney general vested the bia with power to exercise the discretion conferred on him by law.thus we turn to how chevron affects this case.
chevron deference involves a inquiry.at step one,the court must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue and unambiguously expressed its intent.chevron,at.if so,the inquiry ends,as both the agency and the court must give effect to the plain language of the statute.id.at.if a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.
when the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the court proceeds to step two,where it inquires whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.if a statute is ambiguous or silent,and if the implementing agency construction is reasonable,chevron requires a federal court to accept the agency construction of the statute,even if the agency reading differs from what the court believes is the best statutory interpretation.cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d citing chevron,at.
iv.analysis 
having concluded that we have jurisdiction and determined the standards for review,we turn to the national security exception to mandatory withholding.we consider the interpretation of two portions of the exception reasonable grounds to believe,and is a danger to the security of the united states.for the sake of clarity,we perform the chevron analysis separately for each challenged portion of the attorney general interpretation of the national security exception.see,sec y of labor,mine safety,health admin.cement of,taking a similar approach by analyzing separately under chevron step one the terms private and appurtenant to in the statutory definition of coal or other mine.in so doing,we adhere to the instruction that in ascertaining whether the agency interpretation is a permissible construction of the language,a court must look to the structure and language of the statute as a whole.national passenger boston maine,d.
reasonable grounds to believe 
chevron step one 
yusupov argues that congress use of the phrase reasonable grounds to believe demonstrates its clear intent to incorporate a probable cause standard borrowed from criminal law into the national security exception.however,it is not clear that we should read this phrase through the lens of criminal law.congress was free to write a standard without considering our criminal law jurisprudence.the statutory context does not indicate that congress clearly intended to incorporate criminal law standards.for example,immediately before the national security exception,the statute prohibits withholding of removal if there are serious reasons to believe that the alien committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the united states.ina b b iii,b b iii.the serious reasons standard does not map clearly to any criminal law criterion.this suggests that the statute creates a series of standards that may share surface similarities with those of criminal law,but that need not be reduced to criminal law equivalents 
more simply,if congress wished to ensure the incorporation of a probable cause standard,it could have done so explicitly.in that event,we would assume that,because congress used a term of art,it intended to incorporate the requirements imposed by the jurisprudence regarding that term.see mcdermott int l,wilander,d morissette united states.absent explicit use of a term of art,we hesitate to make comparable assumptions.
accordingly,we are unpersuaded that the phrase reasonable grounds to believe,which is not defined in the ina,is unambiguous.as petitioners note,there are strong arguments that it means probable cause,including the fact that black law dictionary defines reasonable grounds as equivalent to probable cause.see black law dictionary,supra note,at.however,just as a term with multiple definitions may be unambiguous in context,see brown gardner,d,the existence of a single definition in black law dictionary does not preclude a term from being ambiguous in context.because of the ambiguity we perceive,we pass to the second step of the chevron analysis as to that the attorney general interpretation is reasonable.
chevron step two 
the attorney general began the interpretation of reasonable grounds for regarding by agreeing with the conclusion of the first circuit court of appeals in adams baker,cir,that the statutory reference to reasonable grounds implies the use of a reasonable person standard.in re,at.this,the attorney general concluded,was consistent with the bia reliance on probable cause cases.id.he faulted the bia,however,for equating probable cause with a preponderance of the evidence standard,explaining that reasonable grounds for regarding is substantially less stringent than preponderance of the evidence.id.at.instead,the attorney general concluded,t he reasonable grounds for regarding standard is satisfied if there is information that would permit a reasonable person to believe that the alien may pose a danger to the national security.id.
in this context,the attorney general appears implicitly to have adopted a probable cause standard from criminal law,a fact acknowledged in the responses to these petitions.atty br.in samadov the attorney general held that the term reasonable grounds was akin to the standard required for probable cause.atty br.in yusupov same.indeed,the attorney general appears to have assumed that probable cause and reasonable grounds are synonymous.we focus our analysis on the resulting interpretive standard adopted by the attorney general 
we know of no basis for doubting the reasonableness of the attorney general interpretation of reasonable grounds for regarding as being satisfied if there is information that would permit a reasonable person to believe.although we conclude that the statutory language does not demonstrate a clear congressional intent to adopt a probable cause standard,the attorney general adoption of a standard akin to probable cause in criminal cases is also reasonable,and thus a permissible construction of the statute.see chevron,at.
the attorney general also decided in in re that t he information relied on to support the reasonable grounds determination need not meet standards for admissibility of evidence in court proceedings,at.we reject the contention that this was unreasonable,as nothing in the statute requires that the information to be considered must be admissible under the federal rules of evidence.in so doing,we agree with the first circuit court of appeals in recognizing that the immigration context is different from that of a courtroom.see adams,at.petitioners fail to point to anything in the ina that incorporates the rules of evidence.rather,the ina imposes an implicit requirement that the evidence be reliable enough to allow a reasonable person to decide that the alien poses a national security risk.the attorney general thus is reasonable to interpret the national security exception as allowing the consideration of any evidence that is not intrinsically suspect.see,at quoting adams,at.
because the attorney general interpretations of the ambiguous phrase reasonable grounds to believe,and the type of evidence allowable in making that determination,are reasonable,we defer to them under chevron.
is a danger to the security of the united states 
we turn to the attorney general interpretation of the phrase is a danger to the security of the united states.the ordinary meaning of danger is peril exposure to harm,loss,pain,or other negative result cause of peril or menace.black law dictionary,supra note,at.here,the attorney general reasons read as a whole the phrase danger to the security of the united states is best understood to mean a risk to the nation defense,foreign relations,or economic interests.accord in re,at.this interpretation follows the definition of national security used for a separate section of the ina.see ina d,d defining national security,for the purposes of that section,as the national defense,foreign relations,or economic interests of the united states.
we are not asked to determine the contours of risk to our nation defense,foreign relations,or economic interests.instead,applying the chevron analysis,we consider petitioners arguments that,for the national security exception to apply,it is incorrect for the attorney general to conclude that an alien may pose a risk to national security,and any danger to national security must be serious and not just.
is a danger versus may pose a danger 
although we defer to the attorney general interpretation of the phrases reasonable grounds to believe and as discussed below danger to the security of the united states,we do not defer to his reading of is a danger.is does not mean may,as suggested by the attorney general formulation that the national security exception is satisfied if there is information that would permit a reasonable person to believe that the alien may pose a danger to the national security.in re,at emphasis added.this interpretation accords with neither the plain wording nor the ordinary meaning of the statutory text,which does not refer to belief in a mere possibility.in other words,is and its subjunctive form would connote a more certain determination than that the alien might or could be a danger for the national security exception to apply.see ins stevic,d the section would be threatened literally provides for withholding of deportation only if the alien life or freedom would be threatened in the country to which he would be deported it does not require withholding if the alien might or could be subject to persecution.
instead,we must take the statute to mean what it says is indicates that congress intended this exception to apply to individuals who under a reasonable belief standard actually pose a danger to security.it did not intend this exception to cover aliens who conceivably could be such a danger or have the ability to pose such a danger a category nearly anyone can fit accordingly,the attorney general interpretation of is a danger as may pose a danger fails at the first step of the chevron analysis.
the introduction of may in the statement of the standard in in re perhaps is no more than an unintentional and inartful articulation on the part of the attorney general.indeed,in remanding the case,the attorney general directed the bia to inquire whether the evidence would support a reasonable belief that respondent poses a danger to our national security interests.in re,at emphasis added.however,as discussed below,the bia quoted the former,incorrect phrasing in petitioners cases.thus we can not conclude that the error of in re reflects nothing more than the specific posture of that case and that it could not have affected petitioners.
nor do we agree with an argument that we may affirm nonetheless on this point because,even if it recited an incorrect standard,the bia applied the correct,it inquired whether each petitioner is a danger to the security of the united states.we agree that we should ask whether the correct standard was applied in petitioners cases.see lavira att y,cir.however,we disagree that the application of a correct standard can be discerned from the record before us.in yusupov proceedings,the bia stated that the ij determined that the government failed to meet the threshold for establishing that an alien poses a national security risk before itself concluding that the record contains information that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the respondent may pose a danger to national security.in re yusupov,no.a bia,emphases added.similarly,in the samadov proceedings,the bia noted that the ij had found the requisite reasonable grounds to believe that the alien is a danger to the security of the united states before affirming on the basis that the record contained sufficient evidence that the respondent may pose a danger to national security.in re samadov,no.a bia.may,emphases added.these differences may not have affected the result in either case,but we can not assume this to be true.given the important interests at stake and the bia expertise,we conclude that it would be most appropriate to remand these cases to that body for review under the correct standard 
whether danger to the security of the united states requires the modifier serious 
petitioners argue that an alien threatens the security of the united states only if the danger is serious.although they do not make that claim within the chevron framework,we consider it in terms of that analysis,asking whether the attorney general interpretation of the statutory language is entitled to deference.we conclude that we should defer.
to repeat,at the first step of the chevron analysis we ask whether the statute announces a clear congressional intent as to the meaning of the phrase danger to the security of the united states.petitioners argue that the legislative history of adoption of refugee protections and an international consensus compel the conclusion that congress clearly intended for a national security danger to be serious for an exception to mandatory withholding of removal to apply.
the national security exception was passed as part of the refugee act of,stat.see,at.it grew out of the united nations convention relating to the status of refugees.july,the convention.section e of the refugee act amended existing law on the withholding of removal,basically conforming it to the language of article of the united nations protocol relating to the status of refugees,the protocol.stevic,at.the main provision of the protocol is article nonrefoulement obligation it provides that a contracting country must not expel or return a refugee to a country where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group or political opinion.article provides an exception to that rule when there are reasonable grounds for regarding the refugee as a danger to the security of the country in which he is.
foreign courts and international law scholars appear to be unanimous in viewing the article exception as referring to a serious danger.the legislative history of the refugee act of makes clear that congress intended to protect refugees to the fullest extent of our nation international obligations indeed,petitioners appear to be correct that congress intended to allow exceptions to our nonrefoulement obligations only in a narrow set of circumstances.
however,petitioners argument ignores that danger to the security of the united states includes an inherent seriousness requirement.it does not easily accord acceptable gradations,as almost any danger to security is serious.congress did not announce a clear intent that the danger to security be serious because such a modifier likely would be redundant.as we understand their argument,petitioners in effect ask us to hold that congress clearly intended that the national security exception only apply to individuals who pose a severely serious danger to our nation.we can not grant such a request,as it would be illogical for us to hold that congress clearly intended for an alien to be if he poses only a moderate danger to national security.
congress was obviously silent as to any modifier for danger.thus we proceed to step two in our chevron analysis.see chevron,at.directing reviewing court to pass to step two if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue.accordingly,the only remaining question in these petitions for review is whether the attorney general interpreted the national security exception reasonably in concluding that it applied to any nontrivial level of danger or nontrivial degree of risk to security.see,at.like a seriousness requirement,the modifier likely is redundant in this context,the attorney general was not unreasonable,even if this turns out to reflect an excess of caution,to ensure that immigration judges do not consider trivial dangers in applying the national security exception.accordingly,we defer to the attorney general interpretation.
conclusion 
per the principles of chevron,we defer to most of the attorney general interpretation of the national security exception to mandatory withholding of removal.we defer to his interpretation of the reasonableness and danger requirements in that exception.however,his interpretation conflicts with the intent of congress by altering the requirement that an alien is a danger to national security to one where an alien may pose a danger to national security.because we can not discern from the record whether the results in petitioners cases were affected by this misinterpretation,we remand for application of the correct legal standard.
this provision was added to the ina by the refugee act of,stat.see ins,d.it is sometimes referred to as mandatory implementing the ina and the united nations convention against torture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment cat also provide for withholding of removal.see c.like withholding of removal under the ina,withholding of removal under the cat is unavailable to an alien to whom the national security exception applies.d.because the question before us is the applicability of that exception,we need not distinguish here between withholding of removal under the cat and the ina.instead,we simply refer to that relief under either the ina or the cat as withholding of removal.
the current national security exception includes the phrase reasonable grounds to believe,which differs from the phrase reasonable grounds for regarding that was at issue in in re.see at referring to former section h d of the act.the bia treated these two formulations as identical for the purposes of these cases.no party argues that the formulations differ in a substantive way and we see no reason to treat them differently.see also infra section discussing comparable language in the united states international obligations toward refugees.
yusupov case was heard by the immigration judge ij walter durling.samadov case was heard by ij grace ij denied the respective asylum applications but granted deferral of removal defined below.judge durling and judge sease differed in their holdings regarding the national security exception.judge durling held that yusupov was entitled to mandatory withholding of removal.judge sease held that samadov was barred from withholding of removal by the national security exception.
the more limited remedy of deferral of removal under the cat is unaffected by the national security exception.a.an alien is entitled to deferral of removal if he is more likely than not to be tortured in the country of removal.id.deferral of removal will end upon a change in country conditions that makes it no longer more likely than not that the petitioner would be tortured in the country of removal.id.d.the attorney general also may terminate deferral of removal upon receipt of diplomatic assurances,forwarded by the secretary of state,that the alien would not be tortured upon removal.id.f.for a history of the united states adoption of the cat,see att y,cir.
see infra section discussing probable cause standard.
the statute specifies four enumerated exceptions,preceded by an additional exception in its paragraph.the full text for the exceptions reads as follows restriction on removal to a country where alien life or freedom would be threatened a in generalnotwithstanding paragraphs and governing countries to which aliens ordered removed may be deported,the attorney general may not remove an alien to a country if the attorney general decides that the alien life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion.b exceptionsubparagraph a does not apply to an alien deportable under section a d of this title stating that any alien who p articipated in nazi persecution,genocide,or the commission of any act of torture or extrajudicial killing is deportable or if the attorney general decides that i the alien ordered,incited,assisted,or otherwise participated in the persecution of an individual because of the individual race,religion,nationality,membership in a particular social group,or political opinion ii the alien,having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime,is a danger to the community of the united states iii there are serious reasons to believe that the alien committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the united states before the alien arrived in the united states or iv there are reasonable grounds to believe that the alien is a danger to the security of the united purposes of clause ii,an alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony or felonies for which the alien has been sentenced to an aggregate term of imprisonment of at least years shall be considered to have committed a particularly serious crime.the previous sentence shall not preclude the attorney general from determining that,notwithstanding the length of sentence imposed,an alien has been convicted of a particularly serious crime.for purposes of clause iv,an alien who is described in section a b of this title governing terrorist activities shall be considered to be an alien with respect to whom there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of the united b,b emphases added.
as petitioners acknowledge,jihad is commonly understood to mean holy war.however,they have presented evidence that it can have alternative meanings,including from an inward spiritual struggle to attain perfect faith to an outward material struggle to promote justice and the islamic social system.brief of samadov citing encyclopedia of politics and religion robert wuthnow.the weight,if any,that this evidence deserves and its relevance to petitioners cases are questions for remand.
samadov testified at the ij hearing that when fbi agents came to his house in june they informed him that the uzbek government had sent an earlier notice of criminal charges.
the request specified that the criminal charges were brought under article of the uzbek criminal code for alleged participation in forbidden organizations.in response to the ij request,the state department wrote a letter explaining that the uzbek government has used its criminal code against political opponents for activities.in addition,samadov testified that one of the four or five boarders who had stayed with yusupov and him in person whose surname was also a follower of imam nazarov.samadov stated that oripjanov was arrested and tortured when he returned to uzbekistan,and that he was forced to sign false accusations against samadov,his other roommates,and other independent muslims.samadov claimed that oripjanov initially offered to testify on samadov behalf but subsequently withdrew that offer.
zakirov was granted withholding of removal from the united states in.see in re zakirov,no.a,at bia,finding a lack of persuasive evidence that the respondent is a militant,terrorist,or an extremist and a clear probability of persecution and torture upon zakirov return to uzbekistan.when asked at oral argument about zakirov whereabouts,given dhs special agent mark olexa testimony that zakirov fled to canada,samadov counsel stated that he had not fled to canada but instead went to canada openly.
in doing so,the board employed the attorney general interpretation of the national security exception the reasonable grounds standard is satisfied if there is information tha
