we are called upon to decide whether an alien may be removed from the united states for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude as determined under federal immigration law.
petitioner armando,a native and citizen of mexico,entered the united states without inspection near nogales,arizona,sometime in.in,he was convicted of felony theft in violation of arizona revised statutes section,and was sentenced to two months imprisonment.years later,campos was pulled over while driving in maricopa county,arizona,and charged with aggravated driving under the influence dui,in violation of arizona revised statutes section a under that statute,a person is guilty of an aggravated dui if he driv es or takes actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs and while the person driver license or privilege to drive is suspended,canceled,revoked or refused or while a restriction is placed on the person driver license or privilege to drive as a result of a prior conviction.id 
in,campos pled guilty to committing such offense and,in so doing,admitted that he was driving on the day in question,that his blood alcohol content upon arrest was,and that he did not have a valid driver license at the time.campos was sentenced to four months in prison and three years probation as a result of this conviction.
the immigration and naturalization service ins subsequently placed campos in removal proceedings,but he successfully petitioned for a waiver of inadmissibility and an adjustment of status to that of a lawful permanent resident,which he received in.one year later,campos pled guilty to violating arizona aggravated dui statute for a second time,after he was again pulled over in maricopa county for running a red light while intoxicated.at campos plea hearing,he admitted that he ran the red light,that his blood alcohol content upon arrest was,and that he knew at the time he was driving that his license had been suspended or revoked.campos was sentenced to two and a half years in prison as a result of this second offense.
after his second aggravated dui conviction,the department of homeland security dhs,the successor to the ins reinstituted removal proceedings against campos,charging that he was removable under the immigration and naturalization act ina as an alien convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude within ten years of admission,see a a i,and as an alien convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude,not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct,see id.a a ii.
campos filed a motion to terminate the proceedings,arguing that his aggravated dui convictions were not crimes of moral turpitude.an immigration judge ij held otherwise and ordered him removed to mexico 
the board of immigration appeals bia or the board affirmed the ij decision in an unpublished order signed by a single member of the board.that order relied on the bia en banc precedent,in re,which held that a violation of arizona aggravated dui statute is a crime involving moral turpitude.in ashcroft,cir,we considered and rejected the board interpretation of the arizona statute.although we did not opine on the board conclusion that the act of driving under the influence with a suspended or otherwise restricted driver license is a crime involving moral turpitude,we held that the board misinterpreted arizona aggravated dui statute by failing to acknowledge that it prohibits more than that act alone.id.at.as we explained,section a can be violated by driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs with a suspended or otherwise restricted driver license,or by maintaining actual physical control of a vehicle under the same conditions.id.when a criminal statute has multiple independent prongs,the board must determine whether any conduct violative of the statute meets the relevant definition of a deportable offense under the ina.id.at.by failing to assess arizona aggravated dui statute as such,we held that the board committed an error of law and we expressed our doubt that it intended to categorize the second act as a crime of equal severity as the first.id.at.still,we did not foreclose the possibility that a conviction under section a could qualify as a crime of moral turpitude if the record of conviction demonstrated that the offender had been driving at the time of the arrest.
acknowledging,the ij and the bia in this case looked beyond the statute to the record of campos conviction and determined that the transcripts of his and plea hearings sufficiently established that both offenses for which he was convicted involved driving while intoxicated.relying on,the bia concluded that such convictions were crimes involving moral turpitude 
campos timely filed a petition for review.a divided panel of our court denied the petition,upholding the board determination that a violation of arizona aggravated dui statute that involves actual driving is a crime involving moral turpitude.gonzales,cir,reh g en banc granted,cir.we now consider this question en banc.
we have no jurisdiction to review a final order removing an alien on account of a conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude.a c.nevertheless,we have jurisdiction to review the board determination that campos convictions are,in fact,crimes involving moral turpitude as the ina defines that term.see ye ins,cir.
before examining the board decision,we must determine the standard of our review,an issue which has been squarely raised in this case.the bia ultimate determination that a petitioner such as campos has committed a crime involving moral turpitude requires two separate inquiries.first,the bia must determine what offense the petitioner has been convicted of committing.this requires the agency to interpret the statute under which the petitioner was convicted and,in certain cases,to examine the record of conviction see infra at.second,once the board has identified the petitioner offense,it must determine whether such conduct is a crime involving moral turpitude as defined in the applicable section of the ina.this requires the board to apply the definition of the term moral turpitude and to determine whether the petitioner conduct meets such definition.
it is well established that we give no deference to the bia answer to the first question.the bia has no special expertise by virtue of its statutory responsibilities in construing state or federal criminal statutes and,thus,has no special administrative competence to interpret the petitioner statute of conviction.as a consequence,we review the bia finding regarding the specific act for which the petitioner was convicted de novo.see gonzales,cir goldeshtein ins,cir.
the board answer to the second question requires a different standard of review.our precedents,however,have not always been consistent.at times,we have suggested that the bia determination that a specific act is a crime of moral turpitude is a finding entitled to deference,although we have not prescribed the precise nature of such deference.see cerezo mukasey,cir,at.at other times,we have reviewed the determination de novo.see,gonzales,cir,at notash gonzales,cir and in still other cases,we have suggested that while our review might be deferential in theory,it is de novo in fact.see mukasey,cir.in light of this uncertainty,we set forth the following principles.
when the board considers whether a certain crime involves moral turpitude,it must interpret that term through a process of adjudication when reviewing an agency interpretation of its governing statute,we follow the framework famously set forth in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.initially,we determine whether the intent of congress is clear.id.at.if it is,both the court and the agency must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if the statute is silent or ambiguous,however,we may not supply the interpretation of the statute we think best as we would without an agency pronouncement,but must limit ourselves to asking whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
not every agency interpretation of its governing statute is entitled to chevron deference,however.in united states mead,d,the supreme court emphasized that chevron only applies when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and when the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.id.at.in other words,before we apply chevron,we must conclude that congress delegated authority to the agency to interpret the statute in question and that the agency decision under review was made with a lawmaking pretense.id.at.
the board interpretations of the ina made in the course of adjudicating cases before it satisfy the first requirement for chevron deference set forth in mead the board,through the attorney general delegation,is authorized to promulgate rules carrying the force of law through a process of adjudication and,thus,should be accorded chevron deference as it exercises such authority to give ambiguous statutory terms concrete meaning.ins,d quoting ins,d.
whether the board interpretations of the ina satisfy mead second requirement depends on the form the board decision takes.our cases applying mead treat the precedential value of an agency action as the essential factor in determining whether chevron deference is appropriate.alvarado gonzales,cir collecting cases.thus,we have held that the board precedential orders,which bind third parties,qualify for chevron deference because they are made with a lawmaking pretense.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we have not accorded chevron deference to the board unpublished decisions,however,because they do not bind future parties.see gonzales,cir 
nevertheless,skidmore deference remains intact and applicable when an agency with rulemaking power interprets its governing statute without invoking such authority.mead,at.discussing skidmore swift.under skidmore,the measure of deference afforded to the agency varies depend ing upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.at.recognizing that the bia interpretations of the ina are entitled to at least this much respect,we have applied skidmore when reviewing its unpublished orders.see,mukasey,cir mukasey,cir gonzales,cir,at.
in light of these principles,we consider the extent to which the bia interpretations of the term moral turpitude are entitled to our deference.
the meaning of the term falls well short of clarity.indeed,as has been noted before,moral turpitude is perhaps the quintessential example of an ambiguous phrase.see gonzales,cir in a series of published decisions,the bia has set forth its general understanding that a crime involving moral turpitude involves conduct that shocks the public conscience as being inherently base,vile,or depraved,contrary to the rules of morality and the duties owed between man and man,either one fellow man or society in general.in re,see also in re danesh,same.in a welcome effort to establish a uniform framework for the determination of crimes involving moral turpitude,the attorney general has recently decreed that a finding of moral turpitude requires that a perpetrator have committed a reprehensible act with some form of scienter.in re.
despite the principles set forth above,we have been hesitant to defer to such general statements by the board,and we are not alone in this view.as the seventh circuit has explained,the board general understanding of the term moral turpitude is not the result of any insights that it might have obtained from adjudicating immigration cases,mei ashcroft,cir,but simply a recitation of the definition found in the criminal law,see,benitez dunevant,in re craig,cal d,in re farina.thus,as we have stated before,because the board general definition of moral turpitude fails to particularize the term in any meaningful way,giving chevron deference has no practical significance,at quoting mei,at.
consequently,without more specific guidance from the board,we have relied on our own generalized definition of moral turpitude,see carty ashcroft,cir explaining that we have traditionally divided crimes involving moral turpitude into two basic types those involving fraud and those involving grave acts of baseness or depravity.see also gonzales,cir en banc reinhardt,concurring for the majority same,although we have noted that our understanding does not differ materially from the board,at.
orders issued by the bia contain more than an abstract definition of moral turpitude,however.when the board adjudicates a case,it must determine whether a petitioner offense,once established,meets the definition of such term.in so doing,it assesses the character,gravity,and moral significance of the conduct,drawing upon its expertise as the single body charged with adjudicating all federal immigration cases.this is precisely the type of agency action the supreme court instructs is entitled to chevron deference.see,at.indeed,we accord chevron deference to the bia construction of other ambiguous terms in the ina promulgated through its precedential decisions.see,gonzales,cir particularly serious crime ins,cir conviction fisher ins,cir en banc persecution.similarly,we accord skidmore deference to the board nonprecedential decisions interpreting its governing statute.see supra at collecting cases.we see no reason to exempt the board treatment of moral turpitude from these rules.
with this backdrop in mind,we now consider the proper standard of review in this case.the board affirmed the ij order of removal,holding that campos and aggravated dui convictions were crimes involving moral turpitude under the ina,a a i,ii.as previously explained,supra at,we review de novo the board interpretation of the arizona statute under which campos was convicted.if we uphold such interpretation,we must consider the extent to which we will defer to the board decision that the conduct it found the arizona statute to under the influence with a suspended or otherwise restricted a crime of moral turpitude.
the bia dismissed campos appeal in an unpublished order.that order,however,relied upon,a precedential decision addressing the dispositive question of statutory interpretation at issue in this case.as the supreme court has suggested,we conclude that where,as here,the board determines that certain conduct is morally turpitudinous in a precedential decision,we apply chevron deference regardless of whether the order under review is the precedential decision itself or a subsequent unpublished order that relies upon it.see,at.applying chevron deference to a nonprecedential bia order interpreting the phrase serious nonpolitical crime that relied on the interpretation of such phrase in an earlier precedential decision see also mead,at.noting application of chevron deference with approval,at suggesting that chevron deference may be appropriate when the bia relies upon a precedential bia decision addressing the precise question at issue in an unpublished order.
in sum,we conclude that,once the elements of the petitioner offense are established,our review of the bia determination that such offense constitutes a crime of moral turpitude is governed by the same traditional principles of administrative deference we apply to the board interpretation of other ambiguous terms in the ina.we have sometimes suggested otherwise in the past,at declining to defer to the board generalized definition of moral turpitude but failing to assess the board particularized application of that definition to the petitioner case mukasey,cir rejecting the argument that chevron deference should apply to the bia interpretation of the amorphous phrase crime involving moral turpitude even though such interpretation was based on a precedential decision.we now overrule those cases and any others that have impliedly so held.and,in so doing,we join every other court of appeals to have considered the question.see ali mukasey,cir wala mukasey,cir knapik ashcroft,cir yousefi ins,cir hamdan ins,cir franklin ins,cir cabral ins,cir.
with our standard of review established,we examine the bia decision in this case.we begin with the board construction of campos aggravated dui convictions.
to determine whether a specific crime meets the definition of a removable offense listed in the ina,our court applies the categorical and modified categorical approaches set forth in taylor united states,d.see,at.while we first apply the categorical approach,if the statute of conviction is not a categorical match for the generic federal crime because it criminalizes both conduct that does involve moral turpitude and other conduct that does not,we apply a modified categorical approach,at.under that approach,in the past,we have seen fit to look beyond the language of the statute to a narrow,specified set of documents that are part of the record of conviction,including the indictment,the judgment of conviction,jury instructions,a signed guilty plea,or the transcript from the plea proceedings.id.at quoting tokatly ashcroft,cir.if these documents establish that the jury found,or the petitioner pled guilty to,elements of a crime involving moral turpitude,he is properly removable,at 
arizona aggravated dui statute contains four elements.the first three elements are immediately apparent a person must driv e or maintain actual physical control over a vehicle,while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs,while his or her license or privilege to drive is suspended,canceled,revoked,or refused or while a restriction is placed upon the person driver license as a result of a prior offense.a see supra.as for the fourth element,arizona courts have held that to sustain a conviction,the text of the statute requires the state to prove that the offender drove with a suspended or otherwise revoked license,and that he knew or should have known of the suspension or revocation.see state cramer,to support the conviction for aggravated dui,the state is required to prove the defendant drove a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol while his license was revoked and that he knew or should have known of the revocation.emphasis added state superior court,same state agee,same see also state williams,same.should have known is a negligence standard.see state hyde.the bia has held that mere negligence can not support a finding of moral turpitude.see,at.
in,the bia concluded that a violation of section a was categorically a crime involving moral turpitude.at.as noted,we rejected that conclusion in because the board failed to acknowledge that section a independently prohibits both driving and physically controlling a vehicle while under the influence and with a suspended or otherwise restricted license,at.still,we did not consider whether a violation of section a could qualify as a crime involving moral turpitude if the petitioner had actually been driving at the time of the arrest.
acknowledging,the board in the case before us examined the transcript of campos and plea hearings and concluded that his testimony in both proceedings plainly demonstrated that both convictions arose out of incidents in which he was actually driving.the board reliance on the plea transcripts was an appropriate application of the modified categorical approach.see tokatly,at.moreover,they adequately show that campos admitted to driving on both occasions.accordingly,we agree with the board that the and aggravated dui convictions both involved actual driving 
the board then relied on its precedent in to conclude that such conduct is a crime involving moral turpitude.thus,the board decision in this case must stand if is based on a permissible construction of the ina.
the bia has never held that a simple dui offense is a crime involving moral turpitude,a fact it attributes to a long historical acceptance,at.although the dangers of drunk driving are well established,the board unwillingness to classify it as a crime of moral turpitude is,perhaps,not surprising because statutes that prohibit driving under the influence typically do not require intent,but rather are,or are most nearly comparable to,crimes that impose strict liability.begay united states,d id.at t he conduct for which the drunk driver is convicted driving under the influence need not be purposeful or deliberate.see leocal ashcroft,d stating that a dui offense involves accidental or negligent conduct 
yet the board treats arizona prohibition on aggravated dui differently because it contains an additional aggravating element the offender knowledge,at the time of the dui,that the state has denied him the privilege to drive under any circumstances.see,at citing arizona caselaw interpreting section a as containing a knowledge requirement see supra at collecting such arizona cases.thus,the board reasoned that aside from the culpability that is often,but not inherently,present in a simple dui offense,an individual who commits an aggravated dui does so knowing that he or she is absolutely prohibited from driving and,in so doing,commits a morally turpitudinous offense,at emphasis added,at noting that a scienter element is a hallmark of a crime involving moral turpitude danesh,i at explaining that knowing violation of the law exhibits a deliberate disregard for the law,which we consider to be a violation of the accepted rules of morality and the duties owed to society.
campos and the dissent argue that the board decision in his case can not stand because conflicts with other bia precedents and,thus,is not based on a permissible construction of the ina.they are correct that u nexplained inconsistency in an agency interpretation of its governing statute can be a reason for holding an interpretation to be an arbitrary and capricious change from agency practice.cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d dissent at.nevertheless,we are mindful that such inconsistency provides a basis for rejecting an agency interpretation only in rare instances,such as when an agency provides no explanation at all for a change in policy,or when its explanation is so unclear or contradictory that we are left in doubt as to the reason for the change in direction.gonzales,cir en banc see also lands council martin,cir applying to hold that the forrest service provided a rational explanation for its change in policy that did not leave the court in doubt as to the reason for the change in direction internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
campos argument is twofold.first,he argues that can not be harmonized with a subsequent bia decision,in re,and that,as a result,the board erred in relying on in his case.in,the board held that an alien who had violated arizona recidivist dui statute,which punishes those who commit a dui after already having three or more simple dui convictions,had not committed a crime involving moral turpitude at.campos contends that if committing three separate duis is not morally turpitudinous,driving under the influence with a suspended or otherwise restricted license can not be said to be more offensive conduct.
yet the en banc panel of the board in acknowledged and reasoned that its holding did not conflict with that precedent.according to,t he aggravating factor rendering the dui conviction a crime involving moral turpitude in was the culpable mental state needed for a conviction under section a the showing that the defendant knew,at the time that he was driving while under the influence of alcohol,that his driver license had been suspended and that he was not permitted to drive.at emphasis added.the aggravating factor in a recidivist dui conviction,however,is the fact that the offender has been convicted of simple dui offenses before.in the board view,recidivist dui is based on an aggregation of simple dui convictions and,since no single simple dui is a crime of moral turpitude,a collection of duis,no matter how many,can never qualify as such.id.at.
the board in offered a rational distinction between recidivist dui and aggravated dui offenses.thus,we can not accept campos argument that the board should not have applied interpretation of the aggravated dui statute at issue in this case.to reject the board distinction as arbitrary and capricious would be to reject its use of the knowledge element in the aggravated dui statute as a permissible ground for treating an aggravated dui differently from a recidivist dui offense.again,the attorney general has declared the presence of scienter to be an essential element of a crime involving moral turpitude.see,at.such a distinction consistently has been critical to the bia determination of whether violation of a statute constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude.see,at where knowing or intentional conduct is an element of an offense,we have found moral turpitude to be present.danesh,at transforming assault into a crime involving moral turpitude because the statute required the offender to know that the person assaulted is a peace officer in re mcnaughton,stating that whenever a crime has involved intent to defraud,it has been found to involve moral turpitude in re,stating that moral turpitude normally inheres in the intent in re p,same in re r,stating the rule that unless the statute under consideration requires knowledge on the part of the receiver that the goods were obtained unlawfully the offense defined does not necessarily involve moral turpitude in re m,holding that an offense involving a breaking and entering may be deemed to involve moral turpitude only if it is accompanied by the intent to commit a morally turpitudinous act after entry in re g,same.while we recognize that campos knowledge that he was driving without a license does not exactly add a knowing or intentional element to dui because the intent involved is different,we can not conclude that the board acted irrationally in using intent as a ground to draw a distinction between recidivist dui and aggravated dui.
the dissent criticizes our deference to the bia conclusion that the presence or absence of a mens rea element in the statute of conviction can be essential to a determination of whether a crime involves moral turpitude.the real question,the dissent asserts,is what is a sufficiently culpable mental state dissent at.this stands in stark contrast to the attorney general determination that some form of scienter is all that is required in order to conclude that a crime involves moral turpitude,at emphasis added.indeed,the dissent asks us to apply a heightened standard of review,a standard of review far beyond the deferential approach mandated by chevron.because the statutory text is devoid of any provision which requires a particular level of scienter,we must defer to the agency adjudication of the matter so long as its construction of the statute is permissible.see,at.as the dissent itself admits,the bia has not seen fit to create a categorical level of scienter for all crimes involving moral turpitude nor is it required to.here,after assessing the statutory definition and the nature of the crime,mcnaughton ins,cir,the bia concluded that given the mens rea involved,the crime was one of moral turpitude.
to the extent such a conclusion conflicts with prior bia precedent,this is not one of those rare instances where we should withhold deference,at see also lands council,at.the agency has not failed to provide an explanation for its action.to the contrary,the bia explicitly pointed to the significance of the mens rea element,a significance only confirmed by.see,at see also,at at.such explanation is not irrational,and it certainly does not leave us in doubt as to the reason for the change in direction,at see also lands council,at.the dissent would have us be persuaded by the reason for the change.our precedent does not require so much.
second,campos,along with the dissent,argues that the board decision in can not be reconciled with its prior holding in in re short.in that case,the board held that the federal offense assault with intent to commit any felony could not be categorized as a crime involving moral turpitude without first considering whether the underlying felony was itself such an offense.id.at discussing b repealed.the board reasoned that because simple assault is not a crime involving moral turpitude,if the felony intended as a result of that assault also does not involve moral turpitude,then the two crimes combined do not involve moral turpitude.id.the board then stated that m oral turpitude can not be viewed to arise from some undefined synergism by which two offenses are combined to create a crime involving moral turpitude,where each crime individually does not involve moral turpitude.id.
campos and the dissent contend that this latter statement from the board opinion in short governs this case.because the board has never held that simple dui or driving with a suspended license,standing alone,are crimes of moral turpitude,they argue that committing both offenses at the same time is not a crime involving moral turpitude either.yet the en banc panel in considered the same argument and rejected it.as the bia explained,
w e did not hold in short that a combination of acts that are included as elements of a specific offense could never,when added together,build to such a heightened deviance from accepted moral standards as to reach a level of conduct deemed morally turpitudinous.in fact,additional aggravating elements can often transform an offense that otherwise would not be a crime involving moral turpitude into one that is.
at emphasis added.in other words,the board construed short as prohibiting a finding of moral turpitude based on the amalgamation of offenses in that case simple assault with intent to commit a felony of unproven seriousness,but held that short did not prohibit a finding of moral turpitude based on any combination of acts proscribed by a single criminal statute that might arise in a future case.
we conclude that the board provided a reasoned explanation for its resolution of any tension between its holdings in and short.see brand x,at.moreover,the board rejection of the rule campos seeks is not irrational.it is possible that two separate acts may not be turpitudinous standing alone,but that their commission in tandem rises to the level of an offense so contrary to accepted societal standards as to result in a crime involving moral turpitude 
the board en banc decision in was accompanied by a dissent that would have held that aggravated dui is not a crime involving moral turpitude.our decision today is likewise accompanied by a vigorous dissent.the existence of such dissents indicates that the question of whether the offense at issue rises to the level of a crime involving moral turpitude is one upon which reasonable minds can differ.yet congress left the choice between reasonable interpretations of the ina to the attorney general and,by his delegation,to the bia,and desired that body rather than the courts to possess whatever degree of discretion the ambiguity allows.brand x,at.quoting smiley citibank,d.we are satisfied that the board offenses committed with the knowledge that one driver license has been suspended or otherwise restricted are crimes involving moral a reasonable interpretation of the ina.the deferential standard that governs our review requires no more.
accordingly,campos petition for review is 
i agree with the majority that the bia is entitled to chevron deference when it issues a precedential decision holding that particular conduct is morally turpitudinous and when it subsequently issues an unpublished order relying upon that precedential decision.as the majority notes,today decision clarifies an area of confusion in our case law and harmonizes our approach with that of other circuits who have considered this issue.i am therefore pleased to join parts i and ii of the court opinion.
i dissent,however,from part iii of the court opinion and from its judgment.as judge berzon convincingly demonstrates in her opinion,the bia decision in in re,can not be plausibly reconciled with bia precedent.the bia has already determined that even a third recidivist conviction for drunk driving does not constitute a crime involving moral turpitude cimt,see matter of,and the agency has categorically stated that m oral turpitude can not be viewed to arise from some undefined synergism by which two offenses are combined to create a crime involving moral turpitude.matter of short.in light of these well as the bia consistently expressed view that regulatory offenses do not involve moral bia conclusion that driving under the influence without a valid driver license constitutes a cimt can not be deemed reasonable.
of course,an agency is not prohibited from reconsidering the wisdom of past decisions in light of changed circumstances and past experience.thus,i might well have viewed this case differently if the bia had issued a opinion formally overruling either,short,or both.however,here the bia did not take the opportunity to overrule or formally limit its past decisions.instead,the agency supported its moral turpitude finding by baldly stating that a person who drives while under the influence,knowing that he or she is absolutely prohibited from driving,has committed a cimt,at.the agency attempted to distinguish short by noting that short involved only the question whether simple assault with intent to commit a felony constituted a cimt,but the bia did not even attempt to explain how its decision in was consistent with the language in short,quoted above,which broadly precludes the bia from doing exactly what it did two offenses to create a cimt.id.an agency has an obligation of consistent dealing and we can not,even under chevron,affirm an agency decision that offers nothing more than a conclusory and disingenuous attempt to distinguish past decisions that clearly mandate a result contrary to the one the agency has reached.
i thus respectfully dissent from the court judgment.
i agree with the majority that chevron,natural resources defense council,d,is the correct framework within which to evaluate whether deference is due to the bia holding,in a precedential decision,that a conviction under arizona revised statutes a constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude cimt for purposes of a a ii.i agree,further,that when such a precedential holding directly controls the outcome in a subsequent,case,we evaluate that holding under the chevron framework as well 
i disagree,however,with the majority conclusion in part iii of its opinion that,under chevron,deference is in fact merited in this case.although the bia precedential decision in matter of,directly controls case,is the epitome of an unreasonable agency interpretation,to which we need not defer under chevron.
as the majority explains,chevron,at what has come to be known as step two,instructs us to defer to an agency interpretation of ambiguous statutory language so long as that interpretation is a reasonable policy choice for the agency to make.chevron,at.i can imagine few starker examples of unreasonable agency action than,the precedential decision dispositive in this case.drunk driving is not,by itself,a cimt nor is driving on a suspended license nor is a second or third drunk driving conviction.yet under,drunk driving only once,while on a suspended license,is a cimt.this holding is utterly illogical.and beyond defying common sense,makes no attempt to square its holding with prior bia case law forbidding such undefined synergism s of individually nonturpitudinous offenses.matter of short.i fail to see how we can grant chevron deference to this latest interpretive whim of an agency that continually refuses to state a coherent definition of,or follow a coherent approach to,the vague cimt statutory term it is charged with applying.i therefore respectfully dissent.
unreasonable interpretations under chevron 
i begin with some observations concerning the degree of consistent we demand of an agency before deferring under chevron to that agency interpretation of its governing statute.
i recognize,first,that an agency interpretation of an ambiguous statutory term can merit deference even if the agency has from time to time changed its interpretation of the term.chevron,at.so,when an agency articulates an interpretation of its governing statute in the type of decision for which chevron deference is otherwise appropriate,see united states mead,d,that interpretation is not instantly carved in stone.on the contrary,the agency,to engage in informed rulemaking,must consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis.chevron,at.we assume that by leaving gaps in a statute,congress intended to give the agency charged with filling those gaps the flexibility to adapt its reading in light of changing circumstances and policy priorities,and we apply the chevron framework with this flexibility in mind.id.at.
at the same time,agencies are not free,under chevron,to generate erratic,irreconcilable interpretations of their governing statutes and then seek judicial deference.consistency over time and across subjects is a relevant factor at chevron step two,when deciding whether the agency current interpretation is reasonable.see ins,d observing that the court would not need to defer to the ins interpretation of the term fear at chevron step two because a n agency interpretation of a relevant provision which conflicts with the agency earlier interpretation is entitled to considerably less deference than a consistently held agency view.internal quotation marks omitted 
moreover,when an agency does change its mind,it must provide an adequately reasoned explanation for the change.sudden and unexplained change,or change that does not take account of legitimate reliance on prior interpretation,may be arbitrary,capricious or an abuse of discretion,and therefore unworthy of deference.smiley citibank,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also brand x,at.t he commission is free within the limits of reasoned interpretation to change course if it adequately justifies the change.rust sullivan,d deferring to the secretary of health and human services interpretation,because the secretary amply justified his change of interpretation with a reasoned analysis.to satisfy this requirement,the agency must provide not only a reasoned explanation for its current position,but also a reasoned explanation for why the change was warranted or why the new position is preferable.
this last check on agency discretion is particularly important when an agency interprets its governing statute,as the bia does,primarily through adjudication.the flexibility chevron accords is meant to give agencies room to inform themselves and re consider the wisdom of their policies,at.to allow them to proceed entirely ad hoc,capriciously deciding individual cases without any concern for generating a coherent body of interpretation and without pursuing a set of articulable and reconcilable policy goals.that is why,when agencies depart from their prior interpretations,they must offer a reasoned explanation for doing so.this requirement is rooted not only in the apa prohibition on arbitrary and capricious action,but in the rule of law itself,for unreasoned decisionmaking prevent s both consistent application of the rule by subordinate agency personnel and effective review of the rule by the courts.allentown mack sales,nlrb,d.see also cbs fcc,without such a requirement as reasoned decisionmaking,effective judicial review would be impractical if not impossible,and administrative litigants and the public generally would be set adrift on a potential sea of unconscious preference and irrelevant prejudice.
as an unreasonable agency interpretation 
viewed against these bedrock principles,the bia ruling merits no deference from this court.
overall,the bia precedential case law regarding the meaning of the phrase crime involving moral turpitude cimt is a mess of conflicting authority.to the degree that one is able to extract strands of relative coherence from that disarray,however,is inconsistent with those strands in two important respects.first,mere knowledge is not a sufficiently culpable mental state to transform a regulatory offense,such as driving without a license or simple driving under the influence dui,into a cimt.as discussed in section,below,when the offense in question is a nonfraud offense,the bia generally requires some variant of evil intent to establish turpitude.when the offense is a mere regulatory offense,however,unrelated to a fraud or sex offense,the bia will not consider it a cimt regardless of what mental state the underlying statute specifies as a requirement for conviction.breaks with this principle by holding that the knew or should have known standard associated with a is a sufficiently evil mens rea to transform that regulatory offense into a cimt.
second,as discussed in section,the bia case law indicates that if two offenses are not in themselves morally turpitudinous,they can not be synergis tically combined to create a cimt.matter of short.by combining two to create a cimt,is inconsistent with this strand of the agency case law as well.
as to neither deviation does provide an adequately reasoned justification.in a context in which the agency has ventured precious few attempts at enunciating any generally applicable principles,deviation from the few principles that do exist is of special significance in undermining any semblance of reasoned decisionmaking.cbs,at noting that,for due process and public reliance reasons,judicial vigilance to enforce the rule of law in the administrative process is particularly crucial where,as here,the area under consideration is in a constant state of flux.
knowledge or negligence as a cimt mental state 
the relevance of intent in the bia case law 
as the majority observes,the bia has never offered a comprehensive definition of the term crime involving moral turpitude to which we could defer under chevron.slip op.at quoting gonzales,cir.although the attorney general recently took a small step toward establishing a general definition in matter of,by opining that a cimt must involve both reprehensible conduct and some degree of scienter,id.at,the majority rightly treats this definition as ineligible for chevron deference,because it is too vague to be a meaningful clarification of the notoriously ambiguous statutory term.slip op.at 
in the absence of a meaningful definition of crimes involving moral turpitude generally,the chevron framework is applicable only to the bia holdings in individual cases that particular offenses are,or are not,cimts.for example,the bia has held fraud,murder,rape,robbery,kidna p ping,voluntary manslaughter,some involuntary manslaughter offenses,certain aggravated assaults,mayhem,theft offenses,spousal abuse,child abuse,and incest to be cimts,at citing no cases see also matter of sanudo,assault and battery involving the intentional infliction of serious bodily injury on another matter of logan,assault with a deadly weapon matter of leyva,i,burglary with intent to commit theft matter of beato,rape matter of y,incest.conversely,the bia has held that most assaults and batteries,alien smuggling offenses,indecency offenses,and rioting offenses are not cimts.see matter of s,assault and battery matter of tiwari,alien smuggling matter of mueller,indecency matter of o,rioting.
despite this relative consistency in outcome,it is hard to say that any articulable principle distinguishes the offenses that are cimts from those that are not.instead,the bia has issued precedential decisions making seemingly definitive pronouncements on both sides of possible lines of demarcation.
for example,the bia has described the term crime involving moral turpitude as a classification aimed primarily at serious and dangerous crimes.matter of e.yet,it has also cautioned that n either the seriousness of a criminal offense nor the severity of the sentence imposed therefor is determinative of whether a crime involves moral turpitude.matter of tran,see also,at matter of serna.
similarly,the bia has declared that the definition of a cimt is an act which is per se morally reprehensible and intrinsically wrong,or malum in se,so it is the nature of the act itself and not the statutory prohibition of it which renders a crime one of moral turpitude.matter of fualaau,quoting matter of franklin.yet,the bia has designated offenses ranging from the knowing possession of child pornography to the sale of a number of packages of oleomargarine labeled as butter,in violation of the food,drug,and cosmetic act and with intent to defraud,as morally reprehensible conduct without specifying with any clarity what the nature of th ose act s have in common.matter of fualaau,at.
aside from the severity or baseness of the crime at hand,the bia also often looks to the mental state involved when distinguishing between cimts and,with stark inconsistencies across cases.the bia has stated definitively that evil intent is a requisite element for a crime involving moral turpitude,matter of khourn,and indeed that evil or malicious intent is the essence of moral turpitude.matter of flores.yet,the board has also held that the presence or absence of a corrupt or vicious mind is not controlling in determining whether an offense is a cimt,matter of medina,and even that certain strict liability offenses may qualify as cimts.see matter of imber,observing that statutory rape has repeatedly been held to involve moral turpitude,despite the strict liability nature of the crime.in fact,at various times and in various contexts,the bia has held such diverse mental states as evil intent,wil l fulness,recklessness,knowledge,and even forgetfulness to be necessary or sufficient to support a finding of moral turpitude.
the attorney general recent holding in is no improvement on the existing mess.holds that some degree of scienter is required for a cimt.at.yet,the common definition of scienter is nothing more than a degree of knowledge that makes a person legally responsible for the consequences of his or her act or omission.black law dictionary ed.so merely begs the question what degree of knowledge is sufficient to indicate moral turpitude the attorney general suggests that specific intent,deliberateness,willfulness,or recklessness,may be list he later rounds out by adding knew,or reasonably should have known,as well.id.at.of course,reasonably should have known is not a culpable mental state it is an objective standard of negligence,disregarding the defendant actual state of mind.the attorney general concept of some scienter therefore includes just about every possible mental state and even one imputed mental state,without providing any indication of which one would be sufficient in what circumstances.scienter standard is thus wholly vacuous.
takes note of some of the bia previous conflicting holdings about the relevance of intent in distinguishing cimt from offenses,but it does not attempt to synthesize or distinguish those cases.instead,it glibly summarizes the cases by recognizing that while crimes involving moral turpitude often involve an evil intent,such a specific intent is not a prerequisite to finding that a crime involves moral turpitude,at emphases added.this statement is simply an observation of the obvious,not a reasoned explanation of the bia apparent lack of a coherent line of authority.
more than that,the sentence just quoted misleadingly conflates evil intent with specific intent.the bia has generally understood evil intent to mean something more than mere knowledge in some cases,it has specified that evil intent involves a degree of depravity above and beyond the specific intent to violate the law,however,uses the terms evil and specific intent as though they were interchangeable.
having thus further muddied the already opaque waters,then concludes that the knew or should have known standard associated with the portion of the arizona aggravated dui offense renders that entire offense a though knew or should have known is clearly a less demanding standard than either evil or specific intent.specifically,reasons that although simple dui is not a cimt,aggravated dui under a is a cimt because,unlike simple dui,a conviction for aggravated dui requires that at the time of the offense the driver license was suspended,canceled,revoked,refused or restricted due to a prior dui offense.a.the circumstance of having an already suspended or revoked license implies that the driver knows he should not be driving under any circumstances,at.and because any circumstances necessarily includes the circumstance of driving while intoxicated,reasons,aggravated dui is a knowing violation which carries greater moral opprobrium than simple dui alone.id.at.
this logical chain makes little sense.on theory of imputing knowledge,driving without a license under any circumstances,drunk or not,would amount to driving while knowing that one should not be driving.there is thus nothing about the mental state involved in aggravated dui that differentiates it from mere driving on a suspended is not a cimt.nevertheless holds that aggravated dui is a cimt because the aggravated circumstances necessary for a conviction under a establish a culpable mental state adequate to support a finding of moral turpitude,at.in other words,according to the bia,the mental state associated with aggravated dui is sufficient because the mental state associated with aggravated dui is sufficient.
the majority in today case recognizes that intent analysis was mistaken in one respect the intent standard specified in a is divisible,and the should have known arizona courts understand to be a negligence not articulate a sufficiently culpable mental state to establish moral turpitude.see op.at citing state hyde.i agree with the majority on this point.
but the majority considers this error to be harmless,because it believes that,with respect to both campos conviction and his conviction,judicially noticeable documents establish that campos did in fact know he was prohibited from driving and it defers to the bia holding that knowledge,if not negligence,is a sufficiently culpable mental state to constitute moral turpitude.op.at.i can not agree with this conclusion.as i will show,even if we assume that knowledge,as opposed to negligence,has been established by campos conviction,the bia own jurisprudence forecloses the conclusion that mere knowledge could support a finding of moral turpitude in this context.
although provides no discernible reasons of its own for concluding that knowledge is a sufficiently culpable mental state,and despite the principle that we may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency action that the agency itself has not given,nw.envtl.def.ctr.bonneville power,cir internal quotation marks omitted,the majority here strives mightily to invent a justification for the bia holding.it does so by citing a hodgepodge of cimt cases which it claims demonstrate that t he presence or absence of an element in the statute of conviction requiring a culpable mental state consistently has been critical to the bia determination of whether a violation of such statute constitutes a crime involving moral turpitude.op.at.that statement,surely,is true,but only by virtue of being contentless.it the real,what is a sufficiently culpable mental state crucially,none of the cases the majority cites support the precise proposition advanced in that mere knowledge is a sufficiently culpable mental state to convert a regulatory offense into a cimt.see op.at citing cases having reviewed the entire corpus of precedential cimt decisions issued by the bia from to the present,i have found no support for this conclusion.
surveying the bia case law on regulatory offenses 
as this court has consistently explained,cimts can be understood as belonging to two basic types offenses involving fraud,and offenses involving conduct that is both a inherently base,vile,or depraved and b contrary to the accepted private and social duties man owes to his fellow men or to society in general.gonzales,cir en banc pregerson,writing for the majority accord,at cir carty ashcroft,cir.the bia has never rejected this understanding,see,at,and it has adopted typology in recent decisions.
the bia looks for different levels of mens rea when considering whether offenses in these two categories are cimts.for fraud offenses,the mens rea required to establish moral turpitude is more than mere knowledge of the acts committed it is the specific intent to defraud for offenses involving base,vile,or depraved group which may be further broken down into the subcategories of violent crimes,theft offenses and other crimes against property,sex offenses,drug offenses,and certain offenses against the bia appears to require a prescribed degree of intent that varies depending upon which subcategory is at issue.as noted above,today majority relies on language it finds in a smattering of fraud,theft,and violent crime cases to find holding reasonable.see supra,note.in doing so,the majority either misunderstands or ignores the fact that the bia does not follow a single,generally applicable rule as to intent across all subcategories of offenses.indeed,one could find support for any proposition if one search pool includes all of the bia precedential cimt opinions over the last seven decades.the better approach,consequently,is to consider what kind of mental state the bia has required in cases involving the same type of offenses.
does not assert that the arizona aggravated dui statute involves a fraud offense rather,it views aggravated dui as belonging to the second,category of offenses describes.it holds 
we find that a person who drives while under the influence,knowing that he or she is absolutely prohibited from driving,commits a crime so base and so contrary to the currently accepted duties that persons owe to one another and to society in general that it involves moral turpitude.
at emphases added.this description clearly puts aggravated dui in the category,which encompasses offenses involving base,vile,or depraved conduct in violation of social duties.see,at.
generally speaking,offenses in the base,vile or depraved category will constitute cimts only if the bia finds that they either inherently involve or specifically require a showing of evil intent.what constitutes evil intent,in turn,is.
looking in this light at the crime for which campos was convicted,it is apparent that it involves two component unlawful acts simple dui,and driving on a suspended license.simple dui,as acknowledges,is indisputably a regulatory offense,at accord matter of,en banc,and so lacks any evil intent element.driving without a valid license,too,can only be described as a regulatory offense,for it involves the lack of permission to do something that would otherwise be permissible my review of the bia precedential case law over the past seven decades shows that the bia consistently declines to characterize purely regulatory offenses as cimts.in its own words,the bia has many times held that the violation of a regulatory,or licensing,or revenue provision of a statute is not a crime involving moral turpitude,at.evil intent simply is not an essential aspect of such a regulatory violation,even if the violation is a knowing one,and so such violations are not cimts.
for example,in matter of h,the bia held that an alien violation of a federal statute requiring liquor retailers to pay a tax to operate their businesses was not a cimt 
the crime consists in merely failing to register,pay a tax,and comply with certain regulations of the internal revenue commissioner we know of n o case which holds that the violation of a revenue or licensing statute involves moral turpitude.the fact that the thing may be done,providing a tax is paid to the government,indicates that the act itself does not involve moral turpitude.
id.at quoting united states ex rel.andreacchi curran,internal quotation marks omitted.the bia recognized that the respondent had been convicted of unlawfully and knowingly carrying on the business of a retail liquor dealer without having paid the special tax as required.id.at emphasis added.still,the presence of a knowing scienter requirement did not matter to the bia analysis even a knowing failure to conform to a regulatory requirement,apparently,could not demonstrate a sufficiently culpable state of mind to indicate moral turpitude.
similarly,in matter of g,the bia held that a conviction for the possession and transportation of distilled spirits without tax stamps affixed thereto in violation of licensing and regulating provisions of the internal revenue code was not a cimt,because the violation of statutes which merely license or regulate and impose criminal liability without regard to evil intent do not involve moral turpitude.id.at,emphasis added.even a knowing violation of the tax statute,then,would not be enough to transform a regulatory offense into a cimt.accord matter of j,holding that a conviction under a federal statute prohibiting the sale of alcohol to native americans was not a cimt because r egulatory enactments of this nature do not create crimes involving moral turpitude.matter of v,holding that a conviction under the federal narcotic drugs import and export act of,which penalized knowingly importing or participating in the importation of narcotic drugs,was not a cimt because the act is a regulatory act and that the violation of it is therefore not a crime involving moral turpitude matter of g,holding that gambling in violation of new york gaming law was a regulatory offense and so not a cimt.
the lack of a sufficiently evil intent also played the decisive role in goldeshtein ins,cir,where this court held that the regulatory offense of willfully structuring financial deposits in order to prevent a bank from filing currency reports in violation of federal law is not a cimt,because evil intent as opposed to willfulness or knowledge that the conduct is not an element of the crime.id.at.the bia recently adopted goldeshtein as its rule nationwide in matter of,holding that a violation of the structuring statute involves no per se morally reprehensible conduct.
in short,in a body of case law riddled with inconsistencies,the rule that regulatory offenses are simply not if committed knowingly appears to be one of the bia more stable principles.
departure from the bia regulatory offense precedents 
acknowledges that there exists a general rule that regulatory offenses do not constitute cimts,at.but it departs from this rule,reasoning that 
an individual who drives under the influence in violation of section a does so with the knowledge that he or she should not be driving under any circumstances.we find that a person who drives while under the influence,knowing that he or she is absolutely prohibited from driving,commits a crime so base and so contrary to the currently accepted duties that persons owe to one another and to society in general that it involves moral turpitude.
this purported explanation is a ipse dixit or because i said so edict.one can,perhaps,read into the bia the implication that certain offenses are so base,vile,or depraved that an evil intent,even if not an explicit requirement for conviction under the statute,is inherent in the act.but the bia has never given any particularized content to the phrase base,vile,or depraved other than to hold that some offenses are and others are not.this is why,as the majority explains,we do not defer to the bia use of general descriptive phrases like base,vile,or depraved,and contrary to the duties owed between man and man because deferring to a contentless phrase would ha ve no practical significance.see op.at quoting,at.
similarly,purported explanation provides no way to figure out when or by what logic an offense is sufficiently base,vile,and depraved that evil intent is implicit in the act what we do know is that the bia and this court have in practice limited the concept of implicitly evil intent to fraud sex offenses and drug trafficking offenses provides no reasons why a regulatory dui offense belongs in the same camp.
indeed,to the extent can be read to hold that drunk driving on a suspended license is so base,vile,or depraved that evil intent is somehow inherent in the act,i can find no reasons in the bia precedential cimt in that should be so.certainly,where a nonfraud offense is purely regulatory,it can not inherently exhibit an evil intent.after all,that is the very definition of a crime that is malum prohibitum but for the statutory prohibition,the act would not be wrongful if any aspect of campos conduct could be characterized as morally wrongful,it would be driving while driving on a suspended license.but the bia has unequivocally acknowledged that driving while intoxicated is not turpitudinous,see,at and so,necessarily,does not inherently demonstrate an evil state of mind.
in fact,the bia has held that even a third conviction for drunk variety of aggravated dui under the same arizona statute at issue not a cimt.matter of,en banc as judge nelson cogently argued in her dissent from the panel decision in this case,it is patently unreasonable to conclude that driving under the influence only once,even with a suspended license,somehow carries with it greater moral opprobrium than driving drunk repeatedly.gonzales,cir nelson,dissenting.
implicit suggestion that the lack of a valid license converts a simple dui offense,which does not inherently involve an evil intent,into a cimt that does necessarily involve an evil intent,is simply incoherent.the bia has identified no basis whatever for treating this variety of aggravated dui under a differently from other regulatory offenses which have been designated as nonturpitudinous.because i said so is not good enough.
b.the bia rule against combining two offenses into a cimt 
in addition,treating aggravated dui under a as a cimt runs squarely into a second set of bia precedents those cases holding that two crimes that are not themselves cimts can not,when committed together,morph into a cimt.
as i have already noted,simple dui is not a cimt.see,at.the act of driving without a valid license is not a cimt either.if evil intent does not inhere in either of the component offenses that make up a individually,then such intent could only be found,if anywhere,in the synergy between those two component offenses when they are committed simultaneously.this appears to be where ultimately locates bald defiance of the rule it set out in matter of short.
in matter of short,the bia held that assault with intent to commit a felony is not per se a cimt.rather,the assault will only fall within the cimt category if the felony that the perpetrator intended to commit would itself have been so designated.short explained 
i f a simple assault does not involve moral turpitude and the felony intended as a result of that assault also does not involve moral turpitude,then the two crimes combined do not involve moral turpitude.moral turpitude can not be viewed to arise from some undefined synergism by which two offenses are combined to create a crime involving moral turpitude,where each crime individually does not involve moral turpitude.there must be some particular criminal activity with which to evaluate whether the nature of that activity involves moral turpitude.
id.at.in other words,evil intent can not float about in the ether it must be grounded in one act or another.
the rule of short coheres with the bia longstanding insistence that it is the nature of the offense that matters when deciding whether the offense is morally turpitudinous,not the circumstances under which the offense occurred or how frequently it has happened.see,goldeshtein,at accord,at.consistent with the rule that the requisite evil intent must inhere in the crime of conviction,the bia will impute the intent associated with crime a to crime b only if crime b is done with the purpose of committing crime 
for example,burglary offenses may or may not involve moral turpitude,the determinative factor being whether the crime intended to be committed at the time of entry involves moral turpitude.matter of m.likewise,malicious trespass,which is not a cimt by itself,becomes one when the trespass is committed with the intent to commit larceny,which would itself be a cimt.matter of esfandiary.short is a reiteration of this general rule.
runs directly into this line of case law by suggesting that the regulatory offense of driving without a license and the regulatory offense of simple dui,neither of which even if committed knowingly involves moral turpitude,somehow exhibit moral turpitude when committed at the same time.but the simultaneity of offenses,without more,has never been enough to create moral turpitude out of nothing.as short held,t here must be some particular criminal activity in which moral turpitude inheres,at,or else some purposeful link between an attempted cimt offense and the perfected offense that justifies imputing the mental state associated with the former to the latter.matter of m,at matter of esfandiary,at.turpitude can not arise simply out of the synergism between two offenses,even if committed simultaneously.matter of short,at.yet that is precisely what does.
does lamely attempt to distinguish itself from short.first,it notes that 
t he relevant discussion in matter of short pertained to a simple assault with intent to commit a felony of unproven seriousness.we did not hold in that decision that a combination of acts that are included as elements of a specific offense could never,when added together,build to such a heightened deviance from accepted moral standards as to reach a level of conduct deemed morally turpitudinous.in fact,additional aggravating elements can often transform an offense that otherwise would not be a crime involving moral turpitude into one that is.
at.tellingly,the bia cites no authority for its proposition that aggravating elements not themselves demonstrative of evil intent often have transformed into cimts 
then goes on to explain 
the finding of moral turpitude in the crimes in the present case does not arise simply from an amalgamation of distinct separate offenses rather,it results from a building together of elements by which the criminalized conduct deviates further and further from the private and social duties that persons owe to one another and to society in general w hen simple dui is committed by an individual who knows that he or she is prohibited from driving,the offense becomes such a deviance from the accepted rules of contemporary morality that it amounts to a crime involving moral turpitude.
id.but nowhere does the bia attempt to explain by what logic simple dui,when committed simultaneously with unlicensed driving,becomes such a deviance from moral standards that moral turpitude materializes where there was none before.the bia claims that this is not the amalgamation of distinct separate offenses but the building together of elements by which the criminalized conduct deviates further and further from accepted moral what is amalgamation,if not a building together again,offers no clue.
encountering a similarly flimsy explanation in primary comm.fec,the circuit lamented that w ithout adequate elucidation,this court has no way of ascertaining whether cases are indeed distinguishable,whether the agency has a principled reason for distinguishing them,or whether the agency is refusing to treat like cases alike.so here.explanation of how it differs from short amounts to because i said so,yet the majority considers this a reasoned explanation worthy of chevron deference.op.at.the majority explains its position by noting that,even if inconsistent with short,does not leave us in doubt as to the reason for the change in direction.id.at quoting gonzales,cir en banc see also op.at.i can not agree.unless we understand that new direction to be any way the board wants,provides no explanation for the change in direction,and thus no guidance on how to apply short rule to future cases.
as i see,the board has changed its view of the continued validity or scope of short without explaining what its new interpretation is.ferry,icc.that is not a permissible exercise of the board power under chevron,and it certainly is not a decision to which this court should defer.
summary as an unreasonable interpretation of the ina 
in sum,the bia offers no reasoned explanation in for its deviations from two modest,relatively consistent principles floating in the miasma that is the bia cimt jurisprudence.we have no explanation worthy of the name for why knowledge,rather than evil intent,should be sufficient to transform a regulatory offense into a cimt.and we have no explanation worthy of the name for why the principle that aggregating two offenses can not yield a cimt offense,which was enunciated definitively in matter of short,does not apply here.even within an exceptionally tangled field of confused and conflicting case law,stands apart,ignoring what few guideposts the bia has staked out.
i note that the bia own regulations require that,through precedent decisions,the board shall provide clear and uniform guidance to the service,the immigration judges,and the general public on the proper interpretation and administration of the act and its implementing regulations.d.yet,the bia cimt precedents are anything but clear and uniform,as i hope i have demonstrated.
the bia refusal to abide by its regulatory mandate to provide clear and uniform guidance leaves individual aliens uncertain as to what conduct will put them at risk of drastic sanction,as we noted in comm.thornburgh,cir quoting kennedy,d.the supreme court in smiley specifically provided that an agency indifference to legitimate reliance on prior interpretation s could make that agency new position ineligible for chevron deference.smiley citibank,d internal citations and quotation marks omitted see also ashcroft,cir the consistent application of the bia precedents,like the consistent application of an agency regulations,serves a critical purpose the provision of fair notice to those subject to the agency decisions.the bia failure to abide by its own cimt precedents,in defiance of its duty under d to provide clear and uniform guidance to the general public,casually ignores those reliance interests.
moreover,the bia refusal to provide clear and uniform guidance makes our task as a reviewing court immeasurably harder.without any overarching theory to guide the bia application of the term crime involving moral turpitude,how can a court review the board determination that a particular offense falls on one side or another of that nonexistent line without any stable theory about what role intent plays in defining moral turpitude,how can a court tell whether a particular decision is consistent or inconsistent with the agency past positions,and,thus,whether it is reasonable under chevron see mukasey,cir noting that the bia has provided little concrete guidance as to the meaning of moral turpitude mei ashcroft,cir since congress did not define crime involving moral turpitude it is reasonable to suppose à la chevron that congress contemplated that the agency charged with administering the statute would define the term,and specifically would tailor the definition to the policies embodied in the immigration statutes.the board of immigration appeals has done neither.to nonetheless defer to,as the majority does today,is to acquiesce in the bia flouting of its interpretive duty and surrender to its continued frustration of effective judicial review.
i would hold that the bia determination in campos,based on,campos two aggravated dui convictions are not supported by a reasoned explanation,and would remand to the agency.i therefore respectfully dissent.
at the time of campos conviction,arizona aggravated dui statute was codified at arizona revised statutes section.five months later,arizona redesignated the statute as arizona revised statutes section.sess.laws,ch,as amended by.sess.laws,ch,effective.sess.laws,ch.for purposes of this opinion,we refer to the aggravated dui statute by its current designation,section.
the statute provides in pertinent part a.a person is guilty of aggravated driving or actual physical control while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs if the person does any of the following.commits a violation of driving under the influence,driving under the extreme influence or this section while the person driver license or privilege to drive is suspended,canceled,revoked or refused or while a restriction is placed on the person driver license or privilege to drive as a result of violating or or under administrative license suspension for driving under the influence.
on march,the ins ceased to exist as an agency under the department of justice and its functions were transferred to the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement within the newly formed dhs.
dhs withdrew its charge that campos was removable under a a i.
the bia also concluded that campos theft conviction constituted a crime involving moral turpitude.campos does not dispute this conclusion on appeal.the only issues preserved on appeal with respect to his removability under a a ii are whether aggravated dui rises to the level of a crime involving moral turpitude and a limited challenge to the adequacy of the administrative record.
the attorney general has recently stated that it may be appropriate for immigration judges to look beyond the record of conviction when applying the modified categorical approach.see in re,w hen the record of conviction fails to show whether the alien was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude,immigration judges should be permitted to consider evidence beyond that record if doing so is necessary and appropriate to ensure proper application of the act moral turpitude provisions.as that question is not squarely before us,we reserve judgment as to the validity of that portion of our prior case law which suggests review should be more confined.see,mukasey,cir limiting review to particular documents in the alien record of conviction.
frequently,we have characterized the question presented in these cases as singular,whether the petitioner statutory crime is a crime of moral turpitude.as noted,we review the bia interpretation of criminal statutes de novo.however,many of our prior cases have not acknowledged the second component of the bia inquiry,its interpretation of the ina.see,at,reviewing both components of the bia decision but suggesting that the standard of review is singular.one reason for such omission is that once the conduct proscribed by the petitioner statute of conviction is identified,fraud,the question whether such conduct involves moral turpitude is not in doubt and thus merits little or no analysis from the court.
the attorney general is charged with the administration and enforcement of the ina and the determination and ruling by the attorney general with respect to all questions of law are controlling.a.while retaining ultimate authority,the attorney general has delegated his discretion and authority in interpreting the ina to the bia to exercise in the course of adjudicating cases before it.d.
as we explained in,the applicable regulations allow the bia to decide most appeals through brief,nonprecedential orders authored by a single member of the board.e.only if that member determines that a case presents t he need to establish a precedent construing the meaning of laws,regulations,or procedures is it transferred to a panel for decision in a published order.see e.the board internal policies establish u npublished decisions are binding on the parties to the decision but are not considered precedent for unrelated cases.bia prac,ch.d ii june.
some have suggested that the imprecision of the term moral turpitude demonstrates congress intent that its meaning be developed over time through judicial and administrative construction.others have construed matters less charitably.as justice jackson once wrote,congress knowingly conceived the term in confusion,deliberately ignoring a warning raised by a member of the house that n o one can really say what is meant by a crime involving moral turpitude.jordan degeorge.jackson,dissenting quoting house committee on immigration and naturalization hearings on,sess.
again,the attorney general has suggested that a broader scope of review is appropriate.see supra note.
we also recognize that they both involved actual knowledge,not mere negligence.campos admitted in that he knew he did not have a valid license,and he admitted in that he knew his license had been suspended or dissent disagrees with our conclusion as to campos conviction.dissent at.the fact of campos conviction is proof that his license had been suspended,canceled,revoked or refused in.a.with this established,what else could campos indicated he knew he did not possess a valid meant except that he knew his license was suspended,canceled,revoked or refused moreover,despite the fact that the bia precedent under which he was deemed removable requires a knowledge scienter,see,at,campos never contends that he was convicted of anything but a knowing violation of section.in any case,the record undeniably reflects that campos knew he was absolutely prohibited from driving.id.at.even if the record of campos dui conviction does not establish the requisite mens rea,the point is academic.the bia determined that he was alternatively removable on the basis of his theft conviction.campos did not appeal that portion of the bia decision,thus waiving any challenge to its validity.see paladin.power,cir explaining that we will not consider matters on appeal that are not specifically and distinctly argued in an appellant opening brief.
the supreme court has held that simple dui is not a violent felony as defined in the armed career criminal act,begay.at,or a crime of violence under the ina,leocal,at.nevertheless,because those terms contain different elements than a crime involving moral turpitude,such holdings bear little relation to the question presented here.see begay.at explaining that a violent felony must include purposeful,violent,and aggressive conduct emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted leocal,at.stating that a crime of violence must have as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.
the petitioner in was convicted of violating arizona revised statutes section a,which has since been redesignated as section a,see supra note,the subsection adjacent to arizona prohibition on aggravated dui,section a.the term recidivist dui is not used in the arizona statute,but we employ it here to distinguish a from a.
the dissent derides this lame attempt to distinguish from short,demanding that the bia explain by what logic it can reach the conclusion it sets forth.dissent at.again,the dissent demands more than is required by chevron.the bia distinction is not irrational short did not purport to establish a categorical rule.it is possible that two offenses,committed at the same time could rise to the level of a crime involving moral turpitude.as the chief judge mentioned at oral argument,while neither simple dui nor driving at excessive speeds individually constitute crimes involving moral turpitude,it would not be irrational to conclude that driving at excessive speeds while drunk amounted to conduct that shocks the public conscience as being inherently base,vile,or depraved,at.to the extent is somehow inconsistent with short,as we stated previously,the agency explanation for its departure does not leave us in doubt as to the reason for the change in direction,at see also lands council,at.
the bia holding in a prior precedential decision that a conviction under a given criminal statute is a cimt will be entitled to chevron deference in a subsequent case only if the prior holding directly controls the outcome in the subsequent case.we so held in gonzales,cir t he bia has never issued a published decision addressing the precise question at issue.although the bia order cited several published bia decisions,none of them sets forth a binding interpretation of the question at issue therefore,we do not accord chevron deference to the bia decision in this case.
to be clear,inconsistency in agency interpretations does not mean that the chevron framework does not apply.rather,an unexplained inconsistency may be a reason for a found that chevron is the correct framework to apply to the type of agency interpretation in question,having determined that the relevant statutory language is ambiguous at chevron step one,and moving on to apply chevron step find the agency interpretation unreasonable and decline to give it deference.see cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d hereinafter brand x.

having offered this capacious definition,which he terms a rearticulat ion of the standard the bia has long applied,the attorney general then states his belie f that the definition in existing board precedent merits judicial deference under controlling supreme court decisions,at.issuing a blanket definition at such an elevated level of generality as to retrospectively encompass virtually every bia decision that has come before or will come afterward can not create a rule entitled to chevron deference if none existed,as we held in,at,none did.
the bia issues precedential also called published and nonprecedential also called unpublished decisions.precedential decisions serve as precedents in all future proceedings involving the same issue or issues,g,and,unless modified or overruled,are binding on all officers and employees of the department of homeland security or immigration judges in the administration of the immigration laws of the united states.id.only decisions issued by panels,by the board sitting en banc,or more rarely,by the attorney general or the secretary of homeland security,may be designated as precedential.see id.at e ii g c.in contrast,decisions issued by single board make up the vast majority of bia by definition.all decisions designated to serve as precedent are published in bound volumes of the reporter entitled administrative decisions under the immigration nationality laws of the united states or.separately,the executive office of immigration review periodically compiles certain unpublished decisions as indexed decisions,which are meant to serve as useful but guidance for eoir staff.see bia prac,ch.d july,available at.indexed decisions are,nevertheless.the discussion that follows,i consider only the bia precedential cimt decisions,as these embody the agency official interpretations of the meaning of the governing law.e ii.

see,matter of solon,offenses characterized as simple assaults are generally not considered to be crimes involving moral turpitude this is so because they require general intent only and may be committed without the evil intent,depraved or vicious motive,or corrupt mind associated with moral turpitude.internal quotation marks and citation omitted emphasis added matter of,in some penal statutes,the word wi l lful connotes moral turpitude or evil of mind,but in others it means no more than that the interdicted act is done deliberately and with knowledge.we think th e latter clearly is the sense in which the term is used in the statute here at issue and conclude,therefore,that the false statement made by the appellant did not constitute a crime involving moral turpitude.internal citation omitted.accord notash gonzales,cir holding that the immigration judge erred in equat ing willfulness with evil intent.we have stated that the word wil l ful means no more than that the forbidden act is done deliberately and with knowledge this does not establish the evil intent required for a crime of moral turpitude.internal quotation marks,alterations,and citations omitted.
i disagree,however,with the majority assertion that judicially noticeable documents establish that campos conviction was for a knowing violation of a.the majority states that campos admitted in his plea colloquy that he knew he did not have a valid license.op.at.that is his plea colloquy,in response to the question and,campos,did you have a valid driver license at that time in arizona,campos responded,i never had one.but driving under the influence while kn owing he did not have a valid license is not sufficient for a conviction under a.the arizona statute instead requires that the defendant knew or should have known that his license to drive was suspended,canceled,revoked,or refused or while a restriction is placed upon the person driver license as a result of a prior offense.a.we can not infer from the fact of his conviction and his statement in the plea colloquy that campos knew his license was suspended,canceled,revoked,or refused if anything,the plea colloquy indicates that he did not know that.this point of disagreement does not matter,however,because i would hold that even a knowing violation of the arizona statute would not constitute a cimt.
specifically,the majority begins by quoting language concerning knowing or intentional conduct from matter of,see op.at,but that language is merely dicta.the assault statute at issue in lacked a knowledge requirement,id.at,and so the bia had no occasion to hold that the offense would have qualified as a cimt had it required knowledge.in any event,later cases concerning violent crimes confirmed that knowingly engaging in prohibited conduct is not the test for a finding of moral turpitude.in the violent crimes context,the bia usually requires more than,recklessness plus.see,matter of fualaau,in order for an assault to be deemed a crime involving moral turpitude,the element of a reckless state of mind must be coupled with an offense involving the infliction of serious bodily injury.matter of mcnaughton,which the majority cites next,is a fraud case,and is therefore inapposite a conviction for fraud must require a showing not of knowledge,but of the specific intent to defraud,in order to constitute a cimt.see infra,note.the majority then cites matter of r,matter of m,and matter of g,see,all of which involve theft offenses,for which the requisite mens rea appears to be the specific intent to deprive another permanently of his property.see matter of,conviction for retail theft is a cimt where the statute requires proof that the person took merchandise offered for sale by a store without paying for it and with the intention of depriving the store owner of the goods and where it can be presumed that the taking is with the intention of retaining the merchandise permanently.matter of salvail,possession of stolen property is a cimt where the statute specifically requires knowledge of the stolen nature of the goods.the majority also cites matter of,and matter of p,for the proposition that moral turpitude normally inheres in the intent.op.at.this statement is unarguably correct,but it says nothing about what level of intent is sufficient to establish turpitude in what sorts of cases.notably,none of the cases on which the majority relies involve a regulatory,as shown below,is the category of offense to which aggravated dui belongs.
see,matter of balao,conviction for the violation of a statute prohibiting the issuing of worthless checks was not categorically a cimt,because the statute prohibited only the knowing issuance of bad checks,rather than expressly requir ing intent to defraud as an element of the crime matter of serna,conviction for possession of an altered immigration document with knowledge that it was altered,but without proof of any intent to use it unlawfully,is not a cimt.but see matter of tejwani,money laundering is a fraud cimt even without any showing of specific intent,because a person who deliberately takes affirmative steps to conceal or disguise the proceeds of criminal conduct acts in an inherently deceptive manner contrary to accepted moral standards.
indeed,campos offense can not logically be described as a fraud offense,because campos gave no false information to the motor vehicles authorities to obtain a driver simply drove without one.in contrast,the bia fraud cases normally involve affirmative misrepresentations of material facts made for the purposes of personal gain.see matter of p,making false or misleading representations in labeling in violation of the food,drug,and cosmetic act is a cimt matter of m,willfully and knowingly making a false statement on a selective service questionnaire for the purpose of evading military service,where that statement is material,is a fraud cimt.see also ins,cir making false attestations on an employment verification form and using a false social security number are mala prohibita but not mala in se,and so are not cimts.
see,matter of solon,offenses characterized as simple assaults are generally not considered to be crimes involving moral turpitude.this is so because they require general intent only and may be committed without the evil intent,depraved or vicious motive,or corrupt mind associated with moral turpitude.internal citation omitted matter of khourn,possession with the intent to distribute cocaine is a cimt the intent to distribute involves evil intent matter of b,i n,a simple assault committed knowingly upon a prison guard involved no evil intent and so was not a cimt matter of,state misprision of felony offense is not a cimt because t o constitute this offense there must be mere knowledge of the offense,and not necessarily an y assent or encouragement a conviction could be had,therefore,without evil intent s ince the statute does not require an evil or corrupt intent,it is concluded that the crime is not one involving moral turpitude.internal quotation marks and citations omitted matter of j,all crimes violate some laws all deliberate crimes involve the intent to do so.congress could not have meant to make the willfulness of the act a test it added as a condition that it must itself be shamefully immoral.see also gonzales,cir discussing the requirement that a crime involve a showing of willfulness or evil intent to be classified as a cimt,as opposed to general intent or reckless ness notash gonzales,cir an act done deliberately and with knowledge does not necessarily involve evil intent for cimt purposes goldeshtein ins,cir rejecting the argument that evil intent exists if a conviction requires proof that a defendant did a forbidden act willfully,where willfully was defined to mean deliberately and with knowledge.
neither nor any other precedential bia decision classifies the offense of driving without a valid license as a regulatory or any other kind of offense.nor has the bia ever considered in a precedential decision whether the possession or use of a falsified driver license is a cimt.but see ins,cir affirming bia decision that using a falsified driver license was a cimt,because the attempt at deceit is inherent in this act id.at stating incorrectly that t he bia has held in serna that use of a fraudulent driver license is a crime of moral turpitude,when in fact,serna involved a falsified immigration document,not a driver license,and it held that possession of such documents was not a cimt zaitona ins,cir affirming bia nonprecedential decision that knowingly using a false name and date of birth to obtain a driver license was a cimt.
the answer to this question can not depend upon the seriousness of the breach or the severity of the harm caused,for the bia has held that neither factor can compensate for the lack of mens rea otherwise required to transform an offense into a cimt.see,at holding,in the drug possession context,that crimes in which evil intent is not an element,no matter how serious the act or harmful the consequences,do not involve moral turpitude.matter of solon,explaining,in the context of assault crimes,that as the level of conscious behavior decreases,from intentional to reckless conduct,more serious resulting harm is required in order to find that the crime involves moral turpitude.but where no conscious behavior is required,there can be no finding of moral turpitude,regardless of the resulting harm.

this statement would be supportable,although only qualifiedly so,in the assault context.in assault cases,certain aggravating factors,like the use of a deadly weapon,may be sufficient to establish turpitude where simple assault by itself would not.see matter of fualaau,at matter of sanudo,at.the bia case law in this area is particularly confused,probably because the term assault encompasses such a wide range of state crimes.moreover,i have found no cases in which an aggravating factor converts a regulatory offe
