kerubo hanggi,formerly known as kerubo crawford,petitions for review of an order of the board of immigration appeals bia adopting and affirming the decision of an immigration judge ij and dismissing her appeal.hanggi argues that the ij abused her discretion in denying both hanggi request for a continuance and her motion to terminate removal proceedings.we conclude that hanggi challenge to the continuance ruling is not properly before us,because she failed to raise the point in her appeal to the bia.we also hold,assuming we have jurisdiction to do so,that the ij did not abuse her discretion in denying the motion to terminate removal proceedings.finally,we reject hanggi suggestion that the bia decision violated her constitutional right to due process.accordingly,we deny the petition for review.
hanggi,a female native and citizen of kenya,arrived in the united states in.she was admitted on a nonimmigrant student visa to attend scott community college,but did not attend that institution.in,hanggi married a united states citizen named tyrone crawford.based on that marriage,hanggi filed an application for adjustment of status with the former immigration and naturalization service ins,pursuant to.in february,crawford filed a petition for alien relative on her behalf,also termed an petition,pursuant to.the following month,hanggi was granted advance parole into the united states,see a a f,which she used to leave and reenter the united states to resume her pending application for adjustment of status.nearly four years later,in march,united states citizen and immigration services uscis denied the visa petition filed on her behalf,which had the effect of also terminating her application for adjustment.the agency deemed that crawford abandoned the petition when he failed to appear for a scheduled interview.
while hanggi was still married to crawford,she met another citizen named daniel hanggi.hanggi divorced crawford,and in july,married daniel.in april,however,hanggi had been placed in removal proceedings by the department of homeland security dhs and ordered to appear before an ij.
at the first hearing on july,counsel for dhs filed an amended notice to appear.the notice classified hanggi as an arriving alien to reflect her previous grant of advance parole,and charged her under a a i i with failing to possess the documentation required to stay in the country.as a result of the amended notice,the ij granted a continuance to give hanggi counsel enough time to review the new charges against her.
on october,a second hearing before the ij was held,but the proceedings were again continued because hanggi had retained new counsel.by the time of the second hearing,hanggi second husband,daniel,had filed an alien relative petition on her behalf with uscis.hanggi had not filed an application to adjust her status,however,because under a regulation,arriving aliens placed in removal proceedings were categorically ineligible to apply for adjustment of from uscis or the immigration courts.c see also ceta mukasey,cir.in may,the department of justice doj and dhs issued a new interim rule in response to conflicting courts decisions,some of which rejected as contrary to law the complete bar on adjustment of status by arriving aliens in removal proceedings,may.the interim rule allowed arriving aliens in removal to seek adjustment,but in most cases only with uscis,not through the immigration courts.a,a.
at this point,hanggi efforts to remain in the united states proceeded on two separate tracks.on one track,hanggi appeared before the ij and continued to challenge dhs attempts to remove her.on the other,hanggi awaited a decision from uscis on the pending petition filed on her behalf by her spouse,daniel.
at the next hearing,on january,the ij granted a third continuance,this time to give uscis more time to adjudicate the pending petition.by the time of the fourth hearing on july,uscis had issued a notice of intent to deny hanggi petition based on allegations that her first marriage to crawford was designed to evade the immigration laws.still,however,uscis had not issued a final decision on the petition,so the ij granted another continuance to await an outcome.also at this hearing,hanggi presented a letter to the ij arguing that in light of succar ashcroft,cir,one of the decisions holding impermissible the regulation barring arriving aliens in removal from applying for adjustment,hanggi should be permitted to seek adjustment of status.the ij noted that she was not bound by first circuit precedent,and that without a statement from this court or the bia,she would continue to apply the rule that arriving aliens in removal are ineligible to seek adjustment.
at the fifth,sixth,and seventh hearings,held on november,february,and june,respectively,the ij granted three additional continuances,again because no final decision on the petition had been rendered by uscis.
by the time the eighth hearing took place on october,dhs and doj had issued the interim rule described above.see,may,codified at a,a.the rule states that i n the case of an arriving alien who is placed in removal proceedings,the immigration judge does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate any application for adjustment of status filed by the arriving alien,with one exception.a ii.that exception gives the ij jurisdiction to review an arriving alien previously filed adjustment application,if that application was denied by uscis and if the arriving alien was placed in removal proceedings.id.otherwise,only uscis may adjudicate adjustment applications by arriving aliens in removal proceedings.id.a,a ii.
the ij made this jurisdictional point clear during the eighth hearing.at some point during the removal proceeding,hanggi requested that the ij adjust her status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence,pursuant to.the ij noted,however,that she had no jurisdiction over hanggi application for adjustment of status because the narrow jurisdictional exception of a ii did not apply.hanggi was granted parole to pursue adjustment based on her first marriage,and she was now seeking adjustment with respect to a different marriage.thus,the ij concluded,her new application was not a previously filed application that triggered the jurisdictional exception.nonetheless,because uscis had not yet issued a decision on hanggi petition,the ij decided to grant one more continuance.
the ninth and final hearing was held on january.the ij again stated that she had no jurisdiction over hanggi adjustment application,regardless of whether her petition was granted or denied.at that point,hanggi made an oral motion to terminate the removal proceedings,so that she could await a decision on the petition and file an application for adjustment with uscis,without being subject to an order of removal.hanggi also asked the ij to grant another continuance.the ij denied the request for a continuance,closed the case,and instructed hanggi to pursue relief with uscis instead,for only uscis had jurisdiction over her application for adjustment.finally,the ij granted both parties additional time to supplement hanggi motion to terminate removal proceedings.in the meantime,on january,hanggi filed an application for adjustment with uscis.
the ij issued her final decision on february.first,the ij reiterated that she lacked jurisdiction under the new regulations to review hanggi application for adjustment based on her second marriage,because it was not a previously filed application under a ii b.second,the ij denied hanggi motion to terminate the removal proceedings,stating that dhs had properly placed her into removal based on the charges in the amended notice to appear.third,because the ij was without jurisdiction to adjudicate hanggi application for adjustment,the ij denied the application.finally,the ij ordered hanggi removal,but granted her the privilege of voluntary departure.
in march,hanggi filed a notice of appeal with the bia.her brief was due by october,but it was not filed until october.hanggi filed a motion for acceptance of an untimely brief,which the bia denied,noting that hanggi reason for the delay was insufficient.
the bia issued its deci
