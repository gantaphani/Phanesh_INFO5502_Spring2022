hoshiyar singh appeals from the bia january denial of his motion to reopen premised on ineffective assistance of counsel.singh married a citizen during the pendency of his appeal from the ij denial of his affirmative asylum application.he is the beneficiary of an approved immediate relative visa,and seeks to reopen so that he may apply for adjustment of status.
the bia concluded that singh prior counsel did not render ineffective assistance,because counsel made a tactical decision to forgo seeking a stay of voluntary departure in favor of filing a motion to remand with the ninth circuit.moreover,the bia held that singh was not prejudiced by prior counsel failures,because he was ineligible for adjustment of status on account of his voluntary failure to comply with the bia order of voluntary departure.we hold that both conclusions constitute an abuse of discretion.accordingly,we grant the petition for review and remand to the bia for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
singh,is a citizen and native of india,and his primary language is hindi he arrived in the on a visitor visa on may.on june,approximately two weeks after his visa expired,through counsel,singh filed an affirmative application for asylum and withholding of removal.
on august,after a hearing,the ij denied singh application for asylum and withholding of removal.the ij also granted singh a voluntary departure period of sixty days,meaning that if he did not appeal,he would have to depart the united states by october,notably,in his oral decision,the ij told singh 
y ou do have to accept this decision as final.you can appeal.if you appeal,then my decision wo be final,and while your appeal is pending,the government wo require that you depart the united states but they will see what happens with the appeal i did grant you voluntary departure,so you have to post a bond by august,and then you are required to depart the country by october.however,if you put in your appeal,that date will probably change.talk to your lawyer about that.she will be able to tell you what happens with your voluntary departure date.

singh retained satwant pandher to appeal the ij decision singh paid pandher in cash,and pandher timely filed a notice of appeal with the bia on september.on may,while his appeal was pending,singh married a naturalized citizen.shortly after his marriage,singh asked pandher to file a visa petition and an application for adjustment of status.singh paid pandher an additional for these services.in september,after two erroneous filings,pandher filed a form i,petition for an immediate relative visa,on singh behalf.singh regularly contacted pandher to ensure that his visa petition was being handled appropriately.
on february,the bia denied singh appeal and granted him a period of voluntary departure.at the time,the bia did not mail copies of its decisions to alien petitioners.only the alien counsel received notice.see matter of compean,directing the executive office for immigration review to begin sending courtesy copies of final board decisions to the aliens themselves in addition to sending them to the aliens lawyers,vacated by matter of compean.singh first learned of the board decision in early february,when he called pandher to inquire about the status of his visa petition.pandher then told singh to come into his office to sign some papers for an appeal of the board decision.singh did so,and paid pandher an additional to appeal the board decision.because singh is unable to read english,he asked pandher to explain the decision to him.pandher told singh not to worry,and that he received documents like this frequently.pandher did not tell singh anything about voluntary departure.on february,pandher filed a petition for review with the ninth circuit.the petition for review did not request a stay of voluntary departure,nor a stay of removal.
singh voluntary departure period expired on march,and singh did not depart.an alien who is permitted to depart voluntarily,but voluntarily fails to depart the united states within the time period specified is subject to civil fines,and,more importantly,is ineligible,for a period of ten years for relief including cancellation of removal and adjustment of status.d emphasis added incorporating by reference the relief discussed in cancellation of removal and adjustment of status,adjustment of status.
on april,singh and his wife attended a marriage fraud interview with united states citizenship and immigration services.pandher also attended.the immigration officer determined that singh marriage was,and approved his application for an i visa.pandher then informed singh that he would send some paperwork regarding the asylum case,but instructed that singh not call him unnecessarily.unbeknownst to singh,on july,pandher filed with the ninth circuit a motion to remand the case to the bia.the motion was utterly worthless.even setting aside any possible statutory ineligibility for adjustment on account of singh failure to depart within the designated period,the motion was filed before the wrong court and was untimely not surprisingly,the ninth circuit denied the motion.the ninth circuit eventually denied singh petition for review of the denial of asylum.singh gonzales,app cir.
pandher then filed a motion to remand with the bia in light of singh marriage and approved visa petition.again,the motion was worthless.pandher failed to include the required filing fee.see g i.moreover,the motion was untimely,and pandher failed to make any argument that the time period for filing the motion to reopen should have been equitably tolled.see c c i.
dissatisfied with pandher representation,singh and his wife consulted another attorney who referred singh to his current counsel.counsel requested and reviewed singh file,and informed singh that pandher had rendered ineffective assistance.singh lodged a complaint against pandher with the washington state bar,and informed him of the grievance.on october,counsel entered a notice of appearance with the bia and filed a motion to reopen to apply for adjustment of status.
the motion to reopen alleged that singh was severely prejudiced by his former counsel failure to seek a stay of voluntary departure in order to preserve singh eligibility for adjustment of status,and move to reopen singh proceedings once his i petition was approved.further,the motion to reopen argued that the time period for filing a motion to reopen should be equitably tolled on account of ineffective assistance of counsel.
