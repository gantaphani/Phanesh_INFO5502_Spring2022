petitioners minya zeru and her husband,russom ghebrai,both natives and citizens of eritrea,applied for asylum on the basis of past persecution and a fear of future persecution.the petitioners premised their application on government harassment of zeru due to her membership in an organization that advocated eritrean independence when that country belonged to ethiopia the organization now opposes the incumbent eritrean government.following hearings conducted over the course of almost five years,an immigration judge ij found petitioners testimony to be not credible,that they had not established past persecution,and that,in any event,there was no basis for a claim of future persecution.the ij thus denied the asylum application.the board of immigration appeals bia affirmed in a per curiam order.
zeru and ghebrai moved to reopen by challenging the credibility determination and alleging ineffective assistance of counsel during the asylum appeal to the bia.the bia denied the motion.
zeru and ghebrai petition for review of both the denial of asylum and the denial of the motion to reopen.the petitions are supported by an amicus brief on behalf of various groups concerned with the rights of refugees and torture victims.we affirm both of the bia orders and deny the petitions for review.
denial of claims for relief 
zeru arrived in the united states on december.her business visa allowed her to remain in the united states until july.in october,she filed for asylum and for withholding of removal and was interviewed by an asylum officer.zeru case was transferred to the immigration court.in february,both zeru and ghebrai,who had overstayed his visa as well,received notices to appear charging them with removability.zeru and ghebrai conceded removability,but both sought asylum,withholding of removal,voluntary departure,and relief under the convention against torture cat based on zeru assertions of political persecution.
an ij heard testimony from zeru and ghebrai on five occasions between january,and march,in those initial hearings before the original ij,zeru testified to the following facts.she was born in in massawa,then a part of ethiopia.from the age of fifteen,zeru began pamphleteering and engaging in fundraising activities on behalf of the eritrean liberation council,a political group devoted to eritrean independence and the establishment of a democratic system of government.zeru kept her political activities secret from her family,fearing retribution from various political opponents.one rival separatist group in particular,the eritrean peoples liberation front eplf,opposed the agenda in favor of rule.
zeru testified that she was arrested in by ethiopian soldiers acting on a tip from the eplf,and endured a period of imprisonment ending on january.she testified that she was raped,and that she was beaten numerous times by her jailors.following her release,zeru spent six months in outpatient treatment for depression in ethiopia.
within a year of her release from imprisonment,zeru resumed fundraising for the.by that time,she had met ghebrai,a physician who worked in a hospital.zeru testified that she did not tell ghebrai about her political activities or her prior imprisonment.zeru and ghebrai testified that they were married in january.
the eplf defeated the ethiopian military in and took power in eritrea.zeru testified that eritrean security forces according to zeru,effectively the same organization as the former eplf began harassing her in,following a failed coup attempt.on two occasions,security officers detained zeru and interrogated her in security forces offices near her import business in asmara.then,in september,eritrean officers detained zeru for a interrogation.according to testimony that zeru gave in august,one of her interrogators held a gun to her head and threatened to kill her.zeru testified that she had never felt worse than during that encounter.
after the september incident,zeru sought the advice of a friend who worked as a secretary with the eritrean security forces.in november,the friend warned her that her name had appeared on a list of members,and that she was in grave danger.leaving the country,her friend said,was her only option.at that point,zeru told ghebrai about her political activities and her history of harassment by government officials.zeru testified that she obtained a visa and passport through her secretary friend and left eritrea.this was more than six years after her imprisonment.zeru arrived in boston in december and resided with a cousin in portland,maine.she was eight months pregnant with her second child at the time.
zeru testified that she did not contact her family after leaving eritrea,and that she had not been in communication with them until recently.nor did zeru have any contact with ghebrai,but communicated with him in occasional messages conveyed through a relative.ghebrai entered the united states in march of,on a visa to study medicine in los angeles,but initially had no contact with zeru.ghebrai did not join zeru in maine until completing six months of medical training.
a new ij was assigned to petitioners case in.he reviewed the record,including petitioners previous testimony,and held a full day of hearings on november.zeru and ghebrai reiterated their prior testimony.zeru stated during direct evidence that she had been raped once,at the start of her imprisonment in.later,following cross examination and in response to questioning by the ij,zeru said there were two instances of rape,the second just before her release.
petitioners also presented an affidavit and testimony from a fact witness named efrem weldemichael.weldemichael,a native of eritrea and a united states citizen,testified that he was an executive committee member in the united states.weldemichael testified that he knew zeru as an member when they were both in ethiopia during the he also testified that he heard reports from other members in or that zeru was imprisoned by the ethiopian government.
the ij also heard from melissa wattenberg,a clinical psychologist specializing in stress disorder ptsd,whom petitioners presented as an expert witness.wattenberg was not a treating psychologist and did not provide therapeutic services to zeru.rather,at the request of zeru counsel,she interviewed zeru about her experiences during two meetings in october and november of,almost four years after zeru entered the country,and produced a detailed assessment report.that report summarized zeru oral statement of her own history and concluded that zeru meets criterion for current moderate ptsd,and moderate depression.the report also opined that zeru is a sincere and reliable reporter of her own experience.zeru told wattenberg that she had been raped three times,which differed from her hearing testimony.
zeru attorney sought to use wattenberg testimony to establish the contents of her report and to assess zeru credibility.the ij admitted the report into evidence and indicated that he need not hear testimony duplicative of the report contents.zeru counsel stated that she had no other questions for wattenberg,and rested on the contents of the report.
the ij also reviewed petitioners documentary evidence during the november,hearing.the hearing opened with the ij pointing out that ghebrai failed to bring his original passport,including the relevant visa page,to the hearing.petitioners presented the ij with a letter they had written to the hospital in eritrea where zeru had allegedly received treatment following her incarceration,but they were unable to produce the hospital records requested in the letter.zeru also produced an identification card issued at zeru request from the organization office in bonn,germany,in.zeru testified that she did not carry such a card in eritrea,but that she obtained it because she was asked to produce this to prove my membership.
zeru also entered into evidence an official letter signifying her release from the prison where she was held in ethiopia.zeru testified that she possessed the letter since.zeru attorney explained that the document could not be verified by the united states embassy in addis ababa because petitioners had sent a copy instead of the original document to the embassy.
finally,petitioners submitted their marriage certificate.they sent the certificate for verification to the united states embassy in asmara,but the embassy responded that zeru date of birth as listed on the certificate conflicted with the date recorded in asmara municipal records.in addition,certain information on the certificate,including the bride date of birth and the date of the marriage contract,had been covered with and typed over.the ij admitted all of the documents into evidence,noting that he would give them what weight i deem is appropriate.
on december,the ij denied the asylum application and ordered petitioners removal.the ij based his decision on adverse credibility findings for zeru and ghebrai,a lack of corroborating evidence requested by ijs during the proceedings,and the submission of apparently fraudulent documents.we describe some,but not all,of the ij findings.the ij gave a number of reasons for his credibility determinations.among them,he pointed out that zeru claimed on different occasions to have been raped once,twice,or three times.the ij noted that even if he was willing to ignore the contradiction in zeru testimony between whether she was raped once or twice during her detention,he was still concerned that zeru had told wattenberg that she was raped three times.it was the inconsistency between her testimony to the ij and her report to wattenberg that the ij found material and relevant.the ij stated that it would not be unusual for a victim of trauma to confuse dates or sequences of events,but it would be very unusual to simply forget that an event occurred.the ij recited numerous other inconsistencies in petitioners testimony relating to their backgrounds,their marriage,their experiences in eritrea,and their work histories.
the ij noted that zeru had been asked to produce specific documents to corroborate her claim and failed to do so.for example,the ij noted that she had testified that her uncle was arrested in for involvement in a coup attempt and that the incident was very well publicized.she was directed at a hearing on august,to obtain news reports or other information to substantiate the arrest.yet at the hearing on november,she neither produced the documents nor had an explanation for her failure to do so.
in addition,the documents petitioners did submit contained inconsistencies and evident alterations detracting from petitioners claims.the ij recounted the bases for his findings that the prison release letter the marriage certificate and other documentary evidence offered by petitioners were fraudulent.
the ij further observed that petitioners demeanor during the november,hearing belied their believability.the ij not only found ghebrai to be wholly incredible,but also that he had given fraudulent testimony under oath.indeed,the ij found that he doubted the testimony of both petitioners even as to their identities and whether they were husband and wife.
the ij also made an adverse credibility finding as to weldemichael.the ij pointed out that in his affidavit,weldemichael stated that he first met zeru in ethiopia in and saw her a couple of time s in that context.at the hearing,however,weldemichael insisted that he first met zeru in,and only met her once in ethiopia.the ij also found it incredible that although weldemichael purported to be an leader in ethiopia,and although he had heard reports of zeru imprisonment due to her affiliation,weldemichael never took enough interest in zeru plight to investigate zeru condition in prison or whether she was released before the two met again in the united states in.the ij also observed weldemichael demeanor and stated that he simply can not find that w e ldemichael was credible.
because petitioners testimony was not credible,and because their corroborating evidence was not only insufficient to support their claims,but in fact contradicted them,the ij found that zeru and ghebrai had failed to establish either past persecution or a fear of persecution following their return to eritrea.see a b asylum applicants bear burden of proof to establish refugee status see also singh gonzales,cir citing diab ashcroft,cir stating that corroborating evidence may bolster the testimony of a less than entirely credible alien.in concluding that petitioners had not established past persecution,the ij found that petitioners had shown neither that they suffered any harm nor that they had established a nexus to one of the five statutory grounds for establishing refugee status.b b i b.the ij also separately rejected the claims that petitioners would suffer persecution on their return or had a fear of future persecution.see b.the ij noted that petitioners close relatives continued to live peacefully in eritrea.indeed,zeru brother was in the military,and her family continued to live in the same home and run the family business,unmolested by the eritrean government.the ij also denied petitioners applications for withholding of removal,protection under the cat,and voluntary departure 
zeru and ghebrai retained a new attorney,solomon bekele,for their appeal to the bia.on appeal,petitioners insisted they had established past persecution.they claimed that the ij erred in his credibility finding because he improperly demanded authenticated documentary evidence to prove petitioners claims.they also objected to the ij use of demeanor in finding zeru and ghebrai incredible.
petitioners described inconsistencies regarding the number of zeru rapes as minor and explained them as lapses in memory due to the passage of time.petitioners also claimed that the second ij did not observe proper procedures applicable upon assigning a new judge to an immigration case.petitioners additionally argued that because zeru had established past persecution,petitioners were entitled to a finding of fear of future persecution and a grant of their withholding of removal claim.finally,petitioners made a perfunctory argument that they qualified for protection under the cat.
on february,the bia affirmed,incorporating an earlier august,per curiam order.the bia upheld both the lack of credibility finding and the finding that the inconsistencies were not sufficiently explained.the bia noted that it did not find persuasive zeru argument that the inconsistencies were caused by lapses of memory.further,that argument did not explain inconsistencies in ghebrai and weldemichael testimony.the bia also noted that the ij allowably considered the demeanor of the witnesses.
the bia also found a lack of corroborating evidence.the bia noted that zeru immediate family members continued to reside in eritrea without harm.as to the argument that this was explained by the fact that her family members were politically inactive,the bia noted that was inconsistent with her husband testimony that he was not politically active,but nonetheless he had been threatened repeatedly by security agents.in turn,it was implausible that the husband,had he been threatened by government agents,would have been granted a passport and permitted to travel to the united states.
the bia also addressed petitioners argument regarding the assignment of a new ij to their case.the bia decision made clear that the ij complied with the requirement that he familiarize himself with the record and so state on the record.in fact,the ij opinion made repeated reference to details of petitioners testimony given in hearings presided over by the previous ij.
motion to reopen 
zeru and ghebrai,represented by new counsel,filed a motion to reopen on may.the motion was based on alleged new information about zeru ptsd and on alleged ineffective assistance of counsel stemming from bekele representation during the initial appeal.
zeru and ghebrai offered evidence tending to show that zeru ptsd had worsened.zeru evidence was that she suffered a breakdown upon learning of her imminent deportation to eritrea and was hospitalized on november,for depression and suicidal thoughts.zeru submitted a letter from john mirczak,a psychiatrist who treated her after her release from the hospital,dated february,and stating that zeru suffered severe ptsd as a result of multiple gang rapes suffered while a political prisoner in eritrea.the letter further stated that zeru symptoms would worsen if she were to return to eritrea.petitioners also submitted a supplementary psychological assessment from mirczak dated april.mirczak wrote that what can sometimes happen with trauma patients is that they may dissociate and that their memories may be repressed.the supplemental assessment does not explicitly ascribe such symptoms to zeru.
the motion also relied on three other letters to petitioners attorneys from mental health professionals regarding zeru ptsd diagnosis.the first,from a staff member at the psychiatric institute of washington named dianne carlson,explained that zeru had flashbacks to her imprisonment and rapes,and that zeru used dissociation and denial to avoid past traumas.the second letter contained the impressions of a psychologist,jane mcgoldrick,who met with zeru twice in april.mcgoldrick wrote that zeru referred in her meetings to her rape and torture,but that she was too tearful and distressed to report details of those episodes.mcgoldrick asserted that zeru recovery was contingent upon the success of her asylum claim.
finally,the motion to reopen presented a lengthy letter from barton evans,a forensic psychologist retained by petitioners counsel to review the wattenberg report and provide a literature review regarding ptsd.the letter aimed at contradicting the ij statement that it would not be unusual for a victim of trauma to confuse dates or sequences of events,but it would be very unusual for a victim of trauma to simply forget that an event occurred.the ij was referring to the difference between zeru testimony and what she told wattenberg about the number of different occasions on which she had been raped.evans wrote that wattenberg affidavit negated the ij statement because of its reference to zeru recall ing feeling dissociated from her body during these rapes and utiliz ing avoidant strategies.evans cited several psychological studies for the proposition that ptsd victims may suffer inconsistent recall of traumatic events.evans wrote that from the perspective of the psychology of trauma,the presence of dissociative symptoms in fact adds believability to zeru report.petitioners motion to reopen explained that all of the foregoing letters challenged the credibility finding stemming from zeru differing statements regarding the number of times she was raped.
zeru and ghebrai claimed ineffective assistance of counsel because bekele work was egregiously deficient in preparation of the asylum appeal.this was so because bekele failed to address adequately in his brief the ij adverse credibility findings in general,and in particular the most important ground of appeal,namely the virtual elimination of the testimony of wattenberg,who was in the best position to address zeru credibility.petitioners argued that bekele failures amounted to a due process violation.the motion to reopen did not address the ij decisions regarding withholding of removal,the cat,or voluntary departure.
the bia denied the motion to reopen on august,in a,closely reasoned order discussing,inter alia,the specifics of the new medical evidence.the bia noted the limited nature of the new evidence.mirczak letter opined that zeru memory could have been a ffected by dissociation,but overall she is being factual about the brutality that happened.mcgoldrick,who said the disorder zeru was suffering often has as symptoms memory problems and amnesia for aspects of traumatic experiences,did not say that zeru suffered those symptoms.the bia stressed that evans did not even conduct a direct examination of zeru.
the bia met evans criticism of the ij statement that it would not be unusual for a victim of trauma to confuse dates or sequences of events,but it would be very unusual for a victim of trauma to simply forget that an event occurred.even accepting evans criticism,the bia held that it would not likely have changed the outcome of the proceeding,for several reasons.zeru inconsistent statements about the number of occasions on which she was raped were not the sole basis for the lack of credibility finding,which rested on numerous independent inconsistencies as well as upon the ij assessment of zeru demeanor.also,zeru had failed to provide corroborating evidence.the entire body of medical evidence rested on the credibility of her reports to the doctor,but the ij had,based on substantial evidence,found her not to be credible in her reporting of her history.further,the basic ptsd diagnosis evidence was before the bia in the prior appeal and had been considered.
as to the ineffective assistance claim,the bia reasoned that it also failed because even considering the new evidence and new emphasis on the effects of trauma on memory the argument prior counsel,it was argued,should have made,the respondent still had not demonstrated that the outcome might have differed.
zeru and ghebrai timely petitioned to this court for review of the bia rejection of their asylum appeal and the board denial of the motion to reopen.
petitioners urge this court that the petition for review of the motion to reopen should be held to be the functional equivalent of the direct appeal such that the two petitions would be reviewed under the same standard and with reference to the entire administrative record.based on this misunderstanding,petitioners conflate their arguments challenging the denial of asylum and the denial of the motion to reopen.
the two petitions are legally distinct.see keo chan gonzales,cir t he legal separateness of the denial of the asylum claim and the motion to reopen is demonstrated by the fact that each is a separate appealable order.see also b a t he court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based.emphasis added.we review them separately according to their respective records and standards of review.see,zeng gonzales,cir olujoke gonzales,cir fesseha ashcroft,cir.
denial of asylum 
petitioners challenge the denial of asylum by attacking the ij credibility findings.petitioners assert that the ij did not give sufficient weight to evidence provided by wattenberg,who would have been able to address the impact of ptsd on zeru memory and ability to recollect certain events related to her trauma.this is dispositive,petitioners argue,because they characterize the ij credibility finding as turning on zeru inconsistent testimony as to the number of times she was raped after her imprisonment in.petitioners also argue that the credibility finding,to the extent it was based on other inconsistent testimony or deficiencies in corroborating evidence,was based on trivial or immaterial evidence.we hold that substantial evidence supports the ij findings and deny the petition for review.
we must affirm an ij findings of fact,including the credibility of witnesses,if they are supported by reasonable,substantial,and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.ins,d quoting a internal quotation marks omitted.an ij credibility determinations demand deference where the discrepancies and omissions described by the ij are actually present in the record those discrepancies and omissions provide specific and cogent reasons to conclude that the petitioners provided incredible testimony regarding facts central to the merits of the asylum claim and petitioners do not provide a convincing explanation for the discrepancies and omissions.zheng gonzales,cir citing hoxha gonzales,cir.
the ij based his findings of incredibility on,inter alia,numerous inconsistencies in zeru testimony.first,although zeru told wattenberg that she had been raped three times during her imprisonment from,she testified to the ij that she had been raped once,and then later,that she had been raped twice.second,zeru testified in august that in september,eritrean security officers interrogated her for ten hours,at one point pointing a gun at her and threatening to kill her.she testified that the encounter terrified her.in november,however,zeru described the episode as a questioning,and stated that she did not ta
