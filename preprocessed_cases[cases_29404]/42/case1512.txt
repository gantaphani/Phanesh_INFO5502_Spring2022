opinion of the court 
appellant theodor szehinskyj participated in what has accurately been described as the third reich closed culture of murder which saw millions of victims die in the holocaust,the greatest moral catastrophe of our civilization.united states szehinskyj,d.the revocation of his united states citizenship is now before us,with szehinskyj arguing that he was not what the evidence resoundingly showed him to armed concentration camp guard who assisted in persecution because of race,religion or national origin indeed,he argues that he never set foot in the camps in which it was shown that he served.he argues,as well,that even if the government proved that he was an armed guard,it did not prove that he made a material misrepresentation on his visa application and,thus,his citizenship should not have been revoked.he is,in a word,wrong.
in,theodor szehinskyj,who was born in poland but claims to be a ukranian national,entered the united states,together with his wife and daughter,on an immigrant visa issued to him under the displaced persons act of dpa,stat,as amended,june,stat.eight years later,the delaware county court of common pleas granted his petition for naturalization,and he became a united states citizen on march.
in,the government filed an action under section a of the immigration and nationality act of ina,a,seeking revocation of szehinskyj citizenship on the ground that he assisted the nazi government of germany in persecuting individuals because of their race,religion and national origin when he served as an armed nazi concentration camp guard during world war ii.the district court,after a bench trial,concluded in extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law that szehinskyj served as a waffen ss totenkopf or death head division concentration camp guard who assisted in persecution.he was not,therefore,entitled to the immigrant visa he received under the dpa and consequently was not lawfully admitted and eligible for naturalization under a his citizenship was revoked.the district court had jurisdiction under.we have jurisdiction under.we will affirm.
material misrepresentation not required 
as suggested at the outset,szehinskyj raises two issues on appeal insufficiency of the evidence,albeit with various permutations and combinations,and the failure of the government to prove that he made a material misrepresentation on his visa application.we will deal with these issues in reverse order because the latter issue can be swiftly put to rest.our review of what is a pure issue of law is plenary.
it is beyond dispute that there must be strict compliance with all the congressionally imposed prerequisites to naturalization,and failure to comply with any of these terms renders the naturalization illegally procured and subject to revocation under section a of the immigration and nationality act.united states breyer,cir quoting fedorenko united states,d.because szehinskyj entered this country under a visa issued to him pursuant to the dpa,the legality of his naturalization ultimately turns on his eligibility under that act.id.
section a of the dpa made immigration visas available to eligible displaced persons.stat.any person who assisted the enemy in persecuting civil populations was excluded from the definition of an eligible displaced person.dpa b,stat.incorporating the definition of displaced person in annex i to the constitution of the international refugee organization see also fedorenko,at.section of the act,the section at issue here,states in pertinent part 
no visas shall be issued under the provisions of this act,as amended to any person who advocated or assisted in the persecution of any person because of race,religion or national origin.
dpa,as amended,stat.thus,szehinskyj was not eligible for his visa if,prior to obtaining the visa,he had advocated or assisted in persecution based on race,religion,or national origin.assistance in persecution constitutes illegal procurement.breyer,at united states koreh,cir.
but,says szehinskyj,the government failed to prove that he obtained his visa because of a material misrepresentation and that this,too,is required.it is not.whether or not szehinskyj made,and the government proved,a material misrepresentation is irrelevant,for no such proof is required by the plain language of section of the dpa.
we now make explicit that which has heretofore been implicit in our cases.the assistance in persecution ground for visa ineligibility is an independent ground that does not include a fraud element once a determination of ineligibility is made on this ground,there is no need to look for and find a material misrepresentation.united states tittjung,cir breyer,at finding ineligibility without examining whether any misrepresentation occurred koreh,at same.
as the tittjung court explained 
to adopt tittjung reasoning,we would be forced to ignore the plain language of a of the dpa as amended in,something we can not do.that section states that no visas shall be issued under the provision of this act,as amended to any person who advocated or assisted in the persecution of any person because of race,religion,or national origin.section a does not contain a fraud element,but rather provides wholly independent grounds for denaturalization.
the court concluded 
once the determination was made that tittjung service as an armed concentration camp guard meant that he had assisted in persecution,the district court did not and was under no obligation to assess whether tittjung had made misrepresentations in order to procure his visa.
requiring a finding of misrepresentation in order to determine illegal procurement would not only be inconsistent with the plain meaning of section of the dpa,but would be in direct conflict with previous federal case law on the matter.
tittjung,at.
szehinskyj,ignoring the plain language of the dpa and ignoring tittjung,argues that a material misrepresentation is the jurisdictional fact under which,in fedorenko,the court predicated the invalidity of the visa before it.but,aside from other distinctions between that case and this,the fedorenko court was not considering an assistance in persecution charge.rather,the court was considering a charge against petitioner under section a of the ina,stat,as amended,a,which requires revocation of citizenship that was illegally procured or procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation,and section of the dpa,stat,which provided that a ny person who shall willfully make a misrepresentation for the purpose of gaining admission into the united states as an eligible displaced person shall thereafter not be admissible into the united states.
specifically,as relevant to the issue before the court,fedorenko was charged with willfully concealing on his visa application and his application for citizenship that he had served as an armed guard at the infamous treblinka concentration camp and had committed crimes or atrocities against inmates because they were jewish.the government case rested on the claim that he had procured his naturalization illegally or by willfully misrepresenting material facts.fedorenko,at.the one count complaint before us did not allege,as a basis for revocation of citizenship,any such thing but,instead,relied on the independent ground of assistance in persecution.there is nothing in fedorenko that even suggests that in such a case a material misrepresentation must still be proved 
szehinskyj material misrepresentation argument is without merit.
b.the evidence was sufficient 
we now turn to the heart of this the evidence supported the district court conclusion that szehinskyj was an armed concentration camp guard who assisted in the persecution of any person because of race,religion,or national origin.szehinskyj,d at.the district court conclusion is based on numerous findings of fact,which we review for clear error,and our review of its conclusions of law is plenary.stelmokas,at.in conducting our review,we must keep in mind that the right to acquire american citizenship is a precious one,fedorenko,at,and,therefore,the government carries a heavy burden of proof in a proceeding to divest a natura
