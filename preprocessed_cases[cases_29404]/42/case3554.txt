ramon,a lawful permanent resident alien,was convicted in an oregon state court in september of sodomy,for sexually molesting a minor.current law provides that sexual abuse of a minor is an aggravated felony as defined by a a,and therefore grounds for removal under a a iii does not dispute that his crime is an aggravated felony.instead,the question before us is whether may now be removed from the country based on his conviction,even though he would not have been deportable for that for any aggravated the time of his conviction.we conclude that he may not be removed,because the law that made aliens deportable for aggravated felony convictions did not apply to convictions prior to november,and neither congress overhaul of the grounds for deportation in nor its rewrite of the definition of aggravated felony in erased that temporal limitation.
background 
entered the united states in and became a lawful permanent resident on february.in june,molested a girl.he was subsequently charged with sodomy in the first degree,in violation of,and rape in the first degree,in violation of.in exchange for dismissal of the rape charge,pleaded guilty to the sodomy count and admitted in his guilty plea that he had sexual intercourse with a minor.on september,he was sentenced to eight months in custody.
in april of,the bureau of immigration and customs enforcement charged with removability because of his conviction.see crawford,d,summarizing the factual background.under current law,sexual abuse of a minor is an aggravated felony,a a,and a conviction for an aggravated felony renders an alien removable a a iii.but that was not the case when was convicted.see a listing grounds for deportation.to determine whether can now be deported because of his conviction requires a journey through the last twenty years of immigration law reform.
three laws are relevant to our inquiry,all of which amended the immigration and nationality act ina the abuse act of adaa or act,stat.the immigration act of immact or act,stat.and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira or act,div.c,stat.because conviction occurred before all three enactments,the retroactivity of the currently applicable aggravated felony removal ground,a a iii to convictions is central to our inquiry.that inquiry focuses,in turn,on the interplay between the current aggravated felony removal provision,a temporal limitation in the adaa,a savings clause in the immact,and an effective date provision in the iirira.
argues that the adaa,which limited aggravated felony deportations to convictions,protects him from being deported based on his conviction.the attorney general maintains,in contrast,that the adaa is not relevant to circumstances,because its temporal limitation on the aggravated felony ground of deportation did not survive the later passage of the immact in and of iirira in.applying the heavy presumptions against repeals by implication,see ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,radzanower touche ross,and against statutory retroactivity,see generally landgraf usi film products,we agree with that the adaa temporal limitation remains in effect as an exception to other temporal provisions enacted later,and precludes his deportation.
b.the adaa of 
the adaa of made a series of amendments to the ina.in it,congress,for the first time,both created the category of crimes denominated aggravated felonies,adaa,stat.at,and provided that any alien who was convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after entering the united states was subject to deportation.id.at a,stat.at adding aggravated felony convictions to the statutory list of grounds for deportation see also leocal ashcroft,tracing the origins of the term aggravated felony.
at the time it was enacted in,the adaa did not make deportable,for two reasons first,the adaa defined only murder,illegal drug trafficking,and firearm and destructive device trafficking sexual abuse of a aggravated felonies.see adaa second,the adaa was enacted on november,just over two months after was convicted of the underlying sodomy offense at issue here.a temporal limitation in the adaa expressly constrained the applicability of the new aggravated felony removal ground,providing 
the amendments made by a to ina a shall apply to any alien who has been convicted,on or after the date of the enactment of this act,of an aggravated felony.
adaa b,stat.at.
so,at the time of conviction for sexually molesting a minor,there was as yet no provision in the ina making aliens removable as a result of aggravated felony convictions.and when congress,just over two months later,enacted the adaa,created the category of aggravated felonies,and made conviction of an aggravated felony a ground for deportation,that ground for deportation a was expressly made inapplicable to individuals who,like,were convicted before the adaa enactment,and b did not cover sexual abuse crimes such as.
c.the immact of 
two years after it enacted the adaa,congress overhauled deportation law by passing the immact.like the adaa,the immact alone did not change immigration status,because it did not define crime,sexual abuse of a minor,as a deportable offense.the attorney general maintains,however,that of the immact did affect the temporal reach of adaa a,which had created the aggravated felony ground of deportation.
immact a replaced the ina list of grounds for deportation with a revised list.as recited in the text of immact a and codified at a,that revised list reiterated the aggravated felony ground and many of the other grounds for deportation,only redesignating them at new locations in the.immact a also altered or deleted certain other grounds of deportation,and added several new ones.see stat.at compare a with a supp.ii.
in addition,subject to certain exceptions,immact c and d stated that the revised list of grounds for deportation applied to all aliens regardless of their date of entry into the united states or the date of the facts that rendered them deportable.specifically,c,titled a savings provision,provided that 
notwithstanding the amendments made by this section,any alien who was deportable because of a conviction before the date of the enactment of this act of an offense referred to in paragraph,or of section a of the immigration and nationality act,as in effect before the date of the enactment of this act,shall be considered to remain so deportable.except as otherwise specifically provided in such section and subsection d,the provisions of such section,as amended by this section,shall apply to all aliens described in subsection a thereof notwithstanding that any such alien entered the united states before the date of enactment of this act,or the facts,by reason of which an alien is described in such subsection,occurred before the date of the enactment of this act.
stat.at.immact d,in turn,provided that t he amendments made by this section,and by section b of this act,shall not apply to deportation proceedings for which notice has been provided to the alien before march.stat.at.
in short,the immact did not make removable,because it still did not classify the sexual abuse of a minor as an aggravated felony for which one could be removed.nevertheless,both parties regard immact as central to whether the aggravated felony ground of deportation applies to.we will return to discuss that section below,but first we recount one final enactment amending the ina and affecting case.
in,six years after enacting the immact,congress passed the final piece of this statutory puzzle,iirira.iirira made crime a deportable offense by adding sexual abuse of a minor to the definition of aggravated felony.a a iirira a,stat.at.iirira amendment to the ina definition of aggravated felony finally brought crime within that definition.the amendment specified that this characterization applied regardless of whether the conviction was entered before,on,or after september,iirira b,and to actions taken on or after the date of the enactment of this act,regardless of when the conviction occurred,id.at c.see stat.at.
thus,iirira now classifies crime as an aggravated felony.but that classification alone does not render him removable.rather,is only removable under iirira if,as the government urges,of the immact repealed the section of the adaa specifying that an aggravated felony conviction entered prior to november,can not serve as the basis for a charge of removability.whether that is so is the central question in this case.
procedural history of this case 
on april,the bureau of customs and immigration enforcement,relying on iirira revised definition of aggravated felony,initiated removal proceedings against by filing a notice to appear.the notice charged with removability pursuant to a a iii as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony,sexual abuse of a minor,which is now an aggravated felony under a a 
an immigration judge ij determined that was removable as charged and denied on the merits his application for discretionary relief under former c of the ina,c in turn,the board of immigration appeals bia dismissed appeal from the ij decision,affirming both that he was removable and that he did not merit discretionary relief under former c.
six days later,filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court for the district of oregon.while that petition was pending,filed a timely petition for review with this court.the district court denied the habeas petition in a published decision,from which timely appeals.we treat appeal of the district court denial of his habeas petition as a timely filed petition for review,gonzales,cir,and consider it together with other petition,as the legal issues presented in the two petitions are identical.
ii.jurisdiction 
the question we or any other alien is removable for an aggravated felony conviction that occurred before november,purely one of law.we therefore have jurisdiction to review it under a d,as amended by the real id act of,div.b,a,stat.
iii.discussion 
pursuant to iirira,aliens convicted after the enactment of the adaa of crimes designated as aggravated felonies are deportable,regardless of when the crimes of which they were convicted were first defined as aggravated felonies.see ins,cir,however,was convicted before the adaa was enacted,and thus both before his crime was defined as an aggravated felony and before the introduction of the aggravated felony category as a ground for deportation.to resolve argument that the adaa temporal limitation on applicability prohibits removal for his conviction,we address in turn the two questions raised by the parties first,did of the immact preserve or override adaa b,the adaa temporal limitation on aggravated felony deportations second,if adaa b survived the immact,did iirira in eliminate its temporal limitation 
immact and adaa b 
to repeat,adaa b limited aggravated felony deportations to convictions obtained on or after november,while immact c,without mentioning aggravated felonies specifically,provided generally that,with a few exceptions,grounds for deportation should apply to all aliens,regardless of the date on which the facts triggering deportability occurred.
recognizing the surface tension between adaa b and immact c,urges us to conclude,first,that the latter did not expressly repeal the former,and,second,that the latter provision should not be read to repeal the former by implication,because doing so would violate both the presumption against implied repeals and the presumption against retroactively applied statutes.see generally ass of home builders,at landgraf.the attorney general,on the other hand,contends that immact c overrides the very specific directive of adaa b,a conclusion that the bia reached in matter of lettman,bia en banc.
we agree with.we explain,first,that,because this case involves the retroactive application of the immigration statutes,we are foreclosed from according chevron deference to the bia decision in lettman.see chevron,nat.res.def.council,ins cyr.we next conduct our own analysis of the immact and conclude that it can not be read to repeal adaa b either expressly or impliedly.finally,we consider whether this case is controlled by united states hovsepian,cir en banc and united states yacoubian,cir,two cases addressing firearms convictions covered by a clause similar to adaa b,but conclude that it is not.
the bia and chevron deference 
although the bia in matter of lettman addressed the very question before the immact repealed adaa b chevron deference to the bia decision is inappropriate.in ins cyr,the supreme court held that courts should not defer to agencies in determining whether a statute is to be applied retroactively,explaining that 
w e only defer to agency interpretations of statutes that,applying the normal tools of statutory construction,are ambiguous.chevron,at.because a statute that is ambiguous with respect to retroactive application is construed under our precedent to be unambiguously prospective,landgraf,at,there is,for chevron purposes,no ambiguity in such a statute for an agency to resolve.
cyr,at internal citations altered.
the government contends that the adaa,immact and enacted in november,in and in,removable as an aggravated felon on the basis of his september conviction.this contention raises a question of statutory retroactivity and so we must decide it ourselves see also ins,cir finding no occasion to apply chevron deference where the presumption against implied repeals resolved statutory ambiguity.
the bia committed an error of statutory interpretation.
if the bia reasoning in lettman were persuasive,we might nonetheless adopt it as our own.but the bia took a fundamentally wrong turn in its analysis,and so arrived at an interpretation at odds with the plain language of the two statutes.matter of lettman concentrated on the except clause in immact c,which provides except as otherwise specifically provided in such section and subsection d the bia determined,first,that the clause excepted from the rest of immact c the portions of ina that otherwise conflicted with c.but c was ambiguous,the agency concluded,about which version of ina the immact provision referred to in the except clause.at.lettman position was that the except clause referred to the version of ina is,ina as it stood after the adaa passage,before the immact amended it.id.at.the bia rejected this reading of the statute and instead adopted the immigration and naturalization service ins position that the clause referred to the version of ina.id.at.having made that determination,the bia went on to conclude that c of the immact overrode b of the adaa,because the version of ina contained no temporal limitation on the application of the aggravated felony ground for deportation.
as it turns out,however,it does not matter whether immact c should be read to refer to the or the version of a.contrary to lettman supposition,the answer to that question has no bearing on whether the adaa temporal limitation survived the immact passage.
the key to the bia mistake is this adaa b was never part of the text of ina at all.true,adaa a provided section a of the ina a is amended by inserting after the semicolon the aggravated felony ground for deportation.but the text of adaa b,unlike subsection a,contained no reference to ina,or to its codified version.instead,b reads only the amendments made by subsection a of adaa shall apply to any alien who has been convicted,on or after the date of the enactment of this act,of an aggravated felony.
in other words,adaa b was never a subsection of ina.instead,it was always an entirely freestanding temporal limitation provision.as a result,neither the except clause of immact c except as otherwise specifically provided in such section and subsection d,nor the affirmative provision of c second sentence the provisions of such section,as amended by this section,shall apply to all aliens described in subsection a thereof,can describe the fate of adaa b,because b was never in such section.thus,whichever version of ina the except clause and the affirmative language of immact c refer to,neither reference to such section refers to b or tells us whether b was alive or dead after the enactment of the immact.
in sum,lettman is not entitled to chevron deference because it involves a question of statutory retroactivity.while we might nonetheless follow its reasoning if it were persuasive,we decline to do so because its reasoning can not be squared with the statute 
implied repeal 
even though the bia reasoning in lettman was fundamentally flawed,we might still reach,for independent reasons,the conclusion that congress intended those convicted of aggravated felonies before the adaa enactment to be removable.but for the immact and iirira to apply retroactively beyond,congress had to repeal adaa b.as we have seen,immact c did not expressly repeal adaa b,so the repeal,if there was any at all,must have been by implication.our question thus becomes whether b of the act was impliedly repealed.applying the extremely strict standards for finding an implied repeal,we conclude that it was not.
as the supreme court has had the occasion to remind us recently,repeals by implication are not favored and will not be presumed unless the intention of the legislature to repeal is clear and manifest.ass of home builders,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.there are narrow circumstances in which implied repeals will be recognized,however.broadly speaking,
i t is a basic principle of statutory construction that a statute dealing with a narrow,precise,and specific subject is not submerged by a later enacted statute covering a more generalized spectrum,unless the later statute expressly contradicts the original act or unless such a construction is absolutely necessary in order that the words of the later statute shall have any meaning at all.
traynor turnage,internal quotation marks,alterations,and citations omitted.more specifically,the supreme court has recognized two categories of repeals by implication where provisions in the two acts are in irreconcilable conflict and where the later act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute.radzanower touche ross.
under either rubric,we can not conclude that a later statute impliedly repeals an earlier one unless the intention of the legislature to repeal is clear and manifest.ass of home builders,at alterations in original quoting watt alaska.and such an intention is not clear and manifest simply because the two statutes produce differing results when applied to the same factual situation.radzanower,at.t hat,the supreme court has pronounced,no more than states the problem.rather,when two statutes are capable of,it is the duty of the courts to regard each as effective.id.quoting morton mancari,ellipsis in original.
applying these principles,b oth this court and the supreme court have found no implied repeal where,by creating minor exceptions to statutes based on earlier ones,both statutes can be preserved,at.in donaldson united states,cir,for example,we characterized as a small puncture in a broad shield the relationship between an earlier statute regarding resort owners liability and a later statute that applied to all real property owners.id.at.although the two statutes conflicted on their face,we reconciled them by allowing the earlier statute to serve as a narrow exception to the later one.
similarly,preserved a provision in the federal first offender act ffoa as an exception to a later law that defined the term conviction for immigration purposes.the ffoa provision allowed courts to sentence the defendant in a manner that prevents him from suffering any disability imposed by law on account of the finding of guilt.at.the immigration law would otherwise have conflicted with the ffoa.but we held that the earlier statute was not irreconcilable with the thus not impliedly to resolve the conflict between the two,w e need ed only construe the immigration law as subject to the minor exception required by the provisions of the ffoa.id.at see also id.at discussing similar analysis in radzanower and nlrb kolkka,cir.
applying these precepts,adaa and immact c meet neither implied repeal standard.
it is quite evident that immact c is a more general statutory provision than adaa b.immact c directs generally that revised ina applies without regard to whether the facts,by reason of which an alien is described as removable in ina,occurred prior to immact enactment.but it does not specifically cover the impact of convictions for crimes generally,or the impact of convictions in particular.adaa b,in contrast,narrowly and expressly covered both of these considerations,and,even more narrowly,did so with regard to the aggravated felony ground of deportation only.
true,when applied after to aggravated felony convictions,the affirmative provision of immact c,which covers all of ina,could,read literally,produce a differing result when applied to the same factual situation as adaa b.radzanower,at.that is,with the except clause out of the picture,immact c,on its face,could be read to allow deportation for such convictions,while adaa b would not.but,as radzanower teaches,that states the implied repeal problem but does not resolve it.id.at.to resolve the problem,radzanower and its progeny inform us,we must consider whether,like the preexisting narrow statutes at issue in and other cases,the earlier and narrower statutory provision b must be construed as a minor exception to the very general language of the later statutory c.we determine that it must,for several reasons.
first,construing adaa b as an exception to the broad reach of immact c would certainly be a small puncture in a broad shield.donaldson,at.adaa b addresses only one of many categories of deportable offenses.aggravated felony convictions constitute one of the approximately thirty grounds for deportation and fourteen categories of deportable criminal offenses that immact a listed.further,with the passage of time,the pool of otherwise deportable aliens who committed aggravated a small percentage of all deportable aggravated continue to shrink.
second,nothing in the text of the immact indicates a clear intention,radzanower,at,to apply the broad language of immact c so as to repeal the very precise,narrow directive of adaa b.nor does anything in the text preclude interpreting adaa b as a narrow exception to immact.the except clause of c shows that congress anticipated some tension between immact c and ina,but,without more,we can not conclude that this clause shows the requisite congressional intent to repeal a separate provision specifically addressing retroactivity of a small subset of deportation grounds,adaa b 
third,when adaa b was enacted,ina already contained a provision nearly identical to the second sentence of immact c.ina d,d,provided 
except as otherwise specifically provided in this section,the provisions of this section shall be applicable to all aliens belonging to any of the classes enumerated in subsection a of this section,notwithstanding that any such alien entered the united states prior to june,or that the facts,by reason of which any such alien belongs to any of the classes enumerated in subsection a of this section,occurred prior to june.
at the time of its enactment,adaa b unarguably presented an exception to former ina d,even though it was not an exception specifically provided in this section because adaa b was a freestanding provision never incorporated in ina.immact c performs essentially the same function as former ina d as adaa b was a freestanding exception to former ina d,then the similar language of immact c,making no mention whatever of adaa b,should also be read as compatible with ada b,rather than as doing away with that section sub silentio.
fourth,the legislative history of immact is of no additional assistance in demonstrating a clear and manifest intention to repeal adaa b.the conference report on the immact makes clear that immact a was to replace the former ina a by updating the grounds for deportation and consolidat ing related grounds in order to make the law more rational and easy to understand.matter of lettman,at quoting,at,reprinted in.but neither that conference report nor any other legislative history document we have found discusses immact c in any regard,or reports the intended effect of the immact on adaa b or similar provisions.compare novak,at concluding that a statute impliedly repealed another in part because the legislative history showed congress was aware of the potential conflict between the two laws when the later statute was passed.
fifth and finally,when other provisions of the immact are taken into account,it becomes apparent that congress did not intend to repeal adaa b,because doing so would have produced exceedingly odd results.see generally sheridan united states,explaining that courts should strive to avoid attributing absurd designs to congress.
the peculiar outcome we must strive to avoid would result from the interaction of immact c and immact,which amended the definition of the term aggravated felony.section broadened the definition of the term aggravated felony by,inter alia,adding certain controlled substance trafficking crimes and crimes of violence to the list of qualifying crimes in ina a.immact a,stat.at.so,like the adaa,the immact treated the definition of aggravated felony as distinct from the aggravated felony ground for deportation.the immact also separately specified the temporal reach of the new definition immact b provided that four of the six amendments added by,including the addition of crimes of violence,would apply only to offenses committed on or after the date of the enactment of the immact.stat.at.two other amendments,including addition of certain controlled substance trafficking offenses,applied as if they had been included in the adaa definition of aggravated felony.id.
section b reference to the adaa indicates that congress considered b of that act as continuing in force.were b impliedly repealed by immact,the provision in immact itself specifying that certain of the amendments contained in a would be effective as if included in the enactment of section of the abuse act of would be pointless.for,if immact c in fact eliminated adaa b,the pivotal provision in the act concerning the temporal impact of the aggravated felony definition would no longer exist,and there would be no reason to refer in immact to the adaa,rather than to c of immact itself,as the source of effective date provisions concerning amendments to the aggravated felony definition 
moreover,if b is read as having incorporated the temporal limitations of the adaa with regard only to some of the immact definitional amendments,that reading would produce exceedingly peculiar results for aliens who committed money laundering and crimes of defined as aggravated felonies in immact a the new aggravated felony definition would apply prospectively,so that only aliens who committed such crimes after immact passage in could be deported as aggravated felons.but aliens who committed the controlled substance or state law offenses referenced in immact b before,like aliens who committed aggravated felonies included in the adaa but were convicted prior to the adaa passage,would suddenly become deportable with the enactment of the immact.such a reading would mean that the immact,for no apparent reason,protected from deportation some,but not all,aggravated felons who committed crimes before the aggravated felony ground of deportation was created.
this division would make no sense.instead,in light of immact b reference to the adaa,and b apparent purpose to limit the instances in which criminal aliens were retroactively categorized as deportable,it becomes evident that the congress intended generally to preserve the adaa determination that an aggravated felon would be deportable as such only if convicted of the crime in question,at the earliest,after november,is,after conviction of an aggravated felony became a deportable offense.
the dissent argues that the bia read immact c as part of a wholesale revision of ina,a new statutory scheme,embracing comprehensive changes,dissent at quoting lettman,at,and thus,as a repeal by way of complete substitution,which is not the sort of implied repeal that is discouraged by our presumption.id.at citing ass of home builders,at.the dissent view of the bia opinion as properly resting on a complete substitution implied repeal theory and as therefore entitled to deference can not be right,for three reasons.
first,the bia stated in lettman that its reading of c comports with our understanding that the purpose of of the act was to completely revise the deportation grounds.lettman,at emphasis added.that is,it came to its reading of c quite apart from the complete revision rationale,namely because it considered c reference to ina a to encompass adaa b expressly.the bia never directly addressed the presumption against implied repeals before settling upon its interpretation of c.as we have already shown,adaa b was never a part of ina,so whatever the bia believed about a being intended to replace former section a in its entirety,lettman,at,such a complete replacement would not directly have affected the meaning of c.
second,even taking the bia decision on its own terms as the dissent suggests we should and presuming that the bia regarded immact c as a complete revision of the deportation provisions of the ina,the bia statutory construction in matter of lettman was not well within the general principles applicable to implied repeals.see dissent at.matter of lettman stated that there would be no point in enacting a new statutory scheme if the intent was to keep the former version of the law in control whenever there was a difference between the old and the new.we can not conclude that this was the intention of congress.at.the bia reasoning,and the dissent attempt to portray lettman as properly applying the demanding requirements for an implied repeal,do not work.
posadas national city bank,explains 
the cardinal rule is that repeals by implication are not favored.where there are two acts upon the same subject,effect should be given to both if possible.there are two categories of repeals by implication where provisions in the two acts are in irreconcilable conflict,the later act to the extent of the conflict constitutes an implied repeal of the earlier one and if the later act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute,it will operate similarly as a repeal of the earlier act.but,in either case,the intention of the legislature to repeal must be clear and manifest otherwise,at least as a general thing,the later act is to be construed as a continuation of,and not a substitute for,the first act.
id.at emphasis added.as we have shown extensively,immact was by no means clearly intended to repeal the adaa generally,and the dissent fails to identify any clear and manifest congressional intent to do so.instead,the dissent is forced to infer a repeal,see dissent at,contrary to the supreme court directive not to infer a statutory repeal unless the later statute expressly contradicts the original act or unless such a construction is absolutely necessary in order that the words of the later statute shall have any meaning at all.ass of home builders,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.boardmember rosenberg,dissenting from the majority decision in matter of lettman,showed at length why the immact did not replace the aggravated felony provisions of the adaa,but only redesignated them.at,rosenberg,dissenting moreover,matter of lettman does not discuss immact b and so does not recognize the inconsistency between that section and a wholesale revision implied repeal theory.
third,chevron does not apply here in the first place.as explained above,because the presumptions against retroactivity and against implied repeals remove any potential ambiguity that an agency might otherwise resolve,chevron deference has no role to play.see cyr,at,at.
for all these reasons,we conclude that immact c did not repeal adaa b.
ii.immact d 
the effective date provision in the following subsection,immact d,does not serve to overcome the presumption against implied repeal either.that section is fully consistent with interpreting adaa b specific mandate that the aggravated felony ground of deportation is not retroactive as a minor exception to immact c general retroactivity provision.
immact d states that amendments to ina shall not apply to deportation proceedings for which notice has been provided to the alien before march.the second circuit in bell held that d directs that the grounds for deportation in a apply to all aliens who received notice on or after march.see bell,at but this mode of interpreting an effective date provision has been definitively rejected.as the supreme court held in cyr,a statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.cyr,at quoting landgraf,at.thus,a simple effective date provision can not impliedly repeal all previous temporal limitations on the application of grounds of deportability.
iii.summary 
in sum,application of the implied repeal doctrine demands that we interpret as leaving the temporal limitation on the aggravated felony ground of deportation intact.we therefore need not consider argument that the bia interpretation also violates our presumption against retroactively applied statutes under the second step of the landgraf retroactivity analysis.under landgraf,when a statute contains no express command about retroactivity,the court must determine whether application of the new statute would have retroactive effect,and,if it determines it would have such an effect,the court must decline to apply the statute.landgraf,at.because congress dealt with retroactivity expressly in adaa b and because we conclude that congress has not repealed adaa b,we do not need to proceed to the second step of the landgraf analysis.hovsepian,at concluding,in a related context,that the landgraf presumption did not apply to immact,because c represented an express statement that immact a should be applied retroactively see also bell,at concluding that matter of lettman was unreasonable because it failed to take into account the landgraf presumption against retroactively applied statutes.we do,however,address the government concern that our analysis today is foreclosed by our previous applications of immact c.
hovsepian and yacoubian 
we previously considered immact c in hovsepian and yacoubian.these cases concerned two aliens who were convicted at trial of destructive device offenses in,prior to enactment of the adaa.at that time,the convictions would not have rendered the aliens deportable under the firearms category of offenses.in,however,the adaa,in addition to defining the term aggravated felony and designating aggravated felonies as a category of deportable offense,amended ina a to expand the list of firearms and destructive device convictions that could serve as a basis for deportation.see adaa a at the same time,in language identical to that of adaa b,adaa b limited the amendment to the firearms ground to convictions on or after the adaa enactment.despite that temporal limitation,we have twice held that immact c rendered aliens deportable based on their convictions.hovsepian,at yacoubian,at.
because of the similarity between the adaa temporal limitation at issue in hovsepian and yacoubian and adaa b,at issue here,those cases inform our analysis today.but they do not control our resolution of petition,because the adaa and the immact treated the offenses at issue in hovsepian and yacoubian differently from aggravated felonies in a critical respect.in ina a,which lists the grounds for deportation,the adaa inserted only a reference to aggravated felony convictions generally it did not further define the term aggravated felony.then,the adaa inserted into the ina definitional section,see ina a a,a definition of the term aggravated felony.for firearms offenses,in contrast,the adaa made no such structural division,but instead inserted into ina a directly an expanded list of firearms the illegal possession of which would render an alien deportable.
the immact continued the adaa distinct structural treatment of the aggravated felony and firearm categories of deportable offenses.like the adaa,the immact amended the aggravated felony definition in ina,while continuing to reference only the term aggravated felony in ina a,the statutory list of grounds for deportation.by contrast,the immact once again broadened the category of deportable firearms offenses by amending ina a directly.as a result of this distinction,there was no need for a provision of the immact pertinent to firearms offenses that is parallel to of that statute and there is none.
these two related structural distinctions between the aggravated felony and firearms categories of offenses are critical here.combined,they explain why the implied repeal question in hovsepian and yacoubian was fundamentally different from the one we decide today 
first,because there is no immact provision applicable to firearms offenses that is parallel to immact b,no peculiar result has ensued from our holding that the immact repealed adaa b,regarding firearms deportations.as we have seen,because of immact b,an implied repeal of adaa b,with respect to aggravated felony convictions covered by the adaa but not by the immact,would mean that some aggravated felons could be deported for convictions that occurred before aggravated felony convictions were made a ground for deportation,while others could not,for no discernible reason.but the implied repeal of adaa b,regarding firearms deportations,creates no comparably odd outcome.the immact did not include a separate temporal reach provision governing firearms convictions that is in tension with immact c.
second,immact a the firearms ground for deportability from the version contained in the adaa in doing so,the bia concluded,immact a enact ed a new statutory provision that completely supersedes all former versions of that firearms deportation ground.matter of chow,at emphasis added.we agree immact a made adaa b,regarding the deportation consequences of certain firearms convictions,no longer applicable at all,working a complete revision of the firearms ground for deportation 
in contrast,immact a changed only the statutory placement of the aggravated felony ground within ina a,but made no change to the substance of the aggravated felony ground for deportation.compare a b any alien in the united states shall,upon the order of the attorney general,be deported who b is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after entry with a a iii supp.ii any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after entry is deportable.so the complete revision implied repeal theory was applicable in hovsepian and yacoubian,but is not applicable here.see also matter of lettman,at rosenberg,dissenting explaining that with section a of the act congress only changed the numerical designation of some deportation grounds,while with others,such as that governing firearms violations,it completely substituted the text of the new section for that of the former section internal citations omitted.
to summarize for aggravated felonies,our implied repeal analysis is informed by considerations quite different from those relevant to firearms offenses.we hold that unlike adaa b,regarding firearms offenses,adaa b,regarding aggravated felonies,survived the immact.
to complete the saga of adaa b,we consider finally whether that provision also survived iirira,the reform of immigration law that added sexual abuse of a minor to the aggravated felony definition,iirira a,and made the amended definition applicable to all aliens,regardless of their date of conviction,iirira b.noting our prior holding that iirira clearly manifested an intent for the amended definition of aggravated felony to apply retroactively,at,the district court in habeas proceeding concluded that iirira b erased the adaa temporal limitation because changing the meaning of a statutory term necessarily changes the effect of the statute using that term,d at id.at quoting.
we can not agree.as we have clarified,it is settled law that the definitional statute,iirira,which defines certain crimes as aggravated felonies,applies regardless of the date of the crime.gonzales,cir.but iirira effective date provisions do not control the substantive immigration consequences of iirira emphasis added even when those consequences turn on an aggravated felony conviction.id.at recognizing that the definition of aggravated felony applies to all aliens,but nevertheless analyzing separately the temporal reach of an iirira provision making aggravated felons ineligible for cancellation of removal as emphasizes,there are a host of consequences of being an aggravated felon other than removability and in addition to this court,both the supreme court and the immigration agencies have consistently determined the temporal reach of those consequences of aggravated felony convictions separately from the temporal reach of the aggravated felony definition,even in the wake of iirira see,b limiting the aggravated felony bar to good moral character determinations to convictions that occurred on or after november,see also cyr,at holding that a law that prohibited aggravated felons from applying for relief from deportation could not apply retroactively matter of,bia discussing individual temporal limitations on the consequences of aggravated felonies.
there has been no suggestion that any provision in iirira other than affects adaa b.we therefore hold that the adaa temporal limitation on aggravated felony removals survived not only the immact but also iirira.in other words,the law remains that pursuant to adaa b,the aggravated felony ground for deportation shall apply only to any alien who has been convicted,on or after the date of enactment of adaa,of an aggravated felony.
iv.conclusion 
is not removable by reason of being an aggravated felon,because a a iii does not apply to convictions,like,that occurred prior to november.consequently,we grant petition for review,vacate the district court denial of his habeas petition,and dismiss his appeal as moot.
petition for review granted remanded.
vacated and dismissed.
there is no polite way to say this the statutory scheme we are required to parse in this case is a mess.it is a model of ambiguity and misdirection.that fact,of course,does not give us license to impose our own reading on the statute,but means that we must accept an agency construction of the statute so long as it is reasonable.chevron,usa,natural res.def.council.the majority declines to accept the bia reading and imposes its own interpretation based on what it calls the plain language of the statutes.op.at.whether the majority has improved on the bia analysis is for the reasons i explain,i quite doubt we do not have to be confident of our analysis,we only have to be confident that the bia is reasonable.and of that,i am percent confident.indeed,so twisted and complex are the provisions at issue here of spitting in a bia could have concluded almost anything in this case and been reasonable.there is nothing plain about these statutes.if chevron means anything,this is a classic case for deferring to the agency.
in september,an oregon state court convicted ramon of sodomy for sexually molesting a minor.the crime for which he was convicted constitutes sexual abuse of a minor,which is an aggravated felony under current law,see a a,and therefore a basis for removal under a a iii.the bia,consistent with its en banc decision in in re lettman,bia,held that he is removable.in lettman,the bia found that the relevant statutory provisions were difficult to decipher,ambiguous,and capable of different readings,but reasoned that the amendments to the ina dictate that any alien who has been convicted of a crime defined as an aggravated felony,and who was placed in deportation proceedings on or after march,is deportable regardless of when the conviction occurred.id.at.
the majority disagrees.arguing that the presumptions against retroactivity and against implied repeals remove any potential ambiguity,the majority finds that chevron deference has no role to play.op.at citing ins cyr,u.as a result,the majority concludes,we must decide it ourselves.id.at.applying de novo review,it then holds that ledezma can not be removed because the law making aliens convicted of aggravated felonies deportable does not apply to aliens convicted of aggravated felonies prior to november.id.at.the majority admits that this creates a small puncture in a broad shield because aliens are deportable for any number of offenses committed prior to.id.at citation omitted.according to the majority decision,congress intended to create this minor exception,and as a result,aliens who sexually abuse minors will not be subject to deportation so long as they committed the crime before.
in the process of discarding the bia considered decision,the majority not only takes issue with the agency,but it also creates a clear split with the fourth and eleventh circuits,which recognized that the statutes are ambiguous and have held that the bia construction of the ina in lettman is reasonable.lettman reno,cir opinion per goodwin,lewis ins,cir.furthermore,the majority decision flies in the teeth of our en banc decision in united states hovsepian,cir.in hovsepian we approved the same reasoning the bia employed in this case as applied to a parallel section of the same act.indeed,were the issue to come before the bia again,hovsepian would likely compel the conclusion the bia reached in lettman.
i respectfully dissent.
my objections to the majority analysis begin with the familiar chevron.at.first,the reviewing court must determine whether the statute is ambiguous if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous then the reviewing court does not impose its own construction of the statute,but rather it decides whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.gonzales dep t of homeland,cir quoting chevron,at.the agency interpretation is entitled to deference unless that interpretation is contrary to the plain and sensible meaning of the statute.simeonov ashcroft,cir.if a court concludes that an agency decision was based,at least in part,on ambiguity in the applicable statutes then the court must give deference to the agency resolution of these ambiguities.gonzales,at.
the majority discards chevron from the outset because a statute that is ambiguous with respect to retroactive application is construed under our precedent to be unambiguously prospective,and there is,for chevron purposes,no ambiguity in such a statute to resolve.cyr,at citing landgraf usi film products,see op.at.the majority reliance on the presumption against retroactivity is misplaced here,for two reasons.first,as i will discuss in the greater detail in the next sections,the bia was quite clear in lettman that it was not merely construing a retroactivity provision its judgment did not rest on its interpretation of an isolated provision,but rather it took guidance from the statute as a whole.lettman,at.specifically,the bia found that the immact completely revised the deportation grounds in the ina indeed,the immact was intended to replace the former section in its entirety.id.at.as the bia found,
our reading comports with our understanding that the purpose of of the immact was to completely revise the deportation grounds.with this in mind,we find it difficult to believe that congress intended to revise the deportation grounds,but still have the former act ultimately determine deportability.in other words,it makes no sense to enact a whole new provision,yet keep the former version perpetually intact.
id.at.bia view of the effect of the immact on the comprehensive immigration scheme in the ina is plainly worthy of deference.
second,the court retroactivity concerns in cyr do not apply here.in cyr,the court invoked the landgraf presumption against retroactivity because the government argument for retroactive repeal of rights rested on structural arguments about iirira,an effective date for iirira,and a savings provision,none of which actually said anything specific about retroactivity.see cyr,at.by contrast,the court pointed to a number of provisions in iirira that indicate d unambiguously its intention to apply specific provisions retroactively.id.at.exhibit for the court was iirira b,which amended the definition of aggravated felony and clearly states that it applies with respect to conviction s entered before,on,or after the statute enactment date.id.at.remarkably,the provision at issue here,immact c,employs nearly identical language to iirira b.compare immact c the provisions of such section shall apply to all aliens described in subsection a notwithstanding that the facts,by reason of which an alien is described in such subsection,occurred before the date of the enactment of this act emphasis added with iirira b the term applies regardless of whether the conviction was entered before,on,or after the date of enactment of this paragraph emphasis added.in sum,the provision at issue here,immact c,is not a statute that is ambiguous with respect to retroactive application.cyr,at.section c for reasons i will ambiguous,but it is not ambiguous about whether congress intended retroactive application.section c is,precisely,an express command about retroactivity,landgraf,at,in which congress indicate d unambiguously its intention to apply specific provisions retroactively.cyr,at see hovsepian,at holding that c directed with the requisite clarity that the law be applied retrospectively.the question of to whom a retroactive provision applies is quite different from whether a statute has retroactive effect.the court in cyr was concerned with the latter we are dealing with the former.
for these reasons,i would afford chevron deference to the bia construction of the ina,as amended by these statutes.in any event,i do not think this case ultimately turns on whether we defer to the bia views,because the bia quite reasonable reading of the statutes is also the best reading of those statutes.i now turn to these complicated acts to put in context the bia construction.
congress first created the category of crimes denominated aggravated felonies in the abuse act of adaa,stat.the adaa added the category of an alien who is convicted of any aggravated felony at any time after entry to the statutory grounds for deportation,which were enumerated in section a of the immigration and nationality act,a.see adaa a.the adaa defined the term aggravated felony as any drug trafficking crime any illicit trafficking in any firearms or destructive devices or any attempt or conspiracy to commit any such act,committed within the united states.id.in,the crime for which ledezma had been for sexually molesting a not fall within this original definition of aggravated felony.
the provision adding aggravated felony as a ground for deportation was immediately followed by an applicability clause 
b amendments made by subsection a shall apply to any alien who has been convicted,on or after the date of the enactment of this act,of an aggravated felony.
adaa b.thus,under the adaa,the deportation provisions for aggravated felons applied only prospectively to aliens convicted of an aggravated felony on or after november.it follows that as of ledezma would not fall under the new deportation provisions both because his crime did not qualify and because he had been convicted prior to this date.
in,congress passed the immigration act of the immact,stat,to change the level,and preference system for admission,of immigrants to the united states,and to provide for administrative naturalization,and for other purposes.id.the immact did not merely amend prior law,it overhauled a by repromulgating the entire section.thus,replaced the grounds for deportation in a with a revised list that continued to include conviction for an aggravated felony.immact a see ina a a iii.section c described how the revised section would apply 
c savings the amendments made by this section,any alien who was deportable because of a conviction before the date of the enactment of this act of an offense referred to in paragraphs,or of section a of the immigration and nationality act,as in effect before the date of the enactment of this act,shall be considered to remain so deportable.except as otherwise specifically provided in such section and subsection d,the provisions of such section,as amended by this section,shall apply to all aliens described in subsection a thereof notwithstanding that any such alien entered the united states before the date of the enactment of this act,or the facts,by reason of which an alien is described in such subsection,occurred before the date of the enactment of this act.
the meaning of the first sentence is clear any alien who could have been deported for certain acts before the passage of the immact can still be deported.
the second sentence is a nightmare.the sentence begins e xcept as otherwise specifically provided in such section and subsection d.it is unclear what such section means.one possibility favoring ledezma is that such section refers to ina a as in effect before the enactment of the immact,which might include the applicability provision in adaa b.because b specifically provide s that the aggravated felony category does not apply to crimes committed prior to november,under this reading,immact c could except ledezma from deportation on that ground.a second possibility favoring the government is that the second reference in c to such section makes it clear that it is such section,as amended by this section.if such section refers to a of the ina,as amended by the immact,then a,as amended,is retroactive and an alien like ledezma who committed a qualifying felony before may be deported.to sum,under the first interpretation,we would read c to say 
except as otherwise specifically provided by former ina a,ina a,as amended by immact a,shall apply to all aliens described in section ina a notwithstanding that any such alien entered the united states before the date of the enactment of this act,or the facts,by reason of which an alien is described in such subsection,occurred before the date of the immact.
if the second interpretation prevailed,we would read c in this way 
except as otherwise specifically provided,ina a,as amended by immact a,shall apply to all aliens described in section ina a notwithstanding that any such alien entered the united states before the date of the enactment of this act,or the facts,by reason of which an alien is described in such subsection,occurred before the date of the immact.
in my view,the latter reading is consistent with the overall theme of,which expands rather than restricts the statute applicability.it is also consistent with the idea that immact was a recodification of ina,because it means that c is the sole provision we need consult to determine a applicability.i believe that the second sentence creates a rule,applicable to all of the provisions of ina a,that unless the act specifically directs otherwise an alien is deportable for the enumerated grounds even if such conduct occurred before the date of the immact was enacted.i admit,however,that the second sentence of c is so badly written that no one can opine on its meaning with absolute confidence.in any event,enactment of the immact had no immediate impact on ledezma immigration status,because sexual abuse of a minor was not yet defined as an aggravated felony,and therefore was not a ground for deportation under ina a.
in the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira,div.c,title iii,stat,congress added sexual abuse of a minor to the definition of aggravated felony,rendering ledezma sodomy conviction for sexually abusing a minor a deportable offense.see iirira a,codified at a a.furthermore,congress explicitly provided that this new definition of aggravated felony applied retroactively.iirira b provided 
effective date of a a is amended by adding at the end the following new sentence notwithstanding any other provision of law including any effective date,the term applies regardless of whether the conviction was entered before,on,or after the date of enactment of this paragraph.
additionally,congress provided that t he amendments made by this section shall apply to actions taken on or after the date of the enactment of this act,regardless of when the conviction occurred.iirira c.when read together,the two provisions required that the modified definition of aggravated felony apply to convictions that occurred before the enactment of iirira,but only if the immigration proceeding were initiated after enactment of the act 
to summarize,in,congress made aliens convicted of an aggravated felony deportable.adaa a.the term aggravated felony was narrowly defined and did not include sexual abuse of a minor.adaa.congress provided that the aggravated felon provision would not apply retroactively to aliens who were convicted prior to the enactment of the adaa.adaa b.in,congress generally revised the grounds for deportation in the ina.immact a.congress expanded the definition of aggravated felony,but the definition still did not include sexual abuse of a minor.immact.simultaneously,congress provided that the new deportation provisions would apply to aliens even if the facts making them deportable occurred before enactment of the immact,thus overriding the previous applicability provision.finally,in,congress amended the definition of aggravated felony to include sexual abuse of a minor,thus making ledezma an alien convicted of an aggravated felony.iirira a.congress chose to apply the amended definition retroactively to convictions that occurred prior to the enactment of iirira.id.b.read together,these immigration statutes made ledezma subject to removal.
in a lengthy decision in in re lettman,the bia reviewed these acts,the legislative history,prior judicial decisions,and the arguments on both sides.it then held that an alien is subject to deportation regardless of the date of conviction if his crime fits within the definition of aggravated felony,bia en banc.the bia concluded that the language of immact c eliminated the date restriction on the aggravated felony ground set forth in the adaa.id.
the bia began from the premise that immact a completely revised the deportation grounds that were found in section a of the act,by reorganizing,renumbering certain grounds,and substantively revising the grounds for deportation.id.at.section a of the act was therefore intended to replace former section a in its entirety.id.
the board then turned to the effect of a.it acknowledge d from the outset that the second sentence of section c is difficult to decipher,even after considerable examination,and found it to be an ambiguous provision,which is capable of different readings id.at.after considering the arguments of the parties and of amici,the board concluded that such section must refer to ina,as amended by the immact,and that except as otherwise provided in section,as amended in,an alien is deportable for an enumerated ground despite the date of entry or the date of the underlying facts which establish deportability.id.the bia reasoned that,although the matter was not free from doubt,it made no sense that congress would enact a whole new provision,yet keep the former version perpetually intact.id.the rule adopted by the bia was straightforward any alien who has been convicted of a crime defined as an aggravated felony,and who was placed in deportation proceedings on or after march,is deportable regardless of when the conviction occurred.id.at.
the eleventh circuit reviewed the bia decision in lettman reno,cir,and agreed with its analysis.in an opinion by our own judge goodwin,the court held that ina section a a iii authorizes the deportation of aliens convicted of aggravated felonies at any time after entry.id.at.as the court explained the problem 
our decision turns on whether,as the bia held,the aggravated felony deportation ground applies notwithstanding that the facts occurred before the date of this act.immact c.the question depends largely on the application of such section in section c.if such section refers to the aggravated felony ground with the date restriction intact,as enacted by the adaa in prior to immact,then the language stating e xcept as otherwise specifically provided in such section would remove the aggravated felony ground from the ambit of c.on the other hand,as the government argues,if such section refers to the aggravated felony ground without the date restriction,as enacted by immact which did not expressly reenact the date restriction,then c survives to effect deportability,unaffected by adaa b.
id.at parentheticals omitted.the court concluded that the bia reasonably interpreted such section to refer to the aggravated felony ground without the adaa date restriction.id.
the fourth circuit arrived at the same conclusion in lewis ins,cir.the court acknowledged the ambiguity of the statute,stating it can not conclude that congressional intent is clear and unequivocal here.id.at.the court concluded that the board interpretation is certainly,we would likely reach the same conclusion.id 
the majority opinion has not improved on the bia reasoning.indeed,it falls well short of demonstrating that the bia construction of a badly written set of statutes is not only a permissible one,but the best one.
the majority argues that because adaa b was not included in the text of the ina,the immact could not have affected adaa b.op.at.i believe the majority to be in error on this point.
there are essentially two problems with the majority theory.first,the majority is wrong because adaa b no longer applies to ina a.section b only modified the changes imposed by a,see adaa b the amendments made by subsection a shall apply to,and a was overwritten by immact a.indeed,after a rewrote ina a,and thus made a inoperative,the bia reasonably,in my the retroactivity provision imposed by adaa b no longer applied.see lettman,at.
second,if the majority were correct,and adaa b was not included in any part of the ina,then b still can not be an exception to the broad retroactivity provision in immact c.section c applies a general rule of retroactivity,e xcept as otherwise specifically provided in such section of the ina.if adaa b was never part of any provision of the ina,then i simply can not understand how the mandate of adaa b was specifically provided in such section.in other words,once the majority concludes that b is entirely excluded from the ina,it can not conveniently slip b back into the ina for purposes of applying the except clause under immact c.
in sum,the bia reasonably concluded adaa b no longer applies because b only modifies a and the amendments imposed by a were overwritten in.moreover,taking the majority claim that b was never part of the ina as true,b can not serve as a section of the ina that would bring it within the exception enumerated in immact c.the bia committed no error here,and certainly no error that would allow us to ignore chevron.
the majority makes at least two errors in its statutory interpretation analysis.first,even if this case involved an implied,as explained below,i believe it does bia did not err in concluding that immact repealed the retroactivity provision in adaa b as applied to the changes implemented by adaa a.the presumption against implied repeals is just that a presumption,not a rule.see united states novak,cir applying the presumption against implied repeals and finding that the presumption was rebutted by the language of the statute.the bia has fully explained why any presumption is overcome its understanding was that the purpose of section of the act was to completely revise the deportation grounds.lettman,at.the immact,the bia explained,was a wholesale revision of,a new statutory scheme,embracing comprehensive changes.id.at.based on that premise,the bia conclusion makes perfect sense 
with this in mind,we find it difficult to believe that congress intended to revise the deportation grounds,but still have the former act ultimately determine deportability.in other words,it makes no sense to enact a whole new provision,yet keep the former version perpetually intact.
a house committee report supports the bia interpretation,describing the statute in the following terms 
the immact substantially revised the immigration law of the united states.in fact,the act constituted the most comprehensive of immigration law in years.every major area of the law,with the one exception of refugee matters,was amended.
at,reprinted in.indeed,even today majority notes that congress overhauled deportation law by passing the immact.op.at.the bia can hardly be faulted for coming to the same conclusion.
a repeal through a wholesale revision of the section is not the sort of implied repeal that is discouraged by our presumption.a statutory repeal may be properly inferred where the latter act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute.ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,internal quotation marks omitted quoting branch smith,the bia construction of is well within the general principles applicable to implied repeals.
the majority takes consolation in the fact that its decision today places only a small puncture in a broad shield.op.at quotation marks and citation omitted.i disagree.the majority has turned a broad shield into a sieve.according to the majority reasoning,any section,whether in the ina or not,can stand as an exception to the retroactivity rule laid out in immact c.this appears to include retroactivity provisions for all categories of crimes included in the definition of aggravated felony,see a,as well as the approximately thirty grounds for deportation and fourteen categories of deportable criminal offenses that immact a listed.op.at.what was congress point in placing a retroactivity provision in the statute if every previous retroactivity provision,whether in the ina or not,is still preserved the majority has not simply created a small exception to a general rule,but ignored the language of the statute and made an otherwise straightforward rule into a mess of competing retroactivity provisions that vary depending on the particular provision at issue.
second,instead of applying a statutory canon and explaining why it resolves any ambiguity,the majority skips straight to analyzing whether or not congress impliedly repealed adaa b.op.at.in addition to avoiding the problem of stating what the statute actually means,this approach also allows the majority to avoid analyzing whether this case even involves an implied repeal which,not surprisingly,it does not.immact a did not impliedly alter ina a it boldly erased it and rewrote it.by redrafting ina a in immact a,congress severed a from b and applied a new provision in immact c.indeed,congress had no need to repeal adaa b because b,by its terms,only applied to amendments made by a,not to ina a generally or to amendments made by immact a.
the majority acts as if congress has simply redesignated the amendments made by adaa a as a new section of the ina.it did not congress chose to amend ina a by rewriting its provisions.congress knows the difference between redesignating a section and amending one.compare immact a amending ina a and rewriting it completely with immact b b redesignating former e as b.it chose not to redesignate the relevant section here,and we should not act as if it did.
i would defer to the bia reasonable interpretation of these ambiguous statutes.
finally,the majority claims that interpreting c to have impliedly repealed adaa b will produce exceedingly odd results when read in conjunction with immact statute that none of the parties has raised in its arguments on appeal,that has no application to the present dispute,and that the bia has not had an opportunity to interpret.op.at.i will address the issue briefly to respond to the majority claims that controls the outcome of the present case.
immact a included a number of amendments that expanded the definition of aggravated felony.immact b provided that two of these amendments shall be effective as if included in the enactment of adaa.the majority first argues that this reference necessarily indicates an intention to leave b in force otherwise,the adaa retroactivity provision would be the same as the immact retroactivity provision.op.at.this argument is easily dispensed by simply pointing out that the majority perceived oddity is actually the current status of the law.see iirira b stating that the definition of aggravated felony applies regardless of whether the conviction was entered before,on,or after the date of enactment of this paragraph 
the majority also claims that applying b as having incorporated the temporal limitations of the adaa with regard only to some of the immact definitional amendments would produce exceedingly peculiar results.op.at.the majority proclaims that congress could not have possibly intended to protect some,but not all,aggravated felons who committed crimes before the aggravated felony ground of deportation was created.op.at.why not under the majority reading of the statute,some changes to the aggravated felony definition in the immact apply to aliens convicted after while others would only apply to aliens convicted after.the majority fails to recognize that under any construction of these statutory provisions,deportability will turn on a different time period for different aliens depending on their crime of conviction.these kinds of anomalies often result when congress amends statutes in a piecemeal fashion.the solution is not to enforce our own policy judgment as to how the statute should operate,but to defer to the agency that is charged with interpreting ambiguities in its governing statutes.
moreover,in attempting to cure the perceived oddities in the bia construction,the majority interpretation of the statute produces equally odd results.the majority recognizes as it must that an alien convicted of a firearm offense prior to is deportable,see hovsepian united states,cir en banc op.at recognizing that d espite the adaa temporal limitation,we have twice held that immact c rendered aliens deportable based on their convictions,while an alien convicted of sexually molesting a minor at the same time is not.with all due respect,t his division would make no sense,op.at,and this absurdity is only multiplied by the hodgepodge of retroactivity provisions that will apply to immact a after the majority of immact c.
there is a final,compelling reason why the majority is in error.the bia reading of the interaction between the adaa and the immact explained above is not only consistent with,but is virtually compelled by,our en banc decision in hovsepian united states,cir.in hovsepian,we held that immact c evidenced clear congressional intent to legislate retroactively and that the immact applies to convictions.see at.hovsepian involved a different removability firearms conviction under a c,rather than an aggravated felony conviction under a a iii but this distinction has no bearing on the retroactive application of those grounds for removal,since the applicability provisions of both removability grounds are essentially identical.the applicability provision for the deportation for weapons violation that hovsepian held did not survive the immact reads 
amendment made by subsection a shall apply to any alien convicted,on or after the date of the enactment of this act,of possessing any firearm or destructive device referred to in such subsection.
adaa b.the applicability provision for aggravated felony convictions that the majority argues survives the immact,reads 
amendments made by subsection a shall apply to any alien who has been convicted,on or after the date of the enactment of this act,of an aggravated felony.
adaa b.thus the interplay between the adaa and the immact is the same for firearms offenses as it is for aggravated felons.
i can not see how we can possibly reconcile hovsepian with the majority decision.the majority attempts to distinguish the two provisions on the grounds that immact a substantively changed the firearms ground for deportability from the version contained in the adaa,whereas a made no change to the substance of the aggravated felony ground for deportation.op.at.that change occurred in the ina definitional section.immact.
the majority is correct about this structural distinction,but i can not comprehend why this difference has any bearing on the survival of the retroactivity provisions of the adaa.the eleventh circuit considered and expressly rejected precisely this attempt to distinguish the applicability provisions for firearms offenses and aggravated felonies.in lettman,the court explained that it had already addressed the effect of immact c on the former firearms ground for deportation,and held that the effective date restrictions found in the old statute no longer apply.at quoting ins,cir,and citing,inter alia,united states.yacoubian,cir.the court explained that the petitioner attempt to distinguish that case by asserting that congress made substantive changes to the firearm offense ground,but merely redesignated the aggravated felony ground failed.id.it found nothing to compel the bia to conclude that congress intended those convicted of firearm offenses to be treated differently than those convicted of aggravated felonies.id.the court reasoned that o n the contrary,giving the grounds parallel treatment is consistent with congress intent to make the ina more rational and easier to understand.id.citation and brackets omitted.
the eleventh circuit analysis is consistent with hovsepian and entirely persuasive.perhaps this distinction between the statutes might be relevant if the immact amended the definition of aggravated felony in a way that encompassed ledezma for the first time.but it was not the immact that defined aggravated felony to include sexual abuse of a minor,but the iirira,and iirira could not have been clearer that its amendments applied regardless of when the conviction occurred.iirira c see also iirira b making changes to the definition of aggravated felony retroactive.moreover,the retroactivity of the aggravated felony definition is well established in our precedent.see,united states,cir.
the only question is whether immact makes the general aggravated felony deportability provision retroactive and,in doing so,supersedes the adaa applicability provision.the bia looked carefully at that difficult question and concluded that it did.this is a reasonable conclusion worthy of deference.
i would deny ledezma petition for review.i respectfully dissent.
unless otherwise stated,all references to the united states code are to the edition.
the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira eliminated the distinction between deportation and exclusion proceedings,replacing them with a new,consolidated category removal.ashcroft,cir.because we are here concerned with both and law,and because there is no material difference here relevant,we use the terms interchangeably.
section a a iii provides any alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after admission is deportable.
adaa a provided in full section a of the immigration and nationality act a is amended sic by inserting after the semicolon the following or b is convicted of an aggravated felony at any time after entry.

united states novak,cir en banc,is not to the contrary.novak indicated that the inclusion of a broad statement notwithstanding any other law in a new statutory provision can,in some circumstances,support an implied repeal of earlier statutes,thereby functioning similarly to an express reference to the superseded statute,and demonstrating that congress intended to partially repeal an a
