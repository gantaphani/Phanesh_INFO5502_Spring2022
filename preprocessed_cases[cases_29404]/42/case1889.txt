ibrahim elrawy appeals his conviction of violating g b by being an alien admitted under a nonimmigrant visa who possessed a firearm count one and of violating id.g a by being an alien illegally present in the united states who possessed a firearm count two.we affirm as to count two,reverse as to count one,vacate the sentence,and remand 
elrawy is a native and citizen of egypt who was admitted to the united states on a nonimmigrant visa on may.the visa authorized him to remain in the united states not more than six months,so he was required to depart on or before november.he did not depart,and therefore his stay in the united states was unauthorized as of november.
in december elrawy married an american citizen,laura reynolds fucich,who filed on elrawy behalf an petition,which requests that a spouse or family member be granted legal status to remain in the united states.elrawy then filed an application whereby he requested adjustment of his status to that of a lawful permanent resident.
in a january interview with immigration officials,fucich confessed that her union with elrawy was a marriage of convenience that had never been consummated.fucich withdrew her petition,and elrawy was served with a notice to show cause and was placed in deportation proceedings in.
in july,elrawy was notified that he won an immigration lottery for fiscal year,which might have allowed him to obtain a diversity visa and gain legal status if he filed a timely visa petition and satisfied other criteria.elrawy,however,filed a petition that was too early,and then another one that was too late,so he did not gain legal status through the lottery.
after divorcing fucich,elrawy married another american citizen,angela rosenbaum together they have a daughter.in august,rosenbaum filed on elrawy behalf an petition that the immigration and naturalization service ins approved on june.at trial an ins agent testified that the grant of the petition still stood but that it had not been granted properly,apparently because elrawy had had a fraudulent marriage.the ins agent agreed,however,that the grant of the petition placed elrawy on the path to getting a visa.
in march elrawy openly purchased a gun from a sporting goods store.he filed the required paperwork,furnishing,among other things,information concerning his country of citizenship and address.he correctly showed the required information,except that he did not provide his immigration and did not specify that he was illegally in the united states these omissions supposedly were because he thought the approval of the visa petition and the pendency of his adjustment of status application meant he was lawfully in the united states.
elrawy was approved to receive a gun based on his criminal background check,because he had no convictions.he also applied for a state gun permit and again provided all the required information.there is no dispute that he purchased a gun that had traveled in interstate commerce as required by the statute of conviction.
at trial elrawy moved,at the close of the government case,for judgment of acquittal pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure.he argued,as to count one,that his nonimmigrant visa had expired in,and thus,under a proper interpretation of the relevant statutory language,he could not be convicted under g b based on his purchase of a weapon in march.the district court disagreed.at to count two,elrawy argued that he was in the united states legally because of his wife approved visa petition 
the jury returned a guilty verdict on both counts.the district court sentenced elrawy to a concurrent terms of imprisonment on each count and to a term of supervised release.he was fined and was given a special assessment of.
both of elrawy convictions were under subparts of g,which makes it unlawful for any person who,being an alien a is illegally or unlawfully in the united states or b except as provided in subsection y,has been admitted to the united states under a nonimmigrant visa as that term is defined in section a of the immigration and nationality act a to possess a firearm that has traveled in interstate commerce.g.elrawy argues that at the time of the gun purchase,he was not admitted to the unites states under a nonimmigrant visa because his visa had expired,and that he was not illegally or unlawfully in the united states,because he had filed an application for adjustment of status.these are both legal issues of statutory interpretation and so are reviewed de novo.united states,cir.
the terms illegally and unlawfully,as used in g a,are not specifically defined in the criminal statutes or immigration statutes or regulations.these terms must therefore be given their ordinary and natural meanings.united states orellana,cir.
in orellana we observed that d ictionaries are a principal source for ascertaining the ordinary meaning of statutory language.id.we explained that,read in the context of g a,the dictionary definitions indicate that an alien illegally or unlawfully in the united states is an alien whose presence within the united states is forbidden or not authorized by law,and we noted that this definition is consistent with our description of an illegal alien as one who is in the united states without authorization,id.at citing united states igbatayo,cir.this is also consistent with the statutory definition,in immigration statutes,of the term unlawful presence as presence in the united states after expiration of the period of the stay authorized by the attorney general or presence in the united states without being admitted or paroled.see a b ii.
in orellana we also looked to the structure and purposes of the statute and noted that they support the view that congress sought to rule broadly to keep guns out of the hands of those who have demonstrated that they may not be trusted to possess a firearm without becoming a threat to society.orellana,at.illegal aliens are likely to be in that category because they are likely to maintain no permanent address in this country,elude detection through an assumed identity,living outside the to illegal activities to maintain a livelihood.id.
we noted that orellana,who had entered the country illegally,nevertheless later received temporary protected status tps and thus was unlike illegal aliens who attempt to avoid detection.id.rather,he revealed his whereabouts to the government and was authorized to secure employment,so he was not part of an underground population of persons,who,unable to secure lawful employment,have a greater likelihood to engage in criminal conduct,id.because aliens who receive tps are allowed to remain in the united states and work and are allowed to apply for adjustment of status as if they possessed lawful status,we found that orellana was not unlawfully present in the united states.
elrawy relies on united states brissett,which held that an alien who was charged under g a,but who had a pending application for adjustment to permanent residence status,could not be found to be unlawfully within the united states.the court in brissett recognized that an alien who filed an application for adjustment was not without authorization to stay in the united states.id.at.rather,he was permitted to remain in the country while his application was pending and was permitted to seek employment authorization,and,consistent with the operating instructions promulgated by the ins,deportation proceedings could not be initiated.id.
in united states flores,cir,we declined to address whether brissett was correctly decided,but we rejected brissett in united states lucio,cir,in which we held that a formerly illegal alien who applies for adjustment of status is not in lawful status merely because he is allowed to remain in the united states while his application is pending.we concluded that the submission of an application does not connote that the alien immigration status has changed,as the very real possibility exists that the ins will deny the alien application altogether.id.at.
lucio,who had entered the country illegally,remained unlawfully and illegally in the united states for purposes of g a.id.at.elrawy acquired illegal or unlawful status when he
