background 
a factual background 
sosa,a citizen of el salvador,moved to the united states in when he was five years old.he entered as a visitor but adjusted his status to that of a lawful permanent resident in.sosa lived with his parents in brooklyn until he was and remains close to them.he stopped attending school at age,in the tenth grade.on november,based on his sale of heroin to an undercover police officer,sosa pleaded guilty in new york state court to attempted criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree.he was sentenced to months to three years imprisonment.on july,based on his attempt to smuggle a razor blade in his belt to an inmate,sosa pleaded guilty in the bronx to smuggling dangerous contraband to prisoners.he was sentenced to days imprisonment.
while sosa was incarcerated for his conviction,the immigration and naturalization service ins served him with an order to show cause why he should not be deported.no further action was taken on the deportation proceeding,and sosa was released on parole by the new york authorities on march.however,on july,after sosa conviction,the ins took him into custody.
a deportation hearing took place before an immigration judge ij in oakdale,louisiana,on august.the ij offered sosa an adjournment to prepare his case find an attorney sosa declined and proceeded pro se that day.the ij then informed sosa that he had a right to an attorney,but that the government would not pay for one,and that he had a right to present evidence.finally,the ij told sosa of his right to appeal any decision of this court to a higher court in washington and even after that,to the federal court system in this country.
at the ij request,sosa admitted that he was not a citizen of the united states and that he was a citizen of el salvador.sosa also admitted to the november,conviction for attempted sale of heroin.the ij then found sosa removable as charged and asked whether sosa understood that finding.sosa responded that he did,and the ij asked whether he wished to accept that decision or reserve appeal.the following colloquy then occurred 
sosa um,first i like to ask a question.then i make my decision on the appeal.my first question is this.if i was to be removed from the united states how long will it be on punishment how long will it be to come back 
ij uh,at least twenty years.
sosa at least years.because,well,i have no family in el salvador.no relatives.
ij do you wish to accept my decision or reserve an appeal 
sosa i take it.
ij you accept it 
sosa i accept it.
the ij then stated that the decision was final,and the ins deported sosa to el salvador within a month.
the issues on this appeal arise from the fact that the ij never informed sosa that he was eligible to seek discretionary relief from deportation under former section c of the immigration and nationality act ina,stat,as amended,et.prior to,that section gave the attorney general broad discretion to cancel deportation orders for aliens who met certain residence requirements and had not served five years in prison for an aggravated felony.united states copeland,cir citing c repealed.in,the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa made aliens convicted of aggravated felonies ineligible for section c relief,d,stat,enacted april.later that year,the illegal immigrant reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira repealed section c and replaced it with a provision allowing the attorney general to cancel removal for a narrower class of aliens not including anyone convicted of any aggravated felony,b,stat,enacted.
the board of immigration appeals bia initially determined that these new laws applied to aliens,like sosa,who had pled guilty to aggravated felonies before the new laws were enacted.copeland,at.because the bia was following this interpretation when sosa deportation hearing took place,the ij did not inform sosa that he was eligible to seek section c relief.after sosa deportation,however,the supreme court held that the amendments could not be applied retroactively to render aliens who pled guilty to aggravated felonies prior to ineligible for section c relief.ins cyr,d.
sosa reentered the united states about nine and a half months after his deportation,around june.he worked installing car stereo systems between his reentry and,and his employer was satisfied with his work.during this period,sosa committed two new crimes.on march,he was arrested in queens for criminal possession of marijuana in the fifth degree he pleaded guilty to the charge the next day.on april,sosa was again arrested on the same charge.after this arrest,a fingerprint check revealed his deportation for committing an aggravated felony.
b district court proceedings 
sosa was indicted in the eastern district of new york for illegal reentry under on july,sosa moved to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that his deportation hearing violated his right to due process.he argued that at the pertinent time he had been eligible for discretionary section c relief under c,was reasonably likely to have received that relief,but was not given an opportunity to apply for it.
section d allows a defendant facing an illegal reentry charge to challenge collaterally the underlying deportation order.to do so successfully,the defendant must show exhaustion of administrative remedies,denial of judicial review,and fundamental unfairness in the deportation proceeding.the district court denied sosa motion to dismiss,holding that he had failed to meet the first two requirements of d exhaustion of administrative remedies and denial of the opportunity for judicial review.the court noted,however,that maybe the deportation order had been fundamentally unfair.
sosa then entered into a conditional plea agreement under which he waived any right to appeal a sentence of less than months imprisonment but retained his right to appeal from the denial of his motion to dismiss.sosa pled guilty on december,before magistrate judge azrack.the probation department found that he had an offense level of and a criminal history category of iii,yielding a sentencing range of to months.the district court agreed but granted a downward departure because these kinds of cases are the most difficult ones.the court noted that sosa was for all practical purposes an american and then he dropped back into a country that totally strange and foreign to him,even though he was born there.the court sentenced sosa to months imprisonment and a three year term of supervised release.this appeal followed.
discussion 
as noted,an alien attempting to collaterally challenge a deportation proceeding as a defense to a criminal prosecution for illegal reentry must satisfy the three requirements of d 
the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order 
the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and 
the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair.
id.we address sosa compliance with each of these requirements in turn,concluding that he satisfies the first two and remanding for findings on the third.
a exhaustion of administrative remedies 
statutory exhaustion requirements,such as section d,are generally not subject to exceptions.united states,cir statutory exhaustion requirements are mandatory,and courts are not free to dispense with them internal quotation marks omitted see also theodoropoulos ins,cir futility of exhaustion excuses statutory exhaustion requirement only where administrative procedure lacks power to provide any relief otherwise,
