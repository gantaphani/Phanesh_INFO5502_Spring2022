balbir singh,a native and citizen of india,was granted conditional permanent residence in this country when he married a united states citizen but lost that status when his wife withdrew her support from their joint petition for permanent residence.singh now petitions for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia denying his application for a hardship waiver of the joint petition requirement.before considering the merits of singh petition we must decide whether we have jurisdiction to review the bia determination that singh removal would not result in extreme hardship.
we hold that we may review the threshold question whether an alien has demonstrated extreme hardship and is thus eligible for a waiver of the joint filing requirement to remove the conditions on residence.because the bia did not err in its hardship determination,we deny singh petition for review.
background 
balbir singh entered the united states in.three years later,he married lidia medina,a citizen,and so was able to adjust his status to become a conditional permanent resident.to remove the conditional status,singh and medina were required to file a joint petition before the second anniversary of singh obtaining lawful status.see immigration and nationality act ina c a,d a,c a,d a.such a petition must state that the marriage is proper and was not entered into for immigration purposes.ina d a i,d a i.
singh and medina timely filed a joint petition.they appeared for an interview before an immigration service officer on august.at the interview,however,medina signed a sworn statement declaring the couple had married for the sole purpose of obtaining immigration benefits and withdrew her signature from the joint petition.the next day,the ins served singh with a notice to appear,charging that he was removable under ina a d i,a d i,because his conditional permanent resident status had been terminated 
the following year,singh filed a second petition,this time seeking a waiver of the joint filing requirement.the attorney general or his designee may remove the conditional basis of the permanent resident status for an alien who fails to meet the joint filing requirement if the alien demonstrates that extreme hardship would result if such alien is removed.ina c a,c a.the ins district director denied singh petition in.a third petition,submitted in,again sought a waiver of the joint filing requirement and again was denied.
before the immigration judge ij,singh conceded removability,and the parties stipulated that the only issue for review was the district director denial of the hardship waiver.the ij held a merits hearing and issued a decision denying singh application for a hardship waiver.although the ij found singh credible,he concluded that singh had not demonstrated that extreme hardship would result if he were removed.
during the ij hearing singh testified that he had no children and had not divorced medina.singh has three sisters,two of whom live in the united states and are citizens the third is a british citizen who lives in england.at the time of the hearing singh lived with one of his sisters and her family,including her sons,and.singh was close to his nephews and helped support the family after his underwent heart surgery.
singh parents are dead.his mother and older brother were shot and killed by terrorists in punjab,india,in,and his father died from an infection in.singh testified that he remain s depressed about these deaths,but when he becomes upset,he sits and talks with his sisters,which helps him feel better.singh saw a psychologist several times the last consultation took place in.
as a truck driver,singh owned his own rig and earned annually.in comparison to the per month he could earn driving a truck in the united states,he might earn per month in india.singh did not own any real estate in the united states at the time of the hearing he and his siblings had inherited their father house in india.singh had traveled to india five times since he first arrived in the united states.although he had no immediate family remaining in india,a nephew still lived there.
the ij summarized singh hardship claim as follows in india,singh lacks a job and would have a lower standard of living he would be separated from his family and he would face cultural difficulties,given the length of time he has spent in the united states.because economic hardship and cultural social uprooting are hardships suffered by every alien who has spent a considerable period of time in the united states,the ij held,singh did not meet the extreme hardship standard.the ij also noted that singh was young and healthy,possessed assets that could be sold to finance his return to india,spoke the language in india,and had spent much of his life there.
singh appealed to the bia,which conducted a de novo review and affirmed the decision of the ij.singh timely filed a petition for review with this court.
ii.jurisdiction 
the first question we must answer is whether we have jurisdiction to review the bia hardship determination.the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of iirira eliminated our jurisdiction to review any decision or action of the attorney general the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the attorney general.ina a b ii,a b ii.this provision does not,however,preclud e review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals.ina a d,a d.
even as to factual issues,a b ii precludes judicial review of a decision made under a particular statute only when the language of the statute in question provide s the discretionary authority for the attorney general action.spencer,united states,cir.for a statutory provision to strip this court of jurisdiction under a b ii,the provision must specify that the right or power to act is entirely within the attorney general judgment or conscience.gonzales,cir quoting spencer,at.
the full text of c,the waiver provision we consider here,provides 
hardship waiver 
the attorney general,in the attorney general discretion,may remove the conditional basis of the permanent resident status for an alien who fails to meet the requirements of paragraph if the alien demonstrates that 
a extreme hardship would result if such alien is removed,
b the qualifying marriage was entered into in good faith by the alien spouse,but the qualifying marriage has been terminated other than through the death of the spouse and the alien was not at fault in failing to meet the requirements of paragraph,or 
c the qualifying marriage was entered into in good faith by the alien spouse and during the marriage the alien spouse or child was battered by or was the subject of extreme cruelty perpetrated by his or her spouse or citizen or permanent resident parent and the alien was not at fault in failing to meet the requirements of paragraph.
in determining extreme hardship,the attorney general shall consider circumstances occurring only during the period that the alien was admitted for permanent residence on a conditional basis.in acting on applications under this paragraph,the attorney general shall consider any credible evidence relevant to the application.the determination of what evidence is credible and the weight to be given that evidence shall be within the sole discretion of the attorney general.the attorney general shall,by regulation,establish measures to protect the confidentiality of information concerning any abused alien spouse or child,including information regarding the whereabouts of such spouse or child.
under this provision,granting a waiver involves two steps first,the attorney general or his designee here,the bia must determine whether the petitioner has demonstrated that he meets one of three alternative criteria.see c a c.second,if the petitioner has so demonstrated eligibility,the bia may grant the waiver.c.
the decision whether to grant a waiver is unambiguously left to the discretion of the attorney general.damon ashcroft,cir.the statutory text specifies that t he attorney general,in the attorney general discretion,may grant a
