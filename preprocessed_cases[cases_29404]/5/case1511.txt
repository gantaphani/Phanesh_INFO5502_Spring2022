background 
in the late,general dynamics corporation general dynamics built two civilian vessels using a construction differential subsidy granted by the maritime administration pursuant to title v of the merchant marine act of.to demonstrate eligibility for the subsidies,general dynamics was required to submit cost details and evidence that both the negotiated price and general dynamics cost estimates were fair and reasonable.a.the detailed estimates that general dynamics submitted to the maritime administration in connection with the subsidies were divided into six areas,one of which concerned sphere insulation and joiner work.
the subcontract for the sphere insulation and joiner work was awarded to the frigitemp corporation of new york city frigitemp.davis,senior vice president of frigitemp,and veliotis,president and general manager of general dynamics quincy shipbuilding division,among others,agreed to award the subcontract to frigitemp in exchange for bribes and kickbacks to be paid to veliotis and gilliland,veliotis principal assistant.united states davis,cir.during,frigitemp,at the behest of davis,paid about million in kickbacks to general dynamics officers veliotis and gilliland,in return for being awarded the subcontracts.united states davis.
in the early,gerald lee,chief executive officer of frigitemp,davis,veliotis,and gilliland were indicted.davis,at.lee pled guilty,davis was found guilty,and veliotis and gilliland fled the united states.id.
in,the united states attorney commenced a civil proceeding in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.on october,the district court dismissed the government claims and found in favor of general dynamics.davis.general dynamics claimed,and the district court ruled,that general dynamics was not legally liable for the damages suffered by the maritime administration as a result of the frigitemp kickbacks because the pre version of the anti kickback act did not apply to prime contractors id.at.though the district court found that general dynamics estimates for the five categories of costs other than the sphere insulation and joiner estimate were fair and reasonable,and that the government had not established fraud,the district court did not rule on the government allegation that general dynamics had passed the costs of the frigitemp kickbacks on to the maritime administration by including them in the sphere insulation and joiner estimate.
on march,the second circuit,and remanded the case to the district court.united states dynamics,cir.the second circuit reversed the district court ruling that general dynamics was not legally liable for the government damages suffered as a result of the inflated estimates for the sphere insulation and joiner work due to the frigitemp kickbacks,and remanded to the district court.id.the second circuit found that the anti kickback act did not preempt the false claims act,that the united states had stated valid claims under the false claims act and federal common law that should have been adjudicated,and that the government remedies would extend past the mere amount of the kickbacks to the amount that the cost estimates were inflated due to the collusive arrangement between frigitemp and general dynamics.id.the second circuit affirmed the district court findings for general dynamics on the other five portions of the costs estimate.id.at.because the government did not petition the second circuit for rehearing or the supreme court for writ of certiorari,the estimates claims were finally resolved in general dynamics favor on june.
on remand,the government and general dynamics entered into an agreement that provided for settlement of all claims against general dynamics included in the suit,in consideration for the payment of million by general dynamics.the parties agreed that the action shall be dismissed as against general dynamics with prejudice and without costs or attorney fees to either party.on july,the district court approved the parties settlement of the proceeding.
shortly after the district court october decision in general dynamics favor,general dynamics notified a department of defense contracting officer that general dynamics had revised its through corporate overhead proposals to include costs that had previously been set aside in accordance with far g.following the settlement,general dynamics submitted its certified revised overhead proposal for,and included its costs as overhead costs for which it sought payment by the department of defense.by letter dated august,the contracting officer wrote general dynamics,stating that all the legal expenses were unallowable pursuant to far b,and requested that general dynamics remove the expenses from certified claims for incurred costs and billings.on september,general dynamics submitted a revised certified overhead cost proposal which incorporated percent of the costs,including the proceeding costs associated with the frigitemp cost estimate.by letter dated september,general dynamics stated that,because it had substantially prevailed in the davis proceeding,it was entitled to include percent of all of its costs of the proceeding in its overhead proposals pursuant to regulation.by letter dated december,the contracting officer sent general dynamics a defense contract audit agency dcaa report on general dynamics revised corporate overhead proposal and stated that the dcaa report questioned,among other things,the or percent of the total proceeding costs that general dynamics attributed to the frigitemp claim.the contracting officer made clear that the dcaa view does not represent the view of the contracting officer.
in march,general dynamics wrote to the contracting officer and indicated its belief that the legal fees and costs associated with the frigitemp claims are unallowable,but that the legal fees associated with the other claims in the davis proceeding were allowable to the extent provided in far.general dynamics included a new estimate placing the total davis case costs at approximately million,with the frigitemp costs constituting approximately of that amount.on august,general dynamics requested issuance of a final contracting officer decision on its indirect cost rates.on september,the contracting officer issued a final decision on general dynamics overhead proposal and found that all of the costs of the davis case were unallowable pursuant to far b.the contracting officer assessed a penalty in the amount of under dfars penalties for unallowable costs for including expressly unallowable costs in the revised proposal.
on october,general dynamics withdrew its overhead proposal and stated that it would resubmit overhead costs without including the davis proceeding costs.general dynamics also appealed to the board.
on june,the board found that the contracting officer erred in refusing to allow any of the davis proceeding costs in general dynamics overhead cost proposal,and reversed the penalty issued by the contracting officer.it was undisputed that general dynamics could not recover for the costs associated with its defense of the frigitemp claims.the primary issue before the board was whether general dynamics legal proceeding costs may be apportioned for the purposes of cost allowability when some of the claims succeed and others fail.dynamics,bca cch.
in deciding this issue,the board found that neither the major fraud act nor its legislative history directly addressed apportionment of proceeding costs.nevertheless,the board concluded that 
congress intended to permit recovery of legal defense costs when a contractor was successful,while insuring that a contractor not be rewarded for wrongdoing.to properly reflect these dual goals,we believe apportionment is required for those claims in a proceeding on which the contractor has prevailed and which do not involve the same wrongdoing as the claims that are compromised,unless the settlement agreement provides otherwise.consequently we hold the major fraud act of,as implemented by far b,requires apportionment of contractor legal defense costs between unsuccessful and successful claims of the government when the successful claims do not stem from the same wrongdoing as the unsuccessful claims,and there is a reasonable basis for apportionment of the costs.
id.in the board view,section k,promulgated as part of the major fraud act of,implied that some costs might be allowable at settlement,even if not previously allowable,and that costs could be apportioned by agreement of the parties in a settled proceeding.the board held that apportionment of costs was required to accomplish congress goals of permitting recovery of legal costs when a contractor was successful,while insuring that a contractor was not rewarded for wrongdoing.id.the board remanded for a determination of the quantum of costs in this case.id.
the government timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
this opinion follows the court review of the record and consideration of the parties oral argument,heard on january.
discussion 
the core issue on appeal is whether the settlement of the frigitemp claim in the davis proceeding makes unallowable general dynamics costs in defending against all claims in that proceeding where the settlement agreement does not provide for the allowability of costs,but expressly disallows them.the government argues that all costs associated with all claims in the davis case are unallowable by operation of section k because a disposition of a proceeding by consent or compromise occurs when any claim in that proceeding is settled at any point in the life of the proceeding.general dynamics,on the other hand,argues that the costs for the frigitemp claim and all other claims should be apportioned because the latter set of claims are factually distinct and resulted in an outcome favorable to it.
after reviewing the text of section k and the legislative history surrounding its enactment,we hold that,at least in the circumstance where there has been a disposition of the proceeding by consent or compromise,such that,following the settlement,no pending claims remain in that proceeding,and the proceeding could have resulted in a determination of contractor liability for fraud or misconduct,no costs for any part of the proceeding are allowable,except as provided in the settlement agreement 
a.the text of section k 
section k of title provides,in relevant part 
k proceeding costs not allowable except as otherwise provided in this subsection,costs incurred by a contractor in connection with any criminal,civil,or administrative proceeding commenced by the united states or a state are not allowable as reimbursable costs under a covered contract if the proceeding a relates to a violation of,or failure to comply with,a federal or state statute or regulation,and b results in a disposition described in paragraph.
a disposition referred to in paragraph b is any of the following 
a in the case of a criminal proceeding,a conviction including a conviction pursuant to a plea of nolo contendere by reason of the violation or failure referred to in paragraph.
b in the case of a civil or administrative proceeding involving an allegation of fraud or similar misconduct,a determination of contractor liability on the basis of the violation or failure referred to in paragraph.
c in the case of any civil or administrative proceeding,the imposition of a monetary penalty by reason of the violation or failure referred to in paragraph.
d a final decision 
i to debar or suspend the contractor 
ii to rescind or void the contract or 
iii to terminate the contract for default 
by reason of the violation or failure referred to in paragraph.
e a disposition of the proceeding by consent or compromise if such action could have resulted in a disposition described in subparagraph a,b,c,or d.
in the case of a proceeding referred to in paragraph that is commenced by the united states and is resolved by consent or compromise pursuant to an agreement entered into by a contractor and the united states,the costs incurred by the contractor in connection with such proceeding that are otherwise not allowable as reimbursable costs under such paragraph may be allowed to the extent specifically provided in such agreement.
in this subsection 
a the term proceeding includes an investigation.
k emphases added.
in the present case,there is no dispute that the davis civil case could have resulted in a finding of contractor liability for a violation of,or failure to comply with,a federal or state statute or regulation.the parties dispute only whether the davis case was a proceeding that was resolved by consent or compromise between general dynamics and the united states.we hold that it was.
as an initial matter,we hold that the term proceeding in section k must be given a broad meaning,such that it includes all claims or causes of action within a particular case,action or proceeding this broad interpretation of proceeding is supported by the text of section k e,which specifies a disposition of the proceeding by consent or compromise if such action could have resulted in a disposition described in subparagraph a,b,c,or d,id.k e emphases added,thus equating a proceeding and an action.further,section k broadly defines proceeding to include an investigation,id.k a,and other sections of the major fraud act of relating to the allowability of contractor costs incurred in fraud proceedings specifically define a proceeding as a civil,criminal,or an administrative investigation,prosecution or proceeding.c.such an interpretation of proceeding is also confirmed by reference to black law dictionary,which defines a proceeding as the regular and orderly progression of a lawsuit,including all acts and events between the time of commencement and the entry of judgment,and notes that a proceeding is more comprehensive than the word action,but it may include in its general sense all the steps taken or measures adopted in the prosecution or defense of an action,including the pleadings and judgment.black law dictionary ed.
congress could have drafted section k such that legal costs of a proceeding are unallowable on a basis it did not.instead,congress chose to employ the broader term proceeding,disallowing all such costs of the proceeding except where the settlement provides otherwise,and we must give effect to that choice.because we find the relevant proceeding to be all claims in the entire davis case,not each claim individually,the only remaining question is whether that proceeding was resolved by consent or compromise.
the government urges this court to adopt a rule whereby disposition of a proceeding by consent or compromise occurs when any claim ever part of the proceeding is settled.we need not consider or rule upon such a broad rule in the present case.the question before this court is narrower where a settlement agreement finally resolves all pending claims in a proceeding,has there been a disposition of that proceeding by consent or compromise under section k it is undisputable that there has been.indeed,even general dynamics does not dispute that the case was resolved through consent or compromise.rather,general dynamics urges this court to adopt a rule that the costs associated with different claims within a proceeding must be apportioned so that only the costs for settled claims are unallowable.we reject this argument.nothing in the statute provides for or even sug
