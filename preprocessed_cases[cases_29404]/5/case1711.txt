this appeal follows a trial by of three consolidated cases.the trial court entered judgment against plaintiff robert ferwerda,who had been trying to build a home on his vacant lot.he had sued the bear creek planning committee the committee and the individuals who comprised the bear creek valley board the board who he contended inappropriately blocked construction on his lot.he had also sued his neighbors,james and cindy ware the wares,contending they had violated the covenants,conditions,and restrictions cc r in building and remodeling their house.ferwerda appeals from a judgment entered in favor of the committee,the board,and the wares,which included awards of attorney fees to the committee and the wares.we affirm the judgment as to the committee and the wares,except as it relates to the attorney fees.as to those orders,we reverse.finally,as to the board,we dismiss as moot the appeal relating to it.
factual and procedural background 
aintroduction 
robert ferwerda owns lot in alpine meadows estates subdivision unit subdivision.since,he has been trying to obtain approval to build a house on his lot.this litigation surrounds events related to securing that approval,interpretation of the cc r and related restrictions on the lots in subdivision,and the resolution of the three cases consolidated in the trial court.
the cc r,the green book,and the architectural review manual 
the cc r that govern subdivision were recorded in and establish a general plan for the improvement and development of the property.the guiding principle is that it is to the best interest of the area that it be developed into an attractive ski area,alpine in character and appearance,with as little damage to the natural beauty of the land and trees as is possible.to that end,the cc r contain several restrictions on the subdivision.among other things,owners are not permitted to cut down trees over five inches in diameter on their lot without approval from the committee.more generally,owners are required to receive approval from the committee before constructing or excavating on their lot.the owners plans and specifications and the committee approval must be in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in the bear creek planning committee restrictions.the bear creek planning committee restrictions were incorporated into the cc r as exhibit a in.
the committee incorporated in.the articles of incorporation describe the committee primary purpose as promoting the social welfare of the community of alpine meadows,california and for the mutual benefit of all property owners in that community through supervision and enforcement of the cc r.among its powers and duties as articulated in its bylaws is t o review and approve or disapprove plans and specifications for improvements in the bear creek valley pursuant to the cc r,conduct,manage and control the affairs of the corporation and to make such rules and regulations thereof as they may deem appropriate,and maintain,issue,and revise at its discretion a procedures,regulations,and standards manual.
in,the committee published the green book that contains procedures,regulations,and standards.the green book notes the observance of objective criteria for plan approval and of subjective criteria guided by a proposed plan harmony with the environment in which the structure is placed and harmony with its surroundings.the restriction on tree removal is continued.it recommends use of composition shingles.finally,it includes the following attorney fees provision in the event that it is necessary for the committee to initiate litigation to enforce the provisions of these provisions,regulations,and standards,then the committee shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys fees and costs.
the green book was revised in and that revision became known as the architectural review manual.the manual states,among other things,t he design of each structure must bear a harmonious relationship to the land and its neighbor and live trees can not be removed without board approval.similar to the green book,it contains the following attorney fees provision in the event that it is necessary for the committee to enforce the provisions of the architectural review manual by obtaining legal advice to clarify issues,initiate litigation,filing preparing legal documents or filing and preparing a cease and desist order,then the committee shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney fees and costs from the performance deposit or other means as may be deemed necessary.legal expenses above the performance deposit may be recovered by fines assessed.
ferwerda activities and resulting litigation 
in,ferwerda purchased the lot in subdivision.in november,he submitted his building plans to the committee for preliminary approval.committee member donald priest reviewed ferwerda plans.he was concerned with the proposed home location and configuration on the lot.what struck him was the location of the large residence and the long ridge line with respect to ferwerda neighbors,and in particular the creation of a rather unique alley space between ferwerda and the wares that was roughly feet wide and up to feet long and had an urban instead of alpine feel.he then looked for a comparable situation in the valley but could not find one.thereafter,priest made his recommendation to the committee to deny the proposed home,and the committee so voted in december.
ferwerda appealed the committee decision to the board,which in march affirmed the committee decision on its de novo review.
in november,the committee filed the first of the three consolidated cases,alleging ferwerda had begun building a home on his lot even though the committee had rejected his plans.the complaint requested,among other things,a temporary restraining order and a preliminary and permanent injunction.
ferwerda filed a,alleging,among other things,the committee had unreasonably and improperly denied his applications to develop his lot by applying invalid guidelines that had not been properly adopted by the owners of subdivision.the was for breach of fiduciary duties,declaratory relief,and injunctive relief.ferwerda later amended his to add the wares,who he contended had not complied with the cc r in building and remodeling their home.
sometime in,ferwerda submitted essentially the same plans for his lot he had submitted previously to the committee.the committee denied approval of the proposed home,citing among other things,the alley space problem.
the wares filed a alleging that ferwerda had violated the cc r in the summer of by cutting down trees on his lot without the approval of the committee.they requested injunctive relief requiring ferwerda to replant similar trees forfeit his property to the other owners in subdivision.
in,ferwerda submitted to the committee a set of building plans similar to the ones he had submitted in.the committee denied the plans because the proposed home was too close to the wares lot.ferwerda appealed the committee decision to the board.after a de novo review,the board affirmed the denial in may.
the second case that was consolidated was filed by ferwerda in may against each board member individually.he claimed the board affirmance was arbitrary,capricious,unreasonable,and lacking in substantial evidence.
in summer,ferwerda again cut down trees without committee approval and excavated portions of his lot.
the third case that was consolidated was filed by the committee in september.it sought to enjoin ferwerda from removing trees and excavating his property.
the parties stipulated to a trial by reference.following an trial,the court issued its statement of decision.
as to ferwerda claims,the court found the following the committee did not act arbitrarily,capriciously,or with bias when rejecting ferwerda construction proposal.since the committee actions were reasonable,the issue of whether the board acted properly was moot.the committee had the authority to adopt the green book and other architectural standards.the wares home did not violate the cc r.as to the committee claims,the court found the following the committee had the power to adopt and modify the architectural review standards beyond those set forth in the cc r.the court also made permanent the preliminary injunction preventing ferwerda from excavating on his property or removing trees without committee approval.as to the wares claims,the court found ferwerda was required to replant the trees he had removed if,by june,he had not received approval from the committee for constructing a home on his property.finally,the court ordered ferwerda to pay in attorney fees to the committee and in attorney fees to the wares.
ferwerda appeals from the resulting judgment.he contends the committee did not have the authority to adopt standards beyond those in the cc r the court erred in awarding attorney fees the court applied the wrong legal standard when it determined the committee acted reasonably in denying his building plans in the court erred in imposing a permanent injunction prohibiting him from any further construction,excavation or alteration to his property without committee approval and requiring him to replant trees if by june he had not received approval from the committee for constructing a home on his property the court conclusion the wares had complied with the cc r was not supported by substantial evidence and the board acted arbitrarily and capriciously in affirming the committee rejection of his plans,and the board was not properly composed.as we explain,as to the committee and the wares,we reject ferwerda contentions except as they relate to the attorney fee awards.as to those awards,we reverse.as to his contentions pertaining to the board,we dismiss as moot the appeal pertaining to it.
discussion 
ithe committee has the power to adopt standards beyond those set forth in the cc r 
section of the cc r states the committee may act on applications,all in accordance with the procedures and standards set forth in the bear creek planning committee restrictions,a copy of which is attached hereto as exhibit a and by this reference is made a part hereof.except as to paragraph hereof,in the event of a conflict between the standards required by said committee and those contained herein,the standards of said committee shall govern.italics added.
the trial court found this italicized language empowers the committee to adopt new conditions on an ongoing basis.as we explain below on our de novo review ekstrom marquesa at monarch beach homeowners th,the trial court was correct to the extent this language allows the committee to adopt new design standards related to the improvement or development of lots in subdivision.
the interpretation of cc r is governed by the rules for interpreting contracts.fourth la costa condominium owners seith th.it is a rule that a ll parts of a contract must be applied so as to give effect and meaning to every part,if possible burnett piercy cal,see,t he whole of a contract is to be taken together,so as to give effect to every part,if reasonably practicable,each clause helping to interpret the other.
the plain language of section of the cc r contemplates the committee may adopt standards beyond those contained in exhibit a as it existed when the cc r were adopted.this is evidenced by the acknowledgment in section that if there is a conflict between the standards set forth in that section and the standards required by the c ommittee,the standards of the committee govern.if the committee had no power to adopt standards beyond those in the cc r,there would be no need for this language.we must read the cc r as a whole and adopt the construction that gives effect to every part of the cc r.ezer fuchsloch d,a cardinal principle of document construction is that document must be construed as a whole so as to give effect to every part thereof.
the question then becomes what is meant by standards as that term is used in the cc r.that term is used in section in reference to the procedures and standards set forth in the bear creek planning committee restrictions that are attached to the cc r.in those restrictions,there is a standards section.the first paragraph entitled,general explains in part that t he design of each structure must bear a harmonious relationship to the land and its neighbors,in terms of lot coverage,mass and degree of individual expression.the remaining paragraphs with the exception of the last one,which addresses variances detail architectural design standards,standards for such things as floor space,decks,roofs,exterior walls,windows,colors and finishes,and parking places.in the context of the cc r,then,the term standards refers to architectural design standards.
ferwerda offers no interpretation of this language in section of the cc r.instead,he points to case law and testimony from the committee expert witness,which he claims negate our interpretation of the cc r.neither help him.
the cases relied on by ferwerda,werner graham cal.and riley bear creek planning committee cal d,are distinguishable.
in werner,a developer subdivided a tract and recorded a map of the tract that showed no building lines or anything else to indicate any purpose of restricting in any way werner.graham,supra,cal.at.he then sold the lots.id.at.the early deeds contained restrictive provisions that were so uniform and consistent in character as to indicate unmistakably that the developer had in mind a general and common plan which he was following.id.at.the developer told the purchasers,he was exacting the same restrictive provisions from all purchasers.id.at.the developer later quitclaimed the property eventually purchased by the plaintiff,but the deed to this property contained no restrictions.id.at.the court held restrictions placed in the earlier deeds to the other property were not binding on the plaintiff.id.at.
in riley,the developer sold a property via a deed that contained no restrictions.riley bear creek planning committee,supra,cal d at.nine months later,the developer recorded a document purporting to impose uniform restrictions on a number of lots,including the one in dispute.id.at.the court held these restrictions did not apply to the lot sold earlier.id.at.
both of these cases are distinguishable because the cc r here specifically acknowledge the possibility of a conflict between the standards set forth therein and the standards required by the c ommittee and assert that if such a conflict arises,the standards required by the committee govern.ferwerda signed that he read and approved the cc r.
the expert testimony to which ferwerda points also does not help him.that testimony consisted of the opinion of the committee expert that section does not expressly authorize the committee to create new or different standards than those attached in exhibit a as other cc r he had worked on did but that by implication,the committee had such authority.this testimony undercuts ferwerda position because it supports a reading of section if only by implication that gives the committee such authority.
based on the plain language of section of the cc r,we hold the committee had the power to adopt standards beyond those set forth in the cc r,which are reflected in the green book and the architectural review manual.
the trial court erred in awarding attorney fees to the committee and to the wares 
ferwerda contends the court erred in requiring him to pay the committee and the wares attorney fees.in his view,the green book and architectural review manual can not be the basis for authorizing the attorney fees because they are unrecorded and were enacted by an unelected committee without approval of the property owners.
the committee and the wares take the position adopted by the trial court,the attorney fees were permissible because the green book and architectural review manual provide for the recovery of attorney fees for a prevailing party such as themselves.and,in any event,ferwerda asked for attorney fees if he prevailed and since he lost in the trial court,he was liable for the other sides attorney fees.
a prevailing party is entitled to attorney fees when authorized by statute or contract.code civ,subd.a.here,the cc r contain no attorney fees provision.rather,the green book and the architectural review manual provide for recovery of attorney fees by the committee.in reviewing these publications in part i of the discussion,we explained that the cc r give the committee power to adopt new design standards relating to the improvement or development of lots in subdivision.the question is whether that power allows the committee to adopt attorney fees provisions not contained in the cc r.
the committee contends it had such broad power because the cc r and its own bylaws give it the authority to expand upon and describe the provisions of the cc rs and s o long as such rules and guidelines are reasonable and do not conflict with the cc r,they will be held to be enforceable.in support,they cite major miraverde homeowners th and rancho santa fe th rancho santa fe.neither case helps the committee.
in major,the court addressed whether the homeowners association was authorized to discriminate between resident members and nonresident members in the use and enjoyment of common areas.major miraverde homeowners,supra,th at.the cc r granted every member a right and easement of enjoyment in and to the common areas within the property,subject only to the right of the association to establish uniform rules and regulations pertaining to a member use of the common areas and recreational facilities.ibid.nonresident members asserted the association acted without authority in restricting the use of common areas by nonresident members.ibid.the court agreed,explaining as follows an association may not exceed the authority granted to it by the cc r.where the association exceeds its scope of authority,any rule or decision resulting from such an ultra vires act is invalid whether or not it is a reasonable response to a particular circumstance.where a circumstance arises which is not adequately covered by the cc r,the remedy is to amend the cc r.the courts have held homeowners are subject to any reasonable amendment of the cc r properly adopted.id.at.
in rancho santa fe,the court addressed whether a homeowners association could apply a regulation adopted subsequent to the enactment of land use covenants that clarified the terms of one of those covenants permitting a homeowner to undertake minor as opposed to major construction without the art jury approval.rancho santa fe,supra,th at.in holding the association could,the court explained the governing documents granted to the association power to adopt regulations and further explained an association operating under a land use covenant had the power to clarify and define the covenant terms,so long as it did so reasonably.id.at.
these cases do not support the authority of the committee to enact the attorney fees provisions here.in major,the court limited the association authority to that granted to it in the cc r.it is not enough,as the committee argues,that the attorney fee provisions are reasonable.major rejected this argument,noting that if a circumstance arises that is not adequately covered by the cc r,the remedy is to amend the cc r,regardless of whether the association actions are reasonable.major miraverde homeowners,supra,th at.here,the cc r are silent on attorney fees.it is a situation,therefore,not adequately covered by the cc r,requiring amendment of the cc r to insert such a provision.ibid.similarly,in rancho santa fe,the court holding that the regulation was enforceable turned on the fact the governing documents granted the association power to adopt regulations and the fact the regulation served only to reasonably clarify terms already in the land use covenant.rancho santa fe,supra,th at.here,the attorney fees provisions do not seek to clarify existing language in the cc r.rather,they are an attempt by the committee to insert a new provision that binds homeowners without their approval.
undaunted,the committee continues to argue that the cc r,the green book,and the architectural review manual must be construed together as one contract,as the rules and standards in the greenbook and architectural review manual give effect to the cc rs.in support,it cites huntington landmark adult community ross d.there,the defendants challenged an attorney fee award,contending there was no provision for attorney fees in the cc r.id.at.the court held the defendants were mistaken because the supplemental declaration of easements,covenants,conditions and restrictions contained an attorney fees provision.ibid.huntington is unhelpful here.to the extent the green book and architectural review manual deal with topics already covered by the cc r and simply serve to reasonably clarify their meaning see rancho santa fe,supra,th at or to the extent they adopt new or different standards which as we have explained in part i of the discussion the cc r give the committee the power to do,those documents are a legitimate exercise of the committee power granted to it under the cc r.they therefore bind the homeowners whether we view them as separate or supplemental to the cc r.the same reasoning does not apply to the attorney fee provisions.nothing in the cc r gives the committee the power to insert into the green book and the architectural review manual an attorney fee provision that was never in the cc r or contemplated therein.huntington simply does not cover this situation.
we turn then to the other basis on which the committee and the wares seek to uphold the attorney fee awards ferwerda asked for attorney fees if he prevailed and since he lost in the trial court,he was liable for the other sides attorney fees.the problem with this argument is that it relies on an incomplete statement of the law.
pursuant to civil code section,a prevailing party is entitled to attorney fees only if it can prove it would have been liable for attorney fees had the opponent prevailed.perez,base camp condominiums.no.one th.in perez,we disapproved dictum in our earlier opinion in international billing services,emigh th,which said,where a party claims a contract allows fees and prevails,it gets fees.where it claims a contract allows fees and loses,it must pay fees.international billing services,at.we explained in perez the fallacy of the rule stated in international billing services is the assumption that if the party who claims that a contract allows fees prevails in the underlying litigation,it gets attorney fees.in truth,the party must still prove that the contract allows attorney fees.the mere allegation is not enough.perez,at.the same applies for a losing plaintiff.for a losing plaintiff to be required to pay attorney fees,the plaintiff bare allegation that he is entitled to receive attorney fees is not sufficient he also had to have established the attorney fees clauses actually entitled him to recover fees.leach home savings loan d.here,ferwerda never so established,and as we have explained,he could not so establish because the attorney fees provisions in the green book and the architectural manual did not legitimately serve to add an attorney fees provision to the cc r therefore,the committee and the wares could not claim the right to attorney fees simply because ferwerda had asked for those fees in his complaint 
in sum,there was no basis,either contractual or statutory on which to award attorney fees to the committee or the wares the fee awards must be reversed.
the trial court applied the correct legal standard in finding the denial of ferwerda building plan in was proper 
ferwerda contends the trial court applied the wrong legal standard when it determined the committee did not act unreasonably or arbitrarily in denying his building plans in.according to ferwerda,the applicable legal standard was whether the committee,in rejecting his proposed plans,was protecting an existing and definable uniform neighborhood scheme where no similar structures or relationships had been approved in the past.where there is a cacophony or hodgepodge of housing stock,diverse architectural styles,and home siting,a review committee rejection of plans for a home that is not out of keeping with the nature and siting of homes throughout the community is arbitrary and capricious.ferwerda draws this language from rancho santa fe th.
supports our conclusion the trial court applied the correct legal standard,which included but was not limited to the principles to which ferwerda refers.in the covenants empowered the association art jury and board to decide on a property owner application for home improvements based on both objective and subjective criteria,supra,th at.the art jury rejected the plaintiff proposed fence designs because the designs were inconsistent with the residential design guidelines,the desired rural community character,and the existing neighborhood character.id.at.it rejected the proposed room addition structures because the windows and wall thicknesses were not in keeping with one of the covenants that required a uniform and reasonably high standard of artistic result and attractiveness in exterior and physical appearance of said property and improvements.id.at,fn.the board upheld the art jury decisions.id.at.the trial court reversed,making factual conclusions opposite to the art jury and board.id.at.the appellate court reversed the trial court,holding the court failed to apply the proper deferential standard to test the board exercise of discretion.id.at.that standard required upholding decisions made by the governing board of a homeowner association so long as they represent good faith efforts to further the purposes of the common interest development,are consistent with the development governing documents,and comply with public policy.id.at,quoting nahrstedt lakeside village condominium cal th.the appellate court rejected the plaintiff argument that the jury and board had acted arbitrarily because several commercial buildings and homes in the community had architectural designs similar to what she was proposing,at.t he mere existence of varying fence styles within rancho santa fe does not establish arbitrary action under the covenant.id.at.but the court did add that if fences and walls within immediate neighborhood in the covenant jurisdiction lacked consistency,proposed fence design would not be inappropriate because it would not be out of harmony with them,quoting from a montana state court decision that found a committee disapproval of the property owner plans unenforceable where the development contained a cacophony of house styles.ibid.
here,the trial court applied the correct standard enunciated in,taking into account whether ferwerda was subjected to arbitrary treatment because there allegedly existed a cacophony of house styles.the trial court upheld the decision of the committee because it applied the standards set forth in the cc r,which reasonably allow for rejection of a homeowner application based on the proposed structure effect on neighboring or adjacent properties.committee member donald priest,who reviewed ferwerda proposal,was concerned with the proposed home location and configuration on the lot,specifically with the creation of a unique alleyway space that was urban and not alpine.he could not find a comparable situation in the valley.thereafter,priest made his recommendation to the committee to deny the proposed home.the trial court noted this evidence undercut ferwerda argument that he was subjected to arbitrary treatment because the committee had allegedly approved homes with the same concerning characteristics as his on this record,the court applied the correct standard when it upheld the committee denial of ferwerda building plan.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting a permanent injunction against ferwerda 
ferwerda challenges in a number of ways the court imposition of a permanent injunction prohibiting him from any further construction,excavation or alteration to his property without committee approval and requiring him to replant trees if by june he had not received approval from the committee for constructing a home on his property.he contends the committee was without power to prosecute its claim against him.he contends the cc r tree removal restrictions are against public policy.finally,he contends an injunction that requires him to replant the trees is not the proper remedy.we take each of these arguments in turn,rejecting them on the merits.
the committee had the power to prosecute its claims against ferwerda 
ferwerda contends the committee was without power to prosecute its claim of injunctive relief against him because the committee did not have power under the cc r to bring an enforcement action and the committee did not follow its own standards and procedures.these claims lack merit.
in making his claim the cc r limit who can bring an enforcement action,ferwerda fails to cite any portion of the cc r that contain such a restriction rather he simply cites to the entire cc r.this is not enough to carry his burden as appellant to show error by specific citation to the record.defend the bay city of irvine th.
regardless,the cc r imply this power and the committee articles of incorporation make it explicit.specifically,the cc r state that no building shall be erected or excavation commenced without approval of the committee.and article ii of the committee articles of incorporation states,the committee is formed for the primary purpose of promoting the social welfare of the community of alpine meadows and enforcement of the conditions and restrictive covenants applicable to the property in that community.
as to ferwerda claim the committee failed to follow its own standards and procedures,there are two problems with this argument.one,he cites not to the committee own standards and procedures,but to those of the board.and two,these standards and procedures are now obsolete.since february,the board standards and procedures to which ferwerda points have been abandoned and enforcement action has again been vested with the committee.
the tree removal restrictions in the cc r do not violate public policy 
ferwerda contends the cc r prohibition on excavation on his lot and the removal of a tree over five inches in diameter without committee approval contravene public policy,specifically public resources code section and placer county code section which he claims establish a clear and important public policy for the creation of defensible space and supersedes restrictions contained in the cc rs regarding tree removal.there are at least three problems with this argument.
one,public resources code section does not apply to ferwerda.that code section applies to a person who owns,leases,controls,operates,or maintains a building or structure in,upon,or adjoining a mountainous area,lands,lands,lands,or land that is covered with flammable material italics added.ferwerda did not have a building or structure on his lot he wanted to build one.
two,placer county code section was enacted in,which was after ferwerda cut down the trees in and.further,while that code section extends the principle of creating a defensible space to a vacant lot,ferwerda evidence did not support the proposition his actions were designed to abate therefrom all combustible material and hazardous vegetation,that constitutes a fire hazard and public nuisance which may endanger or damage neighboring property or forestland.he presented no evidence he was attempting to remove all combustible material from his lot,and it was unclear the defensible space was to protect his neighbor property or forestland.moreover,the trees that were removed were ones he had previously cited as preventing him from moving the location of his house on his lot.
three,to the extent both code sections can be read as evincing a general policy to create defensible space,the cc r do not prevent a homeowner from so doing.they simply require the homeowner to get approval from the committee before excavating on the lot and removing trees of a certain size.
on this record,there is no merit to ferwerda public policy argument.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting the permanent injunction that required ferwerda to replant trees if he has not secured a building permit 
the trial court decision to grant a permanent injunction rests within its sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of a clear abuse of discretion.thompson rv sales,th.ferwerda argues abuse of discretion because there was no evidence he had fut
