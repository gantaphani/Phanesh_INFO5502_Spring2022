an insurer that pays benefits to its insured under a first party policy is generally entitled to reimbursement from funds paid by the third party wrongdoer for the covered losses.one exception to this rule is the common law doctrine,which provides that an insurer is not entitled to these funds unless the insured has been made whole by the recovery from the tortfeasor and any other source.whether an insured has been made whole is determined by comparing the insured total damages resulting from the third party tortious conduct with the total amount the insured recovered in compensation for those damages.the narrow issue presented in this writ proceeding is whether,in calculating the amount under medical payments insurance coverage,the insured total recovery amount must be reduced by the insured attorney fees and costs incurred to obtain the compensation from the third party tortfeasor.we conclude that under california law these expenses are not deducted when calculating the total recovery received by the insured.
because the validity of plaintiff claims in this case depends on a conclusion that the attorney fees and costs are deducted from the insured gross recovery in calculating whether the insured has been made whole,we determine plaintiff complaint does not state an actionable claim under california law.we thus grant defendant petition for a writ of mandate,and order the court to vacate its order overruling defendant demurrer and enter a new order sustaining the demurrer.
factual and procedural background 
tony delanzo filed a class action complaint against his automobile insurer,allstate insurance company allstate.as amended,the complaint alleged delanzo had an allstate automobile policy that included first party,medical payments insurance coverage coverage.delanzo alleged this insurance covers reasonable and necessary medical expenses incurred because of an automobile accident and is designed to provide an additional source of funds for these expenses.
delanzo allegedly suffered injuries resulting from an automobile accident with a third party.under allstate policy provisions,allstate paid delanzo.delanzo then settled his claim against the third party tortfeasor for,and received the settlement payment in full.delanzo alleged he incurred attorney fees of and costs of for a total of to obtain this settlement.
allstate requested that delanzo repay the under allstate policy provision,which states subrogation rights when we pay,your rights of recovery from anyone else become ours up to the amount we have paid.you must protect these rights and help us enforce them.boldface omitted.in response,delanzo paid allstate,which allstate agreed was in full satisfaction of its reimbursement claim.allstate agreed to the reduction based on the rule that an insurer is required to deduct from its reimbursement a pro rata portion of the insured attorney fees and costs incurred to recover covered losses against a third party tortfeasor when the insurer had knowledge of,but did not participate in,the litigation.see lee state farm mut.auto.ins.d.
based on these alleged facts,delanzo asserted four causes of action violation of business and professions code section,conversion,unjust enrichment,and declaratory relief.the legal basis for each cause of action was delanzo assertion that allstate reimbursement claim was improper and unlawful because delanzo was not first made whole by the third party settlement plus the amount received from allstate,when taking into account the attorney fees and costs incurred to obtain the settlement.delanzo did not dispute that the settlement amount constituted full compensation for his injuries from the third party,but alleged he was not made whole by this amount because his total gross recovery of from the settlement plus from allstate,minus the costs and attorney fees to obtain this settlement,was less than 
delanzo sought to represent the class of all california insureds,past and present of allstate who were not made whole after deducting attorney fees and costs from the money they received from the resolution of their claims against third party tortfeasors the amount paid by allstate to or on behalf of such insureds pursuant to the medical payments coverage contained in their personal automobile insurance policies was less than the amount paid by such insureds for such attorney fees and costs and such insureds paid allstate money in response to its demand for reimbursement of payments it paid under such medical payments coverage.
allstate demurred to the complaint,arguing that delanzo claims did not state a cause of action on any legal theory because,under california law,the doctrine does not include a consideration of attorney fees and costs in determining whether an insured was made whole.allstate maintained that delanzo view of the rule as including a consideration of these expenses was improper because it conflicted with the settled equitable apportionment or rule that an insurer reimbursement is subject to the requirement that it pay a proportionate amount of the insured attorney fees incurred to obtain the recovery from the third party.allstate further asserted that if delanzo position were accepted,it would eliminate an insurer rights to obtain reimbursement in virtually every case.because benefits are relatively small and generally less than the amount of attorney fees to obtain recovery for personal injury losses see nager allstate ins.th,d,allstate claimed that an insurer would not be entitled to reimbursement in situations where the insured shows its recovery from the third party was equal to the insured losses.
the trial court overruled the demurrer,finding that under the doctrine an insurer who does not participate in the litigation against the third party is entitled to reimbursement only when the amount the carrier paid is not exceeded by the attorney fees and costs incurred by the insured to obtain a tort recovery.
allstate petitioned for a writ of mandate,challenging the court order overruling its demurrer.we issued an order to show cause,and provided the parties the opportunity to file additional briefing and to present oral argument.after considering the parties contentions,we grant the petition 
discussion 
the legal issue presented here concerns the appropriate allocation of funds received by an insured from a third party tortfeasor as between the insured and insurer specifically,under california law,does the rule preclude an insurer reimbursement from its insured under a policy provision after the insured obtained a recovery from a third party which fully compensated the insured for his or her personal injury losses,but the insured attorney fees and costs reduced that amount such that the insured net recovery was less than his or her total losses 
it is helpful to illustrate this issue with round figures.assume that an insured recovers in damages from a third party tortfeasor and this amount reflects the insured total personal injury losses caused by the tortfeasor.his insurer had previously paid him for his covered medical expenses thus the insured obtained a total of.the insured attorney fees and costs to collect the were.is the insurer entitled to reimbursement of any portion of the amount paid to the insured by the tortfeasor under allstate view of the law,allstate would say yes because the insured gross recovery plus is more than the insured total personal injury losses of,and thus any retention of the minus,which is the pro rata amount attributable to collecting damages for the covered injuries would result in double recovery by the insured.under delanzo view of the law,delanzo would say no because one must subtract the attorney fees and costs from the gross recovery plus minus which equals,or less than,and therefore the insured was not made whole and thus should not be required to repay any money to the insurer.
in resolving these different views,we first discuss the doctrine in the broader context of an insurer subrogation and reimbursement rights.we then summarize the manner in which other jurisdictions have treated this attorney fees and costs issue.we then explain our conclusion that under california law an insured attorney fees and costs should not be deducted from the insured total recovery for purposes of the doctrine under coverage.
ii.applicable legal principles 
subrogation and reimbursement doctrines 
traditionally,an insurer that pays its insured claim is entitled to recover the payment from the third party who caused the insured covered loss.this concept is called subrogation,and can arise by contract,statute,or equitable principles.see hodge kirkpatrick development,th,d hodge sapiano williamsburg nat.ins.th,fn,d sapiano travelers indem.ingebretsen d.upon subrogation,the insurer succeeds to its insured rights against the third party in the amount the insurer paid.hodge,supra,at,d low golden eagle ins.th,d.generally,to protect its subrogation right,an insurer may seek intervention in the insured lawsuit against the legally responsible party or may wait to seek the funds from its insured.hodge,supra,at,d plut fireman fund ins.th,d plut.
the purpose of subrogation is to prevent the insured from obtaining a double recovery and thus being unjustly enriched and to place the responsibility for paying the loss on the party who caused the loss.helfend southern cal.rapid transit dist.cal d,fn,see generally parker,the made whole doctrine unraveling the enigma wrapped in the mystery of insurance subrogation,rinaldi,apportionment of recovery between insured and insurer in a subrogation case tort ins,flower,toward correcting the misapplication of subrogation doctrine in california healthcare,baron,subrogation a pandora box awaiting closure.these purposes are consistent with the corrective and compensatory goals of the tort system.
the insurer subrogation right is similar to its right to reimbursement from its own insured,and many courts refer to the two concepts under the umbrella rubric of subrogation.see progressive west ins.superior court th,d progressive west see couch on insurance,supra.but unlike true subrogation,the insurer reimbursement right is contingent on an actual recovery by the insured from a third party.for certain types of claims,an insurer has no subrogation rights directly against a third party,and must seek recovery only by reimbursement.in california,a claim for personal injuries is not subject to subrogation because this claim can not be assigned fifield manor finston cal d,lee state farm mut.auto.ins,supra,d at.block cal.physicians service d.however,california courts hold that an insurer may obtain reimbursement of proceeds paid for personal injuries by enforcing policy provisions entitling the insurer to reimbursement from its insured.lee,supra,at.it is undisputed the insurance policy at issue here contained such a reimbursement provision.
b.the rule 
the rule is a common law exception to an insurer subrogation right.barnes independent auto.dealers of california cir,see generally couch on insurance,supra.as applied in california,the rule generally precludes an insurer from recovering any third party funds unless and until the insured has been made whole for the loss.progressive west,supra,th at,d plut,supra,th at,d sapiano,supra,th at,d chase national indemnity d.the applicability of the doctrine generally depends on whether the insured has been completely compensated for all the elements of damages,not merely those for which the insurer has indemnified the insured ibid.california courts have historically applied the rule in property loss claims.see,finnell goodman.bank cal,sapiano,supra,th at,d chase,supra,d at.however,one court recently held for the first time that the doctrine applies in a personal injury reimbursement context under insurance coverage.progressive west,supra,th,d.the progressive west court was not asked to decide,and did not discuss,the specific issue raised here concerning the proper calculation of an insured total recovery for purposes of this rule 
although courts in this state have not engaged in extended discussions of the rationale underlying the rule,commentators and courts in other jurisdictions have identified several reasons for the rule.first,where there has not been a complete recovery by the insured,there is no double recovery and therefore there is no justification for providing insurers with a subrogation right,which arguably provides a windfall to an insurer.see hare state so d,humana health plans lawton so d,baron,supra.at flower,supra.at.the exception is additionally founded on the concept that as between the insurer and insured,it is fair to place the burden for any nonrecovery of damages on the insurer who has been paid to bear the loss and who is better able to bear the loss.bush richardson,waukesha county johnson,garrity rural mut.ins,couch on insurance,supra.the rule is also viewed as a principle of priority where the wrongdoer has a fixed amount of assets,it is fair that the insured has the priority of rights to collect the full amount of compensation before the insurer may seek to collect from the wrongdoer.see schonau geico general ins.so d,garrity,supra,at.
courts in many jurisdictions,including california,hold that parties may avoid the exception by contract.see couch on insurance,supra.in california,the contractual language must be clear and specific that the parties intend to permit the insurer to obtain reimbursement even if the insured has not been made whole.progressive west,supra,th at,d sapiano,supra,th at,d see samura kaiser foundation health plan,th,d.allstate does not claim the reimbursement provision in delanzo insurance contract is sufficiently clear and specific to render the rule inapplicable in this case.
additionally,california courts have recognized that the exception does not apply if the insurer participated in prosecuting the claim against the third party.travelers indem.ingebretsen,supra,d at.see progressive west,supra,th at,d.there is no claim in this case that allstate participated with delanzo in the lawsuit against the third party tortfeasor.
finally,it is important to note a separate and independent limitation alluded to earlier on the right,which provides that an insurer reimbursement from its insured is subject to the insurer bearing a pro rata portion of the insured attorney fees and costs incurred to obtain the recovery from the third party.progressive west,supra,th at,d lee state farm mut.auto.ins,supra,d at.hartford accident indemnity gropman,d supp.this rule is based on the doctrine,which is founded on the principle of fairness to the successful litigant who achieves a benefit for others who should equitably share in the costs of that recovery.lee,supra,d at.under this rule,which is well accepted in california,an insurer seeking reimbursement from its insured must bear a portion of the attorney fees and costs incurred by the insured reflecting the proportionate amount of the total attorney fees and costs to the total amount recovered from the third party.ibid.however,contrary to allstate assertions,this rule is not dispositive on the legal issue before us because the exception and the doctrine are not mutually exclusive.see progressive west,supra,th at,d.the exception applies to preclude reimbursement only where the policyholder was not made whole and where the insurer did not participate in the recovery efforts.where,however,an insured was made whole,the doctrine operates to reduce the insurer recovery by requiring the insurer to bear a portion of the expenses for obtaining the recovery for the covered losses.
treatment of fees and costs in doctrine 
the specific issue presented here regarding the proper calculation of the insured recovery under the rule is one of first impression by the courts in this state.one california court applied the doctrine in a property insurance case and mentioned the issue of whether attorney fees and costs are deducted from the insured recovery for purposes of this rule,but the court ultimate determination on the issue was unclear.plut,supra,th at,d.
in plut,the insured homeowners settled their property loss claims with the third party tortfeasors,but this settlement was less than the homeowners claimed property losses.plut,supra,th at,d.in a later lawsuit against their property insurer seeking compensation for the same property losses,the jury awarded the homeowners an amount that fully compensated them for their total property losses.id.at,d.the legal issue in plut was whether the insurer was entitled to offset from this jury award the amounts paid by the third parties for the same losses.the appellate court found an offset was appropriate because the jury award against the insurer reflected the total amount of the homeowners damages,and therefore the plaintiffs were made whole by this award.id.at,d.
in explaining its conclusion,the plut court discussed the rule and stated that t he insured need not account to the nonparticipating insurer for more than the surplus remaining in his hands,after satisfying his loss in full and his reasonable expenses incurred in the recovery.couch on insurance ed.thus,when an insurer elects not to participate in the insured action against a tortfeasor,the insurer is entitled to subrogation only after the insured has recouped his loss and some or all of his litigation expenses incurred in the action against the tortfeasor.plut,supra,th at,d,italics in original.
although the plut court appeared to address the attorney fees issue under the doctrine,a closer look at the entire passage creates doubt as to whether the court intended to reach and decide the issue.first,the court quotation from the second edition of couch on insurance a now superseded edition was imprecise because within that same section,the treatise states the rules in the alternative where the insured prosecutes the suit against the tortfeasor,thereby incurring legal expenses and court costs,the insured is generally entitled to recover such expenses prior to any recovery going to the insurer,or the insurer must at least pay its proportionate share of the expenses.couch on insurance ed,italics added.the plut court itself also stated the rules in the alternative,and in support of this proposition,the court cited several authorities discussing the rule.plut,supra,th at,d see,texas farmers ins.seals,motor club ins.bartunek,lee state farm mut.auto.ins,supra,d.further,in applying the rule,the plut court deducted the insured litigation expenses from the settlement received from the third parties in determining the offset,but did not deduct the litigation expenses incurred to recover damages against the insurer in identifying the total made whole amount.plut,supra,at,d.
accordingly,although the plut decision contains language that could be construed as endorsing an interpretation of the rule to require the deduction of attorney fees and costs from the total amount recovered,the court relied on authorities that pertained to the doctrine that did not definitively address the issue,and the court did not apply the rule consistently to the facts before it.further,the issue arose in the context of property insurance.
unlike california courts,courts in other states have expressly considered the fee issue before us,but have reached inconsistent conclusions.see generally couch on insurance,supra.in several jurisdictions adopting the rule,the courts have stated or assumed that attorney fees and costs should be deducted from the total recovery in determining whether the insured was made whole.see skauge mountain states,nationwide mutual insurance butler,central national insurance group hotte so d,washtenaw mutual fire insurance budd,paul fire and marine insurance company rose supply company,gibbs smith,fidelity utah.although the montana courts have identified equitable grounds for this conclusion see detienne farmers union mut.ins,skauge,supra,at most of the other courts have merely restated this rule without extended analysis or discussion.see,central national insurance group,supra,so d at washtenaw mutual fire insurance,supra,at paul fire and marine insurance company,supra,at gibbs smith,supra,at nationwide mutual insurance,supra.at.
several other jurisdictions have specifically held that attorney fees and costs to obtain the third party recovery should not be deducted from the insured total recovery for purposes of the rule calculation.see,peterson safeco ins,cna ins.johnson galleries so d.the peterson court reasoned that a rule requiring a deduction of litigation expenses for purposes of determining whether the insured was made whole would improperly shift the burden of an insured attorney fees from the plaintiff in a personal injury action to the first party carrier.peterson,supra,at.the cna insurance court declined to deduct attorney fees from the insured recovery in applying the rule based on its conclusion that the insured could not have recovered those fees in the underlying litigation against the third party.cna,supra,so d at.
one federal district court recently interpreted california law to hold that attorney fees and costs should be deducted before determining whether the insured was made whole.chong state farm mutual automobile insurance d chong.chong,however,expressed substantial reluctan ce to decide the issue given the lack of state law authority,and suggested that c ertification of this question to the california supreme court would obviously be the ideal solution.id.at fn.for the reasons explained below,we disagree with the chong court interpretation of california law.
iii.analysis 
applicable legal doctrines do not support delanzo theory in this case 
because there is no case law in california that specifically guides our resolution of the legal issue presented,our analysis focuses on our review of the doctrinal grounds for this state rules and the exception to those rules,as well as the nature and purpose of coverage.based on this analysis,we conclude that in determining whether an insured has been made whole,the amount of the insured total recovery should not be reduced by the attorney fees and expenses incurred by the insured to obtain the recovery from a third party tortfeasor.
first,the purposes underlying the the injured party receives full compensation and imposing the burden for nonrecovery of damages on the party best able to bear the concepts derived from tort law.a fundamental objective of tort law is to make a plaintiff whole for damages suffered to the extent a defendant is responsible for those damages.tort damages are awarded to fully compensate the victim for all injury suffered.erlich menezes cal th,d,brackets in original strebel brenlar investments,th,d.however,under the american rule adopted in california,a plaintiff attorney fees are not included in determining the plaintiff total losses,absent a statutory exception or contractual provision.see trope katz cal th,d,california follows what is commonly referred to as the american rule which provides that each party to a lawsuit must ordinarily pay his own attorney fees.thus,under california law,the fact that an insured does not recover his or her attorney fees in an underlying tort action does not show the insured did not receive full compensation for the loss from the third party.the rule provides that an insurer is not entitled to reimbursement until the insured has been fully compensated.hodge,supra,th at,d.in the tort context,full compensation refers to payment for all damages suffered,and does not include attorney fees see cna ins.johnson galleries,supra,so d at.
we reach a similar conclusion when considering the additional rationale underlying the rule that,as between the insurer and insured,it is fair to place the burden for any nonrecovery of damages on the insurer who is better able to bear the loss.see couch on insurance,supra,garrity rural mut.ins,supra,at.in this case,delanzo admits he received a total recovery for his personal injury losses from the third party and received credit for that portion of his attorney fees and costs attributable to recovery of the covered losses from the third party through a deduction from allstate reimbursement.delanzo did not pay or bargain for,and thus could not have reasonably expected,insurance coverage that would compensate him for damages over and above his medical payments or for litigation expenses to collect these uncovered damages.however,that would be the effect of delanzo interpretation of the rule.if we were to conclude that allstate should be denied any reimbursement because of delanzo obligation to pay attorney fees and costs to collect the uncovered losses,we would effectively shift the burden of his attorney fees from the plaintiff in a personal injury action to the first party carrier.peterson safeco ins,supra,at.this would be inconsistent with the general rule that an insurance company may be obligated to pay attorney fees to its insured only in disputes between the insured and the insurer and only under certain circumstances.see brandt superior court cal d.
likewise,when viewing the rule as a rule of priority,there is no conflict between the insured and insurer with respect to attorney fees in this situation because the insured is not entitled to recover these fees directly from the tortfeasor.see lee state farm mut.auto.ins,supra,d at.
finally,although the rule is an equitable concept,we reject delanzo suggestions that our interpretation of the scope of the doctrine should be based solely on our belief of what is fair or equitable under the circumstances.we agree with delanzo that allstate has more resources than the individual policyholder and thus may be better able to absorb the cost of a rule that would preclude reimbursement in insurance cases,as opposed to the burden on a policyholder to pay for his or her litigation expenses related to noncovered losses.but it is not the purpose of the rule to rewrite the parties contract merely because an insurer has more resources than its insured or to interfere with the parties reasonable expectations such that it would provide the insured with a benefit for which he did not pay and require the insurer to pay for a risk it did not assume.
it is well established in this state that an insurer has the right to enforce a contractual provision to require an insured to repay the insurer in the event of a recovery for the covered loss from a third party.it is not the purpose of the exception to eliminate this right merely because it would appear equitable to do so.rather,the applicability of the rule depends on whether the insured has received an amount that is equivalent to all the damages to which he or she is entitled under california law.where,as here,the insured acknowledges that he has received that full recovery,there is no valid basis for precluding an insurer from reimbursement after the insured has twice recovered for the same loss.
chong reasoning is unpersuasive 
as noted earlier,one federal district court recently considered the identical legal issue presented here and reached an opposite conclusion.chong,supra,d.in that case,the plaintiff brought a class action against her insurer,alleging the insurer reimbursement claim for benefit payments was improper because the plaintiff net recovery from a third party after deducting attorney fees and costs was below the amount the plaintiff needed to be made whole.id.at.in denying the insurer motion to strike the complaint,the district court held that absent a contractual provision to the contrary,the rule requires that a policyholder fully recover her loss and litigation expenses,including attorney fees and costs,before a nonparticipating carrier can seek reimbursement from her tort recovery.id.at.
the chong court reasoned that deducting attorney fees from the insured recovery would simply more nearly put the policyholder back in the situation she would have been had her loss not occurred.chong,supra,d at.the court stated this result was not unfair to the insurer because the insured failure to recover his or her entire loss is a risk the insured has paid the insurer to assume.id.at,italics omitted,quoting skauge mountain states,supra,at.chong conversely found that a rule not allowing a deduction for attorney fees would be unfair to policyholders because it would allow insurers to gamble with the policyholder money and would encourage insurance carriers,which generally have resources far superior to those of their policyholders,to sit out their policyholders tort claims.chong,supra,at.chong stated that an insurance carrier could protect its reimbursement right by simply intervening in the policyholder tort action ibid.
we find each of chong reasons to be unpersuasive,particularly in the specific context of insurance coverage.first,with respect to chong concern with placing the insured back in the situation he or she would have been before the loss,the rule promotes this goal by requiring that an insured recover for all of his or her losses covered and uncovered before an insurer may obtain reimbursement.we agree with this principle.however,under california law,the concept of full recovery for tortious conduct has never been construed to include recovery for attorney fees.absent a contract provision or statutory exception,an insured is entitled to compensation for his or her losses from a third party,but this compensation refers to tort damages that do not include attorney fees.
additionally,we find unsupported chong view that an insured pays his coverage carrier to assume the risk that the insured will recover less than her total loss.chong,supra,d at.an insured who purchases coverage does not pay the insurer to cover more than the insured reasonable medical expenses as defined in the insurance contract.as delanzo acknowledges in his amended complaint,this coverage is limited,and is designed only to provide an additional source of funds for reasonable and necessary medical expenses.under well settled subrogation rules,an insurer is entitled to reimbursement if the insured collects a full recovery for the same damages against the wrongdoer.under the rule,the insurer who seeks reimbursement for the duplicate recovery is required to bear the pro rata portion of the expenses incurred by its insured to recover for the covered losses.see progressive west,supra,th at,d lee state farm mut.auto.ins,supra,d at.the insurer burden to pay for these costs flows directly from its obligation to pay covered losses.ibid.however,an insurer that provides coverage does not assume the risk to bear the cost of uncovered losses or the expenses to recover those losses such as pain and suffering,property damage,or lost wages.thus,with respect to the costs to recover for these losses,there is no equitable basis for concluding that the loss should be borne by the insurer for that is the risk the insured has paid it to assume.chong,supra,d at,italics omitted.
we likewise find unsupported chong assertion that the insurer interpretation of the rule is unfair to policyholders because it would allow insurers to engage in a risk free gamble with the policyholder money.chong,supra,d at.before seeking reimbursement,the insurer must have paid all policy benefits to the insured thus,the insurer is not in a position to gamble with the insured money.instead,it is the insured who has already received all covered benefits who must make the decision whether to bring a personal injury action to recover for additional noncovered losses from a third party.while the decision to proceed with the litigation may indirectly benefit the insurer,the insurer must pay its full share of attorney fees before it is entitled to the reimbursement.further,the requirement that the insured bear the legal expenses related to collecting for uninsured losses is not unfair because the insured has not paid a premium for coverage of these legal expenses.the rule is an exception to subrogation applicable in circumstances where there is no potential the insured will obtain a double recovery for the same injuries.an insured who received benefits from the insurer and is successful in obtaining damages for these same medical expenses from a third party and for all other claimed damages does receive double recovery for the medical expenses.
chong nonetheless expressed concern that if attorney fees and costs are not included in the calculation,an insurer would be encouraged to sit out its insured tort action because the insurer could obtain full reimbursement if the policyholder fully recovers for his losses,but the insurer would not be required to bear any costs if the policyholder is unsuccessful.chong,supra,d at.
