we find merit in appeal,and no merit in the duales appeal.we shall reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
as far as we can discern them,these are the facts plaintiffs purchased a automobile in march for.
in june,plaintiffs sued usa,and of sacramento,seeking rescission,contract revocation and damages and penalties under the act,et.they alleged that usa,failed to adequately service and repair the car after a reasonable number of attempts for the following complaint s the dome lamp will not go off when the door is closed,rattle from the suspension when making a left hand turn or,rear muffler makes improper noises,the driver seat switch is broken,loud knocking noise heard from under the car over rough roads when making a,loud thump noise heard when sitting at a stop light,creaking noises heard from the hard top when driving,rear hat shelf rattles over rough roads,clunk from the rear of the car on if someone hit you from the rear,rubbing noise heard from the left front of the vehicle at times while turning,vehicle lost power while driving on the freeway,vehicle bucks and misfires,clunk from the rear of the car at stops,engine stalls at times and there is a clunk noise after driving long periods and coming to a stop.
plaintiffs sought return of the sum paid for the car,plus interest from the date of purchase,treble damages,attorney fees,and costs.
defendant served plaintiffs with a statutory offer to compromise code civ,section,in which it offered to take back the car in exchange for,plus plaintiffs reasonably incurred attorney fees and all court costs incurred to date to be determined by the court if the parties could not agree.plaintiffs did not accept the settlement offer they did not dispute the settlement amount,but wished to be allowed to bring a motion for interest on that amount.
the case proceeded to trial.although no transcript of the trial proceedings is in the appellate record,the trial court later characterized the proceedings this way at the conclusion of the trial,the jury awarded plaintiff s in damages based on a finding that the rear thump was a nonconformity covered by the warranty that substantially impaired the use,value or safety of the vehicle.the jury also found that the mileage of the vehicle was miles when the nonconformity was brought in for repair.
while the jury found that the mercedes benz failed to repair and then promptly repurchase the vehicle,they did not find that the mercedes benz willfully failed to repurchase the vehicle and did not assess a penalty against the defendant s.the total award of reflects the purchase price of the vehicle less the mileage use,as calculated under the act.
after trial,plaintiffs sought an award of all of their attorney fees of the act.by separate motion,plaintiffs also sought prejudgment interest of,calculated on the judgment amount from the date they bought the car.
defendant filed its own cost bill,but did not seek attorney fees.defendant also opposed plaintiffs application for attorney fees on the ground its section offer should operate to deny plaintiffs postoffer fees and costs.
the court granted plaintiffs request for attorney fees in part.the court reasoned that defendant section offer does not effect sic the attorneys fees allowable in this case because ccp is a general statute effecting sic costs allowed in cases where a party either achieves or fails to achieve a better result at trial while t he act is a specific statute allowing costs,including attorneys fees,for prosecuting cases such as the case at bar.however,the court rejected some individual attorney fee items as not necessary to the prosecution of this case,reduced other items,and ultimately awarded plaintiffs in attorney fees.
the court granted both plaintiffs and defendant requests for costs,awarding plaintiffs costs of without regard to whether they were incurred before or after defendant section offer and awarding defendant postoffer costs of.aa,
the court denied plaintiffs request for prejudgment interest,reasoning in its tentative ruling that the amount of damages was not certain,nor could it be made certain,until the jury determined whether the re was a nonconformity,whether it impaired the use,value or safety of the vehicle,and the mileage at which the nonconformity was presented for repair.all of these issues were contested at the trial of this matter.at the hearing,the court noted that,in light of expert testimony presented by the defense,the only defect found by the jury did not affect the car safety,et cetera and so that was a disputed issue.and the mileage for the offset was disputed until such time as the jury rendered its verdicts.
discussion 
contends the court erred in awarding plaintiffs attorney fees and costs incurred after they rejected defendant offer to compromise under code of civil procedure section.we agree.the trial court erred in concluding that defendant section offer does not effect sic the attorneys fees allowable in this case.
on review of an award of attorney fees after trial,the normal standard of review is abuse of discretion.however,de novo review of such a trial court order is warranted where the determination of whether the criteria for an award of attorney fees and costs in this context have been satisfied amounts to statutory construction and a question of law.carver chevron,th,d.

here,the applicable attorney fee statute that triggers application of sections and is civil code section,subdivision d,which states if the buyer prevails in an action under this section act,the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses,including attorney fees based on actual time expended,determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.we agree that plaintiffs prevailed within the meaning of civil code section,subdivision d and code of civil procedure section.
however,defendant made a pretrial settlement offer under code of civil procedure section.that section provides in pertinent part c if an offer made by a defendant is not accepted and the plaintiff fails to obtain a more favorable judgment or award,the plaintiff shall not recover his or her postoffer costs and shall pay the defendant costs from the time of the offer.in addition,in any action or proceeding other than an eminent domain action,the court or arbitrator,in its discretion,may require the plaintiff to pay a reasonable sum to cover costs of the services of expert witnesses,who are not regular employees of any party,actually incurred and reasonably necessary in either,or both,preparation for trial or arbitration,or during trial or arbitration,of the case by the defendant,subd.c.
