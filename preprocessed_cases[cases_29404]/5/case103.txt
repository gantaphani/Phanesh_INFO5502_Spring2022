jurisdiction 
because the parties settled the underlying dispute,the district court did not explicitly rule on the jurisdictional issues raised in motion to remand.by incorporating the settlement completely into a final judgment,however,the district court assumed it had jurisdiction to enter the settlement judgment.in the settlement judgment,the parties acknowledged and agreed to that jurisdiction as well as the court continuing jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.the parties did not bring a direct appeal challenging the district court jurisdiction or any other aspect of the settlement judgment within the time period provided for appeal.see lipman dye,cir noting that w ithout appeal,the court prior settlement order of dismissal became final thus barring any further attempt to reopen the case in ordinary course.now,as part of his appeal of the sanctions order,attempts to collaterally attack the jurisdictional basis for the settlement judgment,asserting a lack of complete diversity.

a void judgment is to be distinguished from an erroneous one,in that the latter is subject only to direct attack.a void judgment is one which,from its inception,was a complete nullity and without legal effect while absence of subject matter jurisdiction may make a judgment void,such total want of jurisdiction must be distinguished from an error in the exercise of jurisdiction which will not render the judgment void.only in the rare instance of a clear usurpation of power will a judgment be rendered void.
