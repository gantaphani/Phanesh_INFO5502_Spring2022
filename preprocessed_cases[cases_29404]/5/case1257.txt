three cases are consolidated for purposes of this appeal,all arising from the acrimonious departure of michael king from his former employer,pa consulting group,pa.this dispute centers on a series of noncompete provisions contained in king employment contract.a jury found against king on all but his invasion of privacy claim and for pa on its breach of loyalty counterclaim.king now appeals the district court determination that the noncompete provisions were enforceable,submission of his breach of contract claim to the jury,eve of trial discovery ruling,and denial of his motion for a new trial.pa the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law,and its motion for attorneys fees.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
pa is a professional consulting firm with offices in countries and over employees.although it is a new jersey corporation with a human resources office in that state,pa is headquartered in washington.in,pa successfully acquired hagler bailly,hb,an energy consulting firm,in a cash transaction.at the time of the acquisition,king was a senior vice president svp in hb boulder,colorado office.king was also an hb shareholder.as part of the merger,king sold his hb shares for approximately.the merger was conditioned upon at least of hb svps signing pa employment agreements.
on june,in anticipation of the merger,king signed an employment contract the agreement governing his employment with.king lived and worked in colorado,and the agreement was signed in colorado.pa drafted the agreement,which it described as a global agreement used for approximately partners around the world.section states this agreement and all matters arising in connection with it shall be governed by the law of the state of new jersey and shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the new jersey courts.simultaneous with the agreement,the parties signed a side letter amending the terms of the agreement,which notes that the agreement has been executed in anticipation of the execution of the agreement and plan of merger among the company,hagler bailly,and pa consulting group the merger agreement and is conditional upon the consummation of the transactions authorized by such merger agreement.
king agreed to several restrictions.the agreement establishes a restricted period following termination,during which the following provisions would attach 
in respect of any client of pa for whom you have rendered any services on behalf of pa during the two years preceding the termination of your employment,you will not during the restricted period,directly or indirectly,unless authorized by pa 
a solicit business from a client,whether on behalf of yourself or another person or entity,which business is of the same or similar nature to the services you provided on behalf of pa.
b encourage any client not to do business with pa.
c provide for such client or offer to do so services of the same or similar nature or assist or facilitate the provision of such services as an independent contractor or otherwise although notwithstanding the foregoing,you may accept employment with any such client.
during the restricted period you will not solicit or entice away from pa or attempt to do so or accept for employment any employee of pa who entered employment with pa prior to the termination of your employment.
the side letter includes a limited exception to the restrictions notwithstanding the provisions of section of the agreement,should you terminate your employment during the period commencing months following the completion of the transactions authorized by the merger agreement,pa shall waive the provision contained in section c of the agreement.section of the agreement provides that w here you do not provide the appropriate notice of resignation,salary equivalent to the amount payable for the shortfall in notice will be forfeited in lieu of notice,as appropriate.the side letter sets a notice period of three months for all partner ranks.
king precise job title upon joining pa is unclear.the agreement merely states that he was appointed as a consultant with pa energy group.a document incorporated into the agreement,entitled your career as a consultant in pa,lists five consulting ranks analyst,consultant analyst,consultant,principal consultant and managing consultant.it describes consultant as a relatively position.
however,pa head of human resources,james cullens,stated in deposition testimony that king along with the other hb svps entered the company as an associate partner.in explaining the inconsistency,cullens noted that,as a consulting firm,pa had two types of agreements a consultant agreement and an administrative staff agreement.the consultant designation,he stated,simply distinguished king from pa administrative staff.cullens further testified that pa employment agreements do not use the term partner because pa is not a partnership.the agreement also incorporated a document titled the partner at pa,which describes the associate partner designation as follows all external entry candidates into the partner group will be designated as associate partners.they will serve an initial period during which their track record within pa is built up,so that the partner election committee has the information base it needs to confirm their partnership.king also listed his initial position with pa as associate partner on his resume.
upon joining pa in october,king provided energy consulting services,with a focus on business development.he had several layers of management above him,but also had a group of employees working under him.king could not hire or fire workers,but was empowered to enter contracts on behalf of pa on a limited basis.pa january,organizational chart indicates that king was an associate partner in the energy of approximately partners at.it also lists king as chairman of the committee for regional development in the americas and canada.his total compensation in including both hb and pa pay was slightly over million.king rose quickly through the ranks at pa by july,he was one of twelve managing partners worldwide and head of pa global wholesale energy markets practice.his anticipated compensation in was million 
on july,king sent an email to bruce tindale,pa coo,and jon moynihan,pa ceo,informing them of his plans to pursue the options with national economic research associates nera a pa competitor.shortly thereafter king sent a fax entitled confirmation of my resignation of july,indicating he believed his last day of employment would be october.pa acknowledged his resignation that same day,but noted t here may be a couple of things to sort out,such as your leaving date which we believe is november under the terms of your contract,but that is something we can get mutual clarity on over the coming weeks as we work together to sort out the handover arrangements.
on september,king emailed tindale and cullens,in an effort to close the loop on his departure.king stated that he provided notice on july,and,calculating a notice period,his final day would be october.by providing notice within the window period,per the terms of the side letter,he believed he was relieved of the noncompete restrictions listed in c of the agreement.pa disagreed with king characterization.cullens asserted that king july email was not an effective notice of resignation under the agreement because it was unclear and was not delivered in the proper form as specified in the agreement via hard copy,mail,or fax.adding three months to the date of king august,fax,cullens tabulated a final day of november.he also indicated that the window period ran from april to october,which would require an employee to provide notice of termination by july,in order to take advantage of the c waiver.king claims this was the first time pa informed him of its calculation of the window period.
king responded through counsel on september.he argued that pa was required to waive the c restrictions as long as he terminated his employment within the window period,and amended his date of termination to october.although king acknowledged he was bound by the notice period,he claimed that of the states w here you do not provide the appropriate notice of resignation,salary equivalent to the amount payable for the shortfall in notice will be forfeited in lieu of notice,as appropriate amounted to a liquidated damages clause.by this reasoning,king provided insufficient notice,but pa could recover only the salary equivalent to the amount payable for the shortfall in notice,and was still obligated to waive c.on october,pa responded through counsel,reasserting its position that king last day would be november,and that he would be bound by c.
king completed his last day of work at pa on october.because his employment offer from nera was contingent upon resolution of the noncompete provisions in the agreement,however,he was unable to begin work with nera until february.following king resignation,pa continued to distribute promotional materials listing king as the contact person for pa wholesale energy markets practice.king replacement,todd filsinger,directed pa employees to change king pa voicemail message to indicate king was unavailable,but that the caller should leave a message.filsinger also had all messages sent to king pa email account forwarded to him.
prior to his last day,and unbeknownst to pa,king had filed a complaint in the district court for the district of colorado seeking injunctive and declaratory relief regarding the enforceability of the noncompete restrictions on september.pa filed a complaint on october,in new jersey superior court on the same issue.king removed the latter case to the district court for the district of new jersey on october.finding that the contract contained a mandatory clause,the district court for the district of colorado dismissed king action on november.the case proceeded in new jersey,where the court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting pa from enforcing c of the agreement.on september,however,this court vacated the dismissal of the colorado case and remanded to the federal district court in colorado.king successfully moved to transfer the new jersey case to colorado and an order of consolidation was issued on october.
before the colorado district court,king filed a motion for partial summary judgment arguing that the noncompete provisions were void under colorado law.pa filed a,countering that new jersey law applied,and that the noncompete provisions were valid under either state law.the district court found that new jersey law governed the agreement,and that the noncompete restrictions were enforceable under either new jersey or colorado law.accordingly,it dismissed king claim that the noncompete restrictions were void.in his trial brief,king requested the district court rule as a matter of law that pa breached the agreement by failing to waive c.the court declined to do so.
a jury trial was then held on the following claims king claim that pa breached the agreement by failing to waive c king claim that pa breached its implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by trading on his name after he left pa,and intercepting calls and emails intended for him king claim that pa violated the lanham act by deceptively using his name king claim that pa use of his name constituted unfair competition king claim that pa use of his name constituted invasion of privacy pa counterclaim that king breached his contract by disclosing confidential information to nera and pa counterclaim that king breached his duty of loyalty by disclosing information to nera.
because the evidence included a number of confidential,proprietary documents,discovery was conducted under a consent protective order.the most sensitive documents were designated attorneys eyes only,prohibiting the parties from viewing them.on december,the district court granted king motion to redesignate certain documents from attorneys eyes only to highly confidential.the documents detailed clients for whom king worked while employed at pa,who continued to use pa following king departure.after reviewing these documents,king requested additional documentary discovery as well as third party depositions on january.noting that they were on the eve of trial,the court denied king request.
during trial,king testified that he spoke to catherine mcenearney in the summer of,who was at that time a senior counsel with.although mcenearney herself did not appear in court,king testified she told him that he could avail himself of the c waiver if he served notice of his termination before october.during closing arguments,pa counsel addressed this testimony as follows now kathy mcenearney.we heard some testimony about her.all we have is king now what would you do you were in this spot where he is,what would you do you would claim to have had a conversation with a kathy mcenearney.he posited two explanations for king silence on the mcenearney conversation during his departure from pa,the less charitable of which is that the conversation never happened.king did not object to this statement during closing,but did raise the issue the next day,before the case was submitted to the jury.
the jury found against king on all but his invasion of privacy claim and awarded him damages in the amount of.on pa counterclaims,the jury found that king did not breach his contract,but that he did breach his duty of loyalty.it awarded pa in compensatory damages,plus in punitive damages.the court determined that neither party was entitled to attorneys fees.king subsequently moved for a new trial,arguing that pa closing argument was improper.pa moved for attorneys fees on king lanham act claim,and filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on king invasion of privacy claim.the district court denied all three motions.
king now appeals the district court summary judgment ruling that the noncompete provisions of the agreement were enforceable submission of his breach of contract claim to the jury denial of his request for additional discovery and denial of his motion for a new trial.pa the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law on king invasion of privacy claim and denial of its motion for attorneys fees for defending king lanham act claim.
we review the grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard employed by the district court.sequoyah county rural water dist.town of muldrow,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.we review a district court choice of law determination de novo.doering ex rel.barrett copper mountain,cir.its underlying factual determinations,however,are reviewed for clear error.id.
section of the agreement provides t his agreement and all matters arising in connection with it shall be governed by the law of the state of new jersey.the parties agree that of the restatement second of conflict of laws governs our review of this clause.it reads 
the law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied unless b application of the law of the chosen state would be contrary to a fundamental policy of a state which has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue and which,under the rule of,would be the state of the applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties.
our initial inquiry is whether colorado has a materially greater interest in determining whether the agreement noncompete restrictions are enforceable.in answering this question we are guided by,sfr,cir.in that case we held that utah had a materially greater interest in determining the enforceability of certain noncompete provisions,notwithstanding the parties choice of colorado law,because important policy considerations of utah are involved in assessing the validity of the covenant not to compete prohibiting plaintiff,a utah resident,from having employment in his field for a period of seven years within the entire state of utah.id.at.
pa correctly notes that the restrictions at issue in distribs.were more severe in both duration and scope than those in the agreement.nevertheless,we conclude that colorado has a materially greater interest in this issue.king is a resident of colorado,he signed the contract in colorado,and his sole place of work was colorado.the district court made much of pa need for uniformly interpreted contracts,but the relevant interest is not pa,but rather that of the chosen state.new jersey interest in the issue is at most tangential.pa is incorporated in new jersey and maintains a human resources office there,but is headquartered in washington.it strains credulity to suggest that new jersey interest in deciding whether king is bound by the agreement noncompete provisions approaches that of colorado,the state in which king lives and works,and in which the contract was signed.
we next consider whether the application of new jersey law to the noncompete provisions would be contrary to a fundamental policy of colorado.restatement second of conflict of laws.new jersey courts will enforce a noncompete agreement that protects the legitimate interests of the employer,imposes no undue hardship on the employee,and is not injurious to the public.solari indus.malady.colorado noncompete agreement policy,as codified,provides 
any covenant not to compete which restricts the right of any person to receive compensation for performance of skilled or unskilled labor for any employer shall be void,but this subsection shall not apply to 
a any contract for the purchase and sale of a business or the assets of a business 
b any contract for the protection of trade secrets 
c any contractual provision providing for recovery of the expense of educating and training an employee who has served an employer for a period of less than two years 
d executive and management personnel and officers and employees who constitute professional staff to executive and management personnel.
although pa argues that these provisions are essentially equivalent,they are plainly not.new jersey will enforce noncompete agreements except under specific conditions in which they are deemed unreasonable.colorado default is just the opposite it will not enforce noncompete agreements unless they fall within a few circumstances.moreover,both state and federal courts have recognized colorado significant interest in limiting noncompete agreements.see dresser indus.sandvick,cir the states where the parties entered into the employment,wyoming,and north a substantial interest in invalidating covenants not to compete signed within their borders.nutting ram,d,colorado law embodies a strong public policy which disfavors covenants not to compete,protecting employees from clauses except in carefully defined circumstances.quotation omitted dba enters.findlay,covenants not to compete,with some narrow exceptions,are contrary to the public policy of colorado and are void.
colorado thus has a fundamental policy of voiding noncompete provisions that do not fall within one of the statutory exceptions.unlike the restatement materially greater interest prong,under which we need only examine whether the determination of an issue would be problematic,the fundamental policy prong requires us to look to whether the application of another state law would violate colorado policy.to answer that question,we must compare the dueling regimes to determine whether they would reach opposing results.if they would not,colorado fundamental policy limiting noncompete agreements is not offended.see,at.
king concedes that the agreement noncompete provisions would be enforceable under new jersey law.king argues that they are per se invalid under colorado law because they are naked.for this proposition,he cites dresser,which states a naked covenant not to compete is void under the colorado statute.at citing.accounting,mergenthaler.it is unclear,however,what the dresser indus.court meant by naked covenant.king contends that a naked covenant is one that does not indicate which of the statutory exceptions provides the basis for its enforceability.pa counters that naked refers to a prohibition that is primarily aimed at restricting competition,rather than protecting legitimate business interests.
we are persuaded by pa argument.dresser indus.considered whether the noncompete agreements at issue fell within several exceptions.at.if colorado law required a magic words reference to a statutory exception,the only inquiry would be whether the contested provision cited an exception.king reading is also unsupported by the few cases using the phrase naked covenant to describe a noncompete agreement.see barran comm r,cir describing a naked covenant as not associated with a transfer of assets davee united states,defining a naked covenant as one unaccompanied by the sale of the assets of the related business sound ship.bethlehem steel,distinguishing naked covenant from those merely ancillary to a main lawful contract.finally,pa correctly notes that colorado courts have enforced several noncompete agreements that meet king definition of naked.see gold messenger,mcguay,mgmt.recruiters of boulder,miller,boulder med.ctr.moore,holding that a noncompete agreement was valid under two statutory exceptions,but not quoting the provision.
accordingly,the enforceability of the noncompete provisions must stand or fall on the applicability of one or more of the statutory exceptions.the first exception is for a ny contract for the purchase and sale of a business or the assets of a business.a.in holding that king fell within the business purchase exception,the district court stated 
because pa was purchasing hagler bailly business relationships,institutional knowledge,intellectual capital,and the consultancy practice as a whole,and that purchase was contingent in part on king and the other vice presidents moving from hagler bailly to pa,i conclude that king decision to work for pa and his agreement memorializing that decision was sic integral to the acquisition.
we agree.king was not merely an employee at was also a shareholder.pursuant to the acquisition he sold his shares for approximately.although the employment contract and the merger agreement were not integrated,the side letter addendum states that the agreement was executed in anticipation of the execution of the merger agreement and is conditional upon the consummation of the transactions authorized by such merger agreement.moreover,the merger was conditional upon at least of hb svps including king signing pa employment agreements.in other words,as the district court correctly found,the noncompete provisions gave pa critical security in connection with its acquisition of hb.absent those provisions,pa would have purchased the intellectual capital of hb,which included king and other senior employees,with no guarantee that the capital would not walk out the door after the merger.although king refusal to sign the agreement would not,alone,have torpedoed the merger,this fact does not alter our conclusion that pa paid million largely to secure the services of king and his hb colleagues.
the instant scenario is similar to that in boulder med.ctr.there,defendant richard moore,was a partner in a boulder,colorado medical practice.at.the partnership was dissolved and its assets transferred to a professional corporation.id.moore sold his stock in the newly formed professional corporation to the boulder medical center and signed an employment contract with the center,which included a noncompete provision.id.after moore resigned,the center brought suit to enforce the noncompete agreement.the trial court ruled that the business purchase exception was applicable and the colorado court of appeals affirmed.id.explicitly rejecting moore argument that the exception requires a perfect fit between a personal sale and the noncompete provision,the court of appeals concluded that moore interest in the medical partnership,a partnership that owned the practice medical equipment,and a corporation that owned real property upon which the center was located,was sufficient to invoke the exception.id.in the same vein,king sale of hb stock,coupled with the merger agreement explicit condition that most hb svps,including king,sign noncompete agreements,places the agreement squarely within.a.
