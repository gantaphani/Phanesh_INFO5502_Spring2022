introduction 
les jankey jankey,a person with a disability who uses a wheelchair for mobility,brought an action against song koo lee lee,the owner of k d market,a small store in san francisco mission district.the suit alleges that lee discriminated against jankey on the basis of his disability because architectural barriers denied him entry to the market.jankey action sought,among other relief,parallel causes of action for injunctive relief pursuant to the americans with disabilities act of et.ada and the california disabled persons act,et.cdpa.the court entered summary judgment on all causes of action for lee,which is not at issue in this appeal.
instead,this appeal is from an order awarding lee his attorney fees in the amount of under civil code section section,which mandates that the prevailing party in an action to enjoin a violation of disability access requirements shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees.italics added.relying on the ninth circuit decision in hubbard sobreck,llc cir hubbard i,opinion amended and superseded on denial of rehearing by hubbard sobreck,llc cir hubbard ii,jankey claims that attorney fees were improperly awarded to lee as a prevailing defendant on jankey claim for injunctive relief under section.hubbard ii held that a mandatory award of fees to a prevailing defendant under section without a showing that the plaintiff lawsuit was frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless is inconsistent with,and therefore preempted by,the ada.hubbard ii at.we respectfully disagree with the hubbard ii court preemption analysis,and conclude that attorney fees were properly awarded to lee as a prevailing defendant under section.we further find that the amount of attorney fees and costs was well within the trial court discretion.consequently,we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
jankey and disability rights enforcement education services helping you help others drees brought this lawsuit against lee doing business as k d market,a small independently owned and operated store that has been in the mission district for years.lee does not own the building,but has operated the market since.
jankey asserted that lee violated his rights by denying plaintiffs and the class of other similarly situated persons with physical disabilities access to,the full and equal enjoyment of,opportunity to participate in,and benefit from,the goods,facilities,and services offered by the market.specifically,jankey alleged that a step located at the entry of k d market was an architectural barrier that prevented him and other wheelchair bound individuals from wheeling directly into the store.jankey claimed lee was in violation of the ada et the cdpa et the unruh civil rights act et the unruh act and health and safety code section.among other relief,jankey lawsuit sought injunctive relief pursuant to the ada a and under section,to make the subject place of public accommodation readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities 
lee filed a motion for summary judgment contending that jankey claims were deficient because removing the threshold step at the market was not a readily achievable task within the meaning of the ada jankey was not denied reasonable access to goods and services lee utilized alternative methods to provide goods and services to jankey which complied with ada requirements jankey claim under health and safety code section was not cognizable because the market does not have a public restroom and drees lacked standing to prosecute this lawsuit.
the trial court granted summary judgment in lee favor on june.the court found that lee had proved his affirmative defense to all causes of action that because of the regulatory permit process,the removal of the architectural barrier and the installation of a ramp was contrary to applicable law and not readily achievable.the court also found that drees lacked standing to maintain this action.as noted,the correctness of this ruling is not challenged by jankey in this appeal.
lee,as the prevailing party,thereafter brought a motion to recover his attorney fees under section.in ruling on the fee motion,the parties below disagreed whether the trial court should apply the ninth circuit decision in hubbard ii,supra,or the california appellate court decision in molski arciero wine group th molski.as noted,in hubbard,the court used preemption principles to require a prevailing defendant,seeking an award of attorney fees under section,to show that the disabled plaintiff claims were frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless hubbard ii,supra,at.in molski,the court held that attorney fees were automatically available to a prevailing defendant under section,notwithstanding that the disabled plaintiff claims could not be characterized as frivolous.molski,supra,th at.
upon considering the parties arguments,the trial court determined that the molski court analysis controlled,and that lee was entitled to a mandatory award of attorney fees under section.the court made no finding on whether jankey lawsuit could be characterized as frivolous.the court awarded lee in attorney fees and in costs.judgment was entered on august.jankey then filed an appeal from the court award of attorney fees and costs to lee.
discussiona.standard of review 
generally,a trial court determination of whether a party is entitled to an award of attorney fees,and the calculation of such a fee award,are both reviewed for abuse of discretion.press lucky stores,cal d,ramos countrywide home loans,th.however,jankey claims the trial court used the wrong legal standard in granting lee attorney fees under section.a lthough the normal standard of review regarding an attorney fees award is abuse of discretion,discretion may not be exercised whimsically,and reversal is required where there is no reasonable basis for the ruling or when the trial court has applied the wrong test to determine if the statutory requirements were satisfied.citation.ramos countrywide home loans,supra,at.in determining whether the court used the correct legal standard in awarding attorney fees,de novo review is required.harman city and county of san francisco th,silver boatwright home inspection,th.
jankey argument that section mandatory fee award provision is preempted by the discretionary standard under the ada is supported by the ninth circuit decision in hubbard ii,supra,the complaint filed by the disabled plaintiffs in hubbard alleged,among other things,that the defendant restaurant owners violated both the federal ada and california cdpa.the court entered judgment for the defendants,finding that plaintiffs had failed to show that the alleged barriers denied them full and equal enjoyment of the restaurants services and facilities.id.at.defendants then moved for attorney fees under the ada and section of the cdpa.hubbard ii,supra,at.the district court concluded that attorney fees were not warranted under the ada because the plaintiffs claims for injunctive relief were not frivolous,but awarded defendants attorney fees under section of the cdpa,which is mandatory and guarantees attorney fees to a prevailing party.hubbard ii,supra,at.plaintiffs appealed.
although the issue of preemption was not raised or ruled on in the district court,the ninth circuit reversed and vacated the award of attorney fees to the prevailing defendants under section,because the court believed the attorney fee award was inconsistent with,and thus preempted by,the ada.hubbard ii,supra,at.the hubbard court noted that,while both plaintiffs and defendants may be declared prevailing parties under the ada,attorney fees may not be awarded to a prevailing defendant under the ada unless the defendant establishes that the plaintiff suit was frivolous.see summers teichert son,cir,summers adopting title vii standard in christiansburg garment eeoc,christiansburg,for defendants to recover attorney fees under the ada.
the hubbard court went on to point out that a violation of the ada constitutes a violation of the cdpa.see,subd.c,subd.d,subd.b.hubbard ii,supra,at.consequently,the proof required to establish a violation of the cdpa and the ada is identical,and it is impossible to distinguish the fees necessary to defend against the cdpa claim from those expended in defense of the ada claim id.at.accordingly,a grant of fees on the california cause of action is necessarily a grant of fees as to the ada claim.ibid.because the ada bars fees to defendants for nonfrivolous actions,the hubbard court concluded preemption principles preclude the imposition of fees on a plaintiff for bringing claims under state law that parallel claims also filed pursuant to the federal law.citation.ibid.
a few days after the hubbard i opinion was issued,the court in molski,supra,th,addressed the question of whether section authorizes a fee award in favor of a prevailing defendant,regardless of whether the plaintiff claims could be characterized as frivolous.in molski,the plaintiff filed an action alleging that he encountered barriers to wheelchair access while visiting the defendant winery.after his federal action was dismissed,molski filed a lawsuit in state court asserting claims for relief under the unruh act,the cdpa,health and safety code section,and for injunctive relief under section.molski,supra,at.the trial court ultimately granted defendant motion for judgment on the pleadings.id.at.the defendant then moved to recover attorney fees as the prevailing party under section for fees incurred in both the federal and state court proceedings.molski,supra,at.the trial court awarded defendant its attorney fees for the state court action only.ibid.plaintiff appealed.
on appeal,the appellate court first found section mandatory language to be unambiguous authorizing bilateral fee recovery for both prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants.molski,supra,th at.next,the court determined that the defendant winery was the prevailing party because molski had obtained none of the relief he sought.id.at.
the court then considered molski assertion that,notwithstanding the plain language of section and the outcome of this litigation,attorney fees should not be assessed against a plaintiff unless the defendant demonstrates that the claims were frivolous.molski,supra,th at.the molski court rejected plaintiff assertion that the christiansburg standard at should be applied to section as well.the molski court noted that christiansburg involved a case brought under title vii,not to access litigation in california state court,where a plaintiff controls the relative risks,burdens and benefits by selecting from among several statutory options.molski,supra,at.specifically,the molski court noted that,unlike a title vii plaintiff,a plaintiff prosecuting an access claim in california has several alternatives under california law and can seek relief under the unruh civil rights act,the cdpa,or he or she can file an action under section for injunctive relief.molski,supra,at.
the molski court noted that a plaintiff could seek monetary relief under section of the cdpa or section of the unruh act without being exposed to the risk of an adverse judgment for attorney fees.because fees are only authorized for prevailing plaintiffs,the same is not true when a plaintiff seeks relief under section to enjoin a technical violation of california access laws.molski,supra,th at.by including a claim for injunctive relief under section,molski knew that he could be exposed to an adverse fee award,and therefore ha d something to lose if he did not carefully assess the merits of his claim.ibid.the court concluded that entitling a prevailing defendant to fees on the same basis as a prevailing plaintiff under section,without a finding that the plaintiff claims were frivolous,does not violate t he spirit of california statutory scheme.ibid.a plaintiff should be held accountable for the consequences of this scorched earth strategy of electing to pursue every available statutory option available to enforce his right of access under california law,thereby maximiz ing the litigation expenses of his adversary.ibid.
in response to the molski opinion,the ninth circuit granted a petition for rehearing in hubbard i,supra,and issued an amended opinion.hubbard ii,supra.although the ninth circuit reaffirmed its ultimate conclusion that the defendants mandatory award of attorney fees under section was preempted by the ada,the court acknowledged that molski upheld an award of attorney fees to a prevailing defendant on a section claim found not to be frivolous.hubbard ii,supra,at.the hubbard court went on to note that under section f ees are not discretionary they are mandatory given this language,we have no basis for doubting that the california supreme court will agree with molski as to the meaning of section.citation.hubbard ii,supra,at.
the molski court had no reason to address the preemption issue jankey raises because the plaintiff in molski had voluntarily dismissed his federal claims under the ada,and the operative complaint contained only state law claims when attorney fees were awarded.molski,supra,th at.thus,it is unsurprising that the court opinion in molski does not contain a word about parallel state and federal claims for injunctive relief,nor does it address whether federal preemption principles preclude giving effect to the provision in section,which automatically grants attorney fees to prevailing defendants.
procedurally,the case before us is analogous to hubbard,where the plaintiff made parallel claims for injunctive relief under the ada and section of the cdpa,and the defendant prevailed on the ada claim for the same reasons he prevails on the cdpa claim because the instant case is procedurally identical to hubbard,and molski,supra,th did not directly address this issue,we must decide whether hubbard preemption analysis has merit.wagner apex marine ship management th,decisions of the lower federal courts,while persuasive,are not binding on us.
we start with preemption principles.whether federal law preempts state law is fundamentally a question whether congress has intended such a result.citations.the starting presumption is that congress has not so intended.citations.preemption of state law by federal law is found in three circumstances.citations.first,there is express preemption congress can define explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law.citations.second,there is field preemption s tate law is where it regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively.citations.third,there is conflict preemption s tate law is to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.citations.such conflict must be of substance and not merely trivial or insubstantial.citation.it exists when it is impossible to comply with both state and federal requirements citations or when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives underlying federal law citations.peatros bank of america cal th,capital cities cable,crisp.in determining whether a state statute is preempted by federal law,courts may find preemption only when congressional intent is clear and manifest.spielholz superior court th,medtronic,lohr.
in considering the different categories of federal preemption,it appears the hubbard court employed a conflict preemption analysis.according to hubbard,a violation of the ada is a violation of the cdpa,subd.c,subd.d,subd.b,and it is impossible to distinguish the fees necessary to defend against the cdpa claim from those expended in defense against the ada claim hubbard ii,supra,at.because the ada bars attorney fees to defendants for nonfrivolous actions,the hubbard court believed that the mandatory fee award to a prevailing defendant under section of the cdpa was inconsistent with and thus preempted by the ada.
in our view,hubbard improperly used conflict preemption principles to decide the issue before it,and in applying those principles,erroneously concluded that the ada and section were in conflict.certainly,there is nothing in the ada which would support hubbard conclusion that in enacting the ada,congress intended to impose uniform standards for complementary state law remedies.in fact,the ada express preemption clause,which is not even mentioned in hubbard,leads to the opposite conclusion.
the ada has explicitly defined the extent to which its enactment preempts other laws.the text of that provision provides that n othing in the ada shall be construed to invalidate or limit the remedies,rights,and procedures of any federal law or law of any state that provides greater or equal protection for the rights of individuals with disabilities than are afforded by the ada.b.accordingly,rather than express an intent to displace state law in the field of disability discrimination,congress envisioned that a plaintiff will be permitted to pursue state law remedies simultaneously with the remedies provided under the ada,which may potentially provide the plaintiff with equal or greater relief than he or she may be entitled to under the ada alone.see dichner liberty travel cir,the ada anticipates that disabled persons will enjoy the full protection of both federal and state antidiscrimination schemes wood county of alameda,wood plaintiffs are free to bring suit under both state statutes and the ada,to the extent that those state laws are consistent with the accomplishment of the federal purposes stated in the federal law.original italics.
it has been recognized that the express purpose of the ada preemption provision is to maximize the options available to plaintiffs by ensuring that the ada provides a floor for a plaintiff rights and remedies while freeing the states to construct a statutory ceiling.wood,supra.at.in california,the legislature has proclaimed its intent that california provide more protection to individuals than the ada the law of this state in the area of disabilities provides protections independent from those in the federal ada although the federal act provides a floor of protection,this state law has always,even prior to passage of the federal act,afforded additional protections,subd.a.
indeed,a perusal of the array of remedies available under california law leads quickly to the inescapable conclusion that the protections of state law go far beyond the ada.as noted,the ada provides only injunctive relief,not money damages.a.in contrast,both the unruh act and the cdpa allow a plaintiff who is denied equal access or accommodation to sue for money damages.the importance of this expansion of remedies was explained by the court in pickern best western timber cove lodge marina d after the ada was passed in,the california disabled persons act and the unruh civil rights act were amended to provide that a violation of the ada constitutes a violation of their provisions.citations.thus,a plaintiff whose rights are violated under the ada may now seek damages under the california statutes id.at.more recently,our supreme court settled a disagreement among the appellate courts and held that a plaintiff who seeks damages under section,claiming the denial of full and equal treatment on the basis of disability in violation of the unruh act and the ada,need not prove intentional discrimination.munson del taco,cal th.
furthermore,when money damages are sought under both the cdpa and the unruh act,the attorney fee provisions offer a unique departure from the ada bilateral attorney fee provision.under the cdpa and the unruh act,the prevailing plaintiff is entitled to seek recovery of attorney fees,but a prevailing defendant is not similarly entitled to fees.see,subd.a molski,supra,th at.
as noted,unlike the ada,which makes attorney fee recovery discretionary,attorney fees are mandatory under section.consequently,if the plaintiff proves a single violation of a broad range of statutory requirements,of which a violation of the ada is merely a subset,the plaintiff is guaranteed an attorney fee award.far from weakening the rights of plaintiffs,the legislative history reveals that the california legislature designed section guaranteed attorney fee provision to promote,and encourage plaintiffs to seek enforcement of california disability access statutes 
the fact that the legislature decided to impose a guaranteed fee provision does not put section in irreconcilable conflict with the ada or abrogate the scope of the rights available under the ada in any fashion.section,like other provisions of the cdpa and the unruh act,provides greater incentives and rights to a person pursuing a disability access claim in california.the risk that a plaintiff will be liable to a defendant for attorney fees if a section injunction claim fails is more than offset by the greater rights afforded a plaintiff,including money damages and a guaranteed attorney fee recovery in all instances where the plaintiff prevails.
the hubbard court also went astray when it failed to look at the cdpa as a whole in measuring it against the ada protection,and instead improperly parsed the law.we have found no legal authority requiring each and every element of a state remedial act to offer equal or greater benefits under all circumstances over a similar federal law in order to avoid a preemption finding.rather than dissecting the fee provision as did hubbard,when section role and purpose within the cdpa is considered,it represents precisely the kind of state law authorized by section b a law where the potential available remedies would be greater than those available under the ada appen.to,subds.b c.
lastly,hubbard failed to acknowledge the point so persuasively made by molski that,in california,a plaintiff controls the relative risks,burdens and benefits by selecting among several statutory options,and that by invoking section,jankey knew he ha d something to lose if he did not carefully assess the merits of his claim.molski,supra,th at.in this case,jankey chose to pursue claims for injunctive relief under both the ada and section.if his lawsuit had been successful,he certainly would have claimed a mandatory right to attorney fees under section.nullifying section to the extent that it guarantees prevailing defendants attorney fees now that jankey has lost would give him all the benefits of a litigation strategy while incurring none of the risks.molski,supra,at.moreover,if we accepted jankey argument,it would result in giving plaintiffs in disability discrimination litigation an unfair strategic advantage over defendants,who will be subject to section mandatory attorney fee provision if they lose and the ada discretionary attorney fee provision if they win.this result would potentially inject even greater tactical gamesmanship into an area of the law where gamesmanship is already an acute concern.see generally molski mandarin touch restaurant d.
we therefore reject jankey claim,based on hubbard ii,supra,that t he discretionary attorneys fee provision of the ada and the mandatory nature of fees under section raise an irreconcilable conflict and that preemption principles preclude the imposition of fees on jankey unless the trial court was to find that his action was frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.we conclude no such finding was required under section,nor is the statute preempted by the ada.accordingly,the trial court properly awarded lee,as the prevailing party,his attorney fees in this case.
amount of attorney fees award 
jankey next challenges the trial court decision to grant lee his attorney fees in the amount of pursuant to section.jankey first contends that the attorney fee awarded to lee was unreasonable because lee fee request was improperly documented when presented to the trial court.he argues lee failed to provide billing records or any other independent evidence of the specific tasks performed or time billed in the defense of this case,which allegedly has made it virtually impossible to assess the reasonableness of the fees requested.
however,it is well established that detailed billing records are not required to affirm an attorney fee award.in california,an attorney need not submit contemporaneous time records in order to recover attorney fees testimony of an attorney as to the number of hours worked on a particular case is sufficient evidence to support an award of attorney fees,even in the absence of detailed time records.citations.martino denevi d,see also steiny california electric supply th.this was done in this case,and the proof was adequate to justify the award.

the amount to be awarded as reasonable attorney fees is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.city of oakland oakland raiders d.the trial court makes its determination after consideration of a number of factors,including the nature of the litigation,its difficulty,the amount involved,the skill required in its handling,the skill employed,the attention given,the success or failure,and other circumstances in the case.citation.plcm group,drexler cal th.the trial judge is in the best position to evaluate the services rendered,and the court decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is clearly wrong.city of oakland oakland raiders,supra,at.
in reviewing an award of attorney fees,the amount awarded by the trial court will not be set aside absent an affirmative showing of abuse of discretion in that the award is manifestly excessive in the circumstances.horning shilberg th,quoting children hospital medical center bontá th.we have reviewed the record,and we can find no special circumstances rendering the trial court award of attorney fees unjust.the record supports the conclusion that the attorney fee award was the product of the number of hours reasonably spent to develop a detailed and effective litigation strategy that ultimately resulted in a dismissal of all of jankey claims through a successful summary judgment motion.
jankey finally contends that lee fee award should be reduced because c ounsel billing is disproportionately.jankey points out that o f all the time billed by respondent counsel,or out of hours was billed at the highest rate that of a senior attorney.the distribution of work amongst the lead attorney billed at an hour,the attorney billed at an hour and the paralegal an hour as described in counsel declaration was not unreasonable given the complexity of the issues in this case,and we find no abuse of discretion.
