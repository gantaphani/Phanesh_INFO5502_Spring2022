kenneth cole productions,kcp owner of small,upscale retail clothing stores,appeals from a judgment and a subsequent order regarding attorney fees in its appeal de novo of a decision of the california labor commissioner labor commissioner.
on appeal,kcp raises issues regarding classification of plaintiff john paul murphy as a nonexempt employee,the court jurisdiction to hear claims not raised before the labor commissioner,and the nature of the payments for meal and rest break violations as a penalty or a wage.kcp other contention concerns whether kcp had a good faith dispute that precluded imposition of the waiting time penalty.
we will affirm the finding that murphy was not an exempt employee.we agree with kcp that the court should not have addressed the new claims and that the meal and rest break payments are penalties,and reverse that portion of the judgment and remand for reconsideration of the amount of attorney fees.in all other respects,we affirm.
background 
we first examine murphy daily work duties as a store manager.murphy was hired as store manager of the kcp retail clothing store in the san francisco centre on fifth and market streets in june of and worked for kcp until june.murphy was paid a weekly salary of and was not entitled to commissions on sales in april of,his pay was increased to a week.
when murphy was hired,he was given a job description for the store manager position.the store managers were the sales leaders,who were responsible for making sure the store met its sales quotas.they accomplished this task by acting as a leader on the sales floor,making sure inventory was properly managed and handling minor human resources issues according to procedures set out in the corporate operations manual.murphy was trained by the manager of the union street store,who spent two days with murphy,telling him who the strong sellers among the employees were,explaining security concerns and referring him to the operations manual.
the san francisco centre store primarily sold shoes.murphy had no input into decisions about the shoes sold in the store,their pricing or whether they would be placed on sale.the corporate office and a visual manager directed all advertising.sales goals were set by the corporate office.murphy could make recommendations for the district manager approval as to the needs of the store,but the district manager made the final decision.
district managers were responsible for ensuring that the stores met their sales quotas,had proper management and staffs,approved human resources related issues for the stores,such as issuing warnings and approving applicants for jobs.the district manager in murphy area was in charge of seven stores.the position of general manager of a flagship store was similar to murphy position,but was a department manager position,which included supervising other managers in their store who were similar to store managers.their stores were considered separate districts,so they did not report to the regional manager.
murphy did not have the authority to hire or fire an employee without obtaining approval.there were times that his recommendations on hiring were ignored.if discipline issues were clearly covered by the policy manual,murphy could issue a verbal or written warning,but it needed approval from the district manager.if the issue was not clear,murphy was required to refer it to human resources or the district manager.
murphy testified that the operations manual was a guideline for running the store.in addition to general policy issues,it regulated such issues as how shoes were placed on racks,how to put tissue in a shoe,how to present the shoe to the customer,how many shoes to bring out at a time and how to handle merchandise.all employees had access to the operations manual.murphy was told during his training to follow the procedures in the operations manual.the scheduling policy in the operations manual stated that store managers worked shifts,hours per week.the district managers approved all vacations,floating holidays,personal holidays and consecutive days off.
murphy store was staffed with seven employees,including three sales people,one sales person,an assistant manager and two floor supervisors.the store was open from to monday through saturday and to on sundays.murphy often worked more than nine hours a day.usually the extra hours were spent on the sales floor.
on a typical day,murphy and another employee arrived around or together,they opened the safe,took the receipts to the bank,returned and opened the register,counted the money,checked faxes and and opened the store.company policy required both people to be on the sales floor at all times,due to security problems related to the store location in a high theft area.murphy was not allowed to schedule more than two employees for a morning shift.in those morning hours,murphy did the same tasks as the other employee.
during a typical morning,between and,murphy and the other employee made sales,retrieved shoes from the stockroom,worked on processing the morning shipment,worked on markdowns or transfers,and if nothing else was happening,they cleaned.in that morning period,murphy did nothing other than making sales,receiving or transferring product,processing markdowns and cleaning.on weekends,they usually did not receive merchandise and the district manager instructed murphy to spend his time on the sales floor.
processing the shipment of products involved scanning the boxes,opening them,matching the contents to the packing slip,pricing the boxes,pulling a sample shoe,labeling it,and preparing the merchandise for the stockroom.processing transfers involved receiving a faxed list from the corporate office of products to be transferred to other stores.murphy pulled the product from the stockroom,brought it to the sales floor,checked to make sure the shoes matched,scanned the box and wrote in the shipping information.similarly,the processing of markdowns involved checking the list from the corporate office and changing the prices on the bottom of each shoe.cleaning involved dusting the displays and polishing the shoes.at all times,he was doing the same tasks as the other employee and no managerial tasks.they worked on the tasks together during this to time period.
during a typical weekday afternoon,the second shift of either one or two people arrived at.the morning employee would go to lunch,and murphy and another employee would begin carrying the merchandise into the stockroom while covering the sales floor.directives from the corporate office determined the precise details of how the stockroom was organized and where each item was to be stored.murphy did not work on commission and was efficient in the stockroom,so he often was the employee working in the stockroom while the commissioned employees worked on the sales floor.at some point,murphy would go to the office to eat while he checked company and voice mails.by he was either on the sales floor or back in the stockroom working.
at,murphy was scheduled to leave,but he often would have customers on the sales floor,or would do some human resources paperwork.murphy duties when he worked the closing shift from noon until,were essentially the same as when he worked the opening shift.typically,he was on the sales floor or in the stockroom from to.at he would try to eat lunch while he checked kcp company voice mail and in the office,and then worked on the sales floor until closing time.after the store was closed,murphy and a sales associate would verify the bank deposit,clean up the store,put shoes away,vacuum and empty the garbage.typically,they would finish cleaning around or 
murphy performed tasks that he considered to be management duties,including preparing quarterly employee reviews,interviewing job prospects,preparing payroll worksheets,and preparing the sales report to submit to the district manager.he occasionally called the district manager to try to get different merchandise for the store.completing the payroll and sales reports took about minutes each week.
murphy spent about an hour a week on communications with the district manager.although he was not always the one to prepare the weekly work schedule,when murphy did it,he spent another minutes each week on that task.after receiving a payroll dollar goal and number of hours report from the corporate office,murphy prepared a schedule to cover the store hours and submitted it for approval to the district manager.the district manager would then instruct murphy to cut hours,use different employees,or to make other changes.
his human resources duties,which consumed about four hours a month,included writing quarterly and annual employee performance evaluations for the assistant manager and the floor supervisor.the assistant manager and floor supervisor did the evaluations of the other employees.
murphy added up the time he spent doing tasks that the other employees also performed and his managerial tasks,and calculated that approximately percent of his time was spent doing the same tasks as the sales associates and only or percent was spent on management tasks.no one ever criticized him for spending too much time on nonexempt activities such as assisting customers,making sales,processing merchandise,handling markdowns and cleaning.he squeezed the performance of his management tasks into the afternoons on days when they had less stock or shipments.
murphy resigned on june.a friend told him that kcp had not been paying him correctly.
on october,murphy filed a complaint with the labor commissioner.murphy was not represented by counsel and he testified that no one informed him that he could raise claims for meal and rest period or pay stub violations.his claim did include a demand for unpaid overtime of,i nterest pursuant to labor code section and additional wages accrued pursuant to labor code as a penalty of per day.
on july,after a hearing,the labor commissioner issued a decision finding that kcp failed to establish the conditions necessary to qualify murphy as an exempt employee.the order awarded in unpaid overtime,in interest and a waiting time penalty at the rate of a day for days.
on august,kcp filed a notice of appeal de novo from the decision of the labor commissioner.on october,the hastings college of the law civil justice clinic filed and served a notice of association of counsel on behalf of murphy.on november,murphy new counsel filed a notice of claims and issues at issue at de novo trial of wage claim,adding claims for meal period,rest period and pay stub violations,plus interest and attorney fees.
in may of,the trial court filed its statement of decision and a judgment awarding murphy unpaid overtime of,payments for missed meal and rest periods in the amount of,penalties for failing to furnish itemized pay statements of,section waiting time penalties of and prejudgment interest,for a total judgment of.the court subsequently granted murphy motion for attorney fees and costs in the amount of.
kcp appealed from the judgment of the superior court and the fee order 
discussion 
on appeal,kcp argues that the trial court erroneously classified murphy as a nonexempt employee.it also contends that the trial court improperly addressed new claims regarding meal break,rest break and pay stub itemization violations that had not been raised before the labor commissioner.in connection with these violations,kcp contends that the payments ordered for meal and rest break violations were penalties that are barred by the statute of limitations of code of civil procedure section.kcp argues that it had a good faith defense to payment of overtime and should not have been assessed waiting time penalties.it also argues that the attorney fee award should be reduced in the event of a partial reversal.
we have reviewed all of kcp contentions and find they have no merit except for the contentions that the payments assessed for meal break,rest break and pay stub violations are penalties and that those violations may not be raised for the first time on appeal,as we now explain.
overtime compensation and exempt employees 
the labor commissioner and the superior court determined that murphy was not an exempt executive employee.kcp does not dispute murphy characterization of the time he spent doing sales and other nonexempt tasks.its argument,based primarily on federal law,is that while murphy was selling shoes and dusting merchandise,he was simultaneously performing such managerial tasks as observing employees,evaluating performance,and was always responsible for everything that happened in the store.kcp quotes murphy statement during at no point did i ever take my manager cap off,to support its claim that murphy came within the executive exemption to the overtime requirement.
governing exemption 
section,subdivision a provides in part eight hours of labor constitutes a day work.any work in excess of eight hours in one workday and any work in excess of hours in any one workweek and the first eight hours worked on the seventh day of work in any one workweek shall be compensated at the rate of no less than one and times the regular rate of pay for an employee.murphy worked in the retail industry,which,at the time of his employment was governed by industrial welfare commission iwc wage orders and,tit.
the wage orders set out the executive exemption from the requirement to pay overtime as follows the following requirements shall apply in determining whether an employee duties meet the test to qualify for an exemption executive exemption.a person employed in an executive capacity means any employee a whose duties and responsibilities involve the management of the enterprise in which is employed or of a customarily recognized department or subdivision thereof and b who customarily and regularly directs the work of two or more other employees therein and c who has the authority to hire or fire other employees or whose suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring or firing and as to the advancement and promotion or any other change of status of other employees will be given particular weight and d who customarily and regularly exercises discretion and independent judgment and e who is primarily engaged in duties which meet the test of the exemption,tit,subd.a a e.
statutory provisions regulating wages that are enacted to protect employees are liberally construed with an eye to promoting such protection.ramirez yosemite water cal th,d,ramirez.exemptions are narrowly construed,and as affirmative defenses,must be proved by the employer.id.at,d.the elements of the exemption are stated in the conjunctive and all criteria must be established for the exemption to apply.bell farmers ins.exchange th,d elements of exemption impose independent requirements.
the trial court in this case determined that kcp failed to establish three of the five elements of the exemption.after reviewing and discussing the evidence,that court concluded that murphy spent far less than half of his time engaged in managerial duties,did not customarily and regularly exercise discretion and independent judgment,and did not have the requisite level of authority or input regarding hiring and firing decisions.
review of the determination that murphy was not an exempt employee is a mixed question of law and fact.ramirez,supra,cal th at,d.whether an employee satisfies the elements of the exemption is a question of fact subject to substantial evidence review.nordquist broadcasting th,d nordquist.the appropriate manner of evaluating the employee duties is a question of law that we review independently.ramirez,supra,at,d.we examine the elements of the exemption in the order that they appear in the wage order.
authority to hire or fire 
subdivision c of the relevant wage order requires kcp to prove that murphy has the authority to hire or fire other employees,or that his suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring or firing and as to the advancement and promotion or any other change of status of other employees will be given particular weight.kcp argues that it established this element through evidence that murphy was part of the hiring process,made recommendations and filtered job applicants.this issue presents a purely factual matter that is reviewed under the substantial evidence test.
murphy testified that he was involved in the hiring process to the extent that he acted as a filter for job applicants.he had no authority to hire anyone without obtaining the district manager approval.murphy had no say in rate of pay decisions.he testified regarding occasions when he wanted to hire or retain specific individuals,but his recommendations were not followed.he had no authority to fire anyone,but could only call attention to problems.he was unable to impose discipline on store employees without the approval of the district manager.on at least one occasion,an employee was transferred to murphy store over his objection.the only personnel action that murphy could perform without first obtaining approval was a change of address.he needed approval for hiring,firing,transferring personnel and changing pay rates.
kcp refers to portions of the record that it contends would support a finding contrary to that of the trial court.but when reviewing a finding under a substantial evidence standard,we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving that party the benefit of every reasonable inference and resolving conflicts in support of the judgment.nordquist,supra,th at,d.murphy testimony supports the determination that murphy did not have the requisite level of input to hiring and firing decisions.this finding alone is sufficient to uphold the determination that murphy was not exempt.because kcp bases its contention that it had a good faith belief that murphy was exempt on all contested subdivisions of the exemption,we will also discuss those subdivisions.
exercises discretion and independent judgment 
subdivision d of the wage order requires kcp to prove that murphy customarily and regularly exercises discretion and independent judgment.kcp argues that murphy had the authority to do such tasks as direct and train sales associates,decide who would take out the trash and who would open boxes of merchandise.it claims that he oversaw all aspects of the store and was responsible for everything that happened in the store.
in nordquist,supra,th at pages,d,the court discussed the terms discretion and independent judgment in connection with the administrative exemption as described in the version of the department of industrial relations,division of labor standards enforcement dlse,operations and procedures manual discretion and independent judgment involves the comparison and evaluation of possible courses of conduct,and acting or making a decision after considering various possibilities.it implies that the employee has the power to make an independent choice free from immediate supervision and with respect to matters of significance.the decision may be in the form of a recommendation for action subject to the final authority of a superior,but the employee must have sufficient authority for the recommendations to affect matters of consequence to the business or its customers.
the june version of the dlse manual refers to the code of federal regulations for the definition of the terms discretion and independent judgment in each of the exempt classifications.dlse manual,june,as of.the text of the federal regulation as printed in the dlse manual states a in general,the exercise of discretion and independent judgment involves the comparison and the evaluation of possible courses of conduct and acting or making a decision after the various possibilities have been considered.the term as used in the regulations in subpart a of this part,more over,implies that the person has the authority or power to make an independent choice,free from immediate direction or supervision and with respect to matters of significance id.at addendum ii,citing,now a.
substantial evidence supports the trial court determination that murphy had virtually no discretion to compare courses of conduct and decide on an action.his conduct,including sales goals,weekly budgets,pricing merchandise,and the smallest details of how to display shoes,was governed by the corporate office and district manager.all decisions of significance had to be approved by the district manager.a most significant point in a substantial evidence review is that the trial court here assessed all of the evidence,and expressly rejected kcp evidence,finding murphy testimony to be more credible.this testimony is substantial evidence that supports the trial court determination that murphy was not an exempt employee.
primarily engaged in exempt duties 
subdivision e of the wage order requires kcp to prove that murphy was primarily engaged in duties which meet the test of the exemption.kcp argues that the trial court made a legal error by counting the time murphy engaged in nonexempt activities rather than totaling the hours spent performing exempt activities.kcp ignores the fact that the trial court also found,based on murphy testimony,that only percent of his time was spent on exempt management activities.the core of kcp argument is its theory that murphy simultaneously was performing both exempt and nonexempt duties.
kcp argument is based principally on federal cases involving the primary duty concept and the formerly utilized short test for certain employees.under the federal test,whether an employee is a bona fide executive employee may be determined in one of two ways under federal regulations promulgated by the secretary of labor.donovan burger king cir,donovan ii.employees earning less than per week are subject to the long test,with multiple requirements,while those earning or more are governed by the short test.id.at.
at the time that donovan ii was decided,the federal long test criteria were that the primary duty of exempt employees must be management,they must regularly direct the work of two or more other employees,they must have authority to hire and fire or have their personnel recommendations accorded particular weight they must regularly exercise discretionary powers and they must not devote more than of their workweek to activities not directly and closely related to management donovan ii,supra,at.
criteria for the more mechanical short test provided that the employee primary duty is management and that he or she regularly directs the work of two or more other employees.donovan ii,supra,at.the donovan ii court noted that time spent on management tasks is not determinative under the federal short test and an employee who spends less than half of his or her time on managerial tasks may still be exempt if other pertinent factors so indicate id.at.
california does not utilize the federal short test and has not adopted the primary duty concept.under california law,the exemption does not focus on defining the worker principal function,but requires that an employee be primarily engaged in the duties that meet the test of the exemption,subd.a.by statute,primarily means more than of the employee worktime is spent engaging in exempt duties,subd.e ramirez,supra,cal th at,d.
a california court performs a purely quantitative test to assess the work actually performed by the employee,in which the court itemizes the types of activities that it considers to be exempt,and the approximate average times that it finds the employee spent on each of these activities.ramirez,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
in this case,kcp relied solely on its abstract classification of murphy as a manager,who wore his manager cap the entire time rather than assessing the time murphy actually spent performing exempt tasks.murphy wore many caps.kcp argues that the trial court applied the wrong legal standard,contending that the issue is not how much time an employee spends in duties.the issue is how much time the employee spends in exempt duties.
contrary to kcp contention,the trial court expressly recognized that murphy performed some managerial tasks,such as handling personnel issues,working through the weekly scheduling,payroll and business recap processes and paperwork,and communicating with the district and regional managers and the corporate office on behalf of the store,all of which together took about percent of his time.the court did calculate how much time murphy spent in exempt duties.the court also concluded that murphy spent percent of his time engaged in such nonexempt tasks as sales,processing shipments of products,stocking products,and cleaning the store.these findings are supported by substantial evidence in the form of murphy uncontroverted testimony.kcp failed to prove the elements required by california law regarding the relevant exemption.
in addition to evaluating murphy view of the job,we note that from the employer standpoint kcp did not seem to treat murphy like a manager by allocating resources to carry out managerial tasks and thereby relieve him of day to day nonexempt employee tasks.it did not give him the time or the assistance that he needed to accomplish primarily management tasks.rather,kcp expectations of murphy encouraged him to spend the vast majority of his time at work doing the same work as those he was supposedly managing.murphy was a nominal coxswain who performed most of the time as an oarsman alongside the rest of the crew 
for these reasons,and because of the lack of relevant evidence produced by kcp,we agree with the trial court that kcp failed to meet its burden under california law of proving murphy was exempt.
raising new claims in de novo appeal 
murphy concedes that he did not raise the claims of rest break,meal break and itemized pay stub violations in his claim filed on october,with the labor commissioner these claims were not mentioned until november of,when murphy filed a notice of claims and issues at issue at de novo trial of wage claim in the appeal de novo proceeding.the trial court allowed the claims,stating that hearing the new claims served the interests of judicial economy,preserving the rights of the parties and discouraging appeals by subjecting appealing employers to additional liability.
the trial court found that murphy had no assistance filing his claim and that he did not know he could make a claim for meal and rest period and itemized wage statement violations.but murphy knew about kcp failure to provide meal and rest breaks and testified that he had complained to his district manager that it was impossible to comply with rest and meal break requirements if nothing else,his testimony shows that murphy was aware of the requirement,aware of the problem,and elected not to mention it when he filed his claim.
kcp objected below and renewed its objection on appeal.it argues that the court had no jurisdiction to hear the claims added by murphy after he received counsel for the appeal de novo,subd.e.murphy contends that because an appeal de novo requires an entirely new trial with new evidence,he can raise any new claim we now examine this unique review process.
an employee seeking payment of wages due has two options file an ordinary civil action against the employer exhaustion is not required or file a wage claim with the labor commissioner pursuant to sections and obtain a berman hearing.smith law group cal th,d,smith.murphy elected to file a wage claim for unpaid overtime,waiting time penalties and interest with the labor commissioner.
the proceeding before the labor commissioner is initiated by the employee filing a complaint pursuant to section,subdivision a.within days,if the labor commissioner determines that a hearing will be held,the labor commissioner so notifies the employer.when the hearing is set,a copy of the complaint stating the amount of compensation at issue and notice of the time and place of the hearing is served on the employer,subd.b.ten days after the notice of an award is served,the parties may seek review of that award,subd.a.the award is based on the original complaint that gave notice to the employer of the matters at issue and upon which a subsequent appeal is based.
if no party takes an appeal,the commissioner decision will be deemed a judgment,final immediately and enforceable as a judgment in a civil action.smith,supra,cal th at,d.following a decision of the labor commissioner,either party may seek review by filing an appeal to the superior court,where the appeal shall be heard de novo.the notice requesting appeal filed in the superior court is not a pleading and provides no new information rogers municipal court d.the notice of appeal imparts no information to the opposing side which will affect the trial of the issues.murphy argues that the peculiar nature of the superior court review of decisions of the labor commissioner evidences the intent to allow employees to raise all claims,regardless of whether such claims were previously presented to the labor commissioner.
we recognize that such an appeal to the superior court results in a completely new trial,but we see no authority for allowing the introduction of entirely new and different claims at that level.the timely filing of the notice of appeal forestalls the finality of the labor commissioner decision terminates the jurisdiction of the labor commissioner and vests jurisdiction to conduct a trial de novo in the appropriate court.pressler donald bren cal d,pressler.although denoted an appeal,unlike a conventional appeal in a civil action,hearing under the labor code is de novo.citation.a hearing de novo literally means a new hearing,that is,a new trial.citation.the decision of the commissioner is entitled to no weight whatsoever,and the proceedings are truly a trial anew in the fullest sense.italics in original.sampson parking service,th,d sampson.
review is of the facts presented to the trial court,which may include entirely new evidence.sampson,supra,th at,d.the proceeding in the superior court allows both parties to present their evidence directly to the court,which sees the witness,hears their testimony and accepts any documentary or physical evidence.neither party is limited to the evidence presented at the administrative hearing and may introduce any relevant evidence.sales dimensions superior court d.sales dimensions.despite the de novo nature of the review,the court in sales dimensions recognized that an interpretation of section must be arrived at which,if possible,gives effect to both the term review and the term de novo.sales dimensions,supra,d at.murphy assertion that any new wage claim can be raised on appeal disregards the term review in the statute.the appeal taken is expressly from the order,decision,or award,and not from whatever new matter the parties may thereafter seek to raise,subd.a.
in,our supreme court discussed a similar provision for review of the labor commissioner decision in an action between an artist and an agent.the relevant statute provided for an appeal,which was to be heard de novo in the superior court.collier wallis,astor cal d,collier.in commenting on the nature of such an appeal de novo,the supreme court stated a hearing de novo literally means a new hearing,or a hearing the second time.citation.such a hearing contemplates an entire trial of the controversial matter in the same manner in which the same was originally heard.id.at,italics added see also pressler,supra,cal d at.as thus construed,the section simply gives to the party dissatisfied with the determination of the labor commissioner a hearing of the matter submitted to the labor commissioner before the superior court.collier,supra,at.italics added.these comments indicate the intent to give effect to the review aspect of the de novo proceeding.although there is a new trial with the possibility of new evidence,and the administrative decision is given no weight,the subject matter of the review must be the same as that submitted to the labor commissioner otherwise the proceeding is not a review.
murphy places particular emphasis on quotes from post associates cal th,d,post and smith,supra,cal th at page,d.the court in post stated that an appeal de novo encompasses a disputed question concerning any issue of law or fact post,supra,cal th at,d,concerning review of labor commissioner decision that claimant was not an employee.the quote from smith is statutory constraints on the commissioner authority to award interest on the nonwage items did not similarly bind the trial court,which heard smith claim de novo.smith,supra,cal th at,d.
the issue in smith,was whether the addition of prejudgment interest on appeal of the labor commissioner decision was sufficient to constitute success on appeal.smith,supra,cal th at,d.the employee sought interest from the labor commissioner,who was not authorized to award it on nonwage claims.on appeal,the superior court awarded the requested interest.id.at,d.not only was the request for prejudgment interest in smith raised below,but adding interest to an award is a consequence of continuing the litigation.id.at,fn,d.adding a new claim for alleged wrongs that were never presented below is not a natural consequence of continuing the litigation.
in both of the cited cases,the employees had raised the same general issue before the labor commissioner.post,supra,cal th at,d,issue of employee status decided by labor commissioner smith,supra,cal th at,d,employee sought prejudgment interest from labor commissioner,who was not authorized to award it on nonwage claims.the cases did not concern entirely new issues never previously submitted for decision.
the legislative history regarding the enactment of section indicates that the legislature was concerned with strengthening the administrative law system for resolving wage claims by shortening the hearing and decision process.assem.com.on labor relations,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.formerly,the labor commissioner was required to initiate a court action to obtain an enforceable judgment.legis.analyst,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.assembly bill was proposed to solve the problem of enforcement by making the labor commissioner orders enforceable judgments if no request for appeal was filed.assem.off.of research,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.the provision allowing appeal and a trial de novo was inserted out of concerns regarding the exercise of judicial powers by administrative agencies.legis.counsel,supp.on enrolled bill,assem.bill reg.sess.although the legislative history is not dispositive of the issue,nothing therein indicates an attempt to prolong the processing of a wage claim by allowing assertion of new claims at the time of the appeal.the purpose of sections,and is to provide a structure for a timely,fair process for resolving a claim so that the employer and employee receive a final,expeditious determination of the claim.
review of the foregoing authorities clarifies the nature of the section provision for review of the labor commissioner decision.although new evidence may be presented,new witnesses may testify and the de novo review envisions an entirely new trial,no authority sanctions the superior court consideration of entirely new issues and disputes that were never previously submitted to the labor commissioner or a court section subdivision a plainly states that the parties may seek review by filing an appeal where the appeal is heard de novo.the process is a review of the decision or award rendered by the labor commissioner reviewed by a new trial in superior court and not a de novo trial of new claims never heard below.
we note that the superior court may add interest to an amount due even though it was not considered by the labor commissioner.smith,supra,cal th at,fn,d,court awarded prejudgment interest on nonwage claim that had been denied in the berman hearing nordquist,supra,th at,d.but interest is a result of the continuation of the dispute,not a new and different claim that could have been raised below.smith,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
murphy was not seeking interest on the amounts due.rather,he was seeking new payments for alleged different transgressions by the employer that he failed to raise before the appeal.murphy was not asking the court to review de novo,but to adjudicate new and separate claims never raised below.such a process does not constitute a review as contemplated by section.the party dissatisfied with the labor commissioner decision is given the right to appeal that decision and have it heard fresh in superior court,but can not initiate new causes of action unrelated and not considered by the labor commissioner after the statute of limitations has run.
the matter before us concerns only an attempt to raise itemized pay stub violations,meal break and rest break violations for the first time on de novo appeal.we confine our holding to the claims sought to be raised in this case,which,as will be explained in the following section,are new penalty claims on which the statute of limitations expired prior to filing of the request for de novo appeal.
murphy was not without recourse for meal break and rest break violations after he left his job.if the statute of limitations had not run on murphy new claims,he could have filed a civil complaint and sought consolidation with the appeal.sales dimensions,supra,d at.alternatively,he could have filed another timely complaint with the labor commissioner seeking meal break and rest break monetary sanctions.the parties do not dispute the fact that the payment for the pay stub violation is a penalty the statute of limitations on a penalty is the period in code of civil procedure section.since murphy last day of work was in june of,the time for raising penalty claims expired in june of,before kcp filed its notice of appeal and before murphy ever raised these new issues 
the parties do dispute the nature of the payments for meal and rest break violations.kcp claims that they are also penalties,while murphy claims they are wages.because the correct characterization affects the relevant statute of limitations and the nature of the issue murphy attempted to raise,we now turn to an examination of the nature of the payments for failure to provide meal and rest period breaks.
period payment as a penalty 
murphy was employed by kcp from june of to june of.effective october of,sanctions for meal and rest period violations were set out only in an iwc wage order,tit.section,subdivision b,effective january,provides the same sanction if an employer fails to provide an employee a meal period or rest period in accordance with an applicable order of the industrial welfare commission,the employer shall pay the employee one additional hour of pay at the employee regular rate of compensation for each work day that the meal or rest period is not provided.
the trial court determined that murphy was not provided with the opportunity to take meal or rest breaks due to kcp policies and scheduling and awarded statutory payments for each day that each type of violation occurred beginning in october of.the trial court,relying on the lack of the word penalty in the relevant order and statute,concluded that payments for missed meal and rest periods are compensation,like overtime pay,and are governed by the statute of limitations.code civ.but case law indicates that the absence of the term penalty is not necessarily dispositive and that the intent and effect of the provisions is to impose a penalty.
courts have discussed the general characteristics of a penalty.for example,when considering a statute that reduced a court reporter compensation by when a transcript was late,the court in county of san diego milotz cal d,stated the statute must be held to provide a penalty or forfeiture for noncompliance,notwithstanding its use of the words shall have his compensation reduced.id.at.the term penalty has a very comprehensive meaning.while often used as synonymous with the word punishment,or as including a sum payable upon the breach of a private contract,it has also the more restricted meaning of a sum of money made payable by way of punishment for the nonperformance of an act or for the performance of an unlawful act,and which,in the former case,stands in lieu of the act to be performed.id.at.
t he settled rule in california is that statutes which provide for recovery of damages additional to actual losses incurred,such as double or treble damages,are considered penal in nature citations,and thus governed by the period of limitations prudential home mortgage superior court th,d.claims based upon statutes which provide for mandatory recovery of damages additional to actual losses incurred,such as treble damages,are considered penal in nature,and thus are governed by the limitations period under section,subdivision.menefee ostawari d.the statutory penalty there referred to in code of civil procedure section is one which an individual is allowed to recover against a,as a satisfaction for the wrong or injury suffered,and without reference to the actual damage sustained,or one which is given to the individual and the state as a punishment for some act which is in the nature of a public wrong.county of los angeles ballerino cal.the foregoing cases indicate that a statute like section that imposes a payment without regard to the actual loss suffered,is in the nature of a penalty.
in addition to the case law,the history of the relevant wage order indicates an intent to create a penalty.the iwc adopted the wage order at a hearing on june,where commissioner broad explained that at that time there was no incentive for employers to comply with the meal and rest period requirements.as of,transcript of hearing.a representative of the california labor federation addressing the iwc noted that even though an employee is paid for time worked through meal or rest periods,a remedy was needed to provide a disincentive for employers to deny meal and rest breaks.id.at.two other speakers protested and questioned the iwc authority to establish what they referred to as a new penalty for missing a meal period.id.at.commissioner broad stated that overtime is treated as a penalty and that the iwc would adopt the new penalty under the same authority id.at.in a ruling on the legal issue,counsel stated that the iwc had the authority to adopt a regulation imposing a penalty.id.at.the iwc promptly voted to adopt the regulation.id.at.
regarding the legislature subsequent enactment of section,the legislative history indicates that the legislature also intended a penalty.the statute is located with other provisions for penalties in the labor code the assembly floor analysis of assembly bill,provided that the bill would delete the provisions related to penalties for an employer who fails to provide a meal or rest period,and instead codify the lower penalty amounts adopted by the industrial welfare commission iwc.as of.the analysis in the enrolled bill reports prepared by the department of finance and the department of industrial relations for assembly bill stated that payment of regular wages for the short time of a meal or rest period violation does nothing to discourage noncompliance.the reports discuss the payment in terms of imposing a monetary penalty.depts.of finance and industrial relations,enrolled bill on assem.bill reg.sess.
murphy notes that other provisions are considered wages even though they do not correspond exactly to the number of hours worked.citing,reporting time pay pursuant to,tit,subd,unemployment insurance payments,health and welfare fund payments.but such benefits are a part of the compensation given in exchange for an employee labor.department of industrial relations ui video stores,th,d department of industrial relations.payment imposed on the employer due to impermissible conduct is not an employee benefit given for labor performed,but is a sanction or punishment for failure to provide work accommodations such as adequate meal breaks 
murphy relies,in part,on tomlinson indymac bank,d tomlinson which held that the meal and rest period sanction is not a penalty.the district court judge in tomlinson considered the issue of whether compensation for missed meal and rest breaks constitutes a penalty,and is therefore not available in an action under the unfair competition law.id.at,bus,et the district court concluded that a section waiting time payment constituted a penalty rather than payment of wages because the statute compelled more than mere restoration of the status quo by compensating plaintiffs for time worked.tomlinson,supra,d at.
when considering rest and meal period violations,the district court accepted the argument that imposing a payment in the amount of one hour pay for a break was restitution because it was akin to payment of overtime wages to an employee both are earned wages and thus recoverable under the ucl.tomlinson,supra,d at.the district court apparently believed that payment for missed rest and meal periods constituted paying workers a premium for time worked without a meal break or rest breaks.id.at.
we disagree with the district court judge interpretation.while the labor code allows employers to require overtime work,albeit at a higher rate of compensation,it does not allow employers to deny meal and rest breaks the payments imposed by the wage order and section are not compensation for the missed or minute rest or meal break,but are fixed at one additional hour of pay.that payment is not compensation for labor performed,but is an arbitrary amount imposed on the employer in addition to the salary already paid during the time the employee was not eating or not resting it is not overtime pay for an allowed work period,but a penalty for violating the law that prohibits work during those times.
the parties have brought to our attention the fact that the dlse has recently changed its interpretation of the payment imposed for meal and rest break violations.at the time of the trial court decision,murphy submitted a june,opinion by an attorney for the labor commissioner expressing the view of the dlse that meal and rest break payments constituted a premium wage and not a penalty.at the present time,the dlse has changed its interpretation and announced that the payment for meal and rest break violations is a penalty.it has issued that position in a precedent decision,by memo dated june,in case number.murphy urges us to ignore the dlse changing positions,arguing its inconsistency entitles its opinion to no deference.

assembly concurrent resolution,filed with the secretary of state on july,states that the dlse has no authority to promulgate a proposed regulation regarding meal and rest breaks and that the proposed regulation is inconsistent with existing law and regulations a concurrent resolution is not a law,but only an expression of opinion.american federation of labor eu cal d,fn,singer,sutherland,statutes and statutory construction ed.the legislature has no authority to interpret a statute.that is a judicial task.the legislature may define the meaning of statutory language by a present legislative enactment which,subject to constitutional restraints,it may deem retroactive.but it has no legislative authority simply to say what it did mean.del costello state of california d,fn.italics in original.the iwc and the legislature enacted a regulation and a statute,and postenactment statements of purported intent are of limited legal value to an understanding of the clear meaning and legal effect of statutes.singer,sutherland,statutes and statutory construction ed.
the task of this court is to interpret the statute and iwc regulation,both enacted in.we can not base that interpretation on a postenactment expression of current political or legislative opinion in in the absence of a duly enacted statute.see,california labor federation industrial welfare com.th,d court may not overturn iwc action based on subsequent senate resolution.
nor do we base our decision on any deference to the dlse position,but on our independent agreement with it,based on our analysis of the wording,history and apparent intent of the legislature when enacting section,and the iwc when it promulgated the wage order.we conclude that the payment imposed for impermissibly failing to provide a meal or rest break is a penalty.as a penalty,it had to be raised within one year of the last date that the claim accrued.that limitation period expired before kcp filed its request for appeal and before murphy first raised it in his notice of claims and issues at issue at de novo trial of wage claim.
waiting time penalties willful failure to faith dispute 
kcp argues that the trial court erroneously awarded waiting time penalties because kcp demonstrated there was a good faith dispute as to murphy right to payment of overtime wages.kcp claims that the proper legal standard excuses it from the penalty so long as it presented a defense,which if successful,would have precluded any recovery by murphy.we reject this argument because kcp defense was not supported by the evidence or the law.

the trial court factual determination of what occurred regarding kcp good faith defense that murphy was an exempt manager is reviewed under the deferential substantial evidence standard.t he crucial determination is whether there is substantial evidence in support of the trial court findings of fact.t he power of an appellate court begins and ends with the determination as to whether there is any substantial evidence contradicted or uncontradicted which will support the finding of fact.citation.it will not reweigh the evidence.road sprinkler fitters local union g g fire sprinklers,th,d road sprinkler.a reviewing court begins with the presumption that the record contains evidence to sustain every finding of fact.citation.to overcome the trial court factual findings,the appellant must demonstrate that there is no substantial evidence to support the challenged findings.id.at,d.
as we explain below,the controlling historical facts as established by the trial court were largely undisputed.
the applicable law is set out in section,which provides for waiting time penalties as follows if an employer willfully fails to pay,without abatement or reduction,in accordance with sections,and,any wages of an employee who is discharged or who quits,the wages of the employee shall continue as a penalty from the due date thereof at the same rate until paid or until an action therefor is commenced but the wages shall not continue for more than days.the regulation further defining the waiting time penalty states that a good faith dispute that any wages are due will preclude imposition of waiting time penalties under section,tit.the regulation defines the meaning of a good faith dispute as one that occurs when an employer presents a defense,based in law or fact which,if successful,would preclude any recovery on the part of the employee.the fact that a defense is ultimately unsuccessful will not preclude a finding that a good faith dispute did exist.defenses presented which,under all the circumstances,are unsupported by any evidence,are unreasonable,or are presented in bad faith,will preclude a finding of a good faith dispute,tit,subd.a.
kcp argues that the supreme court decision in in re trombley cal d,trombley provides a rule that prevents assessment of waiting time penalties in this case.the trombley court stated that the term willful means knowingly and intentionally to refuse to pay wages which an employer knows are due and a dispute in good faith as to whether any wages were due would be a defense to an action for such penalties.id.at.trombley states a general proposition and does not change the standard that a defense that is unsupported by any evidence,is unreasonable,or is presented in bad faith is not a good faith dispute 
the record supports the trial court determination that kcp did not have a good faith factual dispute over murphy status.it is undisputed that murphy complained about the lack of overtime pay to the general manager at the flagship grant avenue store and that she told murphy she had spoken to the district manager about the problem and would speak to the human resources department as well.he also complained to an unnamed person in the corporate office payroll department.this evidence supports the finding that kcp knew of murphy claim to overtime pay,but did nothing to discern murphy actual job duties required at his store or respond to his concerns about overtime.
kcp presented no evidence to controvert murphy testimony about the hours spent on nonmanagerial tasks.even when faced with the issue at trial,kcp failed to present evidence that murphy was actually performing exempt duties.kcp witnesses at trial included susan kelly,the regional manager from march of through october of.she testified about problems with murphy job performance pertaining to recruiting and hiring.only three months of her employment with kcp overlapped murphy employment.she not had seen murphy in his store before april of to observe how he spent his time.the last time she saw him in his store was in may of.kelly testified extensively about the kcp job description for store managers.she did not testify that she knew how murphy actually spent his time in light of kcp actual policies.an employer may not rely solely on its job description to establish the number of hours an employee works at exempt tasks.ramirez,supra,cal th at,d.
kcp presented the testimony of gayle catropa,a human resources vice president from the new york office.she visited murphy store several times,but was not necessarily present to observe what duties murphy actually performed.tiffany bellotti,manager of the folsom outlet store,testified about her own job duties.she never worked at murphy store and had no personal knowledge of his daily activities.
as the trial court stated,kcp produced no witnesses controverting murphy testimony about the nature of his daily duties.substantial evidence and kcp lack of same support the trial court finding.kcp did not present any evidence that murphy was performing in a manner other than as he explained.kcp witnesses merely stated the contents of kcp job descriptions or general policies.none of murphy supervisors contradicted his testimony regarding his day to day activities.
kcp main defense was not a factual dispute,but a legal argument based on an inapplicable legal principle that could not have been successful under california law.kcp legal defense,that murphy was simultaneously performing both managerial and nonmanagerial tasks,so that all of his time or at least more than percent of it should be counted as management time,was based on federal short test cases.as the trial court stated,the law in this area is clear.no california authority supports kcp view,and kcp could not have relied on it in good faith 
to the contrary,california unique approach to determining which employees are exempt was explained by our supreme court in ramirez.when an employee engages in both exempt and nonexempt activities,the time must be apportioned among the two types of activities for purposes of determining the total amount of time spent doing exempt and nonexempt work.ramirez,supra,cal th at,d.this explanation contradicts kcp
