after six years of litigation challenging the secretary of labor attempt to bar them from government contracting because of irregular payroll practices,appellants dantran,and its principal,robert holmes,prevailed.this court ruled that,given the circumstances,debarment would be a punishment totally out of proportion to the offense and,therefore,contrary to the regulations.see dantran dep t of labor,cir.having achieved that outcome,appellants came back to court seeking attorney fees under the equal access to justice act eaja,d a,which entitles litigants who prevail against the government to attorney fees unless the position of the united states was substantially justified.the district court concluded that the government position had sufficient merit and rejected the fee request.our review of the record and relevant legal principles persuades us that the court erred in its assessment of the latter phase of the government case.we therefore reverse its judgment and remand for calculation of fees covering the appropriate portions of the litigation,as discussed in section iii below.
background 
in our earlier decision,we discussed at length the facts underlying this case,see dantran,at,and we revisit only so much of that history as is necessary to provide a backdrop for the issue now before us.dantran is a trucking company that for more than a decade contracted with the united states postal service to haul mail between various sites in maine,vermont,new hampshire,and massachusetts.this case began with the secretary of labor administrative complaint seeking to exclude,or debar,appellants from government contracting for three years based on violations of the mcnamara service contract act of the act or the sca,and related regulations.the complaint followed an examination by the department of labor wage and hour division,whose investigator concluded that two of dantran routine practices paying employees on a monthly basis and capping fringe benefits at hours per week regardless of the number of hours an employee actually worked benefits violated the act.
although appellants promptly took action to remedy the identified violations,and the wage deficiencies were settled through payments to employees totaling about the investigator final report pressed for debarment.the report noted the size of the violations and the fact that the firm was investigated once before.dantran,at.that prior investigation had a markedly different outcome,however.even though dantran had been using the same procedures,another investigator,rioux,found no irregularities,and his report stated that there were no problems with the company fringe benefit payment practices.
the secretary nonetheless followed the recommendation of the second investigator and filed a debarment complaint.the act enforcement scheme generally anticipates debarment proceedings whenever the secretary determines that a government contractor has violated the act or its associated regulations,but both the statute and regulations provide that the existence of unusual circumstances may warrant a reprieve from that sanction.see a a.the existence of unusual circumstances in a given case depends on the absence of aggravating factors and the presence of mitigating factors.see dantran,at,listing some aggravating and mitigating factors b i,ii.if a contractor conduct evidences one of the enumerated aggravating circumstances,which include culpable neglect or culpable disregard of regulatory obligations,relief from the debarment sanction can not be in order.id.at b i 
after a hearing,an administrative law judge alj concluded that neither holmes nor dantran should be debarred,finding 
that the plaintiffs attempted to comply with the regulations in good faith that they cooperated fully with the secretary investigation that they promptly settled their account and changed their monthly payment practice once the matter was brought to their attention that nothing in their past compliance history reflected adversely on them and that,in all events,the alleged violations were not especially serious.
dantran,at summarizing alj conclusions.the labor department administrative review board arb reversed,however,and ordered debarment.the arb ruled that appellants violation of the payment frequency regulation reflected culpable disregard of that legal requirement,and their of fringe benefits constituted culpable neglect for failing to ascertain the proper calculation,making them ineligible for unusual circumstances relief.the district court affirmed the arb,but this court then reversed that decision concluding that the factors militating against debarment were so potent that an outcome contrary to that which the alj reached would constitute an abuse of discretion,id.at.
armed with our firm statement in support of their position,appellants sought attorney fees under the eaja,contending that the government litigation stance was not substantially justified.the district court denied the request,finding that the secretary had a reasonable basis in fact and law to pursue debarment.the court relied primarily on the differing conclusions reached in the prior judicial and administrative proceedings to support its conclusion that a reasonable person could view the government position as justified 
on appeal,appellants argue,inter alia,that the court erred by failing to consider the government position not only at the outset of the proceedings but also throughout the litigation,and by giving no consideration to the unusual circumstances that this court found weighed so strongly against debarment.
ii.discussion 
a.the standard limited role for objective factors 
the eaja obliges a court to award attorney fees and expenses to a party that prevails in litigation against the government unless the court finds that the government position was substantially justified.d a there is no dispute that appellants prevailed,and the controversy before us therefore centers on whether the government was substantially justified in pursuing debarment.that the government lost in the underlying litigation does not create a presumption that its position was not substantially justified.pierce underwood,d united states v.one parcel of real,cir.nor does success at some stage of the litigation prove the requisite level of justification.pierce,at.sierra club sec y of army,cir the question is whether the government position has a reasonable basis in law and fact,pierce,at,or,stated another way,whether a reasonable person could think it correct,see also de allende baker,cir.this standard means that the government case need not be frivolous to support an award of fees,pierce,at,but,on the other hand,the litigation need not be a cliffhanger to be sufficiently justified.the government bears the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that its position was substantially justified,de allende,at,and we review the district court determination for abuse of discretion,pierce,at.
b.our assessment 
we find no error in the district court conclusion that the decision to initiate a debarment proceeding was substantially justified.the act provides that no contract of the united states shall be awarded to individuals or firms found to have violated its provisions u nless the secretary otherwise recommends because of unusual circumstances.a.as we noted in our earlier decision,appellants violated an explicit prohibition against pay periods longer than semimonthly,see dantran,at citing b,and,on that basis alone,the secretary was required to institute debarment proceedings,see id.at.we think it reasonable for the secretary to have awaited the fact finding hearing before deciding whether appellants were entitled to a reprieve from that penalty because of unusual circumstances.indeed,the enforcement regulations caution the secretary to use restraint in excusing a contractor from the ineligible list,see b,and the burden of establishing unusual circumstances falls on the violator,id.see also vigilantes,adm r,wage and hour,cir the legislative history of the sca makes clear that debarment of contractors who violated the sca should be the norm,not the exception,and only the most compelling of justifications should relieve a violating contractor from that sanction.
our inquiry does not end,however,with the secretary initial decision to bring a debarment complaint.to satisfy its burden,the government must justify not only its conduct but also its position throughout litigation.comm r,ins jean,d jackson chater,cir one parcel of real,at see also d d the court task in examining the government position is not to make discrete findings as to each of these temporally distinct elements,but to arrive at one conclusion that simultaneously encompasses and accommodates the entire civil action.chater,at.
the difficulty with the secretary position in this case surfaces when we look beyond the alj hearing and fact finding.the secretary continuing view that appellants practices warranted debarment does not give us pause the payment frequency requirement is unambiguous,and the lengthy analysis in our earlier opinion demonstrates that the secretary position on the lawfulness of was sufficiently debatable,though we ultimately ruled it incorrect.
we balk,however,on the issue of unusual circumstances.the alj thoroughly examined the relevant circumstances in the course of concluding that appellants were ideally suited for relief from the debarment penalty.see supra at.in our earlier decision,we noted the alj unassailable finding that no aggravating factors were extant,dantran,at,as well as his specific findings of historical fact that resolve virtually all of the enumerated factors in the plaintiffs favor,id.see also id.at l egal certainty associated with the payment frequency provision,without more,can not overcome a record that reeks of mitigation.
the secretary resisted this determination,however,and persisted in pushing for debarment.she took this path even though the company had ceased to exist because of financial difficulties triggered by the department of labor freezing of its assets,see note supra,and despite repeated settlement offers from appellants,see infra at.although the secretary prevailed in the next stage of the litigation when the arb reversed the alj,the board decision lends no support to the secretary effort to justify the continuing pursuit of debarment.the alj decision had been based on observation of witnesses,giving strength to the credibility assessments on which it rested.we found the arb contrary ruling to be not only incorrect,but without foundation 
on appellate review,courts are entitled to expect,at a minimum,that an agency which rejects an alj factfinding will provide a rational exposition of how other facts or circumstances justify such a course of action.citations omitted.there is no hint of such an analysis in the arb opinion the short of it is that,gauged by the proper standard of review,the arb had no legally sufficient reason for upsetting the alj findings of fact particularly those that relied on credibility assessments.
dantran,at.
the particular testimony prompting that criticism of the arb ruling concerned appellants knowledge of the pay rules.the investigator who had done the earlier examination of appellants pay practices,rioux,testified that he had told appellant holmes that the regulations call for payment twice a month,rather than monthly.rioux testified that appellant replied as follows 
t he post office pays me on a monthly basis.when they pay me on a basis,i pay my employees on a basis.
id.at.according to the arb,this exchange demonstrated appellants culpable disregard of the law an aggravating circumstance under b i that made dantran and holmes ineligible for relief from debarment.
as we explained in our earlier decision,however,the alj the only factfinder with direct exposure to the testifying parties explicitly considered this evidence and declined to give it weight,instead crediting holmes testimony that rioux made no such point.see dantran,at.we devoted a considerable part of our opinion to an explanation why this was binding on the arb.see id.at.the alj finding that dantran had a reasonable,belief throughout the ensuing period that its practices conformed with the act requirements was reinforced,moreover,by rioux final report stating that plaintiffs payroll practices were in compliance with all the provisions of the act.id.
on this record,a majority of our panel found that the arb decision reflected a serious infirmity in agency decisionmaking,and we concluded that there was no plausible basis for an outcome contrary to that reached by the alj on the absence of aggravating factors.see id.at.in the panel majority view,the mitigating factors in appellants favor were so strong as the alj had recognized that this was the rare case in which the facts admit of only one plausible legal conclusion.see id.at.we observed 
t here is no reasonable doubt about the balancing equation overall equilibrium.although the act grants the secretary latitude in considering whether to recommend relief from debarment,she has cabined that discretion by enumerating specific factors and the balancing methodology upon which she will rely to determine the existence of unusual circumstances.in this case,the findings as to mitigation are so potent that solving the balancing equation in any manner contrary to that which the alj reached would constitute an abuse of discretion.
id.at emphasis added.
although there may be cases in which the government position would be substantially justified even though to adopt it would be an abuse of discretion,this is not one of them.once the alj resolved crucial credibility issues against the department of labor,the secretary needed some rationale for rejecting those findings in order to be deemed substantially justified in continuing to press for debarment.we found there was none.the secretary again emphasizes that appellants,as of the time of the first investigation in,had copies in hand of the applicable regulations in her view,this led to a reasonable perception that appellants continuing violations represented at least culpable neglect,an aggravating circumstance that would on its own preclude relief from debarment.
we previously have identified the flaws in this logic,pointing out that language in appellants postal contracts calling for monthly payments to dantran,together with the investigator clean bill of health after the earlier investigation,would have lulled appellants into a reasonable assumption of compliance.see dantran,at.the legislative intent behind the act was to make the full vigor of the law felt by those who repeatedly and callously violate it,and it would be a stretch to characterize appellants conduct as culpable within that understanding.with affirmative assurances that their practices were lawful,theirs was not even a failure to pay attention to the requirements,let alone a deliberate flaunting of them.see dantran,at t he regulatory scheme with which we are dealing is designed to debar those whose conduct is culpable and to excuse those whose actions invite leniency.
we recognize that the debarment sanction is not intended as a punishment only for deliberate misconduct.the regulations do not permit relief from debarment simply because the violator pays what should have been paid previously,see b such leniency would provide no incentive for contractors to seek out and conform to the regulations governing their conduct.but the facts here go far beyond such a straightforward failure to abide by the law.not only had appellants experienced an apparent endorsement of their practices by a department investigator,but by the time of the alj decision the secretary enforcement actions already had imposed a severe punishment by triggering the loss of their business it is hard to imagine a more compelling case for leniency.
the insistence on forging ahead was exacerbated in this case,moreover,by the secretary apparent refusal to consider appellants repeated offers to cut short the litigation with a settlement that would have conceded the legal issues in exchange for the relief from debarment to which they ultimately were found entitled.the costs of not settling are precisely what appellants seek to recover here.although the offer of settlement certainly does not on its own render the secretary position unjustified,the decision to persevere in light of the alj findings of unusual circumstances seems all the more unreasonable against the backdrop of appellants overtures.
in sum,while the secretary original decision to bring a debarment action was supportable,we believe the district court abused its discretion in failing to find that the secretary continuing pursuit of debarment following the alj ruling was and,in the language of the eaja,not substantially justified.in these circumstances involving a company already severely penalized by the government enforcement action,a factfinder determination of no culpability,full compliance with remedial obligations,and repeated offers to settle with acquiescence to the government legal stance we do not believe a reasonable person could find the government position following the alj decision to be correct,particularly with the burden on the government to prove itself justified.we conclude that the decision to prolong the adversarial proceedings swallowed up the earlier justifiable pursuit of debarment.these appear to be precisely the circumstances in which congress intended a successful litigant to be able to recover the costs of obtaining success.see jean,at.t he specific purpose of the eaja is to eliminate for the average person the financial disincentive to challenge unreasonable governmental actions.
we therefore reverse the district court judgment and hold that appellants are entitled to fees under the eaja.we address the precise scope of that award in the following section.
iii.the fee award what proceedings are covered by the eaja 
the secretary argues that appellants should be limited in any award of attorney fees to expenses associated with the court action and should not recover fees stemming from the administrative proceedings before the alj and arb.appellants counter that the eaja entitles them to fees for both the judicial and administrative stages of the litigation.because we have concluded that the secretary position before the alj was substantially justified,appellants may not be reimbursed for expenses through the time of the alj decision.we must consider,however,whether a fee award is appropriate for the costs of litigating before the arb.
in addition to providing for an award of fees and other expenses incurred in a civil action in federal court,see d a,the eaja specifically allows a court to award fees for an administrative proceeding that qualifies as an adversary adjudication under b c,see d.section,in turn,defines such an adjudication as one under section of the administrative procedure act apa in which the position of the united states is represented by counsel or otherwise apa section applies in every case of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing,with some exceptions not relevant here.a.
the secretary argues that this sequence of statutory provisions does not permit dantran to recover fees and expenses for the arb proceedings because,notwithstanding the proceeding adversary nature and the secretary representation by counsel,the debarment hearing was not required by statute and thus was not an adjudication within the coverage of the eaja.she emphasizes that only fees within the explicit language of the statute are recoverable because the eaja must be strictly construed as it is a waiver of the government sovereign immunity.see ardestani ins,d a waiver of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed in favor of the united states fidelity constr.united states,although the eaja lifts the bar of sovereign immunity for awards of fees in suits brought by litigants qualifying under the statute,it does so only to the extent explicitly and unequivocally provided,superseded in part by statute,b c specifying that certain proceedings under the contract disputes act are adversary adjudications under the eaja.
appellants maintain,however,that a hearing that meets the eaja definition is mandated by the service contract act.they point to sca section a,which provides in relevant part as follows 
where the secretary does not otherwise recommend because of unusual circumstances,he shall,not later than ninety days after a hearing examiner has made a finding of a violation of this chapter,forward to the comptroller general the name of the individual or firm found to have violated the provisions of this chapter.
a emphasis added.they emphasize that this provision does not leave it to the secretary discretion whether to conduct hearings on debarment,but explicitly authorizes the penalty to be imposed only after a finding by a hearing examiner also called an alj that such penalty is warranted.they further point out that the proceedings conducted under section a do conform to the requirements of an adversary adjudication under the apa,with representation by counsel and all of the other procedural protections specified in.see generally.
we are persuaded by multiple considerations that appellants have the better argument.like appellants,we read the language in section a to require a hearing.the statute expressly links the secretary obligation to place a contractor on the ineligible list to a hearing examiner finding of a violation that the statute does not command a hearing on the record in the language of apa section is of modest significance,as it has long been recognized that the applicability of the apa does not turn on the presence or absence of the precise words on the record,seacoast anti pollution league costle,cir citing united states florida east coast ry,d.see also louis fuel and supply,our decision does not turn,mechanically,on the absence of magic words.marathon oil epa,nn,cir similar,referring to the magical phrase on the record.rather,the resolution of this issue turns on the substantive nature of the hearing congress intended to provide.seacoast anti pollution league,at.
we have no reason to doubt that congress intended this adjudication to be governed by standard apa procedures.as we previously have observed,an adjudication such as this,which involves specific factual findings with potential for serious impact on private rights,is exactly the kind of proceeding for which the adjudicatory procedures of the apa were intended.id.citation omitted see also id.at i t is assumed that where a statute specifically provides for administrative adjudication such as the suspension or revocation of a license after opportunity for an agency hearing,such specific requirement for a hearing ordinarily implies the further requirement of a decision in accordance with evidence adduced at the hearing.quoting attorney general manual on the administrative procedure act.neither the sca itself nor case law excludes proceedings under the act from apa coverage,ardestani,at.supreme court precedent established that deportation proceedings are not subject to the apa owens brock,cir a provision of the federal employees compensation act specifically excludes workers compensation proceedings from coverage under section indeed,both the parties and district court invoked the judicial review provisions of the apa as the basis of jurisdiction.
moreover,a careful review of the relevant statutory provisions suggests that the apa is indirectly made applicable by statute to debarment proceedings under the sca.section of title the sca section preceding the one on which appellants rely incorporates the enforcement authority granted to the secretary under certain provisions of another statute,the walsh healey act.see a,pursuant to yet another provision of walsh healey,a,the apa is applicable in the administration of sections to of that act,a grouping that includes the provisions governing the secretary enforcement of the sca.by that chain of relationship,all of the requirements for eaja coverage would be met a hearing required by statute,with counsel representing the government,governed by the provisions of the apa 
the secretary notes that regulations implementing the eaja within the department of labor explicitly foreclose the award of attorney fees for sca proceedings before the arb.see she also points to a regulation listing the programs within the department to which the eaja is applicable,see id.at a,and argues that the omission of sca hearings from the list is further proof that fees are unavailable for such proceedings.several administrative decisions on which the secretary relies also hold that sca hearings do not qualify as adversary adjudications under the eaja.see,nationwide,bsca case,at,pat janitorial,case sca,dep.sec,at july.
we consider this administrative authority to be of limited value.agency regulations interpreting a statute that relates to matters outside the agency area of expertise are entitled to no special deference,see adams fruit barrett,d,and eligibility for attorney fees under the eaja is not within the department of labor particular knowledge,see ardestani,at.blackmun,dissenting because the eaja,like the apa,applies to all agencies and is not administered by any one in particular,deference to the interpretation by any particular agency is inappropriate.in addition,the administrative rulings cited by the secretary do not consider section reference to a hearing examiner finding of a violation,focusing instead on the discretion given to the secretary under section to make rules and regulations and to hold hearings,pat janitorial,at quoting verticare,case sca,dep.sec.june.
moreover,one of the regulations cited by the secretary suggests an inconsistency in the regulatory scheme.as noted,section of the department regulations lists a variety of proceedings that are considered adversarial adjudications covered by the eaja when all other conditions in that statute and the department rules are met.the list includes v iolations and debarment in federal contracts under the walsh healey act.a ii.because the sca specifically incorporates the enforcement procedures of the walsh healey act,we think it significant that the department explicitly deems the eaja applicable to debarment proceedings under that referenced statute.logically,if debarment proceedings under the walsh healey act are embraced by the eaja,equivalent proceedings under the sca also should be covered.
we see no need to delve more deeply into the complexities of the regulatory scheme,having come this far primarily to show its inconclusiveness and,to a lesser extent,its arguable endorsement of fee recovery for adversary adjudications of debarment.our holding rests not on the agency views but on our conclusion that the hearing prescribed by section satisfies the apa requirement for a statutorily mandated adjudication that is adversarial in nature.
because the adjudication of debarment is required by statute,is adversarial in nature,appears intended by legislation to be covered by the apa,and implicates interests traditionally protected by apa procedures and because it is not otherwise excluded from apa coverage we hold that appellants are entitled to fees and expenses associated with the proceedings before the arb.
iv.conclusion 
although the government justifiably instituted debarment proceedings against appellants,the record shows that it was not substantially justified in continuing to pursue debarment after the alj unassailable determination that unusual circumstances warranted a reprieve from that harsh sanction.the district court therefore erred in rejecting appellants request for attorney fees under the eaja.because the debarment hearing qualifies as an adversary adjudication under the apa,appellants are entitled to fees for both the administrative and judicial components of the litigation,limited in this instance to the period following the alj decision.
we leave to the district court the task of assessing a specific fee award,which may include the legal costs associated with this appeal.
reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
dissent follows.
congress,in enacting the equal access to justice act the eaja,never intended to chill the federal government legitimate efforts to enforce statutes and regulations.fees were to be awarded if and only if the government stance was not substantially justified.see id.d a.the majority gives lip service to this principle,but proceeds to flout it.
as the court opinion explains,this appeal requires us to revisit a dispute between the secretary of labor and a government contractor,dantran.on our previous encounter,a divided panel of this court reversed a debarment order promulgated by the secretary under the mcnamara service contract act of the sca.see dantran,dep t of labor,cir dantran i.this time around,a different panel is asked to determine whether the district court abused its discretion in denying dantran subsequent motion for counsel fees and incidental expenses under the eaja.in a strange twist of fate,the majority takes our earlier opinion an opinion that i authored and fashions it into a club,which it then wields to beat the secretary about the ears.in doing so,the court mistakes the import of what was written.
the secretary consistently held position dantran had two components.first,she claimed that dantran persistently violated a regulation governing frequency of wage payments.see dantran i,at.second,she claimed that dantran persistently violated a fringe benefit regulation,by certain benefit payments.her first claim was indisputably correct the evidence is uncontradicted that dantran paid its employees monthly a practice forbidden by the explicit language of a directly applicable regulation,b.her second claim was plausible,even though it ultimately was rejected by this court.
the claim was plausible because the secretary understanding of the fringe benefit regulation was perfectly reasonable.at the very least,this regulation was susceptible to conflicting readings.see dantran i,at id.at cudahy,dissenting.and the mere fact that the secretary,confronted with a choice among plausible interpretations of an opaque regulation,failed to predict how the courts would rule does not suffice to prove that the government acted unjustifiably.see de allende baker,cir holding that the government was substantially justified in pursuing a novel but erroneous interpretation of the law martinez sec y of hhs,cir per curiam finding the government position substantially justified when the applicable law was unclear dougherty lehman,cir similar.
the history of the fringe benefit regulation helps to prove this point.the secretary promulgated the regulation in.when she cited dantran in,no court had construed it in respect to,and the regulation application simply was not in that type of situation.where,as here,a government actor decisionmaking turns on a question of novel impression,the answer to the question would have to be relatively clear to warrant a holding that the government actor plausible,though erroneous,response was not substantially justified.see de allende,at holding that the government was justified in pursuing its own understanding of a particular provision absent any previous rulings clarifying its meaning united states yoffe,cir we do not think that the government should be found to have acted without substantial justification because it did not foresee how the court of appeals would interpret the regulations.here,moreover,the fact that the administrative review board the arb,the district judge,and one member of the original panel of this court agreed with the secretary reading of the fringe benefit regulation is a strong indicator of the cogency,and thus the reasonableness,of her position,united states paisley,cir.
the majority seems to concede,albeit grudgingly,that the secretary attempts to enforce the and regulations were substantially justified.it nonetheless maintains that the secretary went too far by pushing for debarment.although it strives mightily to treat these inquiries as separate and distinct,the two are inextricably intertwined.
the sca requires the secretary,within ninety days after she concludes that a violation of the statute has occurred,to forward to the comptroller general the name of the individual or firm found to have committed the violation.a.the case law makes manifest that debarment should be the norm,not the exception,and only the most compelling of justifications should relie
