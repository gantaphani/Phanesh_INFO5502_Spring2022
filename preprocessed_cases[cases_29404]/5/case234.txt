the expression you can take that to the bank connotes the certainty and reliability of the banking system.this dispute arises out of the disposition of several hundred thousand dollars that nearly eighty pakistanis the contributor claimants wished to transfer from new york to pakistan.their problems arose from their decision not to entrust their funds to the international banking system but rather to three couriers.the couriers,who were also carrying some of their own money,were apprehended by the customs outbound currency team customs as they were about to board a flight to pakistan and were subsequently convicted under the bulk cash smuggling provision of the usa patriot act.see uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism usa patriot act of,stat.the united states district court for the eastern district of new york jack weinstein,judge concluded that the government could forfeit of the funds owned by the couriers the convicted claimants without violating the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment.united states in currency,d.as for the contributor claimants,it took them roughly three years to recover the money they had dispatched on what they had believed would be an overnight flight.
two attorneys,john donohue and david smith,who represent many of the contributor,not incidentally,also two of the three convicted attorney fees from the united states.the district court denied their request,and they now appeal from that decision.
background 
in september,the convicted sher khan,akbar ali khan,and fazan arrested while on the jetway trying to board a flight from new york to pakistan carrying in currency,concealed,among other places,in soap and toothpaste boxes.in december,they were convicted of bulk cash smuggling,see a,as well as various offenses relating to their failure to report to government agents the amount of money they were transporting,see a a,b.
on or about february,the government filed a civil forfeiture action in rem against the funds seized from the convicted claimants.because this case turns,in part,on whether the government was dilatory in eventually returning money to the contributor claimants,we must recite the course of proceedings in some detail.
on or about march,ali sher khan filed his answer to the complaint in rem as well as responses to the government interrogatories.c b supplemental rules for certain admiralty and maritime claims interrogatories may be served with the complaint in an in rem action without leave of court.answers to the interrogatories must be served with the answer to the complaint.hereinafter supplemental rules.he did not submit a verified claim to the seized funds.in his papers,ali sher khan mentioned the names of approximately of the eighty contributor claimants,which corroborated a list the government had seized from his person.customs then sent copies of the verified complaint,as well as the government interrogatories,to these putative claimants.customs also sent the same documents to various other contributor claimants,identified in a letter dated july,from attorney david udell,who was representing akbar ali khan and fazal subhan thus,by,the government had notified nearly all of the contributor claimants that their money had been seized.
the contributor claimants,who had violated no law,understandably wanted their money back.pursuant to supplemental rule c a i a,those asserting a right to seized funds must file verified claims promptly.see also supplemental rule c a iv see generally united states cambio exacto,cir citing united states amiel,cir.this,unfortunately,they did not do,in part because some had gone to pakistan and others did not quickly retain counsel.
the district court,however,has the authority to extend the time period for filing verified claims.see supplemental rule c a i b.and,both judge weinstein and magistrate judge cheryl pollack proved accommodating.still,by january,no claimant had filed a verified the convicted claimants nor a single one of the contributor claimants 
eventually,the three convicted claimants and those who had contributed money to one of them,ali sher khan,filed verified claims.on august,the government agreed to return money to of the contributors to ali sher khan.however,the aggregate amount claimed by the contributors to ali sher khan exceeded by the amount the government had seized from him and his belongings three of the four contributors whose claims remained in dispute at that point eventually prevailed after a hearing before magistrate judge pollack,although not until july.
with respect to those who had given their money to akbar ali khan the akbar ali khan contributors,the process was slower.by august,a number of the akbar ali khan contributors still had failed to respond to the government interrogatories,and many had not filed verified claims some contributors to akbar ali khan were still filing claims as late as may.
as verified claims trickled in,the government pressed for the forfeiture of the full amount owned by the convicted claimants.the convicted claimants argued that forfeiture in that amount was unconstitutional under the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment and in light of united states bajakajian,d.the district court agreed,concluding that forfeiture of the entire amount of convicted claimants currency would be grossly disproportionate to the gravity of claimants offenses,d at.the district court ultimately ordered the forfeiture of half of the convicted claimants own funds,amounting to for ali sher khan,for akbar ali khan,and for fazal subhan.id.at.
in august,the government began the process of issuing checks to both the contributor claimants and the convicted claimants.thereupon,attorneys donohue and smith sought fees and expenses in the amount of,a little under a third of the total amount seized from the convicted claimants on the jetway.the district court denied their application,noting that although c ounsel for all parties acted ethically and properly t he claimants choice of a surreptitious method for sending their money led to this costly litigation.
the district court concluded that attorneys donohue and smith could not,pursuant to the civil asset forfeiture reform act of,stat.cafra,obtain fees for their work on behalf of the contributor claimants because there were competing claims to the same property within the meaning of section b c ii.b.the district court also held that they could not obtain fees for their work on behalf of the convicted claimants because the government had been substantially justified in seeking forfeiture of the convicted claimants money,or,in the alternative,because cafra preempted the equal access to justice act eaja,see b,d a,and because cafra does not apply if the claimant is convicted of a crime for which the interest of the claimant in the property was subject to forfeiture under a federal criminal forfeiture law,b b.this appeal followed.
i.the civil asset forfeiture reform act 
in passing cafra,congress was reacting to public outcry over the government pursuit of civil and criminal forfeiture.united states funds held in the name or for the benefit of wetterer,cir w e see aggressive but marginal claims asserted on dubious jurisdiction to seize charitable funds raised for the relief of abject orphans in an impoverished country,so that the money can be diverted for expenditure by the department of justice.as part and parcel of this effort to deter government overreaching,congress provided for the payment of reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs to claimants who substantially prevail in a civil proceeding to forfeit property.b a.however,congress had no wish to expand government liability respecting legitimate seizures of property plausibly subject to forfeiture thus,cafra also provides that,
i f there are multiple claims to the same property,the united states shall not be liable for costs and attorneys fees associated with any such claim if the united states 
i promptly recognizes such claim 
ii promptly returns the interest of the claimant in the property to the claimant,if the property can be divided withou
