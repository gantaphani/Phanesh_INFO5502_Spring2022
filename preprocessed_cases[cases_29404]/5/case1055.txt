background 
on february,citizens brought suit in the northern district of california,alleging that the usda had committed procedural violations of the national environmental policy act nepa and the endangered species act esa and substantive violations of the national forest management act in promulgating a new rule the final rule governing the forest service administration and management of national forest system lands.citizens sought declaratory and injunctive relief.after citizens filed suit,the usda reviewed the final rule and announced in december that a new rule would replace it.citizens agreed,in turn,to stay its substantive claims,but moved for partial summary judgment on its procedural claims.the usda filed a for partial summary judgment,alleging that citizens lacked standing to challenge the final rule and that its claims were not ripe for adjudication.the district court granted the usda motion on both grounds and denied citizens motions for partial summary judgment and injunctive relief.citizens brought an immediate appeal of the district court denial of its motion for injunctive relief.
this court reversed,holding that citizens had standing to assert the nepa and esa claims and that the case was ripe for review.citizens for better forestry dep t of agriculture,cir.in our standing analysis,we held that the usda had violated nepa by depriving citizens of its right to comment on the relevant environmental documents.id.at.the opinion concluded we do not reach the merits of citizens appeal on their motion for injunctive relief,however,because the district court did not reach the merits of the motion.id.at.ultimately,we reversed and remanded the case to the district court to determine whether injunctive relief is appropriate.id.at.
after we issued our decision,the usda withdrew the final rule and issued a new final rule.citizens then dismissed its case and moved for attorneys fees and costs pursuant to the esa and the eaja.a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation concluding that citizens motion should be granted under the eaja,but denied under the esa.after the usda objected,the district court reviewed the record de novo and issued an order adopting the report and recommendation without change.citizens for better dep t of agriculture,d.the district court awarded attorneys fees to citizens under the eaja because it held that citizens was a prevailing party on its nepa claim,as required for an award of fees.id.at.the court reasoned given the dispositive and binding nature of the ninth circuit finding,leaving no discretion to the district court,the panel ruling was functionally equivalent to a declaratory judgment,a form of relief sufficient to confer prevailing party status under the eaja.id.at.the usda timely filed a notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
the usda argues that the district court incorrectly held that citizens was a prevailing party in its lawsuit against the usda and,as a result,erred in awarding citizens attorneys fees under the eaja.the usda contends that citizens can not be a prevailing party because the latter did not secure any relief from either the district court or this court.citizens responds by disputing the usda assertion that we did not afford declaratory relief to citizens it argues that this court went beyond a mere jurisdictional ruling to reach the merits of citizens nepa claim.our favorable ruling on the merits in conjunction with a remand with instructions to the district court indicate,citizens contends,that it was a prevailing party under the eaja.
we review for abuse of discretion the district court decision to award fees under the eaja.united states roundhill,cir.the decision as to whether a party has prevailed is a finding of fact that will be set aside if clearly erroneous or if based on an incorrect legal standard.oregon environmental council kunzman,cir.we review de novo the legal analysis underlying the district court finding that citizens was a prevailing party.see ex rel.los joint union high sch,cir.
the eaja directs courts to award attorneys fees to a prevailing party in qualifying civil actions against the united states.d a in buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health human resources,the supreme court looked to black law dictionary to define prevailing party as a party in whose favor a judgment is rendered,regardless of the amount of damages awarded,d alteration in original quoting black law dictionary ed of particular relevance to the present case is the definition of render,given the dispute between the usda and citizens over whether this court entered a declaratory judgment for citizens.when referring to an action taken by a judge,render is defined by the authority relied upon by the court in buckhannon as to deliver formally.black law dictionary ed.taken together,the definitions of prevailing party and render suggest that a party must have a judgment or something similar formally delivered in its favor to be considered prevailing.
while the buckhannon court did not have reason to address how formal a judgment must be,it made clear that,in any event,a party must receive some relief from a court to be considered prevailing.at.our r espect for ordinary language requires that a plaintiff receive at least some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said to prevail.id.alteration in original quoting hewitt helms,d.an award of attorneys fees must be preceded by a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties.id.at.quoting texas state teachers ass garland independent sch,d.only such alterations that obtain the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change will suffice to confer prevailing party status upon the plaintiff.id.at.
in a previous decision,the supreme court held that a plaintiff was not a prevailing party when he obtained no relief,only a favorable judicial statement of law in the course of litigation that result ed in judgment against the plaintiff.hewitt,at.in hewitt helms,the third circuit had instructed the district court to enter summary judgment for the plaintiff,a state prisoner,on the grounds that the defendant prison officials had violated the constitution,unless the defendants could establish an immunity defense.id.at.emphasis added.in subsequent proceedings,the defendants succeeded in establishing qualified immunity and were granted summary judgment themselves.id.the court found that the third circuit favorable instruction did not constitute a form of judicial relief,such as a declaratory judgment,and therefore was insufficient to confer prevailing party status on the plaintiff.id.at.consequently,though the plaintiff had obtained a favorable determination on the issue of whether there had been a constitutional violation,he ultimately received no relief from the district court and therefore was not entitled to attorneys fees.id.
the supreme court provided two examples of forms of relief that justify a fee award enforceable judgments on the merits and settlement agreements enforced through a consent decree.buckhannon,at.while we have identified additional situations in which a plaintiff can qualify as a prevailing party,see,richard dep t of developmental services of,cir legally enforceable settlement agreement between the plaintiff and defendant watson county of riverside,cir preliminary injunction as sole form of relief,we never have undermined the court basic requirement that some relief be granted.in benton oregon student assistance commission,for instance,we reversed a district court award of attorneys fees,finding that the court prior award of nominal damages and its conclusion that the plaintiff had proven that her constitutional rights had been violated were not alone sufficient to justify a fee award,cir.we held that the plaintiff had not obtained a declaratory judgment,notwithstanding this favorable judicial language.see also,poland chertoff,cir denying prevailing party status to a plaintiff who had not yet obtained any relief on the merits of his claims,despite holding that the plaintiff had established one of his claims emphasis added.
in the present case,citizens asserts that it should be considered a prevailing party because it received a ruling from this court that the usda had violated citizens rights under nepa.citizens,however,never received a formal declaratory judgment or other relief from this or any other court.the district court entered no such judgment,and we merely remanded to the district court to consider injunctive relief without discussing declaratory relief.see citizens,at.
no supreme court or ninth circuit precedent supports citizens claim.to the contrary,the cases reviewed here uniformly require that a plaintiff receive some form of relief,as a judicial imprimatur is necessary to achieve the corresponding alteration in the legal relationship of the parties that the supreme court has identified as a for prevailing party status.see buckhannon,at.
the dissent attempts to read supreme court precedent in light of the buckhannon court approval of parham southwestern bell telephone,cir.see buckhannon,at.in parham,the eighth circuit granted attorneys fees to a plaintiff after holding that the company to which he had applied for employment had engaged in racial discrimination in violation of title vii.at.while agreeing with the district court that an injunction was neither necessary or appropriate at the present time,due to the company subsequent progress in minority hiring,the eighth circuit nevertheless directed the district court to retain jurisdiction over the matter for a reasonable period of time to insure the continued implementation of the appellee policy of equal employment opportunities.id.in buckhannon,the supreme court quoted the latter passage and analogized that directive to a consent decree before concluding that c learly parham does not support a theory of fee shifting untethered to a material alteration in the legal relationship of the parties.at.in the present case,our court issued no comparable order to the district court and instead remanded to allow the district court to determine whether injunctive relief is appropriate.citizens,at.buckhannon citation to parham does not support a fee award here.
for its part,citizens points to a single decision of our court,animal lovers volunteer ass n,carlucci,cir,that,citizens argues,should control the resolution of this appeal.in animal lovers,we awarded attorneys fees to the plaintiffs after a previous ninth circuit decision had granted the plaintiffs declaratory relief and had remanded to the district court to determine whether an injunction should be granted.id.at.while citizens relies heavily on animal the district court cites it,citizens,d at,procedural background differs significantly from the facts here our court granted declaratory relief to the plaintiffs in animal lovers,but did not do likewise with citizens.compare animal lovers,at,with citizens,at.thus,even citizens preferred precedent offers no support for its proposition that it was transformed into a prevailing party once we stated that the usda had violated citizens rights.
citizens asserts that we went beyond a jurisdictional ruling to reach the merits of its claim when we held that the usda had violated nepa by depriving citizens of its right to comment on environmental documents.but a favorable determination on a legal issue,even if it might have put the handwriting on the wall,is not enough by itself.a favorable judicial statement of law,as citizens obtained here,can not substitute for a form of judicial relief,such as declaratory judgment.hewitt,at.
one reason the supreme court drew that distinction is that a court is not bound to enter a declaratory judgment when it finds unlawful action.see,wilton seven falls,d d istrict courts possess discretion in determining whether and when to entertain an action under the declaratory judgment act,even when the suit otherwise satisfies subject matter jurisdictional prerequisites.in reaching its decision,the hewitt court cited a practical objection to equating statements of law with declaratory judgments the equation deprives the defendant of valid defenses to a declaratory judgment to which he is entitled,such as mootness or equitable grounds.at.the court added the fact that a court can enter a declaratory judgment does not mean that it should.id.
we recognize that our previous ruling in this case may have put citizens well down the road to victory.it is possible that citizens lawsuit even contributed to the decision by the usda to withdraw the disputed rule.but the supreme court has made clear that being a catalyst for such change is not enough to support a claim for attorneys fees under the eaja.buckhannon,at.relief from the court in some formal fashion is required.this case,however,was dismissed before it reached that stage.accordingly,because neither the district court nor our court entered relief for citizens,the district court did not have the power to award citizens attorneys fees.
iii.conclusion 
there was not a material alteration in the parties legal relationship sufficient to make citizens a prevailing party under the eaja.accordingly,we reverse the award of attorneys fees.
i respectfully dissent.
citizens filed a suit that,among other things,sought a ruling that usda had violated the provisions of nepa by failing to give appropriate notice of the promulgation of a new rule to replace the plan development rule.the district court ruled that citizens lacked standing to sue and that the procedural challenges were not ripe for review.citizens appealed,contending that it did have standing and that the matter was ripe for review.
the usda invited our court also to rule on the merits of the nepa claim.in its reply brief,the usda stated even if the court finds that citizens has standing and that its nepa and esa claims are ripe,it should affirm the district court grant of summary judgment and denial of injunctive relief on the alternative ground that citizen claims fail on the merits.we held that citizens had standing and the case was ripe for review,and also held that the usda violated nepa in promulgating the new rule.citizens for better forestry dep t of,cir.the holding on the nepa violation was,in effect,the equivalent of a declaratory ruling made at the invitation of the usda.
because citizens had requested an injunction in addition to declaratory relief,it is significant that our remand to the district court was only to consider the additional relief of an injunction.citizens for better forestry,at.the declaratory judgment was taken care of in our ruling,in which we held that the usda had violated nepa.this was not dicta,as the usda contends,but our holding on an issue that the usda specifically asked us to address.once judgment was entered,this holding was binding on the district court as the law of the case and was binding precedent in our circuit.until the usda complied with nepa,proceeding with enforcement of the new rule was unlawful.this is exactly the relief citizens sought in its suit.
the district court properly awarded attorneys fees because our ruling in citizens for better forestry was functionally equivalent to a declaratory judgment.citizens for better dep t of,d.the majority rejects the equivalency doctrine by relying on precedents that do not control the case at bar.although the supreme court in buckhannon began its analysis by consulting black law dictionary
