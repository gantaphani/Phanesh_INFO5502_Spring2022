factual and procedural background 
edward and rose caufield the caufields entered into a contract with gino and armando cantele the canteles to sell to the canteles a mobile home park located in hernando county,florida.closing on the sale occurred and title was passed to the canteles in.in,the canteles filed a complaint in the circuit court for the fifth judicial circuit,alleging concealment of defects and fraudulent misrepresentations as to the condition of a sewer plant located on the property.the caufields filed a motion to dismiss and a motion to strike the complaint,claiming that the complaint alleged fraud and breach of contract in a single count.the caufields included a general prayer for attorney fees in the wherefore clauses of both motions.in,the trial court entered an order resolving both motions by treating the complaint as one which asserted a single claim for intentional misrepresentation.in their responsive pleading,the caufields included another general prayer for attorney fees.after the canteles initial counsel withdrew and new counsel failed to appear at a pretrial conference,the canteles voluntarily dismissed their complaint.
the contract contained a provision which entitled the prevailing party to costs and attorney fees in connection with any litigation arising out of the contract.pursuant to the provision,the caufields filed a motion in the trial court for costs and attorney fees.the trial court entered an order denying the caufields request for attorney fees for two reasons.first,the trial court concluded that the caufields had failed to plead for attorney fees as required by stockman downs,so d second,the court concluded that because the cause of action was for the tort of intentional misrepresentation,the litigation was not based on the contract and,thus,the litigation did not arise out of the contract.
the caufields sought review of the trial court order by plenary appeal in the fifth district court of appeal.in addition to affirming the trial court determination that the caufields did not properly plead for attorney fees and that the litigation did not arise out of the contract,the fifth district addressed,sua sponte,the jurisdictional issue of whether plenary appeal was the proper method of review.
the fifth district held that a judgment denying attorney fees entered after a voluntary dismissal was properly reviewed by plenary appeal.as to this holding,the fifth district certified conflict with decisions of other district courts,which have held that under this court decision in chatlos city of hallandale,so d,a petition for certiorari is the proper method for reviewing orders denying or granting attorney fees after a voluntary dismissal.see green tree vendor services lisi,so d dca oakwood plaza,optics,so d dca,review denied,so d britamco underwriters,so d dca kelly tworoger,so d dca barry cohen,latorre,so d dca.the caufields seek discretionary review of the fifth district decision in caufield cantele,so d dca,based on certified conflict.
discussion 
the fifth district certified conflict as to whether district courts may review,by plenary appeal,a trial court order determining attorney fees and costs after voluntary dismissal of a complaint.we recognize that district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction and may only exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon them by the florida constitution.see clement aztec sales,so d,dca warren state,so d,dca.because we find that the fifth district properly exercised the jurisdiction conferred upon it by the florida constitution,we approve the decision below on this issue.
in chatlos city of hallandale,this court discussed the ways in which a cost determination could be reviewed on plenary appeal and certiorari by the district courts 
if the cost determination is entered in the final judgment or is made subsequent to the rendition of the final judgment but prior to timely appeal from that judgment,plenary appeal from the final judgment will bring the cost order to the appellate court finally,in appropriate in the instant case wherein the order was entered following a and unappealable voluntary of certiorari may lie as a means of securing review.
chatlos,so d at quoting craft clarembeaux,so d,dca.cases holding that a petition for certiorari is the appropriate method for a district court to review a cost determination entered after a voluntary dismissal have followed our language in chatlos.see,so d at barry cohen,so d at.thus,cases following chatlos have found that the district courts do not have jurisdiction to review such orders by plenary appeal.see,so d at sholkoff boca raton community hospital,so d,dca.because the fifth district certified conflict in this issue,we address the constitutional jurisdiction of the district courts in deciding this matter.
under the florida constitution,district courts have jurisdiction to hear plenary appeals,as a matter of right,only from final judgments and orders of the trial courts.see art.v,b.const.thus,district courts may only review a cost determination by plenary appeal if that determination is a final judgment or order of the trial court.therefore,in the instant case,the issue of whether the fifth district had jurisdiction to review the trial court order on plenary appeal turns on whether an order determining costs after a voluntary dismissal is final.
a final judgment is one which ends the litigation between the parties and disposes of all issues involved such that no further action by the court will be necessary.see joannou corsini,so d dca chan brunswick,so d dca.courts that have held that orders merely determining costs,especially when entered after a voluntary dismissal,are nonfinal and nonappealable have done so for three reasons.see sholkoff,so d at craft,so d at.first,such orders are incident to the merits of the case,and,as such,are not final judgments in the sense of final judgments on the merits.see gray mann,so.hall patterson,so.second,where a voluntary dismissal is granted and the court does not award the defendant costs,if the plaintiff sues the defendant again on the same claim,rule d expressly provides that the court shall make such order for the payment of the costs of the claim previously dismissed as it may deem proper and shall stay the proceedings in the action until the party seeking affirmative relief has complied with the order.civ.d.see sholkoff,so d at.third,when a party has previously paid costs after a voluntary dismissal,if that party subsequently prevails in the same action,then such a party may recover at least some of the costs previously paid.see rose printing wilson,so d,dca,approved,so d mcarthur dairy,guillen,so d,dca.
however,we are not persuaded by any of these reasons.the mere fact that an action for costs and fees is incident to the merits of the original case does not preclude an order on these issues from being a final decision.see clearwater federal savings loan ass sampson,so d.in sampson we held that w here an order after judgment is dispositive of any question,it becomes a final post decretal order.to the extent that it completes the judicial labor on that portion of the cause after judgment,it becomes final as to that portion and should be treated as a final judgment.id.in the instant case,although there is no final adjudication on the merits,the voluntary dismissal ended the litigation leaving only the caufields motion for fees and costs to be determined.the trial court order denying the caufields request for fees,entered september,disposed of the caufields motion and no further judicial labor was required in the case.therefore,the trial court order denying the caufields request for fees,though incident to the merits,was a final and appealable order.
moreover,the additional judicial action in the second and third scenarios is prompted by a subsequent commencement of litigation by one of the parties.under rule d,after a voluntary dismissal,costs are to be assessed and a judgment entered for costs in that action.see.civ.d.costs are not assessed by the court in which subsequent litigation is commenced rather,rule d provides that costs are to be assessed immediately after a dismissal is entered by the court issuing the voluntary dismissal and that any subsequent lawsuit on the same claim must be stayed by the second court until all of the costs awarded in the initial lawsuit are fully paid.see city of hallandale chatlos,so d,construing rule d to mean that costs,including attorney fees,are to be assessed and judgment entered for them in the same action which is the subject of voluntary dismissal mckelvey kismet,so d,dca.thus,in the instant case,no more judicial labor is required of the initial court to enforce its denial of costs.furthermore,if the prevailing party in subsequent litigation is awarded costs for the initially dismissed action or is allowed to recover costs previously paid,these matters would be appropriately contained in a final judgment of the second court and the initial cost determination need not be altered.we are not persuaded that the trial court order denying the caufields request for costs and fees,entered after voluntary dismissal of the cause against them,is a nonfinal order.
the fifth district reasoned that the differences between plenary appeal and certiorari review support the propriety of reviewing such decisions via plenary appeal.see caufield,so d at.for example,the time in which to seek review can vary for certiorari review and plenary appeal also,while certiorari review is discretionary,plenary appeal review is a matter of right.compare.b with.b as the fifth district noted,reviewing such orders by plenary appeal promotes symmetry in the law since that is how attorney fee awards or denials after a final judgment are reviewed.so d at.we agree that,regardless of whether a request for costs and fees is granted or denied,the parties should not have to await the speculative filing of a subsequent lawsuit for finality of the initial trial court determination on this issue.therefore,we conclude that an order determining costs and fees after a voluntary dismissal is a final and appealable order.
in the instant case,the fifth district reviewed the trial court order determining costs and fees in the voluntarily dismissed action by plenary appeal.district courts have constitutional jurisdiction to review final judgments of the trial courts by plenary appeal.see art.v,b.const.because the trial court determination of costs and fees was final,we hold that the fifth district properly exercised its constitutionally conferred jurisdiction by reviewing the trial court order by plenary appeal.therefore,we approve the fifth district decision on this issue and hold that the proper method for review of a determination of costs after a voluntary dismissal is by plenary appeal.accordingly,we recede from decisions which have held that an order determining costs after a voluntary dismissal is a nonfinal and unappealable order.see chatlos city of hallandale,so d.
we now turn to the remaining issues raised in this review proceeding the fifth district held that the caufields requests for attorney fees failed to meet the standard for claiming attorney fees set forth in stockman downs,so d.in stockman,this court held that a claim for attorney fees,whether based on statute or contract,must be pled.id.at this court stated that the fundamental concern of the pleading requirement is notice.see so d at.by pleading a claim to attorney fees,a party notifies the opposing party and prevents unfair surprise.moreover,this court noted the important role that the existence or nonexistence of a claim for attorney fees may play in a case.see id.for example,the potential that one may be required to pay an opposing party attorney fees may often be determinative in a decision on whether to pursue a claim,dismiss it,or settle.id.therefore,we held that a claim for attorney fees must be pled and,if not pled,a claim for attorney fees is waived.see id.at.
in the instant case,however,the fifth district held that stockman actually requires that a party specifically plead the basis for the entitlement to fees.see caufield,so d at.the fifth district relied on united pacific insurance berryhill,so d dca,where it had previously held that stockman requires a party to plead the correct entitlement to attorney fees.the fifth district also relied on a decision from the third district which held that a general claim for attorney fees will not satisfy this court requirement in stockman.see dealers ins.haidco investment enterprises,so d,dca holding that the requesting party must plead the statutory or contractual basis on which that party seeks attorney fees.
however,this court holding in stockman does not expressly require a specific pleading of the statutory or contractual basis of a claim for attorney fees.see stockman,so d at.in stockman,we reasoned that merely pleading a claim for attorney fees is sufficient to notify the opposing party and allow it to consider the claim in a decision on whether to proceed.therefore,we decline to extend our holding in stockman to impose a stricter requirement for pleading a claim for attorney fees.we hold that the specific statutory or contractual basis for a claim for attorney fees need not be specifically pled,and that failure to plead the basis of such a claim will not result in waiver of the claim.accordingly,we quash the fifth district decision in the instant case,and direct that the case be remanded to the trial court for consideration of the caufields request for attorney fees and costs.
lastly,we address the fifth district determination that the caufields were not entitled to attorney fees under a provision in their contract with the canteles.see caufield,so d at.the fifth district stated that attorney fees may only be awarded under a contractual provision where the parties to the contract clearly manifest their intention that attorney fees cover the specific situation for which fees are claimed.see id.at.the attorney fees provision of the instant contract allowed fees to be awarded to the prevailing party in connection with any litigation arising out of the contract.the fifth district reasoned that a cause of action for fraudulent misrepresentation made orally or external to a contract,concerning property purchased pursuant to the contract,is not litigation arising out of the contract.id.at.we disagree with this reasoning and find that claims of fraudulent misrepresentation concerning the subject matter of the contract do arise out of the contract.
the fifth district relied on its decisions in hopps smith,so d dca,review denied,so d,and dickson dunn,so d dca,in reaching the decision in this case.see caufield,so d at.in dickson,the court found that buyers suing for misrepresentation of improvements to realty could not recover attorney fees based on a clause in the contract providing for such fees to the prevailing party as a result of a suit arising out of the contract.the fifth district reasoned that based on chanin chevrolet motor,cir,the subject litigation arose out of a claim of misrepresentation in the inducement of the cont
