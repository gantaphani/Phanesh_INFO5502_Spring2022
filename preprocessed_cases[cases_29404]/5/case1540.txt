a lawyer who formerly represented a veteran in his claim before the department of veterans affairs department for benefits seeks twenty percent of the past benefits the department awarded the veteran.his claim is based upon his retainer agreement with the veteran providing that amount as the lawyer fees.during the proceedings before the department,however,the veteran terminated the lawyer representation and substituted a veterans organization,which pursued the case to its successful conclusion.
the question before us is which component of the board of veterans appeals board or the regional decide initially the lawyer claim.the court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court held that the board has jurisdiction to determine only the reasonableness of but not the lawyer entitlement to the fee,and remanded the case to the board to dismiss and for the regional office initially to determine the lawyer entitlement to a fee.we modify the remand order and,as modified,affirm it.
the appellant mason,an attorney,entered into a fee retainer contract in january with the veteran scates to represent scates in his claim for benefits before the department and the veterans court.in the contract scates agree d to pay a contingent fee equal to twenty percent of the total amount of any benefits awarded on the basis of your claim with the department of veterans affairs dva.it is understood that this contingent fee is to be paid by the dva directly to me from any past due benefits awarded to you.
scates and mason amended their representation agreement in april.the new agreement substituted the following paragraphs relating to the contingent fee arrangement 
if there is a recovery of benefits,i agree to pay you a fee contingent upon the outcome of the matter or proceeding described in paragraph.i agree to pay you a fee equal to twenty percent of the total amount of any va disability benefits awarded by judgment,settlement or administrative action on the basis of my the client claim with the department of veterans affairs.
if there is an award of attorney fees under the equal access to justice act eaja,i the client agree to pay you the attorney that part of the eaja award that,when added to the twenty percent of the past due disability benefits,raises the total fee earned by you to the following level the number of hours of time expended on this case multiplied by per hour,which is two times your normal hourly rate for noncontingency work.i agree and acknowledge because of the contingency nature of my case,per hour is a reasonable rate.
i hereby order and direct dva to withhold twenty percent of past due benefits payable to me and to pay such amount to you for attorney fee 
if,for any reason,the department of veteran sic affairs fails to follow my order and direction,i promise and agree to pay the contingent fee,less the advance retainer,directly to you.
in june,scates terminated mason representation,and appointed the veterans of foreign wars as his representative.the regional office notified mason of this change and told him that the april amended retainer agreement would be kept in scates file.the regional office stated that if benefits subsequently were awarded,it would forward that agreement to the board to determine whether mason should receive any fee for his representation of scates.
in march,the department awarded scates benefits,including benefits.the regional office,pending a decision by the board on scates right to a fee,withheld twenty percent of the benefits.the board held that mason had satisfied all the requirements for receiving his fee,and directed that he be paid.the board ruled that scates revocation of mason authority to represent him did not preclude payment of otherwise due attorney fees.
on scates appeal,a divided panel of the veterans court reversed the board.it held that under new york law scates termination of mason employment extinguished mason right to the contingent attorney fee.
the full court,however,granted rehearing en banc and vacated the panel decision.in its en banc opinion the veterans court held that b ecause the board does not have original jurisdiction to consider any issues regarding entitlement to attorney fees in cases,all issues involving entitlement or eligibility for attorney fees under agreements,as contrasted with the issues of reasonableness and excessiveness,must first be addressed by the ro regional office in accordance with the normal adjudication procedures and can not be the subject of sua sponte or other original on motion bva review.it stated 
the matter of attorney fees remains pending before the secretary by virtue of the fee agreement filed in this case.after notice to the appellant and intervenor,and an opportunity to be heard,that claim should be decided by the ro.the aggrieved party may then file a notice of disagreement and pursue an appeal to the board and this court if so desired our decision today does not decide the question of the effect of the termination of the relationship between mason and scates and leaves that question for decision at the initial administrative level.neither does the court express any view as to the reasonableness or excessiveness of the fee called for in this agreement since the facts surrounding such issues must be developed in the adjudication of the pending claim.the board decision is vacated for want of original jurisdiction to decide eligibility for direct payment of a withheld contingency fee under d,and the matter is remanded to the board with directions to dismiss the matter of fee eligibility as referred to the board by the ro.citations omitted.
mason contends that under his retainer agreement with scates,and because he played a significant role in the litigation of this case,he is entitled to the twenty percent of the benefits award that the regional office retained,even though scates terminated his appointment during the department proceedings.according to mason,only the ministerial act of paying him the withheld money remains to be done to complete the resolution of this attorney fee dispute.under mason analysis,there is therefore no occasion to remand this case to the regional office for further proceedings.
mason attorney fee claim can not be disposed of so simply and easily.
in the amended representation agreement,scates stated that i f there is a recovery of benefits,i agree to pay you a fee contingent upon the outcome of the matter or proceeding described in paragraph equal to twenty percent of the total amount of any va disability benefits awarded.read in isolation,this provision could be interpreted as entitling mason to that amount if benefits are recovered,without regard to how long mason employment continued or whether scates terminated mason employment during the administrative proceedings and retained a substitute representative who continued to handle the claim.
read in context and in the light of the statutory provisions governing the payment of attorney fees in veterans benefits cases,however,we conclude that implicit in this arrangement was the understanding that mason right to receive the full twenty percent of past due benefits would arise only if mason continued as scates attorney until the case was successfully completed.if,as here,the veteran terminated the lawyer services during the case and retained a substitute representative,the first lawyer fees would be based upon and fairly reflect that lawyer contribution to the case.
under d,when a claimant and an attorney have entered into a contingent fee agreement under which the total amount of the fee i is to be paid to the attorney by the secretary directly from any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim,
the total fee payable to the attorney may not exceed percent of the total amount of any past due benefits awarded on the basis of the claim.
the statute thus limits the total fee payable to an attorney to twenty percent of the past due benefits awarded.under mason theory,if the veteran terminated the attorney services in the middle of the case,the total twenty percent maximum fee would be due to the first attorney.it would then be,at best,extremely difficult for the vetera
