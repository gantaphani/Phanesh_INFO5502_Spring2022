code of civil procedure section provides that when a judgment awards attorney fees pursuant to a contract,the postjudgment attorney fees incurred by the judgment creditor in enforcing the judgment are included as recoverable costs.in this case,we are asked to consider whether attorney fees expended by a judgment creditor in successfully defending itself in a separate action filed against it by the judgment debtor,which had as its sole purpose the specific enforcement of an alleged agreement to settle the judgment debt at a substantial reduction,are attorney fees expended by the judgment creditor in enforcing the judgment.we conclude they are,and reverse the trial court postjudgment order taxing the judgment creditor postjudgment costs.
the underlying litigation and judgment for globalist 
in this case,globalist internet technologies,iron horse holdings,et,orange county superior court case hereafter globalist iron horse,globalist internet technologies,globalist successfully sued albert reda,seamless,a corporation formerly known as internet business international,and hereafter referred to as ibi,and iron horse holdings,iron horse,a company that held an ownership interest in ibi,for breach of contract and fraud arising out of the sale of two internet web sites by globalist to ibi and iron horse.the final judgment,entered in july,awarded globalist compensatory damages of against reda,ibi,and iron horse jointly and severally,and punitive damages of against reda and ibi.the judgment awarded globalist attorney fees of as authorized by the contract.
on may,we filed our first opinion in this case reversing the award of punitive damages against reda only,but otherwise affirming the judgment and awarding globalist its costs on appeal.globalist internet technologies,iron horse holdings,et may,wl nonpub.opn.hereafter globalist i.remittitur was issued on july.on march,the trial court amended the judgment in this case to include globalist attorney fees incurred on the appeal,and its attorney fees incurred through january,to enforce the judgment.
also on may,we filed a second opinion affirming a judgment in favor of soreena salari owner of globalist,and his attorneys,in a separate malicious prosecution action filed against them by reda reda salari et may,wl nonpub.opn,following a successful motion hereafter the slapp suit.we awarded salari and his attorneys their costs and attorney fees on that appeal 
while this case and the slapp suit were pending in the trial court,globalist filed a separate action in los angeles county superior court against some of reda business associates who were involved in the same business transactions underlying this case.globalist wilson et los angeles super.case no,hereafter the los angeles action.
settlement negotiations 
while the first appeal in this case and the slapp suit appeal were pending in this court,the litigants were also engaged in a global mediation of the entire dispute before retired judge william sheffield.the mediation apparently was prompted by the filing of the los angeles action,but the parties included reda and ibi,who were not parties to the los angeles action.
on february,a handwritten stipulation for settlement was signed by the parties to the mediation.among the outlined terms were that reda and ibi would pay globalist,another individual defendant in the los angeles action would pay globalist and would assist in selling three properties owned by iron horse the proceeds from which would go to globalist,and globalist would release all of its claims against all of the parties.but negotiations over the terms of the final settlement and release agreement broke down and a final agreement was not executed.
reda and ibi litigation efforts to enforce settlement 
reda and ibi then undertook a series of litigation actions to enforce the february,handwritten stipulation against globalist as concerned only themselves and the judgment in this case.on march,in the then still pending first appeal in this case globalist i,reda and ibi filed a motion in this court pursuant to section to enforce the settlement.we declined to consider the motion concluding that because there was already a final judgment,the statutory procedure was likely not appropriate.we also concluded the enforceability of the handwritten stipulation involved evidentiary determinations best made by the trial court.globalist i,supra,wl.
after remittitur issued in globalist i,reda and ibi filed a motion in the trial court under section to enforce settlement.in december,the trial court denied that motion,ruling because there was a final judgment in this case,there was no pending litigation to settle pursuant to that statutory procedure 
in january,reda and ibi filed a separate action against globalist for breach of contract seeking specific performance of the february,handwritten stipulation as to them.reda et globalist internet technologies,orange county super.case hereafter reda globalist.in the reda globalist complaint,reda and ibi alleged the february,handwritten stipulation constituted a settlement of this case,globalist iron horse,as to them.
reda,ibi and globalist stipulated to submit reda globalist to binding arbitration before judge sheffield.in a written arbitration award signed on april,judge sheffield ruled the february,handwritten stipulation was not an enforceable settlement agreement.not only had reda and ibi repudiated the terms of the stipulation when they subsequently lowered their settlement offer from to,but globalist would not be able to receive the full benefits of the agreement because as it turned out the iron horse properties that were to be sold for globalist benefit were too heavily fact that apparently had not been disclosed to globalist during negotiations.the arbitrator awarded globalist costs,but the award made no mention of globalist attorney fees which had not been requested by globalist in the arbitration.
the trial court denied reda and ibi subsequent motion to vacate the arbitrator award and granted globalist petition to confirm the award.on july,a judgment was entered in globalist favor in reda globalist.reda and ibi appealed,and we affirmed the judgment.reda et globalist internet technologies,july,wl nonpub.opn.
the order on appeal 
on september,globalist filed a memorandum of costs in the trial court in this case,globalist iron horse.it claimed an additional in attorney fees pursuant to section,which it asserted were incurred in enforcing the judgment since january.included in its cost bill was in attorney fees incurred by globalist in defending itself in reda globalist.the other attorney fees related to globalist efforts at registering the judgment in another state and its continued attempts to locate reda and ibi assets.
reda and ibi filed a motion to tax all of globalist additional attorney fees.the trial court denied globalist request for attorney fees incurred in defending reda globalist,but allowed the other attorney fees globalist sought.the trial court concluded attorney fees incurred in defending reda globalist,were not attorney fees incurred in enforcing the judgment in this case,globalist iron horse.in its minute order,the court noted that even though the alleged settlement encompassed this action,it arose out of a separate action filed by globalist,and reda and ibi were attempting to enforce a settlement reached in the other action.the court concluded attorney fees globalist incurred in defending reda and ibi separate specific performance action were not incurred in enforcing the judgment in this action and could not be recovered in this case.
discussion 
globalist contends the trial court erred by denying its claim for attorney fees incurred defending itself in reda globalist.we agree.
the usual standard of review for an award of attorney fees is abuse of discretion.connerly state personnel bd.cal th,d.but whether the trial court had the authority to award attorney fees is a legal issue which we review de novo ibid.
