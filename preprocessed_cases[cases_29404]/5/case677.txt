ford kennelly prevailed in a national futures association arbitration against several commodities brokers with whom kennelly had accounts and who,he alleged,ran boiler room operations that caused him to incur severe losses.those brokers then filed separate petitions to vacate in illinois state court and the northern district of illinois.kennelly sought,unsuccessfully but over a period of several months,to remove the state court case to federal court and while he was unsuccessful in getting the case into federal court he did persuade the district court to bar wolf,one of the commodities brokers,from seeking attorneys fees for his attempted removal.wolf now appeals that ruling.
for the following reasons,we conclude that clearly established law foreclosed kennelly attempts to remove the state court case to federal court and accordingly we reverse the district court minute order barring the petition for attorneys fees.
background 
ford kennelly,an indiana citizen,sued ken wolf,kjw his broker,lawrence spain another broker and the rosenthal collins group,llc rcg in a national futures association nfa arbitration.the arbitration panel found in kennelly favor,awarding him million in damages,with rcg and wolf jointly and severally liable for,plus interest.rcg filed a petition to vacate that award in the northern district of illinois,posting bond in the amount of the entire joint and several award pursuant to nfa rules before doing so.according to wolf,they also made demands on him to indemnify rcg under an agreement between rcg and kjw.wolf was not a party to rcg petition.
on march,wolf and kjw filed their own petition to vacate in cook county circuit court.wolf included in his state court petition a count for declaratory relief against rcg under illinois state law,seeking a declaration that rcg did not have a valid claim for indemnification.
kennelly responded by seeking to remove wolf petition to federal court.wolf counsel,in a letter sent to kennelly counsel,warned that rcg was an illinois citizen for purposes of jurisdiction and that b,the forum defendant rule,prevented removal to federal court.kennelly nonetheless sought to remove the case in a motion filed on april.to cure the removal problems presented by the forum defendant rule,kennelly asked the district court to realign rcg as a petitioner instead of a respondent according to their actual interests in the litigation.kennelly also claimed that wolf declaratory judgment action against rcg was premature because,if the arbitration award were vacated,there would be no need for a court to determine whether kjw and wolf are legally obligated to indemnify rcg.kennelly also expressed his concern that if the state case were not removed,there was a possibility of inconsistent decisions.
on may,wolf moved to remand.wolf argued that because rcg was a respondent,kennelly removal violated b forum defendant rule and that rcg had not consented to removal.wolf also opposed realignment as the petitioner in the illinois state court case.wolf motion opposing removal cited american motorists ins.trane,cir,which holds that realignment is only proper where there is no actual,substantial conflict between the parties that would justify placing them on opposite sides of the lawsuit.wolf emphasized in his motion that there was a live controversy with rcg over the issue of indemnification.kennelly opposed the motion to remand the case back to the illinois state court.
at a status conference on june,the district court appeared persuaded by kennelly opposition.the district court stated that it does seem to me that the real dispute here is between the party that prevailed at the arbitration and the parties that were found by the arbitrator to have violated kennelly rights.so with that understanding,i do think removal was proper.the district court said that it was concerned about wolf argument regarding a substantial dispute about indemnification but suggested that she saw another problem,that kennelly had not raised in his motion to remove,regarding whether complete justice can be done in the absence of the wolf and kjw parties in rcg federal case.however,rcg indicated its intention to dismiss its federal petition and litigate in state court if the district court remanded wolf case.wolf and rcg filed a supplemental brief restating that intention on july.
on august,kennelly argued that wolf declaratory judgment action against rcg should be severed and that the district court should regard that part of the case as a sham orchestrated by wolf and rcg jointly to keep kennelly out of federal court.the parties went through mediation without success.the district court held another hearing on september,in which the court signaled once again its intention to deny the motion for remand.two more months then elapsed.on november,the district court ordered wolf to respond to the arguments kennelly had raised in his august brief regarding severance of the indemnification issue.
at some point in late november or early december,it emerged that one of rcg limited partners was an indiana citizen.it thus now appeared that rcg could not be realigned as a petitioner because kennelly was an indiana citizen and placing the two on opposite sides would destroy the diversity of the suit.
on december,wolf submitted another brief arguing that american motorists still applied but that it did not matter whether the district court realigned rcg or not.as rcg stated,sending rcg an indiana resident to the plaintiff side against kennelly also an indiana resident would destroy diversity.wolf also cited case law holding that mere misjoinder of a defendant could not cure removal defects,as the standard was the much more imposing fraudulent joinder.wolf pointed out that even if misjoinder standards applied,there was no pending motion to sever rcg from the case.kennelly,in response to wolf,made such a motion to sever on january.
on february,the district court issued a memorandum granting the motion to remand.the district court first found that it must remand if rcg was a respondent in the case.as the district court stated,since jurisdiction did not rest on a federal question,under b the case was removable only if none of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the state in which such action is brought.rcg was a citizen of illinois,so this criterion was not met.the district court also found that removal was improper,assuming rcg as a respondent,because courts have interpreted the statutory language providing for removal by the defendant or the defendants,a,as requiring that all defendants consent to removal.rcg was not willing to consent to removal.next,the district court explained that rcg realignment as a petitioner was not possible because it would destroy diversity between the parties.the district court also stated that,even if rcg was not a resident of indiana,realignment would not be proper because of the substantial controversy between wolf and rcg regarding indemnification.finally,the district court held that severance of the indemnification dispute was not proper without a showing of fraudulent misjoinder or procedural misjoinder,neither of which kennelly could prove.accordingly,the district court remanded the case back to state court.
wolf then tried to recover attorneys fees for kennelly attempted removal.wolf mailed kennelly an offer to confer along with detailed invoices.receiving no response from kennelly,wolf moved the district court for instructions to set a schedule for conferring under local rule b.kennelly to bar wolf from filing any motion for fees and costs.
the district court held a status conference on april.the district court granted kennelly to bar wolf from filing for fees and costs,stating 
without reaching that question,i do think even if we were to view fee shifting as the norm,i think this case is exceptional.it not one where removal was clear.had that was clearly improper.had that been the case,it would certainly not have taken me months to resolve the dispute that i think was an unfortunately costly one for both sides.
i am not inclined to shift fees in this case.so my instructions wou
