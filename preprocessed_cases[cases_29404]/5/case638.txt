the government first contends that the award of attorney fees and costs was unjustified because the district court found that only some of the counts were vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith,as opposed to a finding that the government prosecution of the case was generally vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith.in partially granting heavrin motion,the district court held that counts,and were frivolous,but that count was not frivolous.counts,and through were charges,and were derivative of the substantive counts.if certain substantive counts were frivolous,presumably so were their corresponding derivative counts.
