eric selten appeals from the summary judgment entered against him on his against junho hyon.the trial court granted summary judgment on the ground that all of selten claims were based upon a contract that was illegal in part,and that the illegal portions of the contract could not be severed.we agree that the contract was illegal in part and that the illegal portions can not be severed,but we conclude that selten should nonetheless be permitted to pursue his common count for the reasonable value of any lawful services rendered.we therefore reverse in part.
background 
this appeal concerns a fee dispute arising out of litigation commenced in regarding the rights of hyon and his business associate,laurence colangelo,in a operation on decker island in the sacramento river.the trial court originally dismissed hyon and colangelo suit,but the court of appeal reversed the judgment of dismissal in.unhappy with their trial counsel,hyon and colangelo began looking for a replacement.
in,hyon and colangelo entered into a contract with national legal network nln,of which selten was then president.the express purpose of the contract was for nln to act as hyon and colangelo agent,consultant,and case manager with regard to the decker island litigation.the contract authorized nln to retain counsel for hyon and colangelo and to provide other litigation support services,such as facilitating communication among hyon,colangelo,and counsel.in,nln assigned all rights,title and interest and all the remaining and executory obligations under the contract to selten.
the contract provided that if nln was unsuccessful in arranging for new counsel to represent hyon and colangelo in the decker island litigation,then nln shall not be entitled to compensation under this agreement.if nln did succeed in retaining new counsel for hyon and colangelo and performed the other services called for by the contract,nln would receive a contingent fee of percent of any recovery in the decker island litigation.in,the parties agreed to increase the contingent fee to percent.
nln did succeed in retaining eliot disner of erwin cohen jessup to represent hyon and colangelo in the litigation.disner firm also brought in jeffrey kirk as local counsel to assist with the case.a jury returned a million verdict in favor of hyon and colangelo,but the trial court granted a defense motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,leading to another appeal.
hyon and colangelo retained new appellate counsel,elliot bien,and again prevailed on appeal.disner,who had been working on a contingency basis,refused to handle the retrial,so hyon and colangelo retained maxwell blecher as their new trial counsel.the relationship between hyon,colangelo,and blecher quickly soured,however,and blecher too withdrew.hyon and colangelo next retained jeffrey shopoff of jeffer,mangels,butler marmaro.shopoff later left jeffer mangels but continued to represent hyon and colangelo in the decker island litigation.
shopoff retried the case and won a million verdict for hyon and colangelo.on october,he negotiated a settlement of the litigation 
further disputes quickly erupted between hyon and colangelo concerning their respective interests in the recovery under the settlement.philip putnam of monteleone mccrory was retained to assist in resolving those disputes,but with little success.on september,hyon filed suit against his erstwhile allies.hyon second amended complaint named selten,colangelo,putnam,and others as defendants,and it alleged separate claims for relief including breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,legal malpractice,and various fraud theories.
selten against hyon,colangelo,and others.his first amended alleged claims for breach of partnership agreement,breach of fiduciary duty,and fraud,as well as common counts for the agreed price or,alternatively,the reasonable value of work,labor,and services rendered.
hyon moved for summary judgment on selten first amended.hyon argued that all of selten claims were based on the contract the contract called for selten to engage in the unauthorized practice of law and to provide attorney referral services that are unlawful under business and professions code section hereafter section,which requires an individual or entity providing such services to be registered with the state bar and to meet certain other requirements pursuant to the contract,selten did in fact engage in the unauthorized practice of law and did provide unlawful attorney referral services and the contract is therefore illegal and unenforceable.
in opposition to the motion,selten argued that the contract did not call for,and he did not in fact engage in,the unauthorized practice of law.he introduced declarations from attorneys disner,kirk,bien,and shopoff,among others.those four attorneys stated that they never witnessed selten engaging in the unauthorized practice of law and that all legal work was performed by them or under their supervision or control,without selten interference.selten also argued that his business,nln,did not constitute an attorney referral service within the meaning of section.but selten did not dispute hyon contention that neither selten nor nln was registered with the state bar as an attorney referral service.finally,in his declaration,selten stated that from the time he entered into the contract until the decker island litigation settled in,he spent approximately hours working for hyon and colangelo pursuant to the contract.
the trial court granted hyon motion on the ground that the contract called for,and selten did in fact provide,unlawful attorney referral services.the court further reasoned that the unlawful provisions of the contract could not be severed because the contract provided for a single consideration,namely,the contingent fee,in exchange for all of selten services,including attorney referrals.the court therefore concluded that the entire contract was unenforceable.the court further determined that because all of selten claims required proof of the unlawful contract and the consideration purportedly due under it,hyon was entitled to judgment in his favor on selten entire first amended.the court did not reach the issue of the unauthorized practice of law.
selten filed a motion for new trial,challenging the summary judgment ruling.the trial court denied the motion.hyon legal claims were tried to a jury,and the remaining equitable issues were briefed and argued to the court.the court entered judgment on november,resolving all causes of action as to all parties.hyon recovered nothing on his complaint.selten timely appealed from the judgment,challenging only the ruling on the motion for summary judgment on his first amended.
standard of review 
because selten appeal from the judgment challenges the trial court ruling on hyon motion for summary judgment on selten first amended,we independently examine the record in order to determine whether triable issues of fact exist to reinstate the action.wiener southcoast childcare centers,cal th,d.
discussion 
i.the contract is illegal and unenforceable 
subdivision a of section provides an individual,partnership,corporation,association,or any other entity shall not operate for the direct or indirect purpose,in whole or in part,of referring potential clients to attorneys,and no attorney shall accept a referral of such potential clients,unless the individual or entity meets all of the requirements of the statute,including registration with the state bar.there is no case law interpreting that provision.
the contract called for nln to retain counsel to represent hyon and colangelo.the contract provided that nln would not be entitled to any compensation unless nln did succeed in recruiting counsel for hyon and colangelo.the contract further provided that nln would be entitled to compensation if nln did recruit counsel for hyon and colangelo and perform the other services called for under the contract.it follows as a matter of law that,under the contract,hyon and colangelo were paying nln,in part,to refer them to an attorney.
selten does not dispute that nln recruited counsel for hyon and colangelo by introducing them to disner.indeed,sel
