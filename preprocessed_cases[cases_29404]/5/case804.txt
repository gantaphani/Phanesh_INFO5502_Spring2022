ii.discussion 
breach of guarantee claim 
the shafes argue the district court erred in granting summary judgment on cardinal breach of guarantee claim because the district court improperly stated and applied missouri law,misstated the facts and wrongly interpreted the guarantee to demonstrate unambiguously the shafes intent to be personally bound,and erroneously found the guarantee was supported by consideration for cyrus preexisting debt of.we review de novo a district court grant of summary judgment,as well as its interpretation of state law and the terms of a contract.ace,int l broth.of elect.workers,cir citation omitted.
interpretation of missouri law 
the shafes first urge this court to reverse the district court grant of summary judgment because the district court improperly relied upon dicta from standard meat taco kid of springfield,to create a rule of strict liability in missouri law that a signatory who signs a guarantee as a principal has unambiguously signed the guarantee in his or her personal capacity.the shafes contend the district court interpretation was erroneous because missouri law does not have a rule of strict liability,but rather requires a court to analyze an individual intent to be personally bound by a guarantee.the shafes argue the district court interpretation of missouri law was an error of law which,by definition,constituted an abuse of discretion and requires reversal.
the shafes argument regarding the district court interpretation of taco kid is misplaced.on de novo review,we interpret missouri law independent of the district court,see ace,at,and can affirm the district court grant of summary judgment based upon any reason supported in the record,see christoffersen yellow book usa,cir.we therefore address,under our own interpretation of missouri law,whether the district court properly found there was no genuine issue of material fact regarding the shafes personal liability under the guarantee.
