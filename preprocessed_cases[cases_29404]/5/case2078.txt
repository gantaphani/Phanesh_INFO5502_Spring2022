in this case we must decide whether a party moving to expunge an improperly recorded lis pendens is entitled to attorney fees as a prevailing party under code of civil procedure section when the lis pendens is withdrawn before a ruling on the motion.we conclude that the withdrawal of a lis pendens while a motion to expunge is pending does not automatically preclude recovery of attorney fees to the moving party.rather,we adopt a practical approach to determine the prevailing party based on the trial court determination of which party realized its objectives in the proceeding.such a determination requires the trial court to consider the merits of the motion and whether the lis pendens claimant acted with substantial justification in withdrawing the lis pendens,or whether,in light of all of the circumstances,the imposition of fees would otherwise be unjust.
the record reveals that the trial court believed it could not award attorney fees to petitioner alexandra and edith castro collectively,the castros under section when real parties in interest california savings,the sterling family trust,sterling,as a trustee of the sterling family trust,and sterling,as an individual and trustee of the sterling family trust collectively,the sterlings,had withdrawn the lis pendens before a ruling on the castros motion to expunge.we granted the castros writ petition to address the recoverability of attorney fees in such circumstances.we reject the inflexible rule applied by the trial court and instead adopt the practical approach described herein 
factual and procedural background 
this attorney fees dispute arises from litigation involving a million residence in beverly hills the property in which the castros hold title of record.the castros claim the property was a gift,while the sterlings claim it was a business investment between the parties to acquire,renovate,and market the property 
the sterlings filed a lawsuit against the castros to restore title to the property because the complaint asserted a real property claim,the sterlings also filed a notice of pendency of action or lis pendens.three months later,after filing a first amended complaint,the sterlings filed a second lis pendens on the property 
the castros filed a motion to expunge the first lis pendens first motion,alternatively claiming the lis pendens was improperly recorded because the amended complaint did not allege a real property claim,and the sterlings could not establish the probable validity of any real property claim.the trial court denied this initial motion on both grounds.first,it concluded that the sterlings amended complaint sought to quiet title in the property,which required recording a lis pendens,subd.b.second,the trial court concluded that the lis pendens was properly recorded because the sterlings appeared to have asserted a real property claim.the trial court denied the castros motion for reconsideration.
after conducting further discovery,the castros filed a motion to expunge the second lis pendens and any other lis pendens recorded on the property based on probable validity grounds second motion.in this second motion,the castros submitted additional documentary evidence and excerpts of the sterling parties depositions.the additional evidence supported the castros contention that the property had been a gift,not a business investment.the castros counsel submitted a declaration stating that the additional evidence had been obtained to attack the sterling parties declarations filed to oppose the first motion.
before the hearing on the second motion,the sterlings withdrew the second lis pendens recorded on the property.in its brief notifying the court of the withdrawal,the sterlings stated that they withdrew the lis pendens because they were unable to complete meaningful discovery to oppose the second motion.
at the hearing on the second motion,the castros informed the court that the sterlings had only withdrawn one of the lis pendens.the sterlings then agreed to withdraw the earlier recorded lis pendens.the sterlings counsel,who recorded the first lis pendens,represented to the court that the first lis pendens had not been withdrawn because of an oversight involving substitution of counsel.since the sterlings had agreed to withdraw the lis pendens,the trial court postponed ruling on the castros request for more than in attorney fees incurred in connection with filing the second motion.
one month later,the sterlings recorded a third lis pendens on the property which the castros moved to expunge third motion.the case had been reassigned and a different trial court heard and granted the third motion,awarding the castros fees as the prevailing party.
the new trial court also heard and denied the castros request for in attorney fees incurred in bringing the second motion,concluding that the castros were not the prevailing party under section.the trial court reasoned that,based on the statute,the sterlings could withdraw the lis pendens prior to a court order expunging the lis pendens without incurring any obligation for statutory attorney fees and costs 
the castros filed the pending petition for a writ of mandate challenging the trial court order denying their attorney fees incurred in bringing the second motion.they asked that we vacate the order and direct the trial court to grant their motion for attorney fees under section.we issued an order to show cause to address an issue of continuing interest whether a party moving to expunge an improperly recorded lis pendens is entitled to attorney fees as the prevailing party under section when the lis pendens is withdrawn before a ruling on the motion 
contentions 
the castros contend that the trial court erred in concluding that it could not award them attorney fees under section as the prevailing party on their second motion because the lis pendens had been withdrawn before there was a ruling on that motion.they contend that the trial court should have used a practical approach to determine whether they were the prevailing party based on which party realized its objectives in the proceedings.
discussion 
standard of review 
the sterlings correctly point out that the propriety or amount of an attorney fees award is reviewed using the abuse of discretion standard.see,gilbert national enquirer,th,d.nevertheless,the interpretation of the term prevailing party under section is a question of statutory construction that we review de novo.carver chevron,th,d.
a party prevailing on a motion to expunge a lis pendens is entitled to attorney fees 
a property owner can remove an improperly recorded lis pendens by bringing a motion to expunge,as the castros did here,on the ground that the lis pendens claimant has not established by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property claim.
under section,a prevailing party on a motion to expunge a lis pendens is entitled to recover attorney fees.the statute provides the court shall direct that the party prevailing on any motion under this chapter be awarded the reasonable attorney fees and costs of making or opposing the motion unless the court finds that the other party acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of attorney fees and costs unjust,italics added.
the attorney fees provision in the lis pendens statutes originally was enacted to control misuse of the lis pendens procedure.trapasso superior court d.in,section was revised to make an award of attorney fees mandatory unless the court found that the other party acted with substantial justification,or the imposition of fees and costs would be unjust.see code,west civ.proc.supp.foll.the statute,however,does not define prevailing party.moreover,we have found no case,nor have the parties cited a case,that has determined the meaning of prevailing party under section when a lis pendens has been withdrawn prior to a ruling on a motion to expunge.
the practical approach to determine prevailing party 
because section does not define prevailing party,the castros ask that we reject a rigid interpretation of that term and instead determine prevailing party based on which party succeeded on a practical level.heather farms homeowners robinson th,d.this practical approach has been adopted to determine the prevailing party for purposes of awarding attorney fees in a pretrial voluntary dismissal case asserting tort claims when the contractual term prevailing party was undefined santisas goodin cal th,d,santisas and when,as here,an attorney fees statute does not define prevailing party galan wolfriver holding th,d gilbert national enquirer,supra,th at,d heather farms,supra,at,d see also damian tamondong th,d the practical approach also has been applied to determine the prevailing party for purposes of awarding attorney fees on a special motion to strike under the slapp statute strategic lawsuit against public participation,subd.c,when the complaint is dismissed before a ruling on the motion.coltrain shewalter th,d coltrain.
a.the practical approach to construe prevailing party has been applied in pretrial voluntary dismissal cases 
under the practical approach,the court determines the prevailing party by analyzing which party realized its litigation objectives.in santisas,supra,cal th,d,our supreme court adopted this approach when considering a request by the defendants for attorney fees under a contractual attorney fees provision following the voluntary dismissal of the plaintiffs complaint.the santisas plaintiffs asserted both contract and tort causes of action,arising from alleged defects in a home they purchased from the goodins.id.at,d.the real estate purchase agreement contained an attorney fees clause that entitled the prevailing party to recover attorney fees in any legal action arising out of the execution of the agreement.ibid.after conducting discovery,the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the action with prejudice.pursuant to the agreement,the defendants moved to recover attorney fees.the trial court awarded attorney fees,and the court of appeal affirmed.id.at,d.
the santisas court concluded that while the defendants could not be the prevailing party on the contract claims under civil code section,the defendants could be the prevailing parties on the tort claims under the agreement and under sections and,subdivision a.santisas,supra,cal th at,d.while recognizing that attorney fees should not be awarded automatically,the santisas court rejected an inflexible rule denying contractual attorney fees on tort or noncontract claims in all voluntary pretrial dismissal cases.id.at,d.rather,a court may determine whether there is a prevailing party,and if so which party meets that definition,by examining the terms of the contract at issue if,as here,the contract allows the prevailing party to recover attorney fees but does not define prevailing party or expressly either authorize or bar recovery of attorney fees in the event an action is dismissed,a court may base its attorney fees decision on a pragmatic definition of the extent to which each party has realized its litigation objectives,whether by judgment,settlement,or otherwise.citation.id.at,d.in assessing litigation success,hsu abbara cal th,d,instructs c ourts should respect substance rather than form,and to this extent should be guided by equitable considerations.for example,a party who is denied direct relief on a claim may nonetheless be found to be a prevailing party if it is clear that the party has otherwise achieved its main litigation objective.citations.
courts construing statutes that contain attorney fees provisions that do not define the term prevailing party,also have adopted this practical approach to determine the recoverability of attorney fees in pretrial voluntary dismissal cases.see,galan wolfriver holding,supra,th at,d civil code,section action against a landlord for substandard housing,which entitled the prevailing party to attorney fees gilbert national enquirer,supra,th at,d commercial appropriation action based on civil code,section,subdivision a,which provides that the prevailing party shall be entitled to attorney fees and costs heather farms homeowners robinson,supra,th at,d civil code section,subdivision f,which provides that in an action to enforce condominium conditions,covenants,and restrictions,the prevailing party shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs.in these cases,like santisas,the determination to award attorney fees was based on whether the party seeking attorney fees had achieved its main litigation objective.galan,supra,at,d gilbert,supra,at,d heather farms,supra,at,d.
coltrain adopted the practical approach to construe prevailing party following the dismissal of an action while a special motion to strike was pending 
coltrain,supra,th,d,adopted the practical approach to determine the recoverability of attorney fees under the slapp statute when the plaintiffs dismissed their lawsuit while a special motion to strike was pending.in that case,the coltrains filed a complaint in superior court against their neighbors.id.at,d.the neighbors had filed a nuisance abatement action in small claims court against the coltrains.the neighbors contended that the coltrains action was a slapp suit and filed a special motion to strike the coltrains complaint.id.at,d.while the motion was pending,the coltrains voluntarily dismissed their complaint.the neighbors,however,sought to recover their attorney fees incurred in connection with the filing of their special motion to strike.ibid.the trial court awarded the neighbors their attorney fees.the trial court reasoned that the term prevailing party as used in section,subdivision c,did not require a judicial determination that the neighbors had succeeded on the motion.instead,the trial court imported the definition of prevailing party from section,subdivision a,and concluded that because the coltrains dismissed their lawsuit,the neighbors were the prevailing party.id.at,d.
the coltrain court concluded that the trial court had reached the correct result,but did so on a different analytical basis.it rejected the trial court reliance on section,subdivision a,and instead adopted a practical approach to determine the prevailing party on the special motion to strike.under this approach,the trial court has discretion to determine whether the defendant is the prevailing party for purposes of attorney fees under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c.coltrain,supra,th at,d.consistent with santisas,supra,cal th at,d,the coltrain court reasoned that i n making that determination,the critical issue is which party realized its objectives in the litigation.since the defendant goal is to make the plaintiff go away with its tail between its legs,ordinarily the prevailing party will be the defendant.the plaintiff,however,may try to show it actually dismissed because it had substantially achieved its goals through a settlement or other means,because the defendant was insolvent,or for other reasons unrelated to the probability of success on the merits.coltrain,supra,at,d.the court recognized that regardless of whether the action is a slapp suit or not,the plaintiff may have good faith reasons for the dismissal that have nothing to do with oppressing the defendant or avoiding liability for attorney fees.ibid.
in liu moore th,d,we rejected any suggestion that coltrain,supra,th at,d,created a presumption that when an action is dismissed,the defendant and moving party on a motion to strike under section,is the prevailing party.instead,we concluded that notwithstanding the dismissal of the action,in order to award fees to the defendant,the trial court must determine the merits of the pending motion to strike and conclude that the plaintiff action was a slapp suit.liu,supra,at,d.thereafter,the trial court could consider any evidence to show a good faith reason for dismissal.to hold otherwise,we reasoned,would have depriv ed a true slapp defendant of statutorily authorized fees,or entitl ed a defendant to such relief in a action which was dismissed by the plaintiff for entirely legitimate reasons.id.at,d see also pfeiffer venice properties bernard th,d.
we recognize,as did the coltrain court,that the dismissal of a complaint after the filing of a special motion to strike is akin to a pretrial voluntary dis
