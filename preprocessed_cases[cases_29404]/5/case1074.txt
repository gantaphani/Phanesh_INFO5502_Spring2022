we are called on to decide whether attorney misconduct towards clients,involving violations of rules of professional conduct binding on the attorney,requires forfeiture of the attorneys fees paid to them when,after all righteous furor is vented,the fees were eminently reasonable for the result produced.
jeffrey and amy bertelsen,their company bertelsen food gas,and jeffrey bertelsen parents richard and janice jo bertelsen appellants,appeal the district court judgment after a bench trial in favor of appellants former attorney roger harris and his law firm appellees on appellants breach of fiduciary duty claims.
appellants claimed harris and his firm violated washington rule of professional conduct rpc a by agreeing to share legal fees with a nonlawyer failed to comply with washington law when they modified their legal fee agreements during the course of representation overcharged appellants by miscalculating their contingency fee and failed to comply with rpc c requirement that at the conclusion of a contingency fee matter,the attorney provide his client with a written statement showing the method of contingency fee calculation and failed fully to inform appellants of conflicts of interest in their joint representation and obtain written waivers of the conflicts.
appellants sought disgorgement of in fees they paid harris,his firm,and harris consultant.the district court determined that,even assuming harris and his firm breached the fiduciary duties to their clients imposed by the rules of professional conduct for attorneys,the circumstances of this case did not warrant an equitable award of disgorgement of fees.
this case does not call upon us to determine whether appellees breached their fiduciary duty to their clients as a matter of washington state law.nor is this occasion to express opprobrium at an attorney failure to abide by the rules of professional responsibility in representing his clients.rather,our task is a limited one we must decide whether the district court abused its discretion when it declined to award disgorgement of fees.we hold there was no abuse of discretion.
in the,jeffrey and amy bertelsen owned six gas stations,which they operated through the bertelsen food and gas,bfg,a washington corporation.bfg operated the gas stations under the arco brand.bfg ceased operations in december,because it had no money to pay arco for gasoline or to pay other vendors for other products.on january,arco sent bfg a notice of termination.the notice stated arco intent to terminate its franchise agreements with bfg in days on april.
jeffrey and amy bertelsen retained attorney bill hames for advice on filing for bankruptcy for the bertelsens individually and for bfg.hames advised the bertelsens to speak with an attorney with experience in the gas franchise industry.in lieu of immediately filing for bankruptcy,hames and jeffrey bertelsen contacted roger harris,an oregon attorney who had gas franchise industry experience jeffrey bertelsen sought harris assistance to try to resurrect bfg relationship with arco,so bfg could get gas from arco again and continue to use the arco brand name.on march,hames called harris to discuss bfg and the arco termination notice.on march,harris contacted ronald mcpherson,a client of harris who has expertise in the gasoline franchise industry,and asked him to consult on the bfg matter.
a.the march,retainer agreement 
in march,jeffrey and amy bertelsen signed a retainer agreement the march agreement with harris and his firm,harris berne christensen llp.the agreement stated the bertelsens,for and on behalf of bfg,retained harris and his firm as attorneys for the purpose of representing and handling any and all legal matters on behalf of bfg which may,from time to time,be requested.you have specifically requested that we work to negotiate a resolution of the arco franchise terminations and related issues.the agreement also stated bfg would pay the firm on an hourly basis,at its rates of for attorneys.the agreement also required bfg to pay a retainer,which the bertelsens paid on or about april.
jeffrey and amy bertelsen received detailed bills describing services rendered between march and may,with a breakdown of time spent and hourly rates,from harris firm.they paid these bills without objection nor do they claim any breach of fiduciary duty with respect to those bills.
during spring,it became clear arco had no interest in continuing a business relationship with bfg and did not intend to rescind the notice of termination.indeed,arco filed an action against bfg in august for money due under loan agreements with bfg.the bertelsens decided they would try to sell the six gas stations as a business solution,to avoid bankruptcy.in may,jeffrey and amy bertelsen asked harris and mcpherson the industry consultant to seek a buyer for the stations.
b.the may,corporate resolution 
by may,however,jeffrey and amy bertelsen did not have money to pay hourly attorney or consulting fees.they asked harris and mcpherson if they would work on a contingency fee basis harris and mcpherson agreed.
harris then drafted a terms of engagement pursuant to corporate resolution authorization and limited power of attorney,which jeffrey and amy bertelsen signed on may,on behalf of bfg.the resolution stated bfg retained the services of mcpherson and harris for days,expiring august.the resolution further stated harris and mcpherson will be reimbursed for their services associated with the undertaking at the rate of of the gross value of any transaction s entered into with third parties plus full reimbursement of all expenses incurred by harris and mcpherson.the resolution also stated the bertelsens could terminate the agreement,and harris and mcpherson would be entitled to compensation for work performed at their hourly rates of and,respectively.harris and mcpherson agreed to split the contingency fee evenly between themselves 
c.the september,corporate resolution 
during the term of the may corporate resolution,no buyer for the gas stations was found.as early as july,however,tesoro petroleum had expressed interest in doing a deal with bfg,but no offer had come to fruition.at the time of the expiration of the may corporate resolution on august,jeffrey and amy bertelsen wanted to sign a new contingency fee agreement with harris and mcpherson to continue to try to sell the gas stations.harris discussed with jeffrey and amy bertelsen the fact the new agreement would be based on a contingency up from.
on september,jeffrey and amy bertelsen,on behalf of bfg,signed a revised corporate resolution and limited power of attorney.the term of the agreement was for one year and stated harris and mcpherson would receive of the gross value of any transaction s entered into with third parties plus full reimbursement of all expenses.like the may corporate resolution,the september corporate resolution stated the bertelsens could terminate the agreement and harris and mcpherson would be entitled to compensation at their hourly rates of and,respectively.
d.the tesoro transaction 
at some point,tesoro agreed to enter into a to buy agreement with bfg.on september,the day after the bertelsens signed the september corporate resolution,harris faxed to tesoro executed signature pages of the agreement to lease.tesoro agreed to lease bfg six gas stations for ten years,for more than per month it also paid million for an option to purchase the gas stations for million.tesoro never exercised the option.
the transaction closed on october.harris determined the contingency fee under the agreement would be,which he calculated by taking of million tesoro paid for the option plus the million option price even though tesoro never exercised the option.jeffrey and amy bertelsen received correspondence from harris prior to the october,closing that showed this contingency fee.at the october,closing,jeffrey and amy bertelsen did not object to the fee.the bertelsens do not claim they were afraid the tesoro transaction would not go forward if they did not agree to the contingency fee or if they had not agreed to the terms of either of the may or september corporate resolutions.
the invoice harris firm sent to bfg described the services billed as services rendered from june,through october,pursuant to that limited power of attorney and terms of engagement as revised and extended,including services rendered by consultant,ron mcpherson.the space under the heading on the invoice for hours was blank.under amount,the invoice simply stated.the invoice did not explain how the amount of the contingency fee was calculated nevertheless,the bertelsens paid the fee.
harris firm paid mcpherson as his part of the fee.harris received.jeffrey bertelsen testified he did not feel that mcpherson did anything improper and that mcpherson earned his of this payment.
written records showing the exact number of hours harris spent on marketing and putting together the gas station transaction no longer exist.harris testified he recalled that,during the period from may,to october,he spent approximately hours on the matter.based on his hourly rate of,his fee on an hourly basis would have been at least than his half of the contingency fee.
e.the arco litigation 
on august,arco filed an action in washington state court against bfg,jeffrey and amy bertelsen,and and bertelsen jeffrey bertelsen parents.arco claimed the bertelsens and bfg defaulted on loan agreements.arco further claimed the loans were personally guaranteed by jeffrey and amy bertelsen,as well as by and bertelsen.at the time the action was filed,none of the bertelsens recalled and bertelsen as having personally guaranteed the loans.
bertelsen knew harris was representing his son in the arco lawsuit.after he was served with arco complaint,bertelsen contacted harris and set up a meeting in september.prior to the meeting,harris sent a letter dated august,to and bertelsen enclosing documents that arco counsel provided to harris that purport ed to be personal guarantee agreements signed by and bertelsen.harris stated he had some question about the validity of these signatures.
at the september meeting,harris discussed potential conflicts that could arise in representing all the bertelsens and suggested to and bertelsen that they confer with their own counsel to evaluate whether they should be separately represented.during the meeting,harris explained the possible conflict that might arise in the future if the bertelsen family clients did not agree upon a trial strategy or began finger pointing at one another.harris did not recall whether he discussed with the bertelsens the potential conflict of interest between and bertelsen as guarantors,and jeffrey and amy bertelsen as debtors.
after the meeting,harris sent and bertelsen a letter dated september,to confirm the substance of their meeting.harris noted his firm had been retained to defend the interests of and bertelsen,as well as jeffrey and amy bertelsen and bfg.he further stated we understand those interests to be,in large part,identical and i understand that you have waived any conflict that may arise.at this point in time i am not aware of any such conflict,and have so informed you.
the letter enclosed the firm retainer agreement,which and bertelsen signed and returned.
f.the october,waiver 
on october,harris sent another letter to and bertelsen.in the letter,harris stated we are agreed,following extended discussion and full disclosure,that there is no conflict of interest and that all parties will proceed in an effort to fully defend against the allegations and the claims made by arco and will assert all affirmative defenses,offsets,discounts and counterclaims that might be available to any and all parties in that litigation.the harris letter also noted and bertelsen agreed to assume the obligation of paying for the litigation,because jeffrey and amy bertelsen and bfg lacked the resources to do so.
the harris letter then discussed the tesoro transaction and a potential conflict of interest created by requirements tesoro was imposing.tesoro required and bertelsen to reconvey the deeds of trust they had against the six gas station properties to reduce the amount of debt of record.tesoro also required and bertelsen,along with all secured lenders,to execute a and attornment agreement.the harris letter explained 
these requirements,imposed by tesoro,create a potential conflict of interest between our representation of jeff and amy bertelsen and bfg and you,and bertelsen in connection with the proposed transaction.jeff and amy bertelsen and bfg desire that you execute the deeds of reconveyance and agreement,pursuant to tesoro agreement to lease.therefore,we recommend that you seek new and separate legal counsel with respect to this matter in order to determine your rights,remedies and obligations under the proposed transaction with tesoro.
in consideration for and bertelsen compliance with tesoro requirements,jeffrey and amy bertelsen agreed,among other things,to assume all defense costs in connection with the ongoing arco litigation against all bertelsens,indemnify and bertelsen against any judgment against them by arco,and assume payments on a loan secured by bertelsen.
finally,in the letter,harris stated that,if and bertelsen chose to proceed to discuss the matter with him without the benefit of new legal counsel,he required them to sign an attached waiver.the waiver stated we,separately and as husband and wife,hereby waive any and all conflict of interest as to the representation of harris berne christensen llp for and in connection with the proposed transaction under the agreement to lease,by and between tesoro west coast petroleum company and jeff and amy bertelsen and bfg.
and bertelsen signed the waiver on october,and did not seek independent counsel.jeffrey and amy bertelsen were not asked to sign this conflict waiver.
g.the october,letter 
on october,harris sent a letter to jeffrey and amy bertelsen,and and bertelsen.the letter summarize d,describe d and memorialize d the parties resolution and understanding of the disposition of the various debts,liens against real property and financing of the ongoing litigation with arco,and stated the parties acknowledge d the rights and obligations pursuant to the tesoro lease agreement.the letter set forth the agreement among the bertelsens under the terms of the october,waiver letter.
the final paragraph of the letter stated i ask that each of you review this document and if consistent with your understanding of the arrangements made,please execute as shown below you have been previously advised and it is again recommended that you seek separate legal counsel in connection with this matter in order to be fully advised with respect to your rights,remedies and obligations herein.on october,and bertelsen signed the agreement on october,jeffrey and amy bertelsen signed the agreement.the document does not discuss any potential or actual conflict of interest created by harris representation of the parties in entering into the terms of the agreement outlined in the letter.
throughout the arco litigation,neither jeffrey bertelsen nor bertelsen thought harris failed to render effective legal representation or behaved in any manner detrimental to any of the bertelsens because of harris joint representation of them.no party challenged the amount of fees and costs billed in the invoices harris sent to the bertelsens.and bertelsen paid a total of in fees and costs to harris for the arco litigation,of which jeffrey and amy bertelsen reimbursed to and bertelsen.and bertelsen seek disgorgement of the remaining from appellees in the instant action.
events in september and october led harris to conclude he must withdraw from representing all the bertelsens.first,in september,amy bertelsen told harris that jeffrey bertelsen had paid a vendor a kickback for generating a false invoice,which jeffrey bertelsen somehow used to obtain approximately of funding from arco for work he never intended to be done then,in october,during settlement negotiations with arco,the bertelsens began taking conflicting positions with respect to settlement.jeffrey and amy bertelsen claimed they had no cash to contribute to a settlement with arco,while bertelsen was not willing to contribute enough money out of his own pocket to fund the settlement.further,amy bertelsen wanted to be relieved of the indemnity agreements jeffrey bertelsen and she had signed indemnifying and bertelsen for any losses which their guarantees might occasion.
after these events,consultation with the oregon state bar association and ethics he must withdraw as counsel as to all four of the bertelsens,and so informed them.harris advised the bertelsens to seek new counsel.ultimately,all four bertelsens settled with bertelsen dealt directly with arco,while bertelsen retained an attorney to review the settlement agreement.pursuant to the settlement agreement,and bertelsen paid arco,while jeffrey and amy paid arco 
on december,appellants filed a complaint against harris and his law firm in federal district court invoking diversity of citizenship jurisdiction.appellants claimed appellees breached their fiduciary duties when they violated various sections of the washington rules of professional conduct rpc appellants sought disgorgement of attorneys fees paid to harris,plus interest and their own attorneys fees.
after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment in appellee attorneys favor and dismissed appellants claims.the court issued an oral ruling,which it then supplemented with findings of fact and conclusions of law.the court found as follows.
claims relating to the may and september corporate resolutions contingency fee agreement 
appellants claim harris and his firm breached their fiduciary duty by entering into the may and september corporate resolutions under which harris and mcpherson would share the contingency fee.they claim the agreement violated rpc a,which prohibits a lawyer or law firm from sharing legal fees with a nonlawyer the district court made no finding as to whether the may and september agreements violated rpc a.
improper modification of the fee agreement 
appellants also claimed the may corporate resolution,which provided for a contingency fee,was a modification of the hourly fee agreement in the march retainer agreement,and this modification did not comply with washington law the district court found the may corporate resolution was not a modification of the fee agreement in the march hourly retainer agreement the court further held even if either the may or the september corporate resolutions modified the march hourly fee agreement,harris did not breach his fiduciary duty by modifying the agreement to provide for a contingency fee the agreements complied with washington law because they were fair and reasonable,made after full disclosure and free of undue influence based on the standards set out in ward richards rossano.
contingency fee and failure to set forth the method for calculating the fee 
appellants also claimed harris them under the september corporate resolution,by calculating the fee based in part on the price of tesoro option to purchase the stations,which it had not exercised the district court made no findings as to this claim.it also made no findings as to appellants claim that harris breached his fiduciary duty by violating rpc c,which requires u pon conclusion of a contingent fee matter,the lawyer shall provide the client with a written statement stating the outcome of the matter and,if there is a recovery,showing the remittance to the client and the method of its determination.
the district court held,even if jeffrey and amy bertelsen had a valid breach of fiduciary duty claim as to the may and september corporate resolutions,the claim was barred by washington statute of limitations for such actions,because the bertelsens did not file their action until december.
conflict of interest 
appellants also claim harris and his firm breached their fiduciary duty by failing fully to advise appellants of potential conflicts of interest and to obtain written waivers of the conflicts during the arco litigation.the district court found no breach of fiduciary duty.the district court held appellants waived the conflict of interest at the outset of the arco litigation,harris continually advised appellants to seek independent counsel,and harris did not favor one client over another during the arco litigation.
disgorgement 
most importantly for this appeal,the district court held assuming for the sake of argument that all of plaintiffs assertions concerning violations of rpcs are true,this judicial officer can not conclude that the conduct of harris and his firm was so egregious as to justify disgorgement of fees paid.the court noted the consulting arrangement with mcpherson could easily have been provided in a separate document.moreover,while appellants understandably took issue with the fees paid in the tesoro transaction since they were based on an option that was never exercised,this judicial officer infers that the fee was ultimately reasonable,given the testimony of all concerned,and specifically the fees paid to mcpherson,the description of the services provided and the result achieved.finally,the court stated it did not find that there is sufficient grounds for disgorgement or sufficient equitable concerns to justify disgorgement based upon the evidence.
as to the breach of fiduciary duty claim based on the purported conflict of interest,the court held disgorgement of fees was not warranted because t here is no showing that the giving of independent advice to the plaintiffs at the times material to plaintiffs claims would have changed the strategic positions taken by them or the ultimate outcome of either the tesoro transaction or the arco litigation.
we review the district court findings of fact after a bench trial for clear error and review the district court conclusions of law de novo.lentini cal.ctr.for the arts,escondido,cir.whether an attorney conduct violates a rule of professional conduct is a question of law.eriks denver.we review a trial court decision whether to award disgorgement of fees for an attorney breach of his fiduciary duty for abuse of discretion.see kelly foster.
the only damages appellants seek here for their various claims of breach of fiduciary duty is disgorgement of attorneys fees paid to appellees,plus interest and their own attorneys fees and costs in prosecuting this disgorgement claim.note,appellants do not claim they suffered any injury by the actions of harris and his firm,apart from having to pay their attorneys fees.that is,they do not complain harris and his firm bungled their extrications from the arco contract,nor that harris brought about a disadvantageous lease with tesoro.of course,they do not complain about harris keeping them out of bankruptcy.
under washington law,disgorgement of fees is a remedy committed to the discretion of the trial court disgorgement of fees is a reasonable way to discipline specific breaches of professional responsibility,and to deter future misconduct of a similar type.such an order is within the inherent power of the trial court to fashion judgments.eriks,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.a court is not required to order disgorgement,even where a breach of fiduciary duty is proven.see kelly,at.a court refusal to disgorge fees,whether a breach of fiduciary duty is proven or not,is overturned only for an abuse of discretion.id.
the district court explicitly stated,even assuming appellants had established their breach of fiduciary duty claims,the court nevertheless would not order disgorgement.in other words,the district court held,even if its legal conclusions on the merits of appellants claims were the dissent court would not order disgorgement on this set of facts.we hold the district court did not abuse its discretion in so holding.
washington state law does not set forth particular factors a trial court must consider to decide whether to order disgorgement,or factors we must consider to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in rendering that decision.we find kelly foster,instructive.kelly,the sole beneficiary of her uncle estate,brought an action for breach of fiduciary duty against attorney foster,who represented the estate executor.id.at.foster recommended the estate sell its land to a third party below market value,but failed to disclose he had an interest in the land sale after the sale,the third party sold part of the land to foster and his wife.id.the jury found foster breached his fiduciary duty to kelly and awarded damages of.id.at.the trial court denied kelly motion for disgorgement of fees.id.the washington court of appeals affirmed.it held the trial court did not find factors present in this case justifying a reimbursement to kelly of attorney fees paid by the estate.such a ruling is well within the court discretion and will not be overturned.id.at.
in contrast to kelly,appellants here claim no damages caused by appellees purported breach of fiduciary duty,apart from the attorneys fees they want reimbursed.compare with cotton kronenberg,affirming award of disgorgement of fees in breach of fiduciary duty action where criminal defense attorney took title to his client real property as his retainer fee,sold the property,and then refused to refund the unearned balance of his fees after prosecutors successfully moved to remove the attorney from representation of the client for having tampered with a prosecution witness.
as in kelly,the district court here found the equities did not justify an award of disgorgement of fees,for several reasons.foremost,it held the contingency fee paid to appellees was reasonable for the work done and value of the tesoro transaction.this is an eminently reasonable conclusion,given that harris and mcpherson work led to a dollar rental deal,kept the six gas stations as bertelsen property,and prevented appellants from having to file for bankruptcy indeed,jeffrey bertelsen admitted he thought mcpherson earned his half of the contingency payment.the district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding harris and his firm also earned their own half of the fee.further,the district court concluded there was no evidence independent advice would have changed the positions taken by appellants or affected the outcome of either the arco litigation or the tesoro transaction.in the court opinion,appellees alleged misconduct simply did not rise to the level of conduct that warrants an equitable award of disgorgement of fees 
there is no basis upon which to find the district court abused its discretion by refusing to order disgorgement of fees.whether the district court made an error of law in its assessment of the merits of appellants breach of fiduciary duty claims,as the dissent contends,is of no moment to our determination whether the court abused its discretion as to the remedy.remember in kelly,there was a finding of breach of fiduciary duty and damages caused thereby,but there was no disgorgement of fees kept by the errant attorney.here,the district court considered the facts and circumstances of this case and determined they did not warrant a discretionary award of disgorgement of fees.it gave multiple,sound reasons for doing so.the district court acted within its discretion in refusing to order disgorgement of fees.see kelly,at.
we acknowledge that disgorgement of attorney fees serves an important goal it deters attorney misconduct,a goal worth furthering regardless of whether a particular client has been harmed.hendry pelland.similarly,rules of professional conduct serve a critical role to maintain the integrity of the legal profession and ensure an attorney abides by his duty as his client fiduciary.of course,nothing herein is meant to excuse harris for any breach of his professional duties imposed by washington state rules of professional conduct,should that state bar proceed against him for sanctions.see.rules for enforcement of lawyer conduct et in re gillingham,en banc attorney misconduct is defined by the rpc,and any violation of the rpc may be grounds for attorney discipline.
but,under washington law,the award of disgorgement of fees is not mandatory even where the attorney who got the fees also violated washington rules of professional conduct for attorneys instead,whether to order disgorgement is placed firmly within the discretion of the trial court.see kelly,at.here,the district court made a considered determination that the circumstances did not warrant disgorgement of fees.whether or not the district court erred in its assessment of the merits of appellants breach of fiduciary duty issue we do not did not abuse its discretion when it declined to award disgorgement on this set of facts.we affirm its judgment on that basis.
i respectfully dissent.my colleagues in the majority make light of appellants assertions regarding the conduct of harris and his law firm collectively,harris,suggesting that because the economic result achieved was ultimately favorable to appellants,and because the district court is owed discretion in whether to disgorge attorney fees,it is unnecessary to decide whether harris breached the washington rules of professional conduct rpc and his fiduciary duties.in the words of the majority,after all righteous furor is vented,the fees were eminently reasonable for the result produced.op.at.in my view,harris breaches of the rpc and his fiduciary duties are plain,and the majority conception of attorneys fiduciary duties is the legal equivalent of holding that a trustee who misappropriates money from a trust and gambles those funds at the racetrack is excused from his breach of fiduciary duty,and is entitled to his trustee fees,so long as he wins enough at the track to permit him to timely return the misappropriated money to the corpus of the trust.washington law does not support such a legal theory of relativity concerning an attorney breach of his fiduciary duties.
under washington law,it is well established that the relationship is a fiduciary one as a matter of law and thus the attorney owes the highest duty to the client.perez pappas,en banc versuslaw stoel rives,llp,kelly foster.when acting as a fiduciary,attorneys have a duty to act in and for the client best interests at all times and to act in complete honesty and good faith to honor the trust and confidence placed in them.kelly,at emphasis added.
in affirming the district court,the majority relies on the district court conclusion that even if all of appellants claims against harris were true,harris conduct was not so egregious as to justify disgorgement of fees paid.but neither the majority nor the district court closely examined appellants claims regarding harris violations of his fiduciary duties and the rpc,matters which this court reviews de novo.see eriks denver,en banc stating that whether an attorney conduct violates the relevant rules of professional conduct is a question of law see also lentini cal.ctr.for the arts,cir stating that a district court conclusions of law following a bench trial are reviewed de novo.
i agree that the question of whether to disgorge fees is a matter committed to the discretion of the trial court,and that even when a breach of fiduciary duty is proven,a trial court is not necessarily required to order disgorgement.see kelly,at.however,if an attorney is guilty of gross misconduct in violation of public policy,the attorney may not be entitled to any fees.see ross scannell,en banc kelly,at.
as demonstrated below,harris violated the rpc and his fiduciary duties to appellants in numerous ways,some of which were egregious.given the obvious nature of these multiple violations,some of which the district court did not consider at all,the district court committed a clear error in judgment in concluding that harris did not violate the rpc or breach his fiduciary duties such that disgorgement may be appropriate,and that even if he did so his conduct was not egregious so as to warrant the disgorgement of fees.see wildlife fed marine fisheries,cir stating that abuse of discretion review requires the appellate court to uphold a district court exercise of discretion unless the court has a definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached citation and internal quotations omitted.instead of affirming the district court,this court should conclude that the district court abused its discretion and remand the case to the district court so that it may consider in the first instance what,if any,
