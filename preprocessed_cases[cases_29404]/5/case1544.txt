this case involves a claim for attorneys fees pursuant to c,which limits fees to services provided after the board of veterans appeals first makes a final decision in the case.c.we conclude that the statute was designed to allow attorneys fees,after the initial claims proceeding,in connection with proceedings to reopen a claim on the grounds of new and material evidence,or clear and unmistakable error,a.we also hold that under c,there has been another final decision in connection with proceedings to reopen a claim after there has been a final board of veterans appeals board or bva decision on a particular issue in the course of the reopening proceeding.we accordingly vacate the decision of the court of appeals for veterans claims and remand to that court for further proceedings.
background 
kenneth thurman,a veteran,filed a claim with the veterans administration va for service connection of a cervical spine disability.the regional office ro in new orleans,louisiana denied this claim in august.because thurman did not appeal this decision,it became final one year later.see b and c a.in a january rating decision,the little rock,arkansas ro denied thurman application to reopen his claim for the cervical spine injury on the ground of no new and material evidence,leading thurman to file a notice of disagreement with that decision in july.
in august,thurman employed appellant,james stanley,to represent him in his claims for veterans benefits.thurman and stanley signed a retainer agreement in august,which was also filed with the board.this retainer agreement provided 
client agrees to pay a fee of retroactive benefits in connection with the client claim with the department of veterans affairs.it is understood this is a contingent fee and client will only owe james stanley,in the event he receives a favorable decision on the claim at any level of the proceedings 
a hearing was held before the ro in little rock,arkansas on may,where stanley presented evidence in connection with a request to reopen thurman previously denied claim for service connection of his cervical spine injury.thurman appealed the january ro rating decision denying his application to reopen his cervical spine injury claim.in march,the board concluded that new and material evidence has been submitted to reopen a claim for service connection for the cervical spine injury,and remanded in order to allow thurman claim to be further reviewed by the ro after thurman had been examined by a neurosurgical specialist.the board did not address the claim for total disability for unemployability tdiu.
to comply with the board remand order,on june,there was another hearing before the little rock,arkansas ro reviewing the evidence associated with thurman cervical spinal disorder.at this hearing,stanley also indicated that he was fil ing today a claim for total disability for unemployability tdiu purposes contending that all of thurman disabilities that he contends or that have already been found to be service connected render him unemployable.on september,the ro granted service connection for the cervical spine injury effective july,and entitlement to individual unemployability or tdiu effective june.
on october,stanley and thurman signed a second fee agreement,which they filed with the board in november.this fee agreement provided for a contingent fee of,which equaled of the benefits awarded to thurman in september for residuals of his cervical spine injury.in a december letter,stanley indicated that t here was a final bva decision on thurman claim for cervical disorder dated march,and that he was not going to charge a fee for the issue of tdiu unless and until the bva renders a final ruling.
in may,the board raised the issue of stanley eligibility for payment of attorneys fees sua sponte and noted that h requires attorneys fees be paid out of benefits awarded as a result of a successful appeal to the board or an appellate court or as a result of a reopened claim before the department of veterans affairs following a prior denial of such benefits by the board or an appellate court.in re fee agreement of stanley,slip op.at.may,stanley i.relying on c and c,the board stated that there also needed to be a final decision on the issue involved in the case.the board concluded that although the board march decision was favorable as to reopening of a prior unappealed denial of service connection for a cervical spine disorder,it can not be deemed to constitute a successful appeal to the board on the issue of entitlement to service connection for a cervical spine disability,nor can it be deemed to constitute a final decision on the issue involved by the board id.accordingly,the board decided that stanley had not satisfied the criteria for payment of attorneys fees from benefits.
stanley summarized his claim for attorneys fees in his february,letter to the department of veterans affairs,office of the chief counsel.in this letter,stanley urged that he could charge fees on the cervical spine disorder beginning with the work he completed after the march bva decision.he further claimed that the failure of the board to adjudicate the tdiu issue constituted a de facto final decision on the tdiu issue,allowing him to charge fees on this claim from the time it was first raised on june.he reiterated these contentions in a may letter.
in october,the board found that there had been no final board decision in march on either the cervical spine or tdiu claims.in re fee agreement of stanley,slip op.at,stanley ii.consequently,no fee could be charged for stanley representation of thurman.id.at.
stanley appealed to the court of appeals for veterans claims.the court of appeals for veterans claims identified the issue for review as whether there had been a final board decision in march with respect to thurman claims for a cervical spine disorder and tdiu.the court of appeals for veterans claims concluded that there had been no final decision in march with respect to either claim because the board had remanded thurman claim for a cervical spine disorder to the ro,and a remand by the board to the ro does not constitute a final decision by the bva.stanley gober,slip op.at,stanley iii.the court of appeals for veterans claims further stated 
the tdiu issue was dependent on and inextricably intertwined with the appellant claim regarding his cervical spine disability,and was decided by the ro along with that claim.since we have held that there is no final bva decision regarding the cervical spine claim,there is also no final bva decision regarding the tdiu claim.
id.at.accordingly,the court of appeals for veterans claims affirmed the board denial of legal fees for the cervical spine disability and tdiu claims stanley filed this timely appeal.
discussion 
this court has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.we review an interpretation of statutory provisions by the court of appeals for veterans claims without deference.howard gober.
the award of attorneys fees in veterans cases is governed by,which provides in pertinent part 
c i n connection with a proceeding before the department with respect to benefits under laws administered by the secretary,a fee may not be charged,allowed,or paid for services of agents and attorneys with respect to services provided before the date on which the board of veterans appeals first makes a final decision in the case.such a fee may be charged,allowed,or paid in the case of services provided after such date only if an agent or attorney is retained with respect to such case before the end of the period beginning on that date.the limitation in the preceding sentence does not apply to services provided with respect to proceedings before a court.
c emphases added 
the concept of finality with respect to judicial decisions does not have a single meaning applicable in all contexts.in the veterans law area alone,we have had occasion to consider its meaning with respect to the appealability of decisions from the court of appeals for veterans claims to this court,williams principi,and from the board to the court of appeals for veterans claims,howard gober.none of those decisions is particularly helpful here because we are faced with construing a somewhat unusual phrase first makes a final decision in the case.c.that language is itself inconsistent with traditional notions of finality under statutes such as,which require that the decision in this case leaves no further issues to resolve.see catlin united states.a final decision generally is one which ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.the concept of a first final decision necessarily implies that there may be a second final decision or even further final decisions.we turn to the legislative history for guidance.
section formerly section was enacted in at the same time that congress first provided for judicial review of the secretary determinations in veterans cases.before,claims for attorneys fees were strictly limited to per claim,at,reprinted in.
according to the house report on the veterans judicial review act,historically the limitations on attorneys fees were intended to serve two purposes.first,the limitations protect the interests of veterans from the perceived threat that agents or attorneys would charge excessive fees for their services,which essentially required only the preparation and presentation of an application for benefits,at,reprinted in.second,because the process for seeking veterans benefits has historically been intentionally structured as informal and,the assistance of paid agents or attorneys was not deemed necessary or desirable in the overwhelming majority of cases.id.at,at.the second of these considerations was viewed as having less force given the revisions that for the first time allowed judicial review.
both the senate and house reports recognized the importance of retaining legal counsel in the newly allowed judicial proceedings.indeed,the senate report noted that the new right to judicial review would be a hollow right indeed without some easing of the limitation on attorneys fees,at,from the previous limitation of per claim.
in addition to providing attorneys fees in judicial review proceedings,section c was designed to allow veterans to retain paid counsel in connection with va proceedings to reopen final board decisions,but to bar the retention of paid counsel in connection with the original va proceedings,which were viewed as presenting less complex issues.this approach is readily apparent from the legislative history.the senate report concluded 
i t may be unnecessary for a claimant to incur the substantial expenses for attorney representation that may not be involved in appealing the case for the first time to the bva however,once the bva renders a decision adverse to the claimant on the merits,the need for the assistance of an attorney is then markedly greater with respect to such issues as seeking a reopening and reconsideration and deciding whether to proceed to court.
id.at emphases added the senate report specifically distinguishes the first final decision from decisions rendered after a reopening 
a ny time after the bva has issued a final is,its first decision on the merits,as distinguished from subsequent decisions rendered after a claimant would have the option of retaining an attorney,under fee limitations far less restrictive than the existing limitation,to proceed further before the bva or the va if the claimant can demonstrate either that there is new and material evidence or that there is other good cause to reopen 
the house report accompanying,which proposed language that was a close precursor to the final language of the statute similarly noted that the original va proceedings should be handled differently from proceedings to reopen the case 
congress would repeal the existing limitation of on all such matters,and would replace it with a rule.generally,all representation in matters before the veterans administration would have to be undertaken without the payment of any fee whatsoever.as proposed to be revised,section c currently codified at section c would prohibit the charging or payment of any fee for services rendered at any time prior to the time that the administrator issues a statement of the case b y prohibiting an attorney or agent from charging for services until the va affirms its decision to deny a claim,the committee intends to preserve as much of the informal and efficient means of claim adjudication as possible.
at,reprinted in,emphases added.
in this case,there are two distinct claims for service connection cervical spine injury and tdiu.
a.the cervical spine injury claim 
here the original va proceedings with respect to the cervical spine claim became final in august,exactly one year after the ro rating decision,because the veteran failed to file a notice of disagreement with the ro regarding that decision.b and c a by becoming final,the ro decision could only be reopened under the statute on the basis of new and material evidence or clear and unmistakable error cue,see roberson principi,when a decision of the va is final,there are two grounds for attack on that decision under the statute.the veteran can seek to reopen a disallowed claim based on new and material evidence or based on cue.
the retention of paid counsel would have been permissible at the point when the ro decision became final.however,pursuant to c,an agent or attorney is allowed to charge a fee only if he or she is retained with respect to such case before the end of the period beginning on that date.stanley was not retained within one year after that final decision.instead,stanley argues that the march board decision constituted another final decision in the case within the meaning of the attorneys fees statute.see c.we agree.
the reopening proceeding was itself a separate case,and there was a final decision in the reopening case.in the context of a reopening case,finality unlike the situation in the initial claims proceeding requires only the final decision of an issue.if finality required an appealable final resolution of the reopening controversy,the provision for attorneys fees in va reopening proceedings would be severely restricted.the va itself has recognized that a reading of the statute requiring a final decision in the reopening proceedings would defeat its very allow the retention of paid counsel in the various proceedings after the initial final decision.indeed,in the federal register,the va clearly concluded that the definition of final decision on an issue must be liberal enough to allow attorneys fees in reopening proceedings 
i f we defined issue as meaning a challenge based on cue,an attorney would never be able to charge for services in connection with a cue motion because the board would not have issued a final decision on the issue until after the cue process was complete.
subpart g,rule c attorney fees.january.
to defend its interpretation here,the government relies primarily on the regulation,c dealing with attorneys fees.section c provides that an attorney can only charge fees if there is a final decision with respect to the issue,or issues,involved.c.section c then refers us to a,which defines a final decision as one which was appealable.a the government also points to b,which states that a remand is in the nature of a preliminary order and does not constitute a final decision of the board.
however,we conclude that section c is only addressing the question of when a final decision is rendered in the original claim proceedings where the regulations appropriately require that the board decision be appealable to the court of appeals for veterans claims,and not the question of recovery of fees after further final decisions in reopening proceedings.we think that the statute and regulations must be read to allow the retention of paid counsel in reopening proceedings after a board decision which is final as to a particular issue,whether or not that particular board decision would be appealable to the court of appeals for veterans claims.reading the statute in this manner,the board made a final decision as to the cervical spine injury claim when it concluded in march that the claim could be reopened on the basis of new and material evidence.
b.the tdiu claim 
stanley also
