the labor code requires that an employer pay an employee the equivalent of one hour of pay if the employer fails to provide a meal or rest period as required by applicable orders of the industrial welfare commission iwc,subd.b,all further undesignated statutory references are to this code.in this case,the primary question presented is what statute of limitations applies to the payment,the statute of limitations for an action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture code civ,subd.a,or the statute of limitations for a n action upon a liability created by statute,other than a penalty or forfeiture code civ,subd.a.the answer to this question turns on whether the payment is considered primarily a penalty against employers or a wage to employees.
we conclude that a payment under section is an obligation created by statute,other than a penalty,subject to a statute of limitations period code civ,subd.a,and that this remedy will support a claim for restitution under business and professions code section.

discussion 
issue presented and standard of review 
section provides 
a no employer shall require any employee to work during any meal or rest period mandated by an applicable order of the iwc.
b if an employer fails to provide an employee a meal period or rest period in accordance with an applicable order of the iwc,the employer shall pay the employee one additional hour of pay at the employee regular rate of compensation for each work day that the meal or rest period is not provided.
the primary question presented is what statute of limitations applies to the payment referred to in the statute.the answer to this question turns on whether the payment is primarily considered a penalty against employers or a wage to employees and therefore involves statutory interpretation,which presents a question of law subject to de novo review on appeal.bialo western mut.ins.th,d.our goal is to ascertain and carry out the legislature intent code civ,looking first to the words of the statute,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.people garcia cal th,d.if the language of the statute is susceptible to more than one reasonable construction,we can look to the legislative history to aid in ascertaining the legislative intent.diamond multimedia systems,superior court cal th,d.we are guided by the fundamental rule that the objective sought to be achieved by a statute as well as the evil to be prevented is of prime consideration in its interpretation.people united national life ins.cal d,quoting rockcreek.dist.county of calaveras cal d.
a.the section payment is both a penalty and a wage 
wages are defined as all amounts for labor performed by employees of every description,whether the amount is fixed or ascertained by the standard of time,task,piece,commission basis,or other method of calculation,subd.a.the term includes benefits to which an employee is entitled as a part of his or her compensation such as,money,room,board,clothing,vacation pay and sick pay.department of industrial relations ui video stores,th,d.in contrast,a penalty is one which an individual is allowed to recover against a,as a satisfaction for the wrong or injury suffered,and without reference to the actual damage s sustained,or one which is given to the individual and the state as a punishment for some act which is in the nature of a public wrong.county of los angeles ballerino cal,ballerino.stated differently,a penalty compels a defendant to pay a plaintiff other than what is necessary to compensate him or her for a legal damage done by the former.miller municipal court cal d.
if we turn to the language of the statute,credible arguments exist for interpreting the payment as both a penalty and a wage.if an employer requires an employee to work during a mandated meal or rest period,the employer shall pay the employee one additional hour of pay at the employee regular rate of compensation,subd.b.the payment is in the nature of a penalty because the language of the statute suggests that the payment does not apply if an employee voluntarily chooses to forego a meal or rest period.similarly,the payment is not related to the amount of time worked because an employee receives a full hour of pay for a missed minute rest period or lunch period.on the other hand,the requirement that the employer make the payment directly to the employee rather than a regulatory authority suggests that the payment is a wage.additionally,labeling the remedy as an additional hour of pay suggests a wage.section is also part of the labor code division employment regulation and supervision,part compensation,chapter payment of wages,article general occupations.
thus,the payment appears to be a penalty against the employer in the form of a wage to the employee.because the payment required by the statute can reasonably be interpreted as both a penalty and a wage,and the legislature did not address what limitations period applied,the statute is ambiguous and we may look to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved by the statute and the legislative history.people coronado cal th,d.

although the senate struck certain words and inserted others into assembly bill,in net effect,it simply lifted the language of the existing iwc orders regarding meal and rest periods and inserted that language into the bill.stated differently,the senate did not remove the language regarding a penalty,leaving the language regarding payments rather,it completely rewrote the proposed language so that it matched existing iwc provisions.
the senate amendments also eliminated the need for an employee to file an enforcement action and instead created an affirmative obligation on the employer to pay the employee the one hour pay the employer shall pay the employee for each work day,subd.b,italics added.thus,although section penalizes an employer for requiring an employee to work through a mandated rest or meal period,the statute is in that an employee is immediately entitled to the section payment,just like an employee is immediately entitled to payment for overtime.
the nature of the payment suggests it is not a penalty because the right to a penalty does not accrue until it has been enforced.people durbin cal d,no person has a vested right in an unenforced statutory penalty or forfeiture anderson byrnes cal,no person has a vested right in an unenforced penalty.because the hour of pay under section is owed when it is incurred,it is similar to earned wages,claims for which are payable under a court restitutionary power.cortez purolator air filtration products,supra,cal th at,d,bus,authorizes an order compelling a defendant to pay back wages as a restitutionary remedy see also tomlinson indymac bank,supra,d at finding that claims under are restitutionary.
the lingering question is how the legislature viewed these changes in terms of the applicable statute of limitations.unfortunately,the legislative history is bereft of any discussion of what statute of limitations period applies to the payment required by section,rendering it of limited value.
harmonizing the statutory scheme 
because the legislative history of section is not particularly enlightening,we turn to the entire statutory scheme of which section is part to ascertain the legislature intent.in doing so,we can not construe section in isolation but must read it with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.clean air constituency california state air cal d.
in,the legislature enacted assembly bill,the restoration and workplace flexibility act of.stats,ch.among other things,assembly bill restored the workday and mandated that the iwc conduct public hearings and adopt consistent wage orders,subd.a,including orders pertaining to meal and rest periods.assembly bill also added a penalty provision to the labor code,enforceable by the labor commissioner,subjecting employers to civil penalties for any violation of an iwc wage order regulating hours and days of work.assem.com.on appropriations,assem.bill reg.sess.as amended march.section requires employers to pay a civil penalty of for initial violations,and for subsequent violations,for each underpaid employee for each pay period for which the employee was underpaid and to pay the wages to the underpaid employee,subd.a.
the penalty provision of section indicates that employers owe the civil penalty to underpaid employees,subd a.in an interpretative memorandum of assembly bill,the dlse stated that the civil penalties of section apply to meal period violations,but only to the extent that an employee is actually underpaid,the violation must be coupled with a failure to pay the employee for the time worked during the unlawfully deprived meal period.dlse memorandum dated december,at at http.htm as of,see addendum stated differently,if employers pay the required additional hour of pay on the payday for the pay period for which the meal and rest period violations took place,there would be no underpayment and thus,no civil penalty under section.
effective march,the iwc issued interim wage that implemented the changes in the law as a result of the legislature adoption of assembly bill.summary of interim wage at as of,see addendum the interim wage order essentially adopted the civil penalty provisions of section for any violation of the interim wage order.the iwc later promulgated wage order effective,as amended,which included the one hour of pay requirement for meal and rest period violations and the penalty provision contained in the interim wage order,tit,subds.
in turn,assembly bill sought to strengthen the enforcement of existing wage and hour standards contained in current statutes and wage orders.assem.com.on labor and employment,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced.in this regard,section,effective january,adopted the one hour of pay provision of wage order for meal and rest period violations.
sections and complement each other.under section,employers must pay their employees the compensatory remedy of one hour of pay for meal and rest period violations.if employers fail to do so on the payday for the pay period for which the meal and rest period violations took place,they will also be subject to the civil penalty of section.this overall scheme suggests that the payment under section is in the nature of a statutory remedy to employees because it is unlikely that the legislature intended to establish two penalties on employers for meal and rest period violations.
the dlse contends that section does not apply to meal or rest period violations,citing the enrolled bill report for section.the enrolled bill report states,without explanation,that the penalties of section are for the underpayment of wages,and not meal or rest period violations.of industrial relations,enrolled bill on assem.bill reg.sess.we reject this conclusion as it is not instructive,not reflected in the legislative history of section and does not comport with the statutory scheme just described.elsner uveges cal th,fn,d,enrolled bill report prepared by dlse was instructive on matters of legislative intent where it reflected the understanding of the legislature as a whole.
general legal principles and the object of section 
we assume that the legislature has in mind existing laws when it passes a statute.estate of mcdill cal d.existing law creates a statute of limitations for an action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture code civ,subd.a and a statute of limitations for a n action upon a liability created by statute,other than a penalty or forfeiture.code civ,subd.a.here,the legislature could have,but did not,label the statutory payment of section as a penalty.significantly,the legislature was aware of how use of the word penalty impacts the applicable statute of limitations because in enacting section,which continues the unpaid wages of a discharged employee as a penalty for up to days,it expressly provided that s uit may be filed for these penalties at any time before the expiration of the statute of limitations on an action for the wages from which the penalties arise.
we thus conclude that the payment of section is an obligation created by statute,other than a penalty,governed by code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.hensler city of glendale cal th,d,the applicable statute of limitations depends on the nature of the right sued upon,not the label of the cause of action pleaded in the complaint.general legal principles and the object of section support this conclusion.
first,statutes governing conditions of employment are construed broadly in favor of protecting employees.lusardi construction aubry cal th,d.applying this principle here suggests that the longer limitation period should apply.additionally,the general purposes underlying statutes of limitations do not warrant a limitations period.statutes of limitation protect potential defendants from stale claims by affording them an opportunity to gather evidence while facts are still fresh.davies krasna cal d.because employers are required to keep all time records for a minimum of three years,they will have all documents necessary to mount their defense to plaintiffs claims.cal code regs,tit,subd.a c.
section,subdivision a states that n o employer shall require an employee to work through a rest or meal period but,if the rest or meal periods are not provided,the employer shall pay the pay,subds.a b.thus,the object of section is to pay employees for additional work performed during mandated meal or rest periods and deter employers from requiring employees to work through these periods.construing this section in favor of employees,it provides a statutory measure of compensation for what would otherwise be uncompensated labor performed during a meal or rest period.the fact that the legislature tied the section payment to the employee regular rate of compensation also suggests that it considered the payment to be compensation for otherwise uncompensated work,compensation that is properly measured by the employee regular pay rate,subd.b.construing the payment as a penalty illogically results in employers of employees being penalized less than the employers of employees for the exact same offense.
interestingly,the iwc has characterized overtime payments to employees as both a premium and penalty pay.industrial welfare com.superior court cal d,containing iwc statement regarding overtime.despite this,it has long been recognized that an action to recover overtime compensation is governed by the statute of limitations period of code of civil procedure section.aubry goldhor d.
use of the word penalty in the legislative history is not surprising because the payment is a deterrent device in the form of a wage to the employee.significantly,however,the legislature deleted the word penalty from assembly bill and never linked its use in the legislative history to the limitations period of code of civil procedure section.moreover,employers have an affirmative obligation to make the payment or else the employee will be underpaid and the employer subject to a penalty under section,suggesting that the payment is remedial in nature.it appears to us that use of the word penalty in the legislative history to describe the section payment is simply a way of describing the effect of the payment on an employer,rather than mandating what statute of limitations should apply to the payment.
we find that the use of the word penalty in discussing the section payment is not controlling because the legislature chose not to apply this label,and as nassco argues,whether or not the section payment is a penalty turns on its function and operation,not on its label.here,the payment is clearly remedial to the employee and penal to the employer.prudential home mortgage superior court th,d same provision may be penal to the offender and remedial to the victim.nonetheless,in the labor law arena,statutes must be construed in favor of the employee,militating that the payment should be subjected to the longer statute of limitations period.
restitution under the business and professions code 
plaintiffs third cause of action seeks restitution under business and professions code section for the unpaid one hour of pay.employees earn the additional hour of pay when they are denied a meal or rest period thus,the payments under section are restitutionary and recoverable under california unfair competition law.tomlinson indymac bank,supra,d at.
conclusion 
section has the dual function of deterring employers from requiring their employees to work through mandated meal and rest periods and compensating employees required to work through these periods.the legislature could have,but did not,label the statutory payment of section as a penalty,and the entire statutory scheme suggests that the payment under section is primarily in the nature of a statutory remedy to employees.of course,if this is not what the legislature intended,then it may amend the statute to clarify its intent.

i respectfully disagree with my colleagues.i am persuaded by the reasoning of murphy kenneth cole productions,th,d,that labor code section creates a penalty to which the limitations period of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,applies.
as i read section,subdivision a,it unambiguously prohibits an employer from requiring an employee to work during a rest period,stating that n o employer shall require such work from an employee.italics added.payment imposed on the employer due to impermissible conduct is not an employee benefit given for labor performed,but is a sanction or punishment for failure to provide work accommodations such as adequate meal breaks.murphy,supra,th at,d,italics added.accordingly,i am unable to reach any conclusion other than that labor code section reflects a penalty for statute of limitations purposes.
indeed,my colleagues recognize that labor code section,subdivision b,is a penalty,albeit in the form of a wage.in my view,as long as the liability created by labor code section represents a penalty,it is irrelevant whether that penalty takes the form of a wage.any liability constituting a penalty is unambiguously excepted from the statute of limitations period of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,which applies to a n action upon a liability created by statute,other than a penalty or forfeiture.italics added.because the liability created by labor code section is a penalty,i would conclude that it is controlled by the statute of limitations for an action upon a statute for a penalty or forfeiture.code civ,subd.a.

subject understanding ab an in depth look at the provisions of the eight hour day restoration and workplace flexibility act of 
this memo was drafted prior to the iwc adoption of the interim wage order,and as such,this memo does not purport to interpret the interim wage order.to the extent that any provisions of the interim wage order may be inconsistent with this memo,the wage order provisions would prevail.
ab,which was enacted by the legislature and signed by governor davis earlier this year,will take effect on january.it is therefore critically important that all dlse professional staff take some time to learn about the provisions of this law,and to understand some of the questions that will arise in its interpretation and enforcement.this memo will summarize each section of the bill,with a focus on whether and how it changes existing law.we will also discuss commonly asked questions about ab,and by summarizing from recently issued or pending opinion letters,provide the answers to these questions.
ab an introduction to the substantive provisions 
the legislature named ab the eight hour day restoration and workplace flexibility act of.that name tells us the two primary purposes behind the legislation first,to restore daily overtime in california that is,to bring back the general requirement for overtime pay after eight hours of work in a day,a requirement that the industrial welfare commission iwc had eliminated from wage orders manufacturing industry,professional,technical,clerical,and mechanical occupations,public housekeeping industry,mercantile industry,and transportation industry,with the adoption of the wage orders.section of ab provides that these wage orders,and shall be null and void and that in their place,the wage orders,as amended in,as amended in,and,are reinstated from january,until no later than july,at which point the iwc is required,pursuant to section of the bill which adds section to the labor code to adopt new wage orders.
it is very important to understand,however,that although only of the iwc wage orders that are currently in effect will become null and void on january,ab as a whole applies to all california workers except for those who are expressly exempted by the bill itself,or those who were expressly exempted from a wage of ab adds section to the labor code,which provides,at subsection b,that except for ab new test for the administrative,executive and professional exemption found at section a,nothing in this section requires the iwc to alter any exemption from provisions regulating hours of work that was contained in any valid wage order in effect in,and that except as otherwise provided in ab,the iwc may review,retain or eliminate any exemption from provisions regulating hours of work that was contained in any valid wage order in effect in.
with these general principles in mind,we can answer the most commonly asked questions about ab coverage.of the wage orders expressly exempt public employees from their coverage.these public employees,who would otherwise be covered by a wage order but for the exemption contained in the wage order,are therefore exempt from ab.likewise,truck drivers whose hours of service are regulated by the united states department of transportation under,et or by the california highway patrol or the state public utilities commission under,et are expressly exempt from the overtime provisions of the iwc orders.these workers are therefore exempted from the overtime provisions of ab.on the other hand,workers who were not expressly exempted from any wage order,such as construction,drilling,mining and logging employees,are covered by ab.we should note,however,that labor code b provides that until january,the iwc may establish additional exemptions from the overtime provisions of ab.thus,employees engaged in construction,drilling,mining and logging will be covered by ab unless and until the iwc chooses to expressly exempt any of them from its provisions.
the statutory provisions of ab,or any other state law,will prevail over any inconsistent provision in the wage orders.for example,the current an hour state minimum wage,which was established by the electorate with the passage of the living wage act of,now codified at labor code section,prevails over the lower minimum wage rates contained in the wage orders.likewise,ab salary basis test,which requires a monthly salary equivalent of at least twice the minimum wage,currently per month,as a prerequisite for the administrative,executive and professional exemptions from overtime,prevails over the remuneration test and lower monthly amounts for the administrative and executive exemptions in the wage orders.therefore,starting on january,employers must comply with the wage orders,to the extent they are not inconsistent with ab or any other controlling statutes,in which case the requirements of the statute will apply.
the second important purpose behind ab is the intent to provide more options for work schedule flexibility than had been available in the wage orders.ab maintains,with some changes,two of the mechanisms under the wage orders which permitted work schedules of more than eight hours per day without payment of daily overtime namely,the provisions for secret ballot elections to implement an alternative workweek schedule,and the collective bargaining agreement provision.in addition to these mechanisms,there are two new provisions in ab that permit individual employees to work more than eight hours in a day but not more than the alternative number of ten or by the statute,at the employee request and under clearly specified conditions,without payment of overtime.the first of these new provisions allows for individual time under which an employee can take time off for personal reasons and during the same workweek,make up that time by working up to eleven hours in a day without the payment of overtime.the second of these new provisions allows individual employees who were working on july,under a schedule that provided for up to hours in a day to continue working this schedule without payment of daily overtime,even if this schedule was not established by an alternative workweek election.we will return to these flexible work schedule arrangements later in this memo.for now,we will simply note that although ab allows for increased flexibility in work schedules,the statute imposes limits on the total hours that can be worked in a day under most flexible arrangements,and sets out strict procedures that must be followed in order to work more than eight hours in a day without the payment of daily overtime.
finally,before embarking on a detailed review of ab,we should note that for dlse,in its function as an enforcement agency,perhaps the most important change brought about by this new law is creation of a new method for enforcing overtime obligations.under section of the bill,section is added to the labor code,under which the dlse may issue a civil penalty citation to an employer that violates the provisions of ab or any provision regulating hours and days of work in any iwc order.these penalties are set at the amount of for an initial violation or for any subsequent violation per underpaid employee for each pay period in which the employee was underpaid.in addition,the civil penalty citation may include the amount owed to employees for underpaid overtime wages.
a section by section look at ab 
definitions section of ab adds section to the labor code,defining certain words that are used in the statute.the word workday is defined as any consecutive hour period commencing at the same time each calendar day.the word workweek is defined as any seven consecutive days,starting with the same calendar day each week,and as a fixed and regularly recurring period of hours made up of seven consecutive periods.finally,the term alternative workweek schedule is defined as any regularly scheduled workweek requiring an employee to work more than eight hours in a period.these definitions are unchanged from the wage orders.an employer may designate the period of the workday and the workweek.absent by the employer,dlse will treat each workday as starting at midnight,and each workweek as starting at midnight on sunday,so that sunday is the first day of the workweek and saturday the last.
the basic overtime law section of ab amends labor code,to set out california new basic overtime law.first,it requires overtime compensation at the rate of no less than one and the employee regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight in one workday,and for all hours worked in excess of in one workweek,and for the first eight hours worked on the seventh day of work in any one workweek.second,it requires overtime compensation at the rate of double the employee regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of hours in one day,and for any work in excess of eight hours on any seventh day of a workweek.
this basic overtime law is the heart of ab.it restores daily overtime,and takes the basic overtime provisions found in almost all of the wage orders time and a half for all hours worked in a workday in excess of and up to double time for all hours worked in a workday in excess of time and a half for all hours worked in excess of in a workweek and seventh day premium pay and enshrines these provisions as statutory requirements.
we have received many inquiries concerning the provision for seventh day premium pay.the time and a half provision reads slightly differently than the double time provision time and a half for the first eight hours worked on the seventh day of work in any one workweek,and double time for any work in excess of eight hours on any seventh day of a workweek.this raises the question whether ab requires double time for any work performed in excess of eight hours on the seventh day of the workweek,even if the employee has not worked all seven days of that workweek.we do not believe this would be a logical reading of the statute rather,both the time and a half and double time provisions for seventh day premium pay must be harmonized to require that the employee work all seven days of the workweek in order to qualify for this type of premium pay.the purpose of seventh day premium pay is to provide extra compensation to workers who are denied the opportunity to have a day off during the workweek not to reward someone who may only be scheduled to work one day a week for having fortuitously been scheduled to work on what is the seventh day of the employer workweek.this reading of ab is consistent with the provisions for seventh day premium pay contained in the wage orders,and we are unable to discern any intent on the part of the legislature to modify those provisions.
example an employer has no workweek.an employee of that employer works the following schedule hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours.is the employee entitled to any overtime pay or seventh day premium pay.there is no daily overtime,because the employee never worked more than eight hours in a day.there is no weekly overtime,because the employee did not work more than hours during each of the two workweeks running from sunday to saturday.and even though the employee worked ten days in a row,there is no seventh day premium pay,because the employee did not work seven consecutive days in any one workweek.
the statute also provides that nothing in this section requires an employer to combine more than one rate of overtime compensation in order to calculate the amount to be paid to an employee for any hour of overtime work.this is consistent with dlse enforcement of the wage orders.it simply means that there is no pyramiding of separate forms of overtime pay for the same hours worked.once an hour is counted as an overtime hour under some form of overtime,it can not be counted as an hour worked for the purpose of another form of overtime.when an employee works ten hours in one day,the two daily overtime hours can not also be counted as hours worked for the purpose of weekly overtime.
example an employee works hours on monday,tuesday,wednesday,and thursday.how many and overtime hours did the employee work that week employee is credited with hours of daily overtime each day worked,for a total of daily overtime hours,and these daily overtime hours can not be counted for the purpose of determining when to start paying time and a half for hours worked in excess of in a week.because pyramiding is not allowed,there are no weekly overtime hours,even though the employee worked total hours during the workweek.only of these hours were regular,overtime hours,and they are the only hours that count towards weekly overtime computations.
labor code provides for certain exceptions from the basic overtime law.the overtime requirements of section do not apply to an employee working pursuant to 
an alternative workweek schedule adopted pursuant to labor code,discussed below,or 
an alternative workweek schedule adopted by a collective bargaining agreement pursuant to labor code,discussed below,or 
an alternative workweek schedule for any person employed in an agricultural occupation,as defined in iwc order.section of ab amends section of the labor code to exclude persons employed in agricultural occupations from all of ab,except for section,the section that sets out civil penalties for violations of the overtime provisions contained in ab or in any iwc order.thus,the basic overtime law,now found at labor code,does not apply to workers covered by iwc order.however,an agricultural employer that violates the special overtime provisions of order will be subject to a penalty citation just like any other employer.
finally,section retains the existing provision regarding ridesharing,which states that time spent commuting to and from the first place at which an employee presence is required by the employer shall not be considered to be part of a day work,when the employee commutes in a vehicle that is owned,leased or subsidized by the employer,and is used for the purpose of ridesharing.of course,once the employee reaches the first place at which his or her presence is required by the employer,all time spent subject to the control of the employer whether or not the employee is then engaged in physical or mental labor,and all time during which the employee is suffered or permitted to work,must count as hours worked under the various iwc orders.
bargained alternative workweek schedules section of ab adds section to the labor code,which permits certain bargained alternative workweek schedules.under subsection a,an employer may propose a regularly scheduled alternative workweek authorizing work by the affected employees for no longer than hours per day within a workweek without payment of overtime compensation.the proposed regularly scheduled alternative workweek may be a single work schedule that would become the standard schedule for all of the workers in the work unit,or a menu of work schedule options,from which each employee in the unit would be entitled to choose.
whether it is the only work schedule for an entire work unit or one of several options on a menu available to the workers in the unit,the regularly scheduled alternative workweek must provide for specified workdays and specified work hours,and these workdays and work hours must be fixed and regularly recurring.
adoption of an alternative workweek schedule under section a requires a secret ballot election with approval by at least of the affected employees.we have received many inquiries concerning the procedures to be followed in holding such an election.section of ab adds section to the labor code,which requires the iwc,no later than july,to adopt wage orders which must include procedures for conducting elections to establish or repeal alternative workweek schedules,procedures for implementing such alternative schedules,the procedures for petitioning to repeal an alternative workweek schedule,the conditions under which an employer can unilaterally repeal such a schedule,the contents of any required notices or disclosures to employees,and the factors in designating a work unit for purposes of an election.until such new wage orders are adopted by the iwc,employers must comply with the procedures dealing with alternative workweek elections that are found in the applicable iwc wage order,to the extent that those procedures are not inconsistent with ab.
each worker eligible to vote in an election must be informed,prior to the election,of the precise work is,the precise workdays and work he or she will be assigned to work or,in the case of an election to establish a menu of work schedule options,allowed to choose from if the alternative work schedule is adopted.we have been asked whether an employer can establish a menu of work schedule options through an election,and then,if too many or too few workers choose to work one of the alternative schedules,assign workers to work schedules on some basis other than the workers choice.the answer to this is no,as the statute clearly provides that each employee in the unit would be entitled to choose among the various work schedule options on the menu.if the employer business needs preclude allowing its employees to freely choose among work schedule options,the employer should not propose a menu of work schedule options.instead,the employer may be able to propose more than one alternative work schedule by dividing the workforce into separate work units,and proposing a different alternative work schedule for each unit,so that each worker knows exactly what schedule he or she is voting for.
a regularly scheduled alternative workweek permitted by section a can not provide for regularly scheduled workdays in excess of hours or regularly scheduled workweeks in excess of hours.thus,regularly scheduled workdays for longer than hours except within the health care industry,which is discussed below are not permitted under a bargained alternative workweek schedule,and if an employer whose employees are working pursuant to an alternative workweek schedule regularly scheduled workdays in excess of hours,dlse will conclude that these employees are not working an alternative workweek schedule permitted under section a,and thus,the employer will be required to pay overtime compensation for all hours worked in excess of eight in a day or in a week,as required by section.
example an employer covered by wage order,whose employees have voted to adopt a alternative workweek schedule workdays a week,hours per workday,for a total of hours worked each workweek pursuant to section a,seeks to have its employees regularly work hours each workday,and asks whether it can do this by paying two hours overtime,at time and a half,for the extra two hours each workday.the answer is no.a regularly scheduled hour workday is not permitted under section a,so this is not a valid regularly scheduled alternative workweek.as such,section will apply to require time and a half for all hours worked in excess of eight in a workday.the employer must pay time and a half for overtime hours each workday.
however,it is expected that there will be occasions,not regularly recurring,when an employee working under an alternative workweek schedule adopted pursuant to section will be required to work extra hours beyond those that are regularly scheduled.these occasions are addressed by subsection b of section,which provides that an employee working under an alternative workweek schedule adopted pursuant to subsection a shall be paid overtime compensation at the rate of no less than one and times the employee regular rate of pay for any work in excess of the regularly scheduled hours established by the alternative workweek agreement and for all hours worked in excess of per week,and at the rate of no less than double the employee regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of hours per day and for any work in excess of hours on days worked other than workdays that are regularly scheduled under the alternative workweek.the same prohibition of pyramiding different types of overtime pay,found at section,is contained in section.
example a secret ballot election results in the adoption of an alternative workweek schedule under which the affected workers are to work four ten hour days,for a total of hours work each workweek.no overtime compensation is required when the employees work the hours that are authorized by this alternative workweek schedule.on occasion,the employer assigns extra work to these employees.this extra work is not assigned on a regular or recurring basis.one workweek,an employee working under this alternative workweek schedule works the following hours hours,hours,hours,hours,hours.there is no overtime for monday or thursday since the employee did not work any extra hours,outside his or her regularly scheduled hours,on those days the extra two hours worked on tuesday must be paid at time and a half the extra four hours worked on wednesday are paid at time and a half for the first two hours and at double time for the next two hours since those final two hours were beyond hours in a day the extra hours worked on friday must be paid at time and a half for the first eight hours since those hours were not regularly scheduled,as friday is not a regularly scheduled workday and at double time for the final two hours since these two hours exceeded eight hours on a scheduled workday.
we have been asked whether ab permits alternative workweek schedules of less than hours per week.section a permits the adoption of a regularly scheduled alternative workweek that authorizes work by the affected employees for no longer than hours per day within a hour workweek.the word within means any workweek of no more than hours,and would include workweeks of less than hours.however,paragraph b of order manufacturing contains a unique provision,not found in any other wage order,that requires an alternative work schedule to provide for not more than ten hours per day within a workweek of not less than hours.thus,employers covered by order are prohibited from establishing an alternative schedule of less than hours per workweek.all other employers,under ab,can establish alternative schedules that provide for up to hours in a workweek.the iwc,of course,may consider amending the language in order to conform to the more liberal provisions of the statute.
we have received many inquiries as to whether ab prohibits the adoption or retention of a alternative work schedule that does not provide for the payment of overtime.under a schedule,employees will work hours a day from monday through thursday,hours on friday,followed by a week of hours worked each day on monday through thursday,and no hours worked on friday.if the employer has not a workday and workweek,the standard midnight to midnight workday based on the calendar day used by dlse for enforcement purposes will result in hours worked the first workweek of this schedule,followed by hours worked the second workweek.and since a regularly scheduled alternative workweek adopted by a secret ballot election can not provide for more than hours regularly scheduled within a workweek,the fact that every other workweek is regularly scheduled to exceed hours would defeat the alternative workweek,and mandate payment of overtime for all hours worked in excess of in a day or in a week.but by predesignating the workday to run from noon to noon,and by predesignating the workweek to run from friday noon to next friday at noon,the employer can establish a schedule that does not exceed hours in a workweek,in that the eight hours worked every other friday are split in half,with the hours worked before noon falling into the first workweek,and the friday hours worked after noon falling into the second workweek.
of course,as with any other alternative workweek schedule under section,the schedule can not be unilaterally imposed by the employer but must be or have been adopted by the requisite vote in a secret ballot election to allow for this schedule without the payment of daily overtime.
prohibited reduction of regular rate of pay subsection c of section provides that an employer shall not reduce an employee regular rate of hourly pay as a result of the adoption,repeal or nullification of an alternative workweek schedule.this is a new protection,that never before existed in the labor code or any iwc order.this prohibition only applies to reductions in the regular rate of pay that are implemented on or after january,it does not apply to any reduction implemented prior to january.the prohibition applies to repeals resulting either from an election or from an employer unilateral decision,and to the nullification of any alternative workweek schedule by operation of ab.the prohibition would be enforceable by filing an individual wage claim or a civil action to recover unpaid wages owed to a worker or group of workers based on the wage rates that were in effect prior to the unlawful reduction,and through injunctive relief.
reasonable accommodation under subsection d,an employer must make a reasonable effort to find a work schedule of no more than eight hours in a workday to accommodate any employee who was eligible to vote in the election that established the alternative workweek schedule,if such employee is unable to work the hours established by the election.employers do not have a duty to make such an effort on behalf of any employee who is hired after the election was held,except for a duty to explore any available alternative means of accommodating the religious beliefs of those employees whose religious observances conflict with an adopted alternative workweek schedule.however,the statute permits the employer to provide a work schedule of no more than eight hours in a workday to any employee who is hired after the adoption of an alternative workweek schedule if that employee is unable to work the alternative schedule.
reporting the results of the election subsection e requires the employer to report the results of any such election regardless of the outcome of the election to the division of labor statistics and research dlsr within days after the results are final.ab does not indicate whether the failure to comply with this reporting requirement could invalidate the result of the election.we would expect the iwc to address this issue in its regulations.any employer covered by reinstated order manufacturing industry is subject to an additional requirement,unique to that order,that no agreement for an alternative workweek shall be valid until it is filed with dlse.thus,employers under order must report election results to both dlsr and dlse,and such employers can not implement an alternative workweek schedule without first reporting the election results to dlse.
presently existing bargained alternative work schedules 
subsection f of section provides that any presently existing alternative workweek schedule that was adopted pursuant to iwc wage orders,or shall be null and void,except for an alternative workweek that meets all of the following conditions 
it provides for no more than hours of work in a workday except for hour workdays that are allowed in the health care industry,as specified in subsection g,discussed below.
it was adopted by a vote of the affected employees in a secret ballot election.
the election was held pursuant to wage orders of the industrial welfare commission in effect prior to.
ab thus puts an end to any alternative workweek schedules that were unilaterally established by employers pursuant to the wage orders,except for certain voluntary arrangements as specified in subsection h of section,discussed below.alternative workweek schedules that were adopted under wage orders that were not amended in those that left daily overtime undisturbed should meet the prerequisites for a regularly scheduled alternative workweek under ab,so they are not nullified by operation of statute.these prerequisites are a maximum of ten hours work in a workday,a maximum of hours in a workweek,adoption by a secret ballot election with a vote of approval by the affected employees,with the election conducted pursuant to the procedures specified in the applicable wage order.
we have received many inquiries from employers that unilaterally adopted an alternative workweek under the wage orders,and that now wish to establish alternative workweek schedules that will not be nullified upon the effective date of ab.of course,those employers could wait until january,to propose alternative workweek schedules that may then be adopted by a vote in secret ballot elections conducted pursuant to the procedures specified in the applicable reinstated wage order.but many employers would like to establish a alternative workweek schedule in advance of january,so as to allow for a seamless transition.these employers have focused on the requirement that the election have been held pursuant to wage orders that were in effect prior to,and have asked whether this means that to be valid and not subject to nullification,the election must have been held or be held on a date when the applicable wage order was or will be in effect that is,prior to january,or after january,or have been held or be held at any time until the iwc adopts the wage orders,including the period until december,while the wage orders remain in effect,as long as the employer complied with the election procedures including requirements for employee notification,contained in the applicable wage order.we believe that the intent of ab is best effectuated by construing this ambiguous provision in accordance with the latter interpretation,so as to allow employers who are presently subject to a wage order to conduct an election by following all of the procedures provided in the applicable wage order.
finally,turning to those alternative workweek schedules that will not be nullified by operation of ab on january,subsection f provides that any type of alternative workweek schedule that is authorized by this code and that was in effect on january,may be repealed by the affected employees.procedures for repeal will be contained in the iwc wage orders.until those orders are adopted,procedures for repeal are governed by the applicable wage order.under dlse enforcement policy,an employer that wants to terminate an alternative workweek schedule can do so unilaterally,without holding a repeal election,after providing reasonable advance notice to its employees.if the iwc wishes to prohibit such unilateral repeals,it may do so through its regulations.
two important exceptions to subsection f of labor code 
the first exception to subsection f is found at subsection g,which deals with the health care industry.it provides that an alternative workweek schedule in the health care industry adopted by a vote of affected employees in a secret ballot election pursuant to wage order as amended in,or wage order as amended in,that provided for workdays exceeding hours but not exceeding hours in a day without the payment of overtime compensation,shall be valid until july.of course,if the alternative workweek schedule adopted pursuant to such an election provided for a workday that does not exceed hours,it would meet the criteria set out in subsection f,and it would therefore remain valid indefinitely.
several health industry employers have asked whether there is any possibility,under ab,for extending alternative workweek schedules that provide for hour workdays past july.at present,it would appear that any regularly scheduled bargained alternative workweek in the health care industry that provides for workdays that exceed hours will be nullified by operation of the statute following july,and unless the affected employees adopt an alternative workweek schedule that comports with ab limits and any provisions that may be adopted by the iwc,the basic overtime requirements of section will apply.
the second exception to subsection f of labor code is found at subsection h,which permits an individual employee to continue to work an alternative workweek schedule without the payment of daily overtime compensation,even if the schedule was established by the employer unilaterally,without an election,under the wage orders,if all of the following conditions exist 
the employee was employed on july,and 
the employee was then voluntarily working an alternative workweek schedule,and 
this schedule did not provide for work in excess of hours of work in a workday,and 
this employee makes a written request to the employer to continue working this schedule,and 
the employer approves the written request.
employees hired after july,will not be eligible for this bargained,ballot approved,individual alternative workweek schedule.if the employee,as of july,was working an alternative workweek with regularly scheduled workdays of more than hours,this option is unavailable,even if the employee and employer are now willing to limit the workday to hours.a written request to continue working this individual alternative workweek without payment of daily overtime will only be effective as to work performed after the date of the request the employer must pay the applicable daily overtime compensation for any work performed prior to the date that the written request is executed and approved.finally,because this exception allows for individual voluntary agreements,dlse has determined that the employee can,at anytime,revoke his or her written request to continue working this sort of alternative workweek schedule,in which case the employer must henceforth pay daily overtime in accordance with the provisions of ab.
individual time and the flexible workweek the most significant new aspect of work time flexibility is found at section of ab,which adds section to the labor code,to provide a mechanism for individual employees to take time off to attend to their personal needs,and to then make up that time within the same workweek,without the payment of overtime compensation except for hours worked in excess of in one workday or in one workweek.the employee benefits by not losing any pay,or incurring any loss of sick or vacation time,for the time off and the employer benefits by not having to pay daily overtime to the employee who is working more than eight hours but not more than hours in a day in order to make up the missed time.
time will not count in computing the total number of hours worked in a day for the purposes of the overtime requirements specified in section the basic overtime law and section the provisions for regularly scheduled alternative workweeks only if the hours are worked in the same workweek in which the work time was lost.also,the employer will not have to pay overtime compensation for the work only to the extent that the employee performing the work does not exceed hours of work in a workday or hours of work in a workweek.in other words,when an employee works more than eight hours in a workday because the employee is performing work that day,any work performed in excess of hours that day must be paid at the appropriate overtime rate.likewise,any work performed in excess of hours during the workweek must be paid as overtime.
under section,make up time is permitted if the employer approves the employee signed written request to make up time that has been or that will be lost as a result of the employee personal needs.the employer may choose to grant or deny any request to work make up time.a separate written request is needed each time the employee asks to make up work time pursuant to this section.the request need not be made prior to the employee taking off the time,but must be made prior to the performance of the make up work in order to ensure that the employer is not liable for daily overtime for the make up hours.any daily overtime hours worked prior to a request to perform make up work can not be credited as make up time,but rather,will constitute time for which overtime compensation must be paid.and most importantly,time that is taken off in one workweek can only be made up during that same workweek if it is worked in a different workweek than the when it was taken,the daily overtime hours worked must be paid as overtime.
the statute expressly prohibits employers from encouraging or otherwise soliciting an employee to request an employer approval to take personal time off and make up the work hours within the same week pursuant to this section.this does not prohibit employers from merely informing workers of the provisions of this statute however,it clearly does prohibit employers from suggesting,recommending or certainly,ordering that workers request make up time.
we have been asked whether time can be worked in advance of the date that the time being made up is lost.there is nothing in the statute that would prohibit this,so long as the work is performed during the same workweek in which the time is lost.thus,if an employee knows that he or she will need to take time off to attend to personal needs on the last day of the workweek,the employee can this time in advance,during the preceding days of that workweek.the question that then follows is does the employer have any overtime exposure if that worker,after working the time,decides not to take the time off,and works the time that he or she had planned on taking off the answer to this would depend on whether the employee ended up working more than hours in that workweek.if so,section requires payment of overtime for all hours worked in excess of in a workweek.if the employee did not end up working more than hours that workweek,the employer would not be liable for any daily overtime provided that the employee did not work more than hours in any workday,and that any hours worked in excess of eight in any one workday were worked as time.the reason the employer would not be liable for any daily overtime under this scenario is because the employer agreed to allow the employee to work these extra daily hours without payment of daily overtime in order to time that the employee asserted would be lost later in the workweek due to the employee personal obligations,and the employer relied on the employee assertion in granting this request.on the other hand,if an employer revokes its previously granted permission to allow an employee to perform work after the work is performed,but before the time off is taken,the employer will be liable for all daily overtime,and the extra daily hours worked will not be treated as time.
finally,we have been asked whether these time provisions apply to employees working under regularly scheduled alternative workweeks.the answer is yes,section time provisions expressly apply to workers covered by section,the basic overtime law,and to workers covered by section,which authorizes alternative workweek schedules.of course,a worker employed under a valid alternative workweek schedule which provides for hours of work in a workday without payment of overtime will only be able to work one extra hour of time during such a workday before exceeding the hour per day cap that triggers overtime for all subsequent time worked that day.because time applies to workers employed under an alternative workweek schedule,such workers may perform up to hours of work on a day that they are not regularly scheduled to work without the payment of overtime compensation that would otherwise be required,pursuant to section b,for working on a day other than a regularly scheduled workday.
examples an employee scheduled to work an eight hour workday can work an additional three hours that day as time without the payment of daily overtime.an employee scheduled to work a six hour workday can work an additional five hours that day as time without the payment of daily overtime.an employee scheduled to not work at all on a specific day can work up to hours of time that day without the payment of overtime,whether the worker is covered by the basic overtime law or is working under an alternative workweek schedule pursuant to section.on the other hand,an employee not covered by a regularly scheduled alternative workweek pursuant to section,who is nonetheless scheduled to work nine hours in a workday,can work two hours of time that day without payment of overtime for the time,but must be paid overtime for the one overtime hour of scheduled,work.if this same employee works three hours of time,resulting in hours of work that workday,the employee must be paid two hours of overtime at the rate of one and times the regular rate one hour for the ninth hour of scheduled work,and another hour for the time that exceeded the eleventh hour of work that day.finally,if this same employee works four hours of time,resulting in hours of work that workday,the employee must be paid hours of overtime at time and a half,and one hour of overtime at twice the regular rate of pay.
the collective bargaining agreement provision section of ab adds section to the labor code,which makes ab overtime and meal period provisions inapplicable to employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement cba,if the cba expressly provides for the wages,hours and working conditions of the employees,and provides a regular hourly wage rate for those employees of not less than percent more than the state minimum wage,and provides premium wage rates for all overtime hours worked.if a cba meets these provisions for the,the workers covered by the cba are not entitled to statutory overtime rather,they will receive premium pay for all overtime hours worked,as provided by the cba.this is somewhat different from prior law,in that the under the iwc orders had required payment of a regular rate of at least an hour more than the state minimum wage and under the new percent above formula,the required regular rate would now be seven dollars and and a half cents per hour.and of course,future increases in the state minimum wage will automatically result in increases in the regular rate required for the.if the requirements are met,workers are paid for all hours worked in accordance with the provisions of the cba.it should be remembered,however,that there is no cba opt out under the fair labor standards act,which requires payment of overtime at the rate of one and one half the regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of in a workweek.
the term premium wage rates are not defined in ab or in the iwc orders.the term has always been interpreted to mean any wage rate in excess of the applicable straight time regular hourly rate of pay.there is no indication that the legislature intended this term to be interpreted in any other manner.indeed,it would make no sense to interpret the term as synonymous with a statutory overtime rate such as one and a half times the regular rate,since the very purpose of an provision is to allow for an alternative to the minimum standard that would otherwise be required by statute.the amount by which the premium exceeds the regular rate is left to the parties to negotiate we will recognize any rate higher than the regular rate as a premium.
we have received several inquiries regarding the meaning,within section,of the term all overtime hours.the one thing it can not mean is all hours worked in excess of eight in a day without regard to any definition of overtime that might be contained in the cba,since such a meaning would prohibit unions from collectively bargaining for the very same alternative workweek schedules that workers could adopt under ab is,work schedules of up to hours a day and hours a day in the health care industry without the payment of daily overtime or premium pay.there is nothing to indicate that the legislature intended such a peculiar result.the iwc regulations may provide further guidance on the parameters of the cba.
as with any other wage claims that are filed with dlse by employees covered by a cba,any claims for overtime where a cba is involved must be reviewed by dlse legal in accordance with the consent decree in livadas bradshaw.
administrative,executive and professional exemption section of ab adds section to the labor code.this is the section that codifies,with some very significant changes from prior law,the administrative,executive,and professional exemptions from overtime.first,there are two ways in which ab merely codifies california law.as was the case under the iwc orders,there is no exemption,no matter how highly the employee may be paid,unless the employee is primarily engaged in exempt work,and the term primarily is defined as more than the employee work time.thus,state law continues to differ from federal law,which is less protective of workers in that under federal law,the focus is on the employee primary duty,and an employee may be found to have a primary duty as a manager even if the worker spends most of his or her work time performing tasks.in contrast,state law looks to what the worker is engaged in,that is,what is the worker physically doing.
ab also codifies california fixed workweek method for calculating overtime compensation owed to a salaried employee,a method that was approved by the courts years ago in the skyline homes case.under this method,the salary paid to a salaried employee only covers the hours of the workweek it does not serve to compensate the worker for any overtime hours worked.this weekly salary must be divided by to establish a regular hourly rate of pay,which is then the basis for all overtime calculations.overtime hours worked are then paid at either one and one half times the regular rate,or double the regular rate,as required.this contrasts with the less protective federal fluctuating workweek method,under which a salary paid to a employee is deemed to cover all hours worked including overtime hours so the more overtime hours worked,the lower the regular rate of pay,and so that overtime hours worked are only paid at the employee regular rate of pay.ab does not change the method of computing overtime compensation for employees who are paid on a commission or piece rate basis which under both state and federal law is based on a fluctuating workweek whereby total weekly commission or piece rate earnings are divided by the total number of hours including overtime hours worked in the week to compute the regular rate of pay and overtime hours are then compensated at this regular rate of pay.
to be sure,ab brings about some very significant changes in the administrative,executive and professional exemptions.under prior law,there was no minimum remuneration or salary requirement for the professional exemption.under labor code section,the professional exemption is subject to the same minimum salary requirement as the administrative and executive exemption.the remuneration requirement under prior law is now changed to a requirement of a monthly salary,equivalent to no less than twice the minimum wage for full time work defined as employment for hours per week,which would now require a salary of at least per month.since the required salary is set as a multiple of the minimum wage,future increases in the state minimum wage will result in corresponding increases in the threshold salary for the exemption.the value of any payments in kind,or other forms of remuneration such as employer provided meals or lodging can not be used as a credit against this required minimum salary.the legislative intent in switching from remuneration to salary was to explicitly adopt the federal salary basis test,to the extent that it is consistent with california wage and hour law.thus,employees who are paid on the basis of an hourly wage,or commissions,or piece rates,can not be exempt from payment of overtime under the administrative,executive or professional exemptions.
we have been asked whether a employee working in a bona fide executive,administrative,or professional capacity that is,one who is primarily engaged in such exempt work can be exempt if he or she is paid a monthly salary that is less than the salary equivalent of twice the minimum wage,but not less than the applicable percentage of the minimum monthly required salary,based on the proportion of time that the employee works in relation to a full time,forty hour week.for example,can an attorney employed by a law firm on a hour per week basis,be exempt if paid a monthly salary of the answer to that question is no we do not believe that this monthly minimum required salary can be reduced,even if the ostensibly exempt employee is scheduled to work less than hours per week.an exempt employee is expected to exercise discretion and independent judgment in order to decide the number of hours to devote to a particular task,and can not be expected to confine his or her work hours to a set schedule,as any such limitation on hours worked would be inconsistent with the discretion and independent judgment that is the hallmark of exempt work.section a requirement of a monthly salary equivalent to no less than two times the state minimum wage for employment,simply serves to set the amount of the required monthly salary as a multiple of the minimum wage and not to permit reductions of this monthly threshold salary for employees who work less than hours per workweek.
as was the case under the iwc orders,section f provides that the professional exemption shall not apply to registered nurses.another bill that was passed and signed by the governor this year,ab,provides that the professional exemption shall not apply to pharmacists,a category of workers who formerly were expressly exempted,under the iwc orders,as licensed professionals.
ab does not define the duties that characterize exempt work.section a gives the iwc the task of reviewing the duties which meet the test of the exemption,and then,if the iwc chooses,it may convene public hearings to adopt or modify regulations pertaining to these duties.under the existing iwc orders,the duties are spelled out only in the broadest terms work which is primarily intellectual,managerial or creative,and which requires the exercise of discretion and independent judgment.in enforcing the iwc orders,dlse has out of necessity come to rely upon the federal regulations,and federal case law,which define the terms executive,administrative and professional for purposes of the exemptions,to the extent that these federal definitions are not inconsistent with state law.we do not know yet whether the iwc will decide whether to adopt specific definitions for these terms.absent the adoption of such definitions,we will continue to follow existing dlse interpretations,as set out in our opinion letters,of these terms.see,for example,opinion letters dated and.
meal period requirements section of ab adds section to the labor code,which codifies the requirements for meal periods during the workday.these provisions are somewhat confusing,and there have been many questions as to whether ab puts an end to meal periods.that term is used in the iwc orders to describe a meal period during which the employee is not relieved of all duty regardless of the length of time of the meal period,or that is less than minutes long regardless of whether the employee is relieved of all duty.under the iwc orders,an meal period is permitted only when the nature of the work prevents the employee from being relieved of all duty,and when the employee and employer have entered into a written agreement permitting an meal period.an employee must be paid for the entire meal period that is,it constitutes time worked.
we believe that ab does not prohibit meal periods.had the legislature intended to accomplish that,the bill would have expressly done so.instead,the term meal period is not found anywhere in the text of ab.section provides that a meal period of no less than minutes must be provided to any employee who is employed for a work period of more than five hours per day.however,this meal period can be waived by mutual consent of the employee and the employer if the total daily work period does not exceed six hours.a second meal period of no less than minutes must be provided to any employee who is employed for a work period of more than hours in a day,however,this second meal period can be waived by mutual consent if the worker does not work more than hours that day,and if the first meal period was not waived.of course,since the first meal period can not be waived if there were more than work hours in a day,it would seem that no employee working more than hours in a day could have waived the first meal period.in any event,whenever a worker is employed for more than hours in a day,the second meal period can not be waived.
the confusion over whether ab ends meal periods stems from a misunderstanding of the term meal period and the meaning of the provisions that limit the ability to mutually agree to a waiver of the meal period.the term meal period includes both the paid and unpaid variety.if the prerequisites as defined in the iwc orders for an meal period are met,then an meal period may be established.even though the employee is required to work during the meal period,the employee must be given the opportunity,while working if necessary,to eat his or her meal.that is what can not be waived,if the work period exceeds six hours,and if an meal period has been properly established.on the other hand,if the prerequisites for an meal period have not been met,the limits on waiver of the meal period apply to the employee right to take an meal period.
the iwc will continue to have an important role in defining meal period requirements,as section of ab adds section to the labor code,which provides that notwithstanding any other provision of law,the iwc may adopt or amend regulations regarding meal periods,break periods,and days of rest.
day of rest requirement ab does not amend existing labor code sections and,which provide that every employee is entitled to one day rest in seven,and that no employer shall cause its employees to work more than six days in seven.
section of ab makes some minor changes to labor code,which,among other things,permits an accumulation of days of rest when the nature of the employment reasonably requires that the employee work seven or more consecutive days,providing that in each calendar month the employee receives days of rest equivalent to one day rest in seven.the most significant change to section is that it now specifies that employees covered by iwc order agricultural occupations are not covered by this chapter of the labor code starting with labor code,except for labor code section,so that employers of such employees will be subject to civil citations for violations of the overtime provisions of order.
section of ab makes some minor changes to labor code,which provides that sections and,the sections which mandate one day rest in seven,shall not apply to any employer or employee when the total hours of employment do not exceed hours in a week or six hours in any one day of that week.we have been asked whether an employee who works such a schedule would be entitled to seventh day premium pay,pursuant to section.the answer is yes,seventh day premium pay is required under section if the worker works seven consecutive days in a workweek,regardless of the total number of hours worked during that workweek or during any of the days during that workweek.section does not exempt workers from the requirements of seventh day premium pay.
enforcement as discussed earlier in this memo,section of ab adds section to the labor code,which establishes a civil penalty citation system as a mechanism for enforcing the overtime provisions of both ab and the iwc orders.the citation may include a civil penalty that is payable to the state set for an initial violation,which we interpret as a first citation,at per employee per pay period for which the employee was underpaid and for a subsequent violation,at per employee per pay period in which the employee was underpaid,and an additional amount representing the unpaid overtime wages owed to the employees,with any such wages that are recovered to be paid by dlse to the affected employees.by allowing for inclusion of unpaid wages as a component of the amount assessed,overtime citations differ from minimum wage civil penalty citations under labor code,which do not include an unpaid wage component.
this unpaid overtime wage component of the assessment provides dlse with a significant enforcement mechanism,and a means of expeditiously pursuing the collection of unpaid overtime wages.
employer appeal rights section b provides that the procedures for issuing,contesting and enforcing judgments for civil penalty citations for overtime violations shall be the same as the procedures governing minimum wage citations under labor code.thus,an employer will have business days from the date the citation is issued to request an appeal hearing.the hearing must then be held within days of a timely request.the decision of the labor commissioner hearing officer,either affirming,dismissing or modifying the proposed assessment,must be served on the parties within days of the conclusion of the hearing.the employer then has days from the date the decision is served to file a petition for a writ of administrative mandate.if no writ petition is timely filed,then the labor commissioner decision becomes due and payable,and is entered as a clerk judgement.if a writ petition is filed,the court will review the administrative record to determine whether the evidence presented at the hearing before the labor commissioner supports the findings and whether the labor commissioner decision correctly applies the law.since court review is by way of writ,rather than de novo trial,it is critical to present the necessary evidence at the administrative hearing to establish an adequate administrative record.
of course,the civil penalty provision of section is not the only means available to dlse for enforcing a worker right to overtime compensation.dlse can still prosecute overtime violations as it has in the past,by filing a civil action pursuant to labor code.dlse also can,of course,continue to adjudicate individual employee wage claims through the section berman hearing process.
we have received several inquiries as to whether willfulness is a required element for the issuance of a civil penalty for overtime violations.the answer is no,there is no requirement of willful underpayments.the word willful or intentional does not appear in section.had the legislature intended to make willfulness a requirement,they would have do so expressly,as in labor code section.it is therefore our conclusion that purported absence of willfulness is not a defense to the imposition of penalties under section.
we have also been asked whether meal period violations will be subject to civil penalty citations under section.at first blush,the statute authorizes the issuance of a citation for a violation of a section of this chapter or any provision regulating hours and days of work in any iwc order,so that violations of the meal period requirements of section would appear to be subject to civil penalty citations.but the manner in which civil penalties are calculated or per underpaid employee per pay period in which the employee was underpaid,plus the amount of the underpaid it clear that a violation of meal period requirements will not result in the imposition of a civil penalty under section,unless the meal period violation is coupled with a failure to pay the employee for the time worked during the unlawfully deprived meal period.in other words,as long as the employee was paid at the appropriate regular or overtime rate for the time worked during what should have been his or her meal period,the employer is not subject to a penalty.however,if an employee is not given a meal period as required by section,and is not paid for such time worked either at the regular rate or at the overtime rate,whatever may be required,a penalty citation may be issued in accordance with section.
we have also received inquiries as to whether penalties will be assessed against an employer payroll clerk,payroll supervisor,or a payroll processing service for failure to issue checks that contain required overtime compensation.this question is prompted by the expansive language of section,which makes any employer or other person acting on behalf of an employer subject to a penalty citation.regardless of the expansive sweep of this language,dlse does not intend to issue penalty citations to any individual persons who do not formulate policies that lead to of required overtime compensation.in general,penalties will be issued against the legal entity that is the employer.to the extent that dlse may,on appropriate occasions,decide to go beyond this legal entity in imposing liability,we would not anticipate going beyond the definition of employer found in each of the iwc orders.that definition includes any person who directly or indirectly,or through an agent or any other person,employs or exercises control over the wages,hours,or working conditions of any person.thus,in appropriate instances,corporate officers or managers may be included as defendants in a penalty citation pursuant to section.
labor code section,which was not amended by ab,offers another method of enforcing ab provisions.section provides that any person who violates this chapter,which now includes the overtime provisions of ab,is guilty of a misdemeanor.
special industries existing provisions of the labor code contain special workday or workweek requirements or exemptions relating to employees of ski establishments section,commercial fishing boats section,licensed hospitals section,and stable employees engaged in the raising,feeding or training of racehorses section.sections to of ab amends these statutes to provide for their repeal effective july,unless the legislature enacts a statute prior to that date extending these special provisions.of course,the iwc may choose to maintain,or modify,the exemptions for these industries pursuant to labor code section b.
