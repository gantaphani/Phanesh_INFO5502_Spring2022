in and,two classes of plaintiffs,represented by the alliance to end repression and the american civil liberties union respectively,brought suit under against the united states and the city of chicago.the suit charged that the fbi chicago office and the chicago police department intelligence division were violating the class members first amendment rights by overly intrusive and improperly motivated investigations of alleged subversive activities.in,before a trial could be held,the defendants agreed to a consent decree,which was approved by the district court the following year,imposing detailed restrictions on the defendants investigative authority.the decree did not,however,vest monitoring or other responsibilities in the plaintiffs or their lawyers.
in,long after this court had interpreted the decree as imposing fewer restrictions on the fbi than the district court had thought it did,cir en banc,the city asked the district court to modify it to make the restrictions on the city less onerous.the district court refused even though the judge who had approved the decree in the first place had said it was so strict that she would have awarded the plaintiffs such draconian relief even if they had proved all their allegations in a trial.at.
the city appealed from the refusal to modify the decree.it pointed out that it had complied with the decree throughout the entire period of almost two decades in which it had been in force,that during this period the supreme court and this court had become ever more emphatic that the federal judiciary must endeavor to return the control of local governmental activities to local government at the earliest possible opportunity compatible with achievement of the objectives of the decree that transferred that control to the federal courts,and that the culture of law enforcement in chicago and the character of the threats to public safety by ideologically motivated criminals had so far changed as to make much of the decree obsolete.we agreed with the city and ordered that its motion be granted in its entirety.cir.we pointed out that the decree was frustrating the efforts of the police to cope with the problems of today because earlier generations of police had coped improperly with the problems of yesterday.because of what the police department red squad had done many years ago,the chicago police would,unless the decree was modified,labor indefinitely under severe handicaps from which other police forces were free.under the modified decree,which forbids investigations intended to impede freedom of expression and requires the city to commission independent periodic audits to determine the city compliance,first amendment rights would,we held,be secure,while under the original decree the public safety was insecure and the prerogatives of local government scorned.and this was before the terrorist attacks on the united states of september,brought about a renewed appreciation of the weight of security considerations in determining the point of balance between safety and liberty that we call our civil liberties.
all this is by way of background to the present appeal and,in which the aclu,however,does not join,which is by the city from an award by the district court to the class representatives of more than million in attorneys fees.that is on top of at least in fees awarded and paid for legal services rendered earlier in the proceedings the true figure is undoubtedly higher but the parties records are incomplete,doubtless because of the great age of the case.
the million award is for the following legal services rendered between and two proceedings for contempt of the decree,which failed the opposition,just described,which also failed,to the modification of the decree and efforts,which also bore no fruit so far as anyone can say,to monitor the city compliance with the fruit,that is,except the failed contempt proceedings.the order is appealable now because the activities for which the fees were awarded are complete in a sense that will become clearer in our discussion of the merits.
the awarding of attorneys fees under is governed by b,which authorizes such awards only to the prevailing party.see buckhannon board care home,west virginia of health human resources,d.the plaintiffs argue that by virtue of obtaining the consent decree in the first place they became the prevailing party for the entire life of the decree which contains no sunset provision indeed,beyond,for they contend that even if the decree had been dissolved in,rather than just being modified,they would be entitled to the legal fees they incurred in opposing that result,provided only that the fees were reasonable in amount and the opposition to dissolution not frivolous.they base this claim primarily on the supreme court decision in pennsylvania delaware valley citizens council for clean air,d,which allowed the reimbursement of attorneys fees for postjudgment proceedings brought by the plaintiffs lawyers.but those postjudgment proceedings were at least partly successful.these plaintiffs postjudgment proceedings were not.they argue that they should be penalized for failure because they were to oppose the modification of the decree,to monitor compliance with the decree before and after it was modified,and to bring contempt proceedings against anyone who they thought might be violating it.in support of the argument they cite our decision in ustrak fairman,cir,where we said that the plaintiff,having won a judgment in the district court,had no choice but to incur attorneys fees to defend the judgment in our court.but in that case,too,the plaintiff was entirely,but enough to make him the prevailing party.had he lost on appeal he would not have been entitled to any award of fees.
in only two classes of case governed by section b or similar provisions see hensley eckerhart,d has a plaintiff who obtained no relief in postdecree proceedings nevertheless been awarded fees for those proceedings.the first class consists of cases in which the consent decree itself authorized the court to award fees to the plaintiff that would be incurred in disputes brought to the court in the wake of the decree.plyler evatt,cir turner orr,nn,cir.the contractual entitlement there is none in our case supplemented or superseded the statutory one.granted,plyler contains language suggesting that the case would probably have been decided the same way without benefit of the decretal provision.similar dicta can be found in other cases as well,such as cody hillard,cir san francisco naacp san francisco unified school district,cir,and jenkins missouri,cir.but partly by its approving reference at to our decision in ustrak,where,to repeat,the plaintiff had some success,and partly by its observing that the plaintiffs had merely not been successful in detail,the court in plyler indicated that it thought the plaintiffs efforts had contributed to compliance with the decree,and thus had not been fruitless after all.indeed,the court noted that the defendant had even appealed part of the district court order in favor of the plaintiffs.id.at.this statement may have been erroneous,see plyler evatt,cir an earlier round,in which the court vacated the district court order in its entirety,but it shows the court thinking.
and likewise in turner the court made clear its belief that the postdecree efforts had been valuable in inducing compliance with the decree,even though they,too,had failed in detail.at bond stanton,cir miller carson,cir.these cases can be thought of as extensions of the principle that a plaintiff is not to be denied full attorneys fees merely because he lost some interim rulings en route to ultimate success.jaffee redmond,cir jenkins missouri,supra,at.such setbacks are inevitable,and a lawyer who nevertheless was sedulous to avoid them might lose a good case through an excess of caution.likewise in postdecree litigation there may be inevitable setbacks en route to victory,partial or complete.but in the present case there has for a decade now been nothing but million dollars worth of legal services poured down the drain.there was not even a disappointing partial success,as there would have bee
