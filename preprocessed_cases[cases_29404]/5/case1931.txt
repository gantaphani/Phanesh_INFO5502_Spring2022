the hospital lien act hla,which appears at civil code sections through,provides that a hospital which provides emergency and ongoing care to a person injured by accident or through the negligent or wrongful conduct of another has a statutory lien,in the amount of the reasonable and necessary charges of the hospital,against any judgment,settlement or compromise received by the patient from a third person who is responsible for his or her injuries.all further statutory citations refer to the civil code unless another code is specified.
in this case,the county of san bernardino hereafter the county provided medical care to martin zavala calderon after he was injured in a car accident in which the other driver was at fault.the parties concur that the hospital has a valid lien for the reasonable value of its services to calderon.the principal issue on appeal is whether the county lien for services rendered beginning on july,notice of which was given to the responsible third party on november,takes priority over a lien for attorney fees which was created by contract between calderon and his attorney on july.in a trial on the county action for declaratory relief based on stipulated facts,the trial court held that the hospital lien was created on november,upon the giving of notice.because the lien for attorney fees was created before the hospital lien,the court determined that the attorney lien has priority over the hospital lien.
the construction of a statute and its applicability to undisputed facts are questions of law which we review de novo.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d,international engine parts,feddersen cal th,d.we conclude that the hla does not provide that hospital liens have first priority over competing liens regardless of the time of creation of the lien,and that the hospital lien was not created until notice was given on november.accordingly,we will affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural history 
the parties stipulated to the following facts 
calderon received medical treatment at the county arrowhead regional medical center for injuries he suffered in an automobile accident on july.the other driver was at fault in the accident.the reasonable value of the medical services provided to calderon is.

on november,the county notified calderon and parker of its lien for the medical services it rendered in connection with the july accident.
on june,calderon received a settlement in the amount of from the other driver insurance company.if the county lien has priority,it will receive percent of the settlement,or.if parker lien has priority,the county will receive only,according to the parties calculations.
creation and priority of liens under the hla 
as pertinent,the hla provides as follows 
every person,partnership,association,corporation,public entity,or other institution or body maintaining a hospital licensed under the laws of this state which furnishes emergency and ongoing medical or other services to any person injured by reason of an accident or negligent or other wrongful act not covered by division commencing with section or division commencing with section of the labor code,shall,if the person has a claim against another for damages on account of his or her injuries,have a lien upon the damages recovered,or to be recovered,by the person,or by his or her heirs or personal representative in case of his or her death to the extent of the amount of the reasonable and necessary charges of the hospital and any hospital affiliated health facility,as defined in section of the health and safety code,in which services are provided for the treatment,care,and maintenance of the person in the hospital or health facility affiliated with the hospital resulting from that accident or negligent or other wrongful act,emphasis added.
a lien shall not be effective,however,unless a written notice containing the name and address of the injured person,the date of the accident,the name and location of the hospital,the amount claimed as reasonable and necessary charges,and the name of each person,firm,or corporation known to the hospital and alleged to be liable to the injured person for the injuries received,is delivered or is mailed by registered mail,return receipt requested,postage prepaid,to each person,firm,or corporation known to the hospital and alleged to be liable to the injured person for the injuries sustained prior to the payment of any moneys to the injured person,his attorney,or legal representative as compensation for the injuries.the hospital shall,also,deliver or mail by registered mail,return receipt requested,postage prepaid,a copy of the notice to any insurance carrier known to the hospital which has insured the person,firm,or corporation alleged to be liable to the injured person against the liability.the person,firm,or corporation alleged to be liable to the injured person shall,upon request of the hospital,disclose to the hospital the name of the insurance carrier which has insured it against the liability,emphasis added.
any person,firm,or corporation,including,but not limited to,an insurance carrier,making any payment to the injured person,or to his or her attorney,heirs,or legal representative,for the injuries he or she sustained,after the receipt of the notice as provided by section,without paying to the association,corporation,public entity,or other institution or body maintaining the hospital the amount of its lien claimed in the notice,or so much thereof as can be satisfied out of percent of the moneys due under any final judgment,compromise,or settlement agreement after paying any prior liens shall be liable to the person,partnership,association,corporation,public entity,or other institution or body maintaining the hospital for the amount of its lien claimed in the notice which the hospital was entitled to receive as payment for the medical care and services rendered to the injured person.
the county contends that its lien was created,pursuant to section,immediately upon the rendering of services to calderon.calderon and parker contend that,pursuant to section,a lien is created only when the hospital gives notice to the responsible party.
in interpreting a statute,our function is to ascertain the intent of the legislature in enacting the statute and to effectuate the purpose of the statute.we begin with the statute language,giving its words their usual and ordinary meaning,construing them in context.people johnson cal th,d.if the statutory language is unambiguous,we presume that the legislature meant what it said,and construction is unnecessary.ibid.if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,however,the court may consider various extrinsic aids to interpretation.torres parkhouse tire service,cal th,d.ultimately,the court must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.citation.ibid.
the hla is rife with ambiguity see mercy hospital medical center farmers ins.group of companies cal th,d,dis.opn.of baxter,mercy hospital,and its provisions with respect to the creation of the lien are ambiguous as well.unlike some other statutes which provide for liens see,code civ,carroll interstate brands th,d,the hla does not explicitly state that the lien is created only when notice is given.rather,it states that the lien is not effective unless written notice is given before any payment has been made to the injured person,his attorney,or legal representative as compensation for his injuries.for the reasons which follow,we conclude that the legislature intended that liens under the hla come into existence only upo
