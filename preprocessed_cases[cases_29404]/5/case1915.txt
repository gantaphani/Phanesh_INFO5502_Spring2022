in an action brought under the public safety officers procedural bill of rights act pobra,et,the trial court awarded attorney fees to the riverside sheriff association rsa under code of civil procedure section raising an issue of first impression,the county of riverside argues on appeal that the right to attorney fees is provided exclusively by government code section,subdivision e,and the rsa was not entitled to a fee award under either statute.the county also challenges the amount of fees awarded.
we hold government code section is not the exclusive ground for recovery of attorney fees in a pobra case.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees under section.we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
this appeal has its genesis in a petition for writ of mandate filed by the rsa,alleging that several deputy sheriffs,working at the indio jail,were denied access to rsa employee representatives during a criminal investigation of sexual improprieties with female inmates.
according to the writ petition filed on july,during the county investigation occurring in may and june,several deputy sheriffs,members of the rsa,were denied representation as required by government code section.on june,rsa lawyer sent a letter to the county,demanding compliance with pobra.the county responded on june,that it did not need to comply with pobra because the matter was a criminal investigation and not a personnel matter.contrary to the county assertion in oral argument,the writ petition did not allege the county had admitted its violation but acquiesced in providing representation.rather,rsa alleged the county sent correspondence admitting its failure to provide representation.
consequently,the rsa filed the writ petition,seeking various kinds of relief,including a finding that the county violated pobra by denying the deputy sheriffs their right of representation under government code section,subdivision i.the same allegations were made and relief sought in the amended petition filed august.
in opposing the writ,the county argued there was no pobra violation because pobra does not apply to a strictly criminal investigation,but only to administrative investigations,citing government code section,subdivision i.it further argued that the case relied upon by rsa,california correctional peace officers state of california th,d,was entirely distinguishable because it concerned an administrative investigation conducted under the guise of a criminal investigation.the county relied on another case,alhambra police officers city of alhambra police th,d.
ultimately,the superior court found the county denial of requests for representation constitutes a denial of a specific right guaranteed under i.the court further finds that the county denial of the right to representation was not based on malice,but instead,was done in but was based on an erroneous department policy.that ruling has not been appealed.the superior court granted an injunction prohibiting the county from violating pobra.
rsa then filed a motion for attorney fees in the amount of pursuant to section.the county opposed the motion,which the court granted subject to a motion to tax costs.rsa opposed the county motion to tax costs.the court awarded actual fees and costs of to rsa under baggett gates cal d,baggett and woodland hills residents,city council cal d,finding that this case was a matter of fairly significant concern to all present and future employees of the sheriffs department.and if it results in a published opinion that will be a matter of significant public interest as baggett turned out to be.the court commented further,what we are talking about here is,in fact,a significant interest going to violations of the law.and while it may not be malicious,it still a significant violation that will be important in the future and because it was done for the sheriffs association,and their union consists of probably of people potentially benefited,which is a significant group of people.if the court chooses to take this up because of an appeal and published opinion results,then it will become a matter of general public interest statewide,which is exactly how baggett became significant statewide.
analysisa.rsa right to recover attorney fees 
the county primary argument is that government code section,subdivision e,provides the sole authority for obtaining attorney fees in a pobra action.the relevant language provides upon a finding by a superior court that a public safety department,its employees,agents,or assigns,with respect to acts taken within the scope of employment,maliciously violated any provision of this chapter with the intent to injure the public safety officer,the public safety department shall,for each and every violation,be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed thousand dollars to be awarded to the public safety officer whose right or protection was denied and for reasonable attorney fees as may be determined by the court.
senate bill amended government code section and added the text of subdivision e,effective in.the case of lozada city and county of san francisco th,d comments the legislative history indicates the amendment was a response to an unpublished case in which the court held that the public safety officer was not entitled to damages despite conduct which could be characterized as malicious by the public entity employer.com.on public safety,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended,com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.lozada city and county of san francisco,supra,at,d.
although the county maintains that the legislature considered section when it amended government code section,the county does not identify any legislative history demonstrating an intent to make section the sole basis for attorney fees.the county cites no specific statutory or legal authority to support its contention that a public safety officer can obtain attorney fees only for a malicious violation of the pobra but not under section.
instead,based on ordinary principles of statutory interpretation,the county reasons that,because government code section,subdivision e,is more specific and more recent than section,the former replaced the latter.code civ,san francisco taxpayers board of supervisors cal th,d,los angeles police protective league city of los angeles th,d.the county,however,does not acknowledge that this general rule applies when two acts governing the same subject matter can not be reconciled.id.at,d.but section and government code section,subdivision e are not irreconcilable.
based on our independent review,we do not regard the two statutes as mutually exclusive or government code section,subdivision e,as supplanting section.mart severson th,d.as set forth above,government code section,subdivision e,permits an award of attorney fees where there has been a malicious violation of pobra.section permits an award of attorney fees when a party has secured an important right affecting the public interest.the two different statutes afford different grounds for an award of fees but neither necessarily excludes the other.
the county interpretation of the statutes would limit attorney fees awards only to cases in which there has been a finding of a malicious violation of pobra.but,rather than circumscribing the right to attorney fees,government code section,subdivision e,extends the right to attorney fees to a party who otherwise might not qualify for fees under section t he amendment to government code section was intended to expand,in a limited way,the remedies available to public safety officers suffering violations of their pobra rights.clearly,the legislature intended to expressly authorize a civil penalty and actual damages,as well as attorney fees for malicious violations of the statute.lozada city and county of san francisco,supra,th at,d.we find no support for the county argument that the legislature intended to limit attorney fees awards in pobra cases to malicious violations only.
our conclusion is consistent with a line of cases,beginning with baggett,supra,cal d,which allow recovery of fees under section for pobra actions.henneberque city of culver cit
