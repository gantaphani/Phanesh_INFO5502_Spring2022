background 
factual.the patents in suit 
peter bonutti is an orthopedic surgeon and is a named inventor on numerous patents,including the.the patent,which is entitled surgical devices having a polymeric material with a therapeutic agent and methods for making same,issued on october.the patent,which issued on may,is entitled surgical devices containing a heat bondable material with a therapeutic agent.the have been assigned to bonutti research company marctec.
as this court noted in the prior appeal,the have identical specifications and are directed to a surgical implant in which a polymeric material is bonded by heat to an expandable implant,where the polymer includes a therapeutic agent such as an antibiotic.prior appeal,fed.appx.at.importantly,both patents provide for heat bondable material that is bonded to a surgical device or implant.
a.the claims at issue 
marctec alleged that cordis infringed at least claims,and of the patent.claim,the only independent claim of the patent,recites 
a surgical device for implantation in a body comprising an implant,at least a portion of which is expandable and a polymeric material bonded to the implant,wherein the polymeric material is thermoplastic,includes a therapeutic agent,is and at room temperature,and becomes flowable,tacky,and adherent upon the application of heat.

with respect to the patent,marctec alleged that cordis infringed at least claims,and.claim,the only independent claim of the patent,recites,in pertinent part 
an implant for implantation in a human body comprising a tubular member having a channel and mechanically expandable upon activation of a delivery mechanism and a first component bonded to at least a portion of the tubular member and formed of a heat bondable material that includes a therapeutic agent selected from the group consisting of a tissue ingrowth promoter and an antibiotic,wherein the heat bondable material is and at room temperature and becomes flowable,tacky,and adherent upon the application of heat.
patent ll emphases added.the parties dispute focused,in large part,on the emphasized limitations and the proper construction of the term bonded.the specifications explain that the terms bondable or bondable material refer to any material,suitable for use in surgical applications,which can be softened and made flowable by the application of heat,and which,when softened,will become tacky and bond to other materials and will flow to fill available space.patent ll.patent ll.
b.the prosecution history 
bonutti,through his attorneys,filed the applications that led to the in and.these applications claimed priority from bonutti patent application,which was entitled surgical devices assembled using heat bondable materials.exceptional case order,dist.lexis,at.during prosecution,the patent and trademark office pto rejected bonutti proposed claims as invalid over patent the patent,which issued to julio palmaz,the inventor of the stent.id.
in response to the examiner rejection,bonutti explained that the patent teaches an absorbable polymer coating placed upon wall surfaces of tubular shaped members.joint appendix.in contrast,bonutti claimed implant includes a heat bondable material which is bonded to an implant by the application of heat.id.based on the rejection,bonutti,through his attorneys,amended his patent claims to highlight the fact that the material bonded to the claimed implant is and at room temperature and becomes flowable,tacky,and adherent upon the application of heat.exceptional case order,dist.lexis,at.
bonutti also distinguished the patent on grounds that it discloses an expandable intraluminal vascular graft,or expandable prosthesis for a body passageway applicants,on the other hand,disclose,inter alia,an assembly for use in surgical applications in humans.during claim construction,the district court construed this distinction as a representation that bonutti invention did not include intraluminal grafts,stents.exceptional case order,dist.lexis,at.
the cypher stent 
cordis develops,manufactures,and sells products that are used to treat coronary artery disease,including the accused cypher stent.the cypher stent is a balloon expandable stent which utilizes technology invented by palmaz the same technology that bonutti disclaimed to obtain allowance.exceptional case order,dist.lexis,at.at this stage of the proceedings,it is undisputed that the cypher coating is sprayed onto the stent at room temperature and bonds to it at room temperature not by the application of heat.prior appeal,fed.appx.at.
procedural history 
on november,marctec filed suit against cordis alleging that the cypher stent infringes the patent and the patent.in response,cordis denied infringement and asserted counterclaims seeking declaratory judgment that the are invalid and not infringed.
claim construction 
on february,the district court conducted a markman hearing.in its claim construction briefing and at the hearing,marctec told the court that no construction of the disputed claim terms was needed because each term had a plain and ordinary meaning.in fact,during the markman hearing,counsel for marctec instructed the court that it should focus on the claim language and look to the specification only if there is ambiguity in that language.
on march,the district court issued its claim construction order.marctec,llc johnson johnson,dist.lexis,claim construction order.consistent with our guidance in phillips awh,en banc,the district court considered the language of the claims,the specification,and statements made during the prosecution history in reaching its conclusions regarding the proper construction of the claims.the district court rejected marctec attempts to minimize the role of the specification,noting that,in phillips,we indicated that the specification is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.claim construction order,dist.lexis,at quoting phillips,at.based on the specification and prosecution history,the court construed the term bonded which appears in both of the to mean bonded by the application of heat.id.at.specifically,the court found that h eat bonding is the only form of bonding taught by the patent and during prosecution,bonutti limited his claims to heat bonding to overcome the palmaz patent.id.at.next,the court construed the terms surgical device patent and implant patent to exclude stents.id.at there is no description in the specification of any devices,such as stents.the court further found that bonutti disclaimed stents during prosecution in order to obtain allowance.id.at.
summary judgment of noninfringement 
cordis moved for summary judgment of noninfringement on grounds that the require heat to bond a polymeric material to the implant,while the coating on the cypher stent adheres at room temperature and it is undisputed that the cypher device is a stent,not a surgical device.based on these differences,cordis argued that the cypher stent can not infringe the asserted claims either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents.
in response,marctec argued that cypher coating is,in fact,bonded by heat.in support of this position,marc tec offered expert testimony that spraying the coating onto the cypher stent at nearly the speed of sound would cause an increase in temperature such that heat is involved in bonding the coating to the stent.marctec also pointed to evidence that heat is used in some of the manufacturing steps before the coating is sprayed onto the cypher stent.with respect to the disclaimer of stents,marctec did not dispute that cypher is a stent,but instead argued that nothing in the specification or the prosecution history precluded coverage of stents and that the device described in palmaz patent involved an expandable intraluminal vascular graft,not a stent.
on june,the district court granted cordis motion for summary judgment of noninfringement with respect to all asserted claims of the.in reaching this decision,the court relied on undisputed evidence that cypher coating is sprayed onto the device at room temperature and bonds at room temperature.noninfringement order,d at undisputed evidence establishes that the polymers in cypher coating adhere to the stent at room temperature.because the court construed the asserted claims to require bonding by the application of heat,it concluded that the do not cover the cypher stent.id.at.
with respect to marctec proffered expert testimony,the court found that 
sojka theory that spraying droplets at an unrealistic speed,approaching the speed of sound and unrelated to anything that happens in the cypher coating process would increase the temperature of the droplets in ways that can not be measured for millionths of a second seconds is an untested and untestable theory that is neither reliable nor relevant to the issues at hand.
id.at.accordingly,the court excluded sojka testimony on grounds that it was unreliable and thus inadmissible under daubert merrill dow pharms,and rule of the federal rules of evidence.id.at.the court also rejected marctec arguments that the use of heat at an earher stage of the cypher manufacturing process could satisfy the heat bonding limitations.specifically,the court found that use of heat at other stages of the process has no bearing on whether the polymers are bonded to the device by the application of heat,and that marctec expert testimony to the contrary ignored the court claim construction,is irrelevant to the question of infringement,and is inadmissible under daubert.id.at.
as a separate and independent basis for granting summary judgment,the court found that marctec could not show infringement because it disclaimed stents during prosecution to overcome the palmaz patent and the cypher device is a stent.id.at.
the prior appeal 
marctec appealed the district court decision granting summary judgment in favor of cordis in an august decision,we affirmed the district court construction of the term bonded and the judgment of noninfringement based on that construction.prior appeal,fed.appx.at.first,we found that the specification discussion of bonding,in the context of the invention,is uniformly directed to heat bonding.id.at.looking to the prosecution history,we noted that,d uring prosecution of the patents,the applicants limited the claimed bonding to heat bonding,in order overcome the palmaz prior art,and that l imitations clearly adopted by the applicant during prosecution are not subject to negation during litigation.id.as such,we found that prosecution history estoppel prevented marc tec from asserting a claim scope that includes bonding without the application of heat.although marctec argued that the doctrine of claim differentiation undermined the district court claim construction because dependent claim of the patent specifically describes the polymeric material as one that is bonded to the implant by the application of heat,we rejected this argument on grounds that claim differentiation can not broaden claims beyond the scope that is consistent with the specification and prosecution history.id.finally,we noted that,although marctec argued that heat is used in making the cypher stent,it failed to produce sufficient evidence of the use of heat during the bonding process to avoid summary judgment.id.
as cordis correctly notes,because we affirmed the district court construction that bonded means bonded by the application of heat,we did not reach the district court alternative basis for granting summary judgment,which involved marctec disclaimer of stents.
motion for attorney and expert fees 
after the district court granted summary judgment in its favor,cordis moved to have marctec suit declared exceptional under,and to be compensated for its reasonable attorney and expert witness fees.in its motion,cordis argued that marctec engaged in litigation misconduct by,among other things misrepresenting claim construction law to avoid intrinsic evidence mischaracterizing the district court claim construction and offering junk science that was unreliable,untestable,and had no relevance to this case.cordis further argued that marctec filed a frivolous and baseless lawsuit and acted in bad faith by continuing to pursue its claims without any evidence of infringement.
in a february,decision,which is the subject of the present appeal,the district court agreed with cordis and declared this case exceptional under.specifically,the court found that marctec allegations of infringement were baseless and frivolous,and that marctec acted in bad faith in bringing and maintaining this litigation.exceptional case order,u.dist.lexis,at.the court criticized marctec for ignoring the specification and prosecution history in its claim construction argument,both of which were fatal to marctec proposed construction of the term bonded.id.at.the court found that,even after it had evidence that the cypher stent coating is applied at room temperature and does not bond using heat,marctec continued to pursue its frivolous case by relying on mischaracterizations of the claim construction adopted by this court and expert testimony that did not meet the requirements for scientific reliability or relevance required by fre and daubert.id.at.the court further noted that,w ith bonutti having represented to the pto that the claims exclude stents in order to obtain allowance,marctec can not turn around in litigation and assert the against the cypher stent.id.at.finally,the court held that the fees and expenses incurred by cordis were reasonable in light of the scope of patent litigation,the magnitude of the damages sought by marctec and marctec litigation misconduct.id.at emphasis added.
based on these findings,the district court awarded cordis in attorney fees and expenses under.in addition,pursuant to its inherent powers,the court awarded cordis its expert fees in the amount of.marctec timely appealed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
marctec argues that the district court applied the wrong standard in declaring this case exceptional under and abused its discretion in awarding expert witness fees.we address each argument in turn.for the reasons explained below,we find no error in the district court decision and therefore affirm the attorney and expert fees awarded.
a.the district court did not err in awarding attorney fees under.
a district court has discretion to award reasonable attorney fees to a prevailing party in a patent case if the court determines that the case is exceptional.this discretion is not unbridled,however.old reliable wholesale,cornell,citing wedgetail,huddleston deluxe.given the substantial economic and reputational impact of an award of attorney fees,we must carefully examine the record to determine whether the trial court clearly erred in finding the case exceptional.id.quoting medtronic navigation,brainlab medizinische computersysteme gmbh.
when deciding whether to award attorney fees under,a district court engages in a inquiry.first,the court must determine whether the prevailing party has proved by clear and convincing evidence that the case is exceptional.forest,abbott,see also aspex eyewear clariti eyewear,the party seeking attorney fees under must establish,by clear and convincing evidence,that the case is exceptional.whether the district court applied the correct legal standard under is a question this court reviews de novo,and we review the court exceptional case finding for clear error.forest,at.if the district court finds that the case is exceptional,it must then determine whether an award of attorney fees is justified.cybor fas techs,en banc.we review the district court decision to award attorney fees under an abuse of discretion standard.id.
a case may be deemed exceptional under where there has been willful infringement,fraud or inequitable conduct in procuring the patent,misconduct during litigation,vexatious or unjustified litigation,conduct that violates federal rule of civil procedure,or like infractions.serio us,plastic recovery techs.where,as here,the alleged infringer prevails in the underlying action,factors relevant to determining whether a case is exceptional include the closeness of the question,investigation and discussions with the defendant,and litigation behavior.computer docking station dell,f d.where a patentee prolongs litigation in bad faith,an exceptional finding may be warranted.id.
absent litigation misconduct or misconduct in securing the patent,a district court can award attorney fees under only if the litigation is both brought in subjective bad faith and objectively baseless.old reliable,at quoting brooks furniture,dutailier int l.under this standard,a patentee case must have no objective foundation,and the plaintiff must actually know this.ilor,llc google.whether a case is objectively baseless requires an objective assessment of the merits.id.quoting brooks furniture,at.
on appeal,marctec argues that the district court applied the wrong standard in declaring this an exceptional case under.specifically,marctec claims that the district court erred as a matter of law when it deemed this case exceptional without first finding that the litigation was brought in subjective bad faith,given the fact that inequitable conduct by marctec was never alleged,and given the fact that the district court consciously declined to find marctec guilty of litigation misconduct.appellant br.in response,cordis argues that the district court correctly deemed this case exceptional because the court found that marctec acted in bad faith in pursuing its baseless allegations and engaged in litigation misconduct.appellee br.
for the reasons set forth below,we agree with cordis and find that the district court decision,when read in its entirety,reflects its determination that marctec acted in bad faith in filing a baseless infringement action and continuing to pursue it despite no evidence of infringement and engaged in vexatious and unjustified litigation conduct that unnecessarily prolonged the proceedings and forced cordis to incur substantial expenses.
subjective bad faith objectively baseless 
in its decision awarding fees,the district court stated as follows 
marctec contends that subjective bad faith is needed to find a case exceptional under.that is not the law.as discussed above,evidence that a plaintiff has brought a baseless or frivolous suit is a sufficient basis to require a district court to deem the case exceptional under.
exceptional case order,dist.lexis,at quoting digeo,audible.based on this language,marctec argues that the district court applied the wrong law by failing to recognize that,absent litigation misconduct,a case can not be deemed exceptional without a finding of subjective bad faith.specifically,marctec argues that cordis failed to prove,by clear and convincing evidence,that marctec acted with subjective bad faith the court ignored marctec evidence that it acted in good faith and the litigation was not objectively baseless because marctec advanced substantial and legitimate positions on claim construction.appellant br.we disagree.
regardless of the district court description of the law,it is clear that the court made sufficient factual findings to support the conclusion that marctec filed an objectively baseless lawsuit in bad faith.indeed,the district court specifically found that marctec allegations of infringement were baseless and frivolous and that it acted in bad faith in bringing and pressing this suit when it had no basis for asserting infringement.exceptional case order,dist.lexis,at.although the district court used the term bad faith,and did not specifically state that the bad faith found was subjective,the court language,and its express findings of fact,are consistent with and fully support a finding of subjective bad faith.see eltech.ppg,under the heading bad faith litigation,the court there set forth in detail an overwhelming basis for finding that oxytech brought and maintained this suit in bad faith.though the court did not expressly find that oxytech knew its suit was baseless,many of its findings are compatible with and only with that view.and,importantly,at oral argument,counsel for both parties agreed that courts normally use the term bad faith to mean subjective bad faith 
the district court made several findings supporting its conclusion that marctec knew its allegations were baseless but pursued them anyway.see forest,at.specifically,the court found that 
bonutti amended his claims during patent prosecution to make clear that his invention required the application of heat to a material documents produced to marctec in discovery show that cypher coating is applied and adheres at room temperature without the use of heat.exceptional case order,dist.lexis,emphasis added.
with bonutti having represented to the pto that the claims exclude stents in order to obtain allowance,marctec can not turn around in litigation and assert the against the cypher stent.id.at.
e ven after marctec had documentary evidence establishing that which bonutti told the patent office is required is not used in the cypher manufacturing process and cordis moved for summary judgment on that ground,marctec pursued its frivolous action by relying on mischaracterizations of the claim construction adopted by this court and expert testimony that did not meet the requirements for scientific reliability or relevance required by fre and daubert.id.at.
each of these findings supports the conclusion that marctec subjectively knew that it had no basis for asserting infringement and therefore pursued this litigation in bad faith.although marctec argues that it had no way of knowing that the district court would disagree with its proposed claim construction,no reasonable application of the principles this court enunciated in phillips awh,en banc supports its position.as cordis correctly argues,marctec can not claim to be ignorant of the references to heat in the claims,the language in the specification discussing the importance of heat to the bonding process,or bonutti statements to the pto.indeed,as we noted in the prior appeal,the doctrine of prosecution history estoppel prevented marctec from asserting its construction of the term bonded.after careful consideration and review of the record,we agree with the district court that marctec proposed claim construction,which ignored the entirety of the specification and the prosecution history,and thus was unsupported by the intrinsic record,was frivolous and supports a finding of bad faith.
marctec next argues that,because we did not describe its positions as frivolous or made in bad faith in the prior appeal,we can not endorse the district court decision to do so in this context.specifically,marctec points to language in our prior appeal where we addressed its claim differentiation argument.marctec took the position that the asserted claims did not require heat because dependent claim of the patent specifically describes the polymeric material as one that is bonded to the implant by the application of heat.prior appeal,fed.appx.at.although we acknowledged that the district court construction of bonded might render some language in cl
