background 
on april,corbett,individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated,filed a complaint for damages and for an injunction against bank of america,bancamerica auto finance corporation,bank of america corporation collectively,bank of america and hayward dodge.he alleged fraud by concealment,intentional misrepresentation,contract interference,and violation of the consumers legal remedies act clra,civil code section et.on may,corbett filed a first amended complaint adding class allegations pursuant to the clra.
on august,the court denied without prejudice corbett motion for class certification for failure to set forth evidence in support of his motion and granted him leave to file his third amended complaint.corbett filed his new pleading,adding a cause of action for violating the unfair competition law ucl,business and professions code section et.
the trial court refused to permit a class claim regarding the ucl claim,and corbett filed a petition for peremptory writ of mandate in this court.we issued an order to show cause.in corbett superior court th,d we reversed the lower court ruling that corbett could not,as a matter of law,pursue a class action for his ucl claim.
on january,corbett filed a fourth amended complaint,which is the operative pleading,for damages and for injunctive and declaratory relief.he alleged that he purchased a motor vehicle under a simple interest motor vehicle installment contract and security agreement,financed by bank of america.according to the pleading,hayward dodge arranged the financing.corbett was unaware that bank of america had approved his loan application at an interest rate of approximately percent,but hayward dodge prepared the loan documents for an interest rate of percent.bank of america and hayward dodge shared the difference between the interest rate approved and the interest rate charged.neither bank of america nor hayward dodge disclosed any of this information to the consumer.corbett alleged on behalf of himself and all other consumers who had similarly been harmed by this deceptive business practice causes of action for violating the clra,fraud,intentional interference with prospective contract,and violating the ucl.
hayward dodge demurred,and the court overruled the demurrer.in late,the parties agreed that corbett would dismiss with prejudice corbett claims of fraud and interference with contract claims.the parties agreed to waive claims for fees and costs as to these causes of action.
on december,hayward dodge filed a motion for summary judgment.the court granted the motion on march,finding that hayward dodge made no affirmative misrepresentation in the loan application or purchase agreement.in the written disclosures,hayward dodge did not represent that the interest rate had been approved by the bank of america or that the rate was the best possible.hayward dodge also disclosed to corbett that it intended to assign the loan.corbett does not recall any oral representations the court ruled that hayward dodge did not have any duty to disclose a possible rebate from the bank or an assignment.in addition,the court noted that corbett did not allege that hayward dodge represented that it would obtain the best available interest rate for the consumers and,even if such a claim were alleged,the court found that no written representations asserted this and corbett did not recall any oral representations of this.the court entered judgment in favor of hayward dodge and against corbett on may,
hayward dodge moved for an award of attorney fees pursuant to civil code section,subdivision d.hayward dodge maintained that corbett had no basis to allege misrepresentations.on july,the court denied the motion for fees finding that hayward dodge must demonstrate that the action was brought or maintained in bad faith.corbett theory in this case was that corbett negotiated with hayward dodge and hayward dodge deceived corbett regarding the efforts it would make on corbett behalf to obtain affordable financing.the court ruled that the pleading stated a plausible claim against hayward dodge.although the case may have been weak at all times,there is a distinction between weak cases that assert new theories and frivolous cases that are barred by established law.the court notes that there is little authority concerning the interpretation of civil code d of the consumer legal remedies act.there is no authority dealing with the burden of proof,the appropriate standard of proof,or any elaboration of the meaning of good faith in the context of prosecution of a lawsuit under civil code d.certainly,the public policy reflected in allowing a prevailing plaintiff to recover fees as a matter of right,and requiring a finding of the absence of good faith for a prevailing defendant to recover fees suggests that the l egislature did not want the specter of attorney fee liability to dissuade the bringing of clra actions,provided they are brought in good faith.this leads the court to conclude that the matter of discerning when litigation is not brought in good faith appears to be addressed to the sound discretion of the court.as such,the court can not say this matter was frivolous or entirely without merit,particularly when the law was evolving on significant issues during the course of the lawsuit.
on july,the court amended the judgment to award costs in favor of hayward dodge in the sum of.hayward dodge filed a timely notice from the order denying its request for attorney fees.
discussion 
hayward dodge requested attorney fees pursuant to civil code section,subdivision d.this provision provides the court shall award court costs and attorney fees to a prevailing plaintiff in litigation filed pursuant to this section.reasonable attorney fees may be awarded to a prevailing defendant upon a finding by the court that the plaintiff prosecution of the action was not in good faith.ibid.the trial court denied the request for fees and hayward dodge contends that the trial court used an incorrect test and improperly imposed the burden of proof on it.we consider each of these arguments,as well as its contention that,under either test,it was entitled to fees.
interpreting not in good faith 
the trial court may award reasonable attorney fees to a prevailing defendant upon a finding by the court that the plaintiff prosecution of the action was not in good faith,subd.d.the trial court applied a subjective bad faith test and hayward dodge contends it erred as the court was required to use the standard of whether a reasonable attorney would not have found corbett claims meritorious.
the determination of the legal basis for an award of attorney fees is a question of law that we review de novo,honey baked hams,dickens th,d.we are not aware of any court that has interpreted the meaning of not in good faith as used in civil code section,subdivision d,and therefore this is a question of first impression.
o ur first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in determining such intent,a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves,giving to the language its usual,ordinary import and according significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible,fair employment housing com.cal d.rules of statutory construction require courts to construe a statute to promote its purpose,render it reasonable,and avoid absurd consequences.ford gouin cal th,d.exceptions to the general provisions of a statute are to be narrowly construed only those circumstances that are within the words and reason of the exception may be included.city of lafayette east bay mun.utility dist.th,d.
hayward dodge contends that not acting in good faith is not the same as acting in bad faith.it argues that the legislature enacted code of civil procedure section prior to its enactment of civil code section,subdivision d and the former provides that e very trial court may order a party,the party attorney,or both to pay any reasonable expenses,including attorney fees,incurred by another party as a result of actions or tactics that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay.code civ,subd.a.since the legislature did not use bad faith language in civil code section and it did in code of civil procedure section,hayward dodge argues that this establishes that the legislature intended the standard for bad faith to differ significantly from not in good faith.hayward dodge maintains that the not in good faith test is an objective test and that the court must award the prevailing defendant attorney fees whenever it is unable to discern the plaintiff state of mind when prosecuting the clra claim.
further,hayward dodge argues that courts interpreting code of civil procedure section have held that a claim is in good faith when reasonable attorneys agree it is meritorious see karwasky zachay d.gray gray d.therefore,according to hayward dodge,a claim is not in good faith when reasonable attorneys agree the claim is not meritorious and the trial court erred when it did not apply this standard.
hayward dodge argument is without merit.it is noteworthy that prior to its amendment in,code of civil procedure section authorized sanctions for tactics or actions not based on good faith which are frivolous or which cause unnecessary delay thus,initially,the statute did contain the language of not based on good faith rather than in bad faith.courts interpreting this earlier version of the statute never suggested that the portion of the provision related to actions not based on good faith should require a finding of objective merit.rather,all of the courts defined this portion as meaning subjective bad faith.
when citing karwasky zachay,supra,d.and gray gray,supra,d,for their holding a motion is frivolous and in bad faith where any reasonable attorney would agree such motion is totally devoid of merit karwasky,supra,at,hayward dodge ignores that code of civil procedure section,unlike civil code section,subdivision d,includes frivolous actions in the provision.the statute defines frivolous as meaning a totally and completely without merit or b for the sole purpose of harassing an opposing party.code civ,subd.b.thus,courts have uniformly applied an objective standard to this term and found an action objectively frivolous where it can be said that it indisputably has no merit,such that any reasonable attorney would agree that it is totally and completely without merit.abbett electric sullwold d.courts such as karwasky zachay,supra,d at page.and gray gray,supra,d at page,which authorized sanctions under section upon a showing that the action was objectively frivolous or not based on good faith see,winick county sanitation district d.weisman bower d.finnie town of tiburon d,held a motion is frivolous and in bad faith where any reasonable attorney would agree such motion is totally devoid of merit.karwasky,supra,at,italics added.accordingly,for those courts applying a disjunctive is,applying the objective standard of frivolous or the subjective standard of bad of the objective test was sufficient to issue sanctions under code of civil procedures section.in contrast,civil code section,subdivision d does not include frivolous actions as a consideration for awarding attorney fees to prevailing defendants in crla actions.
many courts have interpreted the change in language in the amendment to code of civil procedure section as clarifying that subjective bad faith is required prior to a finding of sanctions.see,llamas diaz d.after analyzing legislative history of section and its subsequent amendments,held that subjective bad faith finding is necessary javor dellinger th,d summers city of cathedral city d.but see,on cow hollow properties d.need to show meritless or frivolous action or tactic or bad faith in taking the action or tactic.in any event,no case interpreting this statute prior to the amendment or after the amendment suggests that an objective test should be applied to a finding that the tactics or actions are not based on good faith or to a finding of bad faith actions or tactics.
indeed,we are aware of no court that has interpreted any sanctions or attorney fees statute as holding that an action in bad faith or not in good faith requires the court to apply an objective test.although cited by neither party,courts interpretation of code of civil procedure section is instructive.section authorizes an award of defense costs,including attorney fees to a public entity,where specified procedural requirements are met and the trial court determines that the plaintiff brought the action without reasonable cause or without the good faith belief that there was a justifiable controversy under the facts and law which warranted the filing of the complaint when interpreting this provision,courts have explained that good faith,or its absence,involves a factual inquiry into the plaintiff subjective state of mind,knight city of capitola th,d knight.encompassed within the legal definition of good faith is the equitable principle of fairness.carroll state of california d.
in contrast,r easonable cause is to be determined objectively,as a matter of law,on the basis of the facts known to the plaintiff when he or she filed or maintained the action.once what the plaintiff or his or her attorney knew has been determined,or found to be undisputed,it is for the court to decide whether any reasonable attorney would have thought the claim tenable knight,supra,th at,d,italics omitted.thus,it is the filing and maintaining a claim without reasonable cause that courts have interpreted as requiring an objective test.
the legislature notably omitted any language in civil code section,subdivision d that indicates attorney fees can be imposed upon a plaintiff prosecuting a clra claim solely on a finding that the prosecution was frivolous or without reasonable cause.rather,the legislature limited the award to the defendant in crla actions to a determination that the plaintiff prosecution of the actions was not in good faith,subd.d.courts have uniformly constructed this language as requiring a subjective test.moreover,we note that this construction comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature.civil code section provides this title shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes,which are to protect consumers against unfair and deceptive business practices and to provide efficient and economical procedures to secure such protection.accordingly,the statute is to be interpreted to encourage such prosecutions.the definition urged by hayward dodge and supported by no authority would chill such lawsuits.
we hold that the trial court correctly interpreted subdivision d of section of the civil code as requiring a finding of subjective bad faith.
ii.burden of proof 
hayward dodge maintains that the trial court erred when it interpreted civil code section,subdivision d as placing the burden of proof on it.hayward dodge argues that by using the language that fees may be awarded to a prevailing defendant upon a finding by the court that the plaintiff prosecution of the action was not in good faith,subd.d,the legislature has placed the burden of proof on the plaintiff.
hayward dodge asserts that we should be guided by the interpretation of code of civil procedure sectio
