the issue presented is whether attorneys acting on their own behalf can intervene in a client lawsuit and move for attorney fees under code of civil procedure section,which provides for fee awards in cases resulting in the enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.
in lindelli town of san anselmo th,d lindelli i,we held that the town of san anselmo violated the stay provisions of elections code section in awarding an interim contract for waste management services to marin sanitary service notwithstanding the fact that an earlier ordinance awarding a contract for such services to marin sanitary service was the subject of an upcoming referendum election.the case returns because on remand,the successful petitioners,suzanne lindelli and north bay corporation,declined to authorize their attorneys,remcho,johansen purcell rjp,to file a motion for an award of attorney fees under code of civil procedure section thereafter,rjp sought leave to intervene to file a motion for attorney fees on their own behalf.the trial court denied rjp motion.
resolution of the issue presented is directed by flannery prentice cal th,d,flannery.in flannery,the california supreme court held that,absent an agreement allocating fee awards to the client,fees awarded under the fair employment and housing act belong to the attorneys who labored to earn them.flannery,at,d.the court departed from federal precedent and construed prevailing party in government code section to refer to either a litigant or its counsel.flannery,at,d.following the reasoning of the flannery decision,we hold that rjp has standing to move for fees and sufficient interest in an award of attorney fees under section to support permissive intervention under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.we reverse and remand for the trial court to calculate and award a reasonable fee for the appeal in lindelli 
factual and procedural background 
we incorporate the factual and procedural background from our decision in lindelli i,supra,th at,d.
from to,san anselmo refuse recycling,an affiliate of north bay corporation collectively north bay,provided waste management services for san anselmo.the north bay franchise was to expire on november.on august,san anselmo passed a resolution awarding the new waste management franchise to a competitor,marin sanitary service.
petitioner suzanne lindelli lindelli and others obtained enough signatures to qualify a referendum petition protesting the award of the franchise to marin sanitary service.the petition was certified on september.on september,san anselmo published a notice seeking interim contract proposals for the period from expiration of the existing franchise agreement until a referendum election could be held.north bay,marin sanitary service,and a third party submitted bids.on october,san anselmo awarded an interim contract to marin sanitary service under the identical terms and conditions as the challenged franchise agreement.the interim contract differed from the original franchise agreement only in its duration.san anselmo set the vote on the referendum petition for the next permissible general election,november.
on october,north bay and lindelli filed a written protest.they argued that the interim contract violated the stay provisions of elections code section.after receiving no response,they filed a petition for writ of mandate,which was denied by the trial court.lindelli and north bay then sought a writ of mandate and stay from this court to stop the interim contract from going into effect.we denied their petition.
on appeal from the trial court decision on the petition for writ of mandate,lindelli and north bay withdrew their request to have marin sanitary service removed as interim provider and confined themselves to a request for a ruling that the issuance of the interim contract to marin sanitary service was unlawful.we denied san anselmo motion to dismiss the appeal as moot.although lindelli and north bay concession that they were no longer seeking removal of the interim provider ordinarily might have rendered the case moot,we exercised our discretion to consider the appeal on the merits because t he election law issue presented in this case is one of broad importance,capable of recurring,and likely otherwise to escape review.lindelli i,supra,th at,d.
on the merits,we concluded that san anselmo had violated the stay provisions of elections code section in accepting bids for an interim contract and then awarding marin sanitary service the yearlong interim contract until the referendum election.lindelli i,supra,th at,d.we reversed the trial court judgment denying the petition for writ of mandate and remanded for further proceedings in accord with our decision.id.at,d.
the principal issue on remand was whether petitioners were entitled to attorney fees under section.although rjp charged petitioner north bay on an hourly basis for litigating this case in the trial court,rjp agreed to pursue the appeal in lindelli i,supra,th,d,without charge to the petitioners,based on the expectation of a statutory fee award.on july,a few days before rjp intended to file an attorney fees motion on petitioners behalf,rjp learned from petitioner north bay that it no longer wished to be a moving party in the fee request.on august,petitioner lindelli informed rjp that she also no longer wished to be a moving party in the fee request.
on august,rjp filed a motion to intervene under section to request reasonable attorney fees and costs pursuant to section.real party in interest marin sanitary service opposed the motion and san anselmo joined in the opposition.the trial court denied rjp motion,concluding that rjp lacked standing to seek an award of fees on their own behalf 
discussion 
general standards for permissive intervention 
section,subdivision a,states in relevant part upon timely application,any person,who has an interest in the matter in litigation,or in the success of either of the parties,or an interest against both,may intervene in the action or proceeding.a third party may intervene where the proposed intervenor has a direct interest,intervention will not enlarge the issues in the litigation,and the reasons for the intervention outweigh any opposition by the present parties.us ecology,state of california th,d.the purpose of allowing intervention is to promote fairness by involving all parties potentially affected by a judgment.simpson redwood state of california d.see also city and county of san francisco state of california th,d san francisco section balances the interests of others who will be affected by the judgment against the interests of the original parties in pursuing their litigation unburdened by others.section should be liberally construed in favor of intervention.simpson redwood,at.
the fundamental question as to the permissive intervention standards is whether rjp has the type of direct interest in a section fee award required to support intervention under section.to support permissive intervention,the proposed intervener interest must be direct rather than consequential,and it must be an interest that is capable of determination in the action.san francisco,supra,th at,d.the requirement of a direct and immediate interest means that the interest must be of such a direct and immediate nature that the moving party will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment.citations.a person has a direct interest justifying intervention in litigation where the judgment in the action of itself adds to or detracts from his legal rights without reference to rights and duties not involved in the litigation.citations.conversely,an interest is consequential and thus insufficient for intervention when the action in which intervention is sought does not directly affect it although the results of the action may indirectly benefit or harm its owner.ibid.
a trial court decision to grant or deny an intervention request is ordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion.san francisco,supra,th at,d.however,whether rjp has sufficient interest in a section fee award to support intervention under section is a question of statutory interpretation subject to de novo review.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d.
ii.rjp has a direct and immediate interest in an award of fees under section 
the trial court concluded that rjp lacked standing to intervene and move for an award of fees on its own behalf.respondent contends that the trial court was correct because the interest of an attorney in fees payable out of litigation is indirect and will not support intervention.appellants contend that the trial court erred in concluding that rjp lacks standing to seek an award of attorney fees on its own behalf,relying on flannery,supra,cal th,d.following the reasoning of the california supreme court in flannery,we conclude that rjp has a direct and immediate interest in a fee award under section.
flannery prentice 
flannery,supra,cal th,d,involved an award of attorney fees under government code section,which is part of the fair employment and housing act feha,et the case resolved a discrete question the question presented is to whom,as between attorney and client,attorney fees awarded under government code section belong when no contractual agreement provides for their disposition.we conclude that,absent proof on remand of an enforceable agreement to the contrary,the attorney fees awarded in this case belong to the attorneys who labored to earn them.flannery,at,d.
in flannery,the plaintiff sued her former employer alleging violations of feha,the jury awarded in damages,and the trial court awarded over million in attorney fees under government code section and code of civil procedure section.flannery,supra,cal th at,d.plaintiff filed a separate action alleging malpractice and seeking a declaration that she was entitled to the entire statutory fee award in her feha action because she had not agreed to give those fees to her counsel.ibid.the trial court awarded fees to counsel.id.at,d.
the california supreme court held that attorney fees awarded pursuant to government code section exceeding fees already paid belong,absent an enforceable agreement to the contrary,to the attorneys who labored to earn them.flannery,supra,cal th at,d.in other words,the fee award belongs to the attorney in the first instance and only belongs to the client if an agreement so specifies.ibid.this holding is critical to our analysis of the issues presented.
the court parsed the term party,concluding that the reference to the prevailing party in government code section,subdivision b,is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation.flannery,supra,cal th at,d,quoting levy superior court cal th,d.the term is commonly understood to refer to either the actual litigant or the litigant attorney of record,and that is the meaning courts must ascribe to the term unless the legislature has clearly indicated a contrary intent.flannery,at,quoting mcdowell watson th,d.alternatively,even were party construed to mean a litigant only,that would not preclude the conclusion that beneficial ownership of section fees remains,absent contract,with the attorneys they are designed to compensate.flannery,at,d.
because the words of the statute itself did not resolve whether the plaintiff or her counsel was entitled to the fee award,the court turned to an analysis of the legislative intent and public policy.flannery,supra,cal th at,d.the court drew an analogy between government code section and code of civil procedure section,which codifies the private attorney general fee doctrine and provides for fee awards in cases enforcing important rights affecting the public interest.flannery,at,d.beginning with the clear public policy statement set forth in government code section and relying on both the statutory language and cases under code of civil procedure section,the court reasoned,there is no doubt that privately initiated lawsuits are often essential to the effectuation of the fundamental public policies embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions citation and w ithout some mechanism authorizing the award of attorney fees,private actions to enforce such important public policies will as a practical matter frequently be infeasible.flannery,at,d.under section fee awards are properly made to plaintiffs attorneys rather than to plaintiffs themselves.flannery,at,d,citing folsom butte county of governments cal d,fn.the court noted that the legislature did not repudiate those precedents in enacting or amending government code section.flannery,at,d,see sharon superior court cal th,d,when the legislature amends a statute without changing portions that have been construed by the courts,the legislature is presumed to have known of and acquiesced in the previous judicial construction.
the court explained that the purpose of feha is to safeguard the right of californians to employment free from discrimination and that attorneys considering whether to undertake cases vindicating fundamental public policies may require statutory assurance that,if they obtain a favorable result for their client,they will actually receive the reasonable attorney fees provided for by the legislature and computed by the court.flannery,supra,cal th at,d.statutes aim to enable private parties to obtain legal assistance by providing such statutory assurance that attorneys will receive a reasonable fee.id.at,d.
interpretation of section 
rjp seeks to intervene in order to request fees under section.as noted previously,section is the codification of the private attorney general fee doctrine.woodland hills residents,city council cal d,woodland hills.the purpose of the doctrine is to encourage suits effectuating fundamental public policies by awarding substantial attorney fees to those who successfully bring such actions.ibid.
code of civil procedure section and government code section share similar language and purposes and an interpretation of one carries weight in interpreting the other.see city of los angeles cal th,d,in deciding whether to,and how to,award attorney fees under section,subdivision b,courts will look to the rules set forth in cases interpreting section.the purposes for awarding fees in feha cases apply with equal force in the section context.in fact,the flannery court relied on a section case in explaining the need for fee awards in public interest cases.flannery,supra,cal th at,d,citing baggett gates cal d.the need for fee shifting in the section context may even be greater than in the feha context because section fee awards are only appropriate where the cost of the litigation transcends the plaintiff personal interest.woodland hills,supra,cal d at.thus,although feha plaintiffs may have substantial monetary recoveries from which attorneys could be paid,the same may not be true in section cases 
notably,the flannery court relied on cases under section in construing government code section as authorizing fee awards to attorneys and rejected justice kennard suggestion in dissent to follow the construction of prevailing party adopted by the united states supreme court in evans jeff,d evans.see flannery,supra,cal th at,d,kennard,dissenting.the evans court construed prevailing party in united states code section,a federal provision,as referring to the litigants alone.evans,at.we find no principled reading of the majority opinion in flannery that allows us to follow the reasoning in evans and hold that prevailing party under section refers to the only.to do so would require us to adopt the reasoning of the dissent in flannery,which we are not at liberty to do.
we see no sound basis to distinguish between government code section and code of civil procedure section in the construction of the word party and we have found nothing in the language of section or its legislative history clearly indicating that the legislature intended party to refer only to a litigant.see flannery,supra,cal th at,d.accordingly,we do not construe successful party in code of civil procedure section more narrowly than the flannery court construed prevailing party in government code section.we construe successful party in section as authorizing an award of attorney fees to a litigant or its counsel.see graham daimlerchrysler cal th,d,stating that prevailing party and successful party are synonymous and characterizing flannery as standing for the proposition that the word party as part of a prevailing party fee statute refers to litigant or litigant attorney.attorney fees awarded pursuant to section belong,absent an enforceable agreement to the contrary,to the attorneys.see flannery,at,d.
meadow superior court 
in support of its contention that rjp lacks standing to intervene and move for fees,respondent relies on the california supreme court decision in meadow superior court cal d,meadow,which in turn adopted the reasoning of marshank superior court d.marshank.both cases are distinguishable.
meadow,supra,cal d,and marshank,supra,d,were marital dissolution proceedings in which former attorneys for a spouse sought to intervene to seek fees under statutory provisions authorizing courts to require a spouse to pay attorney fees necessary to allow the other spouse to maintain divorce or support actions.former,former title,repealed stats,ch.in meadow,wife counsel objected to a proposed property settlement agreement and wife discharged her counsel,reconciled with her husband,and sought dismissal of the divorce proceeding.meadow,supra,cal d at.wife former counsel sought leave to file a complaint in intervention in order to recover fees and costs for services rendered.ibid.he alleged that the spouses and current counsel conspired to prevent him from collecting fees.id.at.the supreme court denied intervention under section.meadow,at.the court held that an attorney may intervene to resolve a dispute with a client over attorney fees only where the contract of employment gives the attorney a specific present interest in the subject matter of the action.id.at,quoting marshank,supra,d at.the court reasoned that attorneys do not possess a proprietary and direct interest in fees awarded under former civil code sections and.fees are granted to the wife for her benefit and are not awarded to her attorney a wife attorney has no separate equity in counsel fees awarded to her.his right thereto is derived from his client.meadow,at,quoting marshank,at.the court expressly held that only the party has the right to request an award of attorney fees an attorney may not move on his or her own behalf for an award of fees.meadow,at.the attorney may only seek compensation in an independent action against the client,not by application to the court in which the present litigation is pending.ibid.
california courts have followed meadow,supra,cal d,and marshank,supra,d,and rejected intervention or fee requests from attorneys in dissolution proceedings as well as in cases involving claims for fees arising out of contracts between attorneys and their clients.see brown superior court th,d contractual lien in licensing dispute in re marriage of read th,d divorce proceeding in re marriage of tushinsky d.divorce proceeding bandy diablo unified sch.dist.d.contractual lien in personal injury case wong superior court d.divorce proceeding wong hendricks superior court d.contractual lien in personal injury case hendricks.the parties have not cited and we have not found any california court that has followed meadow or marshank in denying intervention to counsel seeking fees under section,or any other provision providing for fee shifting in cases which vindicate fundamental public policies.flannery,supra,cal th at,d.
analysis of rjp motion to intervene to seek fees under section in light of flannery and meadow 
respondents insist that meadow stands for the blanket proposition that an attorney interest in fees is indirect and can not support intervention.in the martial dissolution context in which meadow arose,a court award of attorney fees is a grant to the client for the client benefit and the attorney right to the award is indirect and derived from the attorney employment by the client.meadow,supra,cal d,wong,supra,d at.the flannery court responded to the dissent argument that the court had previously invalidated statutory awards of attorney fees when ordered paid directly to a party lawyer flannery,supra,cal th at,fn,d,and expressly distinguished fee awards in public interest litigation and awards in marital dissolution proceedings.the majority pointed out that the legislature,in authorizing divorce courts to require the husband to pay as alimony any money necessary to enable the wife to support herself or her children,or to prosecute or defend the action former,plainly intended that the money be paid to the wife,rather than directly to her attorneys.no such plain intent obtains in this case.flannery,at,fn,d.
because the fee provision in the marital dissolution context is intended for the benefit of the spouses,the attorney claim for fees arises from the attorney employment relationship and it is the attorney who must enforce any contractual lien on the recovery through an independent action against the client.see meadow,supra,cal d at,hendricks,supra,d at.in contrast,rjp interest in the fee award arises from section itself.under flannery,supra,cal th at,d,the attorney is entitled to fees awarded unless an agreement specifies otherwise.by application of flannery reasoning to the term successful party in section,rjp interest in a fee award will be directly and adversely affected if a final judgment issues prior to a motion for fees.rjp will forever lose the right to collect fees from defendant under section.rjp has a sufficiently direct and immediate interest to permit intervention and a motion for an award of fees under section.
the other requirements for intervention under section,subdivision a have also been satisfied.intervention will not enlarge the issues in the litigation petitioners sought attorney fees in their petition and the propriety of granting intervention should be measured by the petition.people superior court good cal d.the reasons for intervention outweigh any opposition by the present parties petitioners have not objected to intervention and respondents point to no prejudice from intervention,other than that they may be required to pay a fee award they otherwise would avoid,which is not the type of interest that can justify denying intervention.truck ins.exchange superior court th,d fact that intervention would frustrate plaintiffs attempt to obtain default judgment does not justify denial of intervention.finally,respondents contention that rjp intervention request was untimely is without merit because rjp moved to intervene as soon as it became clear that their clients would not authorize a motion for fees.
were we to interpret section as precluding intervention and an attorney request for fees where the client declines to move for a fee award,we would diminish the certainty that attorneys who undertake public interest cases will receive reasonable compensation and dilute section effectiveness at encouraging counsel to undertake litigation enforcing important public policies.see flannery,supra,cal th at,d.were we to adopt respondents position it would also provide a windfall to the wrongdoing defendant,at the expense of the attorneys who labored in the public interest.id.at,d,interpreting government code section to avoid windfall to client macisaac waste management collection recycling,th,d california courts are justifiably reluctant to construe statutes to confer a windfall lolley campbell cal th,d,interpreting fee provision in the labor code to avoid windfall to wrongdoing employer in form of exemption from paying attorney fees.finally,interpreting section as permitting intervention and a motion for fees by attorneys on their own behalf avoids wasteful collateral actions wherein attorneys sue their former clients because the clients refusal to move for fees led to loss of an opportunity to seek a fee award under section.
without analysis,respondents state that were we to permit rjp to intervene and move for fees,we would undermine the principle that a client has the right to waive statutory fees as part of settlement.this case was not resolved by settlement it was litigated to a judgment favorable to petitioners.questions regarding how permitting attorneys to move for fees might affect the settlement process in future cases do not provide a basis to deny intervention in this case 
in concluding that rjp may intervene and seek fees under section,we disagree with the ninth circuit decision churchill village general electric cir,churchill,the only case on the issue.the churchill court concluded that counsel to certain plaintiffs in a nationwide class action lacked standing to assert a fee claim under section because section confers no legally enforceable interest on the attorneys themselves churchill,at,fn.the churchill court conclusion was based on a construction of successful party in section as including only the actual litigants.churchill,at.that narrow construction is inconsistent with the california supreme court construction of the term party as used in government code section and,by analogy,in code of civil procedure section.flannery,supra,cal th at,d.
flannery discussion of federal case law 
in flannery,the plaintiff,like respondent here,urged the court to follow federal cases holding that the right to seek,recover,and waive federal statutory fees resides with the client rather than the attorney.flannery,supra,cal th at,d.the court emphasized that it was not bound by interpretations of federal fee statutes.id.at,d.the flannery court then discussed two united states supreme court cases which held that only litigants,not their attorneys,are eligible for title united states code section fee awards as the prevailing party.see evans,supra,at.venegas mitchell,d venegas.the court noted that neither evans nor venegas addressed the particular issue of whether a party may receive or keep the proceeds of a fee award when she has neither agreed to pay her attorneys nor obtained from them a waiver of payment.flannery,at,d.
the court continued in any event,the high court analysis of united states code section fee eligibility is not incompatible with the trial court ruling that defendants attorneys are entitled to the proceeds of the fee award that plaintiff concedes she authorized defendants to seek.as the ninth circuit court of appeals explained in ex rel.virani jerry lewis truck parts equipment,cir,evans,supra,d stands for the proposition that,under united states code section,only a plaintiff has the power to demand that a defendant pay the fees of the plaintiff attorney,and the defendant liability will only arise if that power is exercised virani,supra,at.but once the client power to demand attorney fees is exercised,the attorney right to receive them come s into being.ibid.accordingly,and as pertinent for our purposes,t he plaintiff has no power to confer the fee upon himself.ibid.flannery,supra,cal th at,d.respondents argue that by this statement flannery endorsed the federal rule that only litigants may request an award of fees.
the flannery court distinguished evans,supra,d and its progeny by explaining that even under federal law,where only a party is eligible for a united states code section fee award,the attorney still may have a right to those fees once awarded by a court.flannery,supra,cal th at,d.flannery was neither confronted with nor considered the issue before us may attorneys intervene and request a section fee award given that the statute authorizes awards to attorneys and public interest fee awards belong to attorneys in the first instance.
the virani rule can not be the law in california after flannery.virani holding that only a litigant may request an award of fees is based on the evans and venegas holdings that united states code section fees belong to the litigants and not their attorneys.ex rel.virani jerry lewis truck parts equipment,supra,at evans,supra,at.venegas,supra,at.in marked contrast,the flannery court held that fees awarded belong to the attorneys in the first instance.flannery,supra,cal th at,d.
particularly illustrative of the difference between california and federal law is the decision in gilbrook city of westminster cir,which relies on evans,supra,d,and venegas,supra,d,to reach a conclusion directly opposite the conclusion in flannery,supra,cal th,d.there the ninth circuit held that because united states code section reference to prevailing party authorizes an award only to a client and not its counsel,fee awards must be made directly to the litigant,with the ultimate disposition of the award dependent on the contract between the lawyer and the client.gilbrook,at see also benitez cir,award of fees belongs initially to the prevailing litigant,not its attorney.
flannery discussion of federal law can not be read as an endorsement of the federal rule that only a litigant may request an award of fees because that rule is based on a fundamentally different interpretation of the phrase prevailing party as used in the federal attorney fee statutes.flannery,supra,cal th,d.that is,flannery expansively construes the phrase as used in government code section to include a litigant counsel while evans,supra,d,and venegas narrowly construe the phrase as used in united states code section to include the litigants alone flannery does not discuss how its interpretation of government code section might affect the analysis in a future case considering an attorney request to intervene to seek a public interest fee award under california law.faced now with that issue,we extend the reasoning of flannery to a logical conclusion in the analogous context of a code of civil procedure section fee request and hold that rjp has standing to intervene and file a motion for fees.
iii.entitlement to fees under section 
rjp urges this court to decide,in the first instance,whether it is entitled to an award of fees under section.laurel heights improvement regents of university of california cal d.because the request for fees is based entirely on the success obtained by petitioners on appeal,we are better equipped than the trial court to decide whether an award of fees is appropriate.see wilkerson city of placentia d.where the entire basis for the decision is what we have done in this opinion,we should make the decision that it qualifies as a case for granting of fees accord,laurel heights,at.
an award of attorney fees is proper under section if petitioners action resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest,a significant benefit was conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,and the burden of private enforcement was such as to make the award appropriate.woodland hills,supra,cal d at.
our decision in lindelli i resolves the first two issues.there,san anselmo moved to dismiss the appeal as moot because petitioners conceded they were no longer seeking as relief removal of the interim provider,marin sanitary service.lindelli i,supra,th at,d.we decided an exception to mootness applied because t he election law issue presented in this case is one of broad importance,capable of recurring,and likely otherwise to escape review.ibid.we explained that under the california constitution,the people have the right to approve or reject measures passed by a legislative body through the referendum process,and the ability to stay legislation pending a vote is a n essential component of the referendum power.lindelli i,at,d.we conclude that petitioners ultimate success in obtaining a declaration that the interim contract violated the stay provisions of election code section resulted in the enforcement of an important right and conferred a significant benefit on the general public.see press lucky stores,cal d,the determination that the public policy vindicated is one of constitutional stature establishes the first of the elements requisite to the award,the relative societal importance of the public policy vindicated see also woodland hills,supra,cal d at.
respondents argue that petitioner north bay financial stake in obtaining san anselmo contract for waste management services means that the cost of the litigation was not out of proportion to its individual stake.woodland hills,supra,cal d at.because petitioners did not seek removal of marin sanitary service as the interim provider,the appeal provided little potential individual benefit to petitioners.the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement,as related to the ap
