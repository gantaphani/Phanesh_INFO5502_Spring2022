in this appeal,we apply california rules to determine whether california law or georgia law governs an attorney fees dispute between plaintiff appellant first intercontinental bank bank and defendant appellee christina ahn christina.we conclude that california law,specifically california civil code a,governs the attorney fees dispute,and we affirm the district court decision awarding attorney fees to christina.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
in march of,first intercontinental bank,a bank chartered in georgia,with its principal place of business in doraville,georgia,made a purchase money loan of to aehcc and christina in connection with their purchase of a hotel.christina parents,edward ahn and helen ahn,guaranteed the loan.christina,edward ahn,and helen ahn are residents of california.aehcc is a colorado limited liability company with its principal place of business in california.
the promissory note included in the loan agreement documentation specified this note is intended as a contract under and shall be construed and enforceable in accordance with the laws of the state of georgia.the note also contained a attorney fees clause,providing in the event this note,or any part hereof,is collected by or through an attorney at law,borrower agrees to pay all costs of collection,including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees actually incurred.
in december of,the bank released christina from her obligations under the loan,and christina executed a quitclaim deed that transferred her interest in the hotel to aehcc.on march,the bank board of directors voted to remove christina as a borrower on the loan.christina parents,edward ahn and helen ahn,remained as guarantors of the loan.
in june of,aehcc ceased making payments on the loan,and in september of,the bank sent a letter to christina parents demanding that they honor their guarantees.
ii.prior proceedings 
when edward ahn and helen ahn failed to respond to the bank demands for payment on their guarantees,the bank filed an action in the central district of california against edward ahn,helen ahn,christina,and aehcc for breach of contract and breach of guaranty.the district court granted summary judgment to the bank on all claims against aehcc,edward ahn,and helen ahn.however,the district court also granted summary judgment to christina,holding that the bank had released her in december of from any obligations under the loan.none of the parties appealed these decisions.
on february,christina filed a motion for attorney fees and costs pursuant to california civil code a,which makes reciprocal otherwise unilateral attorney fees clauses in contracts.the bank contended that california civil code a was inapposite,and that georgia law should govern the attorney fees dispute.the district court held that california law applied to the attorney fees dispute,and awarded attorney fees to christina pursuant to california civil code a.
this timely appeal followed.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the attorney fees dispute pursuant to.we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review de novo the district court legal conclusions,including its decision that california law applies to the attorney fees dispute.see pokorny quixtar,cir.
discussion 
the central issue in this case is whether georgia law or california law applies to the parties attorney fees dispute.
legal standard 
we begin by determining whether georgia or california rules apply in this case.in diversity jurisdiction cases,such as this one,we apply the substantive law of the forum in which the court is located,including the forum choice of law rules.ins.of north am.fed.express,cir.the bank brought its action for breach of contract in the central district of california.the district court thus correctly determined that california rules govern the question of whether georgia or california law applies to the attorney fees issue.
california follows the approach set out in the restatement second of conflict of laws to determine the law that applies to a contract with a clause.see nedlloyd lines superior court,cal.under,a california court begins its analysis by determining whether the chosen state has a substantial relationship to the parties or their transaction,or whether there is any other reasonable basis for the parties choice of law.washington mut.bank,fa superior court,cal quoting nedloyd lines,at.if this is the case,the court then determines whether california would be the state of the applicable law in the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties.restatement second of conflict of laws.if the chosen forum has a substantial relationship to the parties or their transaction but california law would apply in the absence of a provision,the court then determines whether the relevant portion of the chosen state law is contrary to a fundamental policy in california law.if there is such a conflict,the court finally determines whether california has a materially greater interest than the chosen state in the determination of the particular issue washington mut.bank,fa,at quoting nedloyd lines,at.if all of these criteria are met,the court applies california law.otherwise,the court applies the law of the forum selected in the contract.
ii.application of california choice of law principles 
georgia has a substantial relationship to the parties in the transaction 
the loan agreement between christina and the bank specifies that georgia law applies to any dispute.additionally,the bank is chartered in georgia,its principal place of business is in georgia,and it drafted the contract and related documents in georgia.accordingly,there is a reasonable basis for the provision contained in the loan agreement documents.
b.the application of california law in the absence of the choice of law provision 
we next assess whether california would apply its own law to the dispute in the absence of the provision selecting georgia law.in addressing this issue,restatement second of conflict of laws directs us to consider a the place of contracting,b the place of negotiation of the contract,c the place of performance,d the location of the subject matter of the contract,and e the domicil,residence,nationality,place of incorporation and place of business of the parties.
place of contracting 
when adjudicating the underlying breach of contract claim in this case,the district court concluded that the bank and christina negotiated and executed the contract in both california and georgia,and that christina signed the contract in california.these facts do not favor the application of either california or georgia law.
on appeal,the bank contends that it is unclear where the parties executed the loan agreement because christina may not have even signed the loan documents,or been present when she signed the agreements by proxy.according to the bank,because the place of execution is unclear,the balance tips in favor of applying georgia law.the bank argument is unavailing for two reasons.
first,its contentions,at best,only establish that it is unclear where the parties executed the agreements,which brings us no closer to resolving the question of which state law would apply to the present dispute.second,the doctrine of judicial estoppel prevents the bank from asserting that christina did not sign the loan agreements in california.j udicial estoppel,generally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase.new hampshire maine,quoting pegram herdrich.in her motion for summary judgment in the breach of contract action,christina argued that she did not sign and execute the contract at issue.in response,the bank acknowledged that christina ahn made,executed and delivered the contract to plaintiff.the bank also submitted documents into evidence that indicated christina had executed the agreements in california,and that bore christina signature.after reviewing the evidence,the district court concluded that christina had signed the agreements in california.judicial estoppel prevents the bank from contradi
