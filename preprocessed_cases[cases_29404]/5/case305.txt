opinion of the court 
appellee sergey aleynikov is a computer programmer who worked at goldman,sachs gsco from through and held the title of vice president.after accepting an employment offer from another company,aleynikov copied source code developed at gsco into computer files and transferred them out of gsco.he was indicted by a federal grand jury and convicted of violations of the national stolen property act,and the economic espionage act.the united states court of appeals for the second circuit reversed his conviction,concluding that his conduct did not violate federal law.he was then indicted by a new york grand jury for violations of new york law and this criminal case remains pending.
aleynikov brought this suit in the united states district court for the district of new jersey seeking indemnification and advancement for his attorney fees from appellant the goldman sachs group,gs group,and together with gsco,goldman.he seeks indemnification for attorney fees expended in defending against the federal criminal charges and advancement of attorney fees for the state criminal charges,along with fees on fees incurred in obtaining indemnification and advancement.he claims his right to indemnification and advancement under a portion of gs group by laws that applies to subsidiaries like gsco,providing for indemnification and advancement to,among others,officers of gsco.following expedited discovery in aid of defining the term officer,the district court granted summary judgment in aleynikov favor on his claim for advancement but denied it on his claim for indemnification and denied goldman for summary judgment.goldman appealed.
we are asked to interpret the meaning of the term officer in gs group by laws and determine whether aleynikov is entitled to indemnification and advancement due to his title of vice president.we conclude that the term officer is ambiguous and that the relevant extrinsic evidence raises genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment.we therefore vacate the district court grant of summary judgment in aleynikov favor on the advancement issue.while we exercise supplemental appellate jurisdiction over the district court denial of goldman for summary judgment,as urged by goldman,we affirm the district court denial of summary judgment in goldman favor.
gs group is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of delaware.gsco is a new york limited partnership and subsidiary of gs group.section of gs group by laws addresses indemnification for and advancement of legal fees and costs for,among others,officers of gs group and officers of gs group corporate and subsidiaries including gsco.this section provides that for subsidiaries,the term officer,shall include in addition to any officer of such entity,any person serving in a similar capacity or as the manager of such entity.app.
as a limited partnership and subsidiary of gs group,gsco is not required to have officers.gsco has appointed officers pursuant to a written resolution process,but this process was not widely disseminated.it has no other formal appointment processes for officers.gsco employs tens of thousands of employees.approximately of those employees hold the title of vice president.someone with the title of vice president is more senior than someone with the title of analyst or associate,but less senior than someone with the title of managing director.
aleynikov worked as a computer programmer for gsco from may,until june,although his last day in the office was june.while at gsco,he developed source code for goldman trading system and held the title of vice president in gsco equities division.he did not supervise other employees or transact business on behalf of gsco.he exercised no management or leadership responsibilities.as a part his employment,aleynikov agreed to keep all proprietary information belonging to gsco confidential.
in late april,aleynikov accepted an employment offer from teza technologies,a startup company in the trading business.on his last day in gsco offices,aleynikov copied gsco source code into computer files and transferred those files to a server in germany.on july,goldman contacted federal authorities to report the transfer of the files.two days later,fbi agents arrested aleynikov.
aleynikov was indicted by a federal grand jury in the southern district of new york in february of.he moved to dismiss all three counts against him the district court granted his motion as to one but denied it as to the other two counts.he proceeded to trial on the two counts a violation of the national stolen property act,and a violation of the economic espionage act.following an trial in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,a jury found aleynikov guilty on both counts.he was sentenced to months of imprisonment.
aleynikov served weeks in prison while his appeal was pending.on february,the united states court of appeals for the second circuit reversed his conviction and ordered him acquitted and released immediately,concluding that his conduct did not violate federal law.see united states aleynikov,cir.
on august,new york state authorities arrested aleynikov and charged him with state crimes based upon the same alleged conduct.on september,a new york grand jury indicted him on two charges unlawful use of secret scientific material in violation of penal law and unlawful duplication of material in violation of penal law.the state criminal case remains pending.
on august,aleynikov and his counsel sent a letter to goldman seeking indemnification for over million in attorney fees and costs incurred in connection with the federal criminal proceedings and advancement of attorney fees and costs related to the ongoing state criminal proceedings.the letter asserted that aleynikov was entitled to indemnification and advancement under the by laws.
on september,aleynikov initiated this case in the united states district court for the district of new jersey seeking indemnification and advancement,as well as fees on fees incurred in attempting to obtain indemnification and advancement.
at the same time,aleynikov filed a motion for summary judgment and requested entry of a preliminary injunction.on december,the district court denied aleynikov summary judgment motion and request for a preliminary injunction,concluding that the factual record was insufficient to establish aleynikov entitlement to indemnification and advancement under the by laws.the district court ordered expedited discovery to establish in the record the process for appointing officers and the practice of indemnifying employees at gsco,in order to discover the meaning of the term officer in the by laws.
following expedited discovery,the parties filed for summary judgment.on october,the district court granted aleynikov motion for summary judgment with respect to his claims for advancement and fees.the district court analyzed section the by laws for ambiguity,exploring the plain meaning of vice president and concluding that the meaning of this term was unambiguous and entitled aleynikov to indemnification and advancement.it proceeded to consider the extrinsic evidence anyway,concluding that the evidence submitted did not raise any genuine issues of material fact.finally,the district court explained that even if there were an issue of fact,it would apply the doctrine of contra proferentem to construe any ambiguities against goldman,the of the by laws.it denied aleynikov motion for summary judgment with respect to indemnification and fees pending further discovery on the total monetary amount due.the district court also denied goldman for summary judgment.goldman filed a timely notice of appeal and sought to stay the district court order pending appeal and to expedite the appeal.this court denied goldman motion for a stay pending appeal,granted its motion to expedite the appeal,and referred the additional issue of the court appellate jurisdiction to the merits panel.after oral argument,we stayed the district court order pending our resolution of this appeal.

the order here adjudicated relief sought in aleynikov complaint and appears to be enforceable through the district court contempt powers,given the ongoing and immediate nature of the obligation and the role that the district court assumed in overseeing the payments alternatively,the order could be seen as one for specific performance of a contractual duty.it compels goldman to advance attorney fees in order to fulfill its alleged contractual obligation under the by laws.the obligation is immediate,ongoing,indeterminate,and could be repaid depending on the outcome of the state criminal proceeding.under the factors set forth in cohen,the district court order appears to be an immediately appealable injunction.
aleynikov contends that the order merely requires the payment of money in an action at law,and is therefore not an appealable injunction.an order is legal if it compels the payment of money that is past due or compels specific performance of a past due monetary obligation.pell dupont de nemours,cir.but where an order for the payment of money is and involves an amount that can not be calculated with specificity,it is equitable.id.here,the district court order is clearly and indeterminate,as it requires goldman to pay aleynikov attorney fees as he incurs them.

goldman also urges us to exercise our pendent appellate jurisdiction over the issues raised in its for summary judgment,which the district court denied.pendent appellate jurisdiction allows an appellate court in its discretion to exercise jurisdiction over issues that are not independently appealable but that are intertwined with issues over which the appellate court properly and independently exercises its jurisdiction.dupont de nemours rhone poulenc fiber resin intermediates,cir.the doctrine is narrow,and should be used sparingly,and only where there is sufficient overlap in the facts relevant to both the appealable and nonappealable issues to warrant plenary review.id.at internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted quoting in re montgomery,cir.
the appealable order the district court partial grant of summary judgment ordering that goldman advance aleynikov attorney fees for his state criminal action raises the issue of the meaning of officer as used in goldman by laws and whether the term includes aleynikov.goldman for summary judgment also turned on the meaning of the term officer and whether aleynikov could be considered one.therefore,our adjudication of the issues properly before us would necessarily resolve whether goldman was properly denied.we would not need to evaluate additional facts or legal arguments to resolve goldman.because the issues are so intertwined,this is one of the relatively rare instances where we should use our discretion to exercise pendent appellate jurisdiction.we will therefore reach the issue of whether the district court erred in denying goldman for summary judgment however,as we conclude below that the by laws are ambiguous and genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment,the district court did not err in denying goldman motion.

the propriety of the district court grant of summary judgment in aleynikov favor hinges on the interpretation of the term officer.we will begin with a brief overview of corporate and indemnification and advancement provisions under delaware law we will then consider whether,in the context of section of goldman bylaws,the word officer is ambiguous and,if so,whether extrinsic evidence can resolve this ambiguity.
delaware has enacted statutory provisions giving corporations and their subsidiaries the ability to provide for mandatory indemnification and advancement in their corporate charters,and other agreements.section of the delaware code allows business entities to indemnify or provide advancement to an individual involved in a lawsuit by reason of fact that he or she is or was a director,officer,employee,or agent of the corporation,partnership,or other enterprise.a,e.this allows corporate officials to defend themselves in legal proceedings secure in the knowledge that,if vindicated,the corporation will bear the expense of litigation.homestore tafeen,quoting vonfeldt stifel fin.
indemnification and advancement are related but distinct avenues by which a business entity pays for an individual legal expenses.in both,the corporation pays the legal expenses of the officer,director,or other employee when that individual is accused of wrongdoing in the course of performing duties to the corporation.for indemnification,the corporation reimburses the individual for his or her legal expenses once he or she has been successful in the underlying proceeding on the merits or otherwise.homestore,at.for advancement,on the other hand,the corporation pays legal expenses on an ongoing basis in advance of the final disposition of the lawsuit,provided that the individual must repay the amount advanced if it turns out he or she is not entitled to be indemnified,he or she is not successful on the merits or otherwise in the underlying lawsuit.e.

we turn now to our analysis of the by laws.are interpreted in accordance with the rules used to interpret statutes,contracts,and other written instruments.gentile singlepoint.the terms are given their plain meaning,like terms in any other contract.activision blizzard,hayes,wl,at.to be ambiguous,a disputed contract term must be fairly or reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning.alta berkeley vi omneon.t he fact that the parties offer two different interpretations does not create an ambiguity.activision blizzard,wl,at.we analyze the by laws for ambiguity through the lens of what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought the by laws meant.kuhn,diamond state port,quoting rhone poulenc basic chem.am.motorists ins.we begin by inquiring whether the relevant provision of section of the by laws is unambiguous.then,concluding that the relevant provision is ambiguous,we look beyond the by laws to attempt to determine the parties meaning.finally,we consider whether the doctrine of contra proferentem properly applies here.
the by laws use of the term officer is crucial to the outcome,because a person is entitled to indemnification and advancement under the by laws if he or she is made a party to an action by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director,officer,trustee,member,stockholder,partner,incorporator or liquidator of a subsidiary of gs group.app.aleynikov only claim to indemnification and advancement rests on whether he is an officer of gsco,a subsidiary of gs group,as he does not,and can not,claim any other entitlement under the by laws.
for the purposes of indemnification and advancement concerning subsidiaries that are not corporations,like gsco,the by laws state the term officer shall include in addition to any officer of such entity,any person serving in a similar capacity or as the manager of such entity.app.yet,after stating the applicable law on contract interpretation,the district court observed that the plain and ordinary meaning of vice president is,of course,the starting point and touchstone of the analysis.app.it then proceeded to evaluate the dictionary definition and meaning of vice president in the case law to conclude that the usual and ordinary meaning of vice president is unambiguous and means that aleynikov is an officer.the district court focus of its analysis on the meaning of the term vice president,which does not appear at all in section of the by laws,was its first and most significant error.the term officer appears in the relevant language of the by laws,and it is the interpretation of the term officer that determines whether aleynikov is entitled to advancement.in analyzing whether vice president is ambiguous,the district court analyzed a term that does not appear in the relevant portion of the contract.
having noted this crucial error of interpretation,we move to the text of the relevant part of section to determine whether it is unambiguous.at first blush,the definition of officer with respect to subsidiaries is fairly circular.officer,as used in the by laws,includes any officer a person serving in a similar capacity or a person serving as the manager of the subsidiary.we read the first use of officer as setting forth a contractual category it defines officer for the purposes of entitling a person qualifying under that definition to indemnification and advancement.for this reason,this apparent circuity defining officer as including any officer is not problematic in and of itself.but the second use of the word officer in this provision remains undefined.from the face of the instrument,it is not immediately apparent what characteristics make someone an officer.
we look to the dictionary definition of officer for assistance in determining the plain meaning of this undefined term.lorillard tobacco am.legacy.we look here first because dictionaries are the customary reference source that a reasonable person in the position of a party to a contract would use to ascertain the ordinary meaning of words not defined in the contract.id.black law dictionary defines officer as a person who holds an office of trust,authority,or command.black law dictionary ed.merriam webster defines it similarly.see merriam webster collegiate dictionary th ed.one who holds an office of trust,authority,or command.according to american heritage dictionary,an officer is o ne who holds an office of authority or trust in an organization,such as a corporation.am.heritage dictionary of the english language ed.random house college dictionary adds to the definition an element of election or appointment,defining officer as a person appointed or elected to a position of responsibility or authority in an organization.random house coll.dictionary revised ed.
we can glean from these definitions that the plain meaning of the term officer is someone holding a position of trust,authority,or command.only one of the four definitions suggests that for a person to be considered an officer,he or she must be elected or appointed to that position.we therefore conclude that the election or appointment requirement can not properly be considered a part of the ordinary,dictionary definition of officer.
equipped with this definition of officer,we consider whether the use of this definition gives meaning to the provision that officer shall include in addition to any officer of such entity,any person serving in a similar capacity or as the manager of such entity.app.applying the dictionary definition here results in the reading that officer as a contractual category is defined as someone holding a position of trust,authority or command and a person serving in a similar capacity.this reading results in a tautology officer as defined using the dictionary definition and any person serving in a similar capacity mean the same thing.using the dictionary definition,therefore,does not result in an unambiguous provision rather,what appears at first blush to be circular instead becomes repetitive.
goldman suggests that we should read this clause as providing that an officer for the purposes of indemnification and advancement includes general purpose,officers of entities,along with people serving in similar capacities and managers.goldman,at.goldman maintains that at gsco,these general purpose,officers are those,and only those,appointed by formal,written resolution of the general partner of gsco.this definition is unavailing for several reasons.first of all,there is no generally promulgated document stating who such general purpose,officers are at gsco or stating that officers are appointed only by written resolution of the general partner therefore,it is not apparent that these officers would be readily ascertainable,such that the plain meaning of the term officer in the by laws would be apparent as applied to gsco.second,to read this provision in the way goldman urges that officers are general purpose,officers appointed pursuant to written resolutions of goldman general partner we would have to violate the principle that in construing a contract a court can not in effect rewrite it or supply omitted provisions.finally,this reading would conflict with the dictionary definition of officer someone holding a position of trust,authority,or command.we therefore decline to adopt goldman reading.
if there were a,common meaning of the term officer,the application of this meaning would perhaps render section of the by laws unambiguous.we analyze ambiguity through the lens of what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought the contract meant.kuhn,at quoting rhone poulenc basic chem,at.if there were a common meaning of the term officer in the investment banking industry,such that its plain meaning would be apparent from the face of the by laws to a reasonable person in that industry,we could apply that meaning and conclude that the provision is unambiguous.but we have not been supplied with such a meaning of the term officer.
we therefore conclude that the provision of the by laws defining officers for the purposes of indemnification and advancement at subsidiaries as any officer of such entity,and any person serving in a similar capacity or as the manager of such entity is ambiguous.app.it is circuitous,repetitive,and most importantly,fairly or reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning.alta berkeley vi,a d at.officer could mean simply someone occupying a position of trust or authority,or it could mean someone elected or appointed to that particular position,or it could mean something else entirely in the relevant industry.the failure to define the term suggests that it has,or was meant to have,some meaning that would be obvious to readers of the document.unfortunately,we can not ascertain that meaning from the face of the document or by resorting to dictionary definitions 
when the provisions in controversy are fairly susceptible of different interpretations or may have two or more different meanings,there is ambiguity.then the interpreting court must look beyond the language of the contract to ascertain the parties intentions.eagle,devilbiss health care.in looking at extrinsic evidence to interpret an ambiguous contractual provision,a court may consider evidence of prior agreements and communications of the parties as well as trade usage or course of dealing.id.at.
we pause to note that resorting to extrinsic evidence in this case is problematic.because the by laws are a agreement neither aleynikov nor the many other employees of gsco who would be interested in whether they are eligible for indemnification or advancement had any part in drafting them many types of extrinsic evidence in this case would be irrelevant.u nless extrinsic evidence can speak to the intent of all parties to a contract,it provides an incomplete guide with which to interpret contractual language.si mgmt.wininger,emphasis in original.a lthough advancement provisions in corporate instruments often are of less than ideal clarity,rarely is resort to parol evidence appropriate or even helpful,as corporate instruments addressing advancement rights are often crafted without the involvement of the parties who later seek advancement.delucca,wl,at.however,as we discuss below,it is inappropriate to apply the doctrine of contra proferentem and construe the ambiguities against the unilateral drafter,because we are considering whether aleynikov can even claim status as a party benefited under the by laws.so we are left in a bind most extrinsic evidence should not be considered because goldman unilaterally drafted the by laws,yet we should not construe ambiguities against goldman because we are trying to determine if aleynikov even is a party to the contract.
we conclude that there are two types of extrinsic evidence that are relevant to resolving the ambiguity presented here course of dealing evidence and trade usage evidence.eagle,at.these types of extrinsic evidence go beyond the subjective intent of the drafting party to shed light on how reasonable individuals in the investment banking industry and at gsco specifically would have interpreted the term officer.the parties have introduced three categories of extrinsic evidence that we may properly consider as evidence of course of dealing and trade usage evidence of gsco procedure for appointing officers and of gsco record of providing indemnification advancement can properly be viewed as evidence of gsco course of dealing with the title officer and with awards of indemnification and advancement.evidence of title inflation in the investment banking industry and industry usage of the title of vice president can be viewed as evidence of trade usage of titles that may connote to people inside the investment banking industry.we evaluate each type of extrinsic evidence to determine whether this evidence is relevant and helpful in resolving the ambiguity and whether there are genuine issues of material fact regarding this evidence that preclude summary judgment.
goldman offered evidence from discovery regarding gsco procedure for appointing and removing officers.it produced eleven documents titled written consent of the general partner of goldman,sachs these documents appointed removed individuals as officers of gsco.goldman also introduced evidence that the persons occupying the position of officer,as appointed in the documents,were publicly identified in regulatory filings.
in considering the interpretive value of this extrinsic evidence,the district court erred in improperly weighing the evidence to neutralize the value of gsco process for appointing officers.see anderson,at a t the summary judgment stage the judge function is not himself to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.the district court discounted the weight of the appointment procedure because goldman did not point to a document that established or memorialized this procedure for appointing officers.it also discounted the evidence about identifying officers in public filings,reasoning that the evidence suggested that the appointments had a regulatory purpose,which had no bearing on the meaning of officer for indemnification and advancement purposes.finally,it discounted the evidence because the written consents were labeled confidential and the appointment process was not widely disseminated to the gsco employee population.while these considerations may indeed weigh on whether the appointment procedure deserves credence in interpreting the terms of the contract,this is a factual determination for the jury to decide.the district court erred in improperly weighing and discounting the value of this evidence.
goldman introduced evidence about its record of providing indemnification advancement to other individuals at gsco.over a six year period,people associated with gsco were considered for advancement indemnification.of these,goldman paid the attorney fees for.aside from aleynikov,goldman refused to pay indemnification advancement for one other person who sought it,also a gsco vice president.however,of the whose fees goldman paid,fifteen were gsco vice presidents.goldman put forward evidence suggesting that for at least some of these individuals,goldman was invoking its discretion in agreeing to pay the fees,even if the individual was not necessarily entitled to indemnification or advancement under the by laws.
the district court discounted this evidence as a characterization of the payment decisions and expressed doubt as to the discretionary nature of the payments,drawing particular attention to the fact that for some of these individuals,indemnification and advancement were clearly mandatory under the by laws.we decline to discount this evidence for these reasons.while for some of the individuals,indemnification and advancement would have been clearly due under the by laws,this does not preclude goldman from first determining whether it wants to pay attorney fees,and then,if it decides it does not want to do so,determining whether it must.while the characterization of these decisions as discretionary could diminish their relevance to interpreting the by laws,we leave that question to the district court at trial.depending on how this evidence of goldman course of dealing is presented,it could have some relevance to the meaning of the term officer if the district court finds this evidence relevant and admissible,it is up to a jury to determine how these prior instances of indemnification and advancement bear on the meaning of the term officer at gsco.
goldman introduced trade usage evidence,which aleynikov has not rebutted,from publications like the economist and the los angeles times and deposition testimony showing that title inflation in the financial services industry is prevalent and the title of vice president is not particularly meaningful.see app.i n the investment banking and brokerage industries,just about everyone is a vice president app.almost everybody in banking from the receptionist upwards is a president of some sort.app.m anagement titles such as senior vice president have spread so widely that in many cases being a vice president means nothing.the evidence tends to show that vice president is merely a functional title,because it connotes a level of seniority between associate and managing director,and as distinguished from an officer title,which is somebody who appointed through the process.app.
the district court discounted this evidence of title inflation and the industry understanding of the term vice president.the district court placed the burden of this title on goldman,penalizing goldman for the industry profligacy in conferring the title of vice president.the district court also confusingly observed that the folkways of the financial services industry are not necessarily determinative here,app,even though the norms of the relevant industry are properly considered extrinsic evidence,eagle industries,at,and are relevant to ambiguity,which considers how a reasonable person in the position of the parties would interpret the contract term,kuhn construction,at.we emphasize yet again that it is the meaning of the term officer the term appearing in the by laws that the extrinsic evidence must aid in interpreting.but the industry usage of the term vice president is still relevant extrinsic evidence.aleynikov hangs his hat only on his vice president title in claiming entitlement to advancement,and industry usage of this term informs industry understanding of who qualifies as an officer,and in particular,whether a gsco vice president can be considered an officer 
goldman extrinsic evidence raises genuine issues of material fact.w here reasonable minds could differ as to the contract meaning,a factual dispute results and the factfinder must consider admissible extrinsic evidence.in those cases,summary judgment is improper.gmg capital,llc athenian venture partners i.a jury must determine the interpretive value of goldman extrinsic evidence in resolving the ambiguity in the by laws.
the district court concluded that even if the term officer was ambiguous,the concept of contra proferentem would apply to resolve any ambiguities against the corporate drafter,here,goldman.the doctrine of contra proferentem is well established in delaware contract law.when one side of a contract was unilaterally responsible for the drafting,courts apply contra proferentem and construe ambiguous terms against the drafter.norton k sea transp.partners.
goldman contends that we should not apply the doctrine of contra proferentem here because we are presented with the threshold question of whether a person was a party to or intended beneficiary of a corporate instrument.aleynikov argues that contra proferentem applies whenever one party has sole control over the drafting of the agreement and delaware courts do not consider extrinsic evidence of a drafter intent when the agreement was not the product of bilateral negotiation.
we have found no delaware case law specifically addressing whether contra proferentem can and should apply where there is ambiguity over whether a plaintiff is a party to or beneficiary of a contract.generally,the cases in which the delaware courts have applied contra proferentem have concerned situations in which it was clear that the party invoking the doctrine had rights under the agreement and the ambiguity went to the scope of those rights.see,norton,at discussing contra proferentem in the context of a dispute involving a limited partnership agreement between limited partners,a general partner,and the board of directors.in particular,the courts have applied the doctrine to construe an ambiguity in an insurance policy against the insurance company that drafted the policy where the clearly a party to the agreement had no role in drafting the ambiguous provision.see,twin city fire ins.delaware racing ass n,applying contra proferentem to construe an ambiguity in an insurance policy exclusion provision against the insurance company where the insured had no role in drafting the exclusion.
while we have found no case law directly on point,a close reading of the applicable delaware case law suggests that the doctrine is inapplicable here.the delaware court of chancery has written that contra proferentem protects the reasonable expectations of people who join a partnership or other entity after it was formed and must rely on the face of the operating agreement to understand their rights and obligations when making the decision to join.stockman heartland indus.partners,vsc,vcs,wl,at.ch.july,emphasis added.this language suggests that contra proferentem applies to determine the scope of a person rights under a contract which they had no role in drafting it does not suggest that the doctrine applies to determine whether a person has rights and obligations under,whether he or she is a party to or beneficiary of a contract.
t he bylaws of a delaware corporation constitute part of a binding broader contract among the directors,officer,and stockholders formed within the statutory framework of the delaware general corporation law.boilermakers local ret.fund chevron,once it is determined whether or not a person qualifies as an officer under the by laws,contra proferentem might appropriately apply to resolve any ambiguities in the scope of the right to indemnification and advancement.however,we conclude that contra proferentem has no application in resolving whether a person has rights under the contract at all here,whether aleynikov is an officer of gsco applying the doctrine of contra proferentem in this circumstance would put the cart before the horse.it would have us resolve ambiguities in favor of a individual in order to determine whether that individual was even subject to the agreement.
we therefore decline to apply the doctrine of contra proferentem and hold that the district court erred in doing so.while resort to some types of extrinsic evidence specifically relating to goldman intent might be inappropriate,as discussed above,resort to extrinsic evidence regarding course of dealing and trade usage to resolve the ambiguity does not seem inappropriate even where goldman unilaterally drafted the agreement.the use of course of dealing and trade usage evidence of the sort we discussed above can speak to the intent of all parties to a contract,si mgmt,at emphasis in original,as it addresses the general operations at gsco and who reasonable people in the investment banking industry would consider an officer to be.absent consideration of aleynikov subjective views on his,which would be neither helpful nor appropriate,this is the closest we can get to ascertaining how employees at gsco,who may or may not be eligible for indemnification and advancement at some point,would view the language of the contract.on remand,the fact finder should consider the extrinsic evidence presented and determine whether that evidence resolves the ambiguity to ascertain which of the reasonable readings of the term officer was intended by the parties.harrah entm t,jcc holding.
for the foregoing reasons,we vacate the district court order granting summary judgment in aleynikov favor on the advancement issue and remand to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.because we have concluded that the relevant terms of the by laws are ambiguous and there are genuine issues of material fact raised in resolving that ambiguity,summary judgment is not appropriate for either party at this time.therefore,while we exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the district court denial of goldman for summary judgment,we conclude that motion was properly denied and affirm the district court on this issue.
i agree with the majority that the term officer as used in the advancement provision of the by laws is ambiguous.but unlike the majority,i believe that delaware has clearly stated the rule for deciding between competing interpretations of an ambiguous term courts should construe the ambiguous term in the corporate instrument against the drafter,rather than inviting the use of extrinsic evidence to decipher the term meaning.delaware has never suggested that there is an exception to its contra proferentem rule where the ambiguity concerns whether a plaintiff is a party to or beneficiary of a contract.op.at.thus,i would resolve the ambiguous term officer against goldman sachs and conclude,as a matter of law,that sergey aleynikov,a vice president at goldman,was an officer and therefore entitled to advanced legal fees.i believe delaware law compels this conclusion,as does the public policy animating delaware interpretation of governing documents.
i therefore dissent.
under delaware law,a court generally must allow a case involving an ambiguous contract to proceed to trial,so that the finder of fact may consider the relevant extrinsic evidence in aid of identifying which of the reasonable readings was intended by the parties.harrah entm t,jcc holding,citing eagle indus.devilbiss health care.however,delaware follows a different rule where the ambiguous contract at issue is a firm governing document.stockman heartland indus.partners,llp,wl,at.july.where such a governing document makes promises to parties who did not participate in negotiating the agreement,delaware applies the general principle of contra proferentem,and construes ambiguous provisions against the drafter without resorting to extrinsic evidence.see also si mgmt.wininger,applying contra proferentem when interpreting a partnership agreement shiftan morgan joseph holdings,applying contra proferentem when interpreting a certificate of incorporation.
this rule applies where the ambiguous provision at issue concerns advancement see stockman,wl,at delucca kkat,wl,at.indeed,if anything,delaware impulse to construe governing instruments against their drafters applies with greater force to advancement provisions,because delaware has a strong public policy in favor of advancement.id.at see also homestore,at.
goldman by laws make promises of advancement to parties who did not participate in negotiating the agreement.see stockman,wl,at.under delaware law,then,goldman must clearly notify its employees whether they are entitled to advancement under its by laws.see id.as the majority explains,goldman has failed to do so.see op.at.it has drafted an advancement provision susceptible to more than one interpretation.accordingly,delaware law requires us to apply the doctrine of contra proferentem and construe the provision against goldman.
the majority has declined to apply delaware contra proferentem doctrine to the advancement provision of the by laws,because,it says,this dispute concerns whether aleynikov is entitled to benefits under the by laws and not what those benefits include.the majority draws this distinction from its survey of delaware cases they apply contra proferentem to ambiguities as to the scope of a particular benefit,but are silent as to whether contra proferentem applies to ambiguities concerning an individual entitlement to the benefit at all.
but the fact that delaware has not applied contra proferentem in this exact circumstance does not mean that it would not do so were it given the opportunity.and given the clear language in delaware case law stating that contra proferentem applies to ambiguous provisions of governing documents,i believe that it is not appropriate to craft an exception to delaware rule,unless the public policies motivating the rule are inapplicable to these circumstances.in my view,however,the policies supporting delaware use of contra proferentem would plainly be furthered by applying the doctrine to this case.specifically,construing the advancement provision against goldman would assure relevant stakeholders that they could reasonably rely on the face of governing documents of delaware corporations,and encourage goldman to redraft the advancement provision in its by laws.
generally speaking,persons working for,and contracting with,a firm do not take part in the drafting of the document that creates the firm and governs its conduct.rather,these persons and entitled referred to here as the firm stakeholders conduct business with the firm after the governing document is drafted,and they must then decide whether to interact with the company based upon the representations of a unilaterally drafted document.see stockman,wl,at noting that a firm stakeholders look to the governing instrument words when determining whether to engage with a company see also bank of mellon commerzbank capital funding trust ii.delaware robust application of contra proferentem accounts for this reliance interest by protect ing the reasonable expectations of people who join a partnership or other entity after it was formed and must rely on the face of the operating agreement to understand their rights and obligations when making the decision to join.stockman,wl,at.this in turn benefits the entity by encouraging stakeholders to provide their capital,be it human or financial,at a lower cost than they would if they faced greater uncertainty.id.at.
by rejecting the district court application of contra proferentem,we open the door for the finder of fact to determine a governing document meaning using extrinsic evidence.but as the delaware chancery court has noted,looking to extrinsic evidence to make sense of these documents,rather than construing them against their drafters as a matter of law,contravenes the public policy outlined above.specifically,doing so undermine s the ability of investors,officers,and other relevant constituencies to rely on the written text of governing instruments in deciding whether to invest in,work for,or supply debt capital to entities.id.at.such an outcome is bad for that firm employees,its investors,and its shareholders.
the reasonable expectation of a vice president that he is an officer of a corporation and is entitled to the benefits provided for in the by laws is the very sort of expectation that delaware corporate law clearly protects.aleynikov join ed goldman after it was formed and rel ied on the face of its by laws that is,a vague promise that he was an officer entitled to advancement to understand his rights and obligations when making the decision to join.see id.honoring this reasonable expectation would assure other stakeholders that they,too,may rely on governing documents when doing business with entities organized in delaware.
by contrast,today majority opinion does not honor aleynikov reasonable expectations about the meaning of goldman by laws.in fact,as i explain below,it privileges the subjective views of goldman about the meaning of the term officer over the reasonable expectations of its employees.doing so undermine s the ability of relevant constituencies to rely on the written text of governing instruments in deciding whether to invest in,work for,or supply debt capital to entities.see id.
delaware application of contra proferentem serves another,related public policy it encourages corporations to draft clear corporate instruments and ensures that governing instruments of entities are interpreted consistently and that they are applied in a predictable manner.stockman,wl,at accord penn mut.life ins.oglesby,noting that it is incumbent on an issuer of securities to make the terms of its operative documents clear to a reasonable investor.by contrast,resorting to extrinsic evidence in construing ambiguous corporate instruments,as the majority does,create s unpredictable results and reduce s the incentives for clear drafting.stockman,wl,at.
by construing the advancement provision against goldman,we would incentivize gol
