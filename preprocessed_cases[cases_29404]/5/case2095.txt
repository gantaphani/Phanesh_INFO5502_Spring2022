under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,the prevailing party in tort litigation may recover as costs the ordinary witness fees,as defined in government code section and code of civil procedure section,which were incurred in deposing a witness in this case,we hold that the ordinary witness fees do not include a treating physician reasonable and customary hourly or daily fees which must be paid under section,subdivision i in order to take the deposition of the treating physician.
we also hold that the prevailing party may not recover the costs of a discovery referee as a matter of right and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying recovery under the circumstances of this case.
the underlying litigation 
lockheed martin corporation appeals the trial court granting of a motion to tax certain costs in this case,which is also known as the redlands tort litigation.the redlands tort litigation began as a class action alleging that defendant lockheed martin corporation and others conducted manufacturing operations in redlands beginning in,and that those operations discharged dangerous chemicals which contaminated the city drinking water supply.the action alleged that this contaminated water was used by many of the residents of the city.plaintiffs sought a court order requiring defendants to fund a program for the medical monitoring of class members,estimated at to persons.the trial court certified the class but we reversed,finding that class certification was inappropriate because individual issues clearly predominated.our supreme court affirmed our decision,finding that plaintiffs had not met their burden of proving that common issues of law and fact predominate.lockheed martin superior court cal th,d.
the motion for summary judgment 
in december,lockheed martin brought a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication against certain plaintiffs,alleging that their individual claims were barred by the statute of limitations.the trial court agreed with lockheed martin that the individual claims of eight plaintiffs were time barred for some or all of their causes of action.
the motion to tax costs 
lockheed martin then filed cost memoranda seeking cost reimbursements from each of the eight defeated plaintiffs.the lengthy memoranda presented various calculations to allocate a fraction of the costs of the litigation to each of the eight plaintiffs.for example,using this allocation system,lockheed martin sought costs of from plaintiff patricia.costs were sought from the other seven defeated plaintiffs in sums ranging from to.
in may,plaintiffs filed their detailed objections to the cost memoranda and concurrent motions to tax the costs.the objections included the contention that plaintiffs should not have to pay for the costs of the depositions of the plaintiffs respective treating physicians.plaintiffs argued that those costs are not properly recoverable under section.plaintiffs also argued that they should not have to pay the costs of the discovery referee,including time charged for the referee attendance at individual depositions.
in rebuttal,lockheed martin argued that it should be reimbursed for the fees it had to pay to take the depositions of the treating physicians,and the fees it paid to the discovery referee.
a hearing was held on july.the court refused to make a general apportionment of costs to plaintiffs and instead decided that t he rationale has to be reasonableness of the fees on a basis,basis to determine what is reasonable as to fees as to each of the plaintiffs.after considering a number of other issues,the trial court reviewed the statutes and tentatively ruled that lockheed martin could not recover the full costs of taking the deposition of the treating physicians for each of the eight plaintiffs.it also tentatively ruled that the original payment schedule for apportionment of the costs of the discovery referee would govern,and lockheed martin could not recover the fees it paid to the discovery referee as costs.
after further briefing,the cost issues were again heard on october.at the conclusion of that hearing,the trial court adopted its tentative rulings and issued its order on the objections to claimed costs.as noted above,two aspects of that order are contested here lockheed martin contends the trial court erred in allowing only a day for the depositions of plaintiffs treating physicians,instead of their customary hourly and daily fees and in refusing to allow recovery of costs paid to the discovery referee 
standard of review 
the parties agree that the applicable standard of review for the issue of the allowance of the costs of deposing treating physicians is de novo review.on review of an award of attorney fees after trial,the normal standard of review is abuse of discretion.however,de novo review of such a trial court order is warranted where the determination of whether the criteria for an award of attorney fees and costs in this context have been satisfied amounts to statutory construction and a question of law.citations.carver chevron,th,d.
we agree with the parties.as will be seen,the first issue is an issue of statutory interpretation and a de novo standard of review is appropriate 
plaintiffs contend that the abuse of discretion standard of review is the proper standard to use in deciding whether the trial court properly denied the fees of the discovery referee.they point out that the award or denial of such fees is discretionary under section,subdivision c.winston square homeowner centex west,d.we agree and apply the abuse of discretion standard of review to the second issue.
general principles 
the costs of a civil action consist of the expenses of litigation,usually excluding attorney fees.under the common law rule,parties to litigation must bear their own costs.the right to recover any of such costs is determined entirely by statute.it is axiomatic that the right to recover costs is purely statutory,and,in the absence of an authorizing statute,no costs can be recovered by either party.citations.davis,cal th,d.
this general rule is subject to numerous exceptions,including those found in code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,which provides that unless otherwise statutorily prohibited,the prevailing party is entitled to recover costs.the primary statutory provision with respect to the types of expenses that may or may not be included in a cost award under code of civil procedure section is found in section of that code.ripley pappadopoulos th,d.
this means that the prevailing party is entitled to all of his costs unless another statute provides otherwise.citation.absent such statutory authority,the court has no discretion to deny costs to the prevailing party.citation.nelson anderson th,d ladas california state auto.th,d.
recovery of the witness fees charged by treating physicians as costs 
in a case management order dated june,the referee allowed defendants to depose certain plaintiffs and their treating health care providers.lockheed martin claims that it took the depositions of respondents treating physicians,examining them on their percipient knowledge of the illnesses and injuries forming the basis of respondents claims,with particular focus on their diagnosis,treatment,and prognosis of respondents.in order to do so,lockheed martin had to pay the customary hourly and daily fees of the treating physicians.
plaintiffs do not disagree factually,but rather contend that the fees paid to the doctors were expert witness fees which are not recoverable as costs under section,subdivision b.section,subdivision b states the following items are not allowable as costs,except when expressly authorized by law fees of experts not ordered by the court.since the treating physicians were not experts ordered by the court,plaintiffs argue that this provision applies to bar recovery of the costs incurred to take their depositions.recovery of their reasonable and customary hourly or daily fees would therefore be prohibited.
lockheed martin contends that it is entitled to a cost award which includes the actual costs it had to pay in order to depose the treating physicians.it finds express statutory authority for the recovery of such costs.
as noted above,the prevailing party is entitled to recover the costs specified in section,subdivision a,subd.b.lockheed martin relies on section,subdivision a.that provision states that the prevailing party is entitled to recover o rdinary witness fees pursuant to section of the government code.section provides except as otherwise provided by law,witness fees for each day actual attendance,when legally required to attend a civil action or proceeding in the superior courts,are dollars a day and mileage actually traveled,both ways,twenty cents a mile.
the heart of lockheed martin argument is its contention that the ordinary witness fee for a treating physician is not a day under government code section.instead,lockheed martin invokes the otherwise provided by law clause and argues that the witness fees for depositions of treating physicians is otherwise provided in section,subdivision i.under that subdivision,the treating physician is entitled to be paid the expert reasonable and customary hourly or daily fee for any time spent at the deposition 
lockheed martin therefore contends that section,subdivision i is a provision which sets ordinary witness fees for treating physicians at the amounts lockheed was required to pay to depose them.it would therefore follow that such fees are recoverable as costs under section,subdivision a because the ordinary witness fee for a treating physician is now statutorily set as the physician ordinary witness fee.
we disagree with lockheed martin for two reasons not all costs required to be paid by the prevailing party are recoverable costs under sections and and section,subdivision b specifically disallows expert fees as costs unless the court has ordered the fees to be incurred.
the weak link in the statutory chain posited by lockheed martin is its reliance on the introductory clause of government code section.that clause refers to fees which are recoverable costs under other statutes.a number of cases describe these statutes and emphasize that,except as provided by statute,expert witness fees are not recoverable as costs.for example,in ripley pappadopoulos,supra,th,d,the court said in numerous specific types of cases the legislature has seen fit to require the losing party to reimburse the prevailing party for the payment of expert witness fees when the numerous statutory provisions in which expert witness fees are expressly declared recoverable are considered together with the express prohibition against the inclusion of such fees in a cost award otherwise,the legislature intent becomes clear.the legislature has reserved to itself the power to determine selectively the types of actions and circumstances in which expert witness fees should be recoverable as costs and such fees may not otherwise be recovered in a cost award.id.at,d,fn.omitted.the omitted footnote lists a number of statutes which provide for the recovery of expert witness fees as costs.
for example,evidence code section provides for the payment of costs of a expert,and further provides that the fee fixed by the court as compensation for the expert services under evidence code section is a recoverable cost,subd.c.evidence code section,on the other hand,provides that other expert evidence may be produced,but,where other expert witnesses are called by a party to the action,their fees shall be paid by the party calling them and only ordinary witness fees shall be taxed as costs in the action.
as our supreme court puts it,the legislature has created exceptions to the general rule concerning costs,by expressly authorizing the shifting of the fees of an expert in specific types of actions.davis,supra,cal th,d.the davis opinion goes on to list specific examples which are not applicable here.see also wegner et,cal.practice guide civil trials and evidence the rutter group.it is these specific exceptions,and the other exceptions in the editorial material accompanying the statute,which are referred to in the introductory clause to section.
in other words,section,subdivision i only requires the person taking the treating physician deposition to pay the doctor reasonable and customary hourly or daily fee in order to take the deposition.it does not provide that the fee is a recoverable cost.as a treatise puts it under the previous statute,a deposition fee paid to an opponent designated expert was not a cost recoverable by the prevailing party.however,this ruling was based on a government code provision that stated that expert fees shall not be allowable costs.after the adoption of the discovery act of,this wording was deleted from that statute,and the statute itself no longer applies to discovery depositions of experts.section is silent concerning any right of a prevailing party to recover deposition fees paid to an opponent expert.hogan et,cal.civil discovery bancroft whitney,fns.omitted.
despite lockheed martin contrary argument,not all required costs are recoverable.only those costs which are specified in the statute are allowable as a matter of right under section,subdivision a.under section,subdivision a,the fees or expert witness fees ordered by the court are recoverable.the corollary,provided by section,subdivision b,is that fees of experts not ordered by the court are not recoverable in the absence of a specific authorizing statute.we find that section,subdivision i is not such a statute.
our supreme court has recently confronted a related issue.in schreiber estate of kiser cal th,d,the court held that section does not require the submission of an expert witness declaration for a treating physician the court held that a treating physician does not become a retained expert within the meaning of section,subdivision a,thus requiring the filing of an expert witness declaration,whenever the physician gives opinion testimony.schreiber,at,d.the court explained that the declaration requirement applies only to certain expert witnesses,including retained experts,and a treating physician was not within any of the listed categories.id.at,d.
a treating physician is therefore not a retained expert a treating physician is a percipient expert,but that does not mean that his or her testimony is limited only to personal observations.rather,like any other expert,he or she may provide both fact and opinion testimony.as the legislative history clarifies,what distinguishes the treating physician from a retained expert is not the content of the testimony,but the context in which he or she became familiar with the plaintiff injuries that were ultimately the subject of litigation,and which form the factual basis for the medical opinion.schreiber estate of kiser,supra,cal th,d.thus,while the treating physician is not a retained physician,the treating physician is clearly an expert.accordingly,the right to recover the fees charged by the treating physician for a deposition are recoverable only if the expert was ordered by the court,subd.a,and not otherwise,subd.b.
a n expert witness ordered by the court is one who has been appointed by the court pursuant to evidence code section or other statutory authority.in the absence of an order of the trial court appointing an expert witness,the fees of an expert witness are not recoverable as costs under code of civil procedure section.sanchez bay shores medical group th,d desplancke wilson th,d.the fact that an expert is necessary to present a party case does not mean that expert has been ordered by the court for purposes of recovery of expert witness fees as costs.citation.sanchez bay shores medical group,supra,th,d.thus,the fact that expert witness fees had to be paid under section i in order to take the depositions of the treating physicians does not mean that those fees are necessarily recoverable costs.
such fees are simply not ordinary witness fees as described in section,subdivision a and lockheed martin can not,by the verbal alchemy of its skilled attorneys,successfully transmute the phrase ordinary witness fees into a higher category entitled ordinary witness fees of treating physicians.treating physicians are experts and recovery of their fees as costs are accordingly governed
