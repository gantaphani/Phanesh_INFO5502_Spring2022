code of civil procedure section is california suit strategic lawsuits against public participation statute hereafter referred to as section or the statute the statute was specifically enacted to provide both a summary disposition and attorney fees and costs to defendants in such actions 
plaintiff and appellant peter dowling dowling appeals from a judgment dismissing his complaint against defendant and respondent connie zimmerman zimmerman under the provisions of section,and awarding her,under subdivision c of that section,reasonable attorney fees in the amount of and costs in the amount of.we hold that in order to effectuate the purpose of the statute and the legislature intent to deter slapp suits,a defendant who appears in a slapp action in propria persona and later retains specially appearing counsel who successfully brings on behalf of the defendant a special motion to strike the complaint under section is entitled to recover an award of reasonable attorney fees under the mandatory provisions of subdivision c of that section in order to compensate the retained counsel for the legal services provided in connection with both the special motion to strike,and the recovery of attorney fees and costs under that subdivision.because we also conclude the court in the instant case properly granted zimmerman special motion to strike the complaint under the statute,and its modest award of fees in her favor under subdivision c of that statute is not excessive in amount we affirm the judgment.
in his separate petition,dowling seeks a writ of supersedeas barring zimmerman from attempting to enforce the portion of the judgment awarding her attorney fees and costs under the statute pending disposition of his appeal in this matter dowling appealed from the judgment without filing an appeal bond or other undertaking.when zimmerman attempted to enforce the judgment by serving dowling with a subpoena duces tecum and an order to appear at a judgment debtor examination,dowling unsuccessfully moved to quash the subpoena and vacate the debtor examination,contending that enforcement of the judgment was automatically stayed under section,subdivision d,by the perfecting of his appeal.dowling challenged the court ruling by filing the instant writ petition.we granted a de facto stay of execution of the judgment by requesting zimmerman to answer the petition and brief the legal issues presented therein,and by thereafter deferring a ruling on the petition until disposition of the appeal.
the petition presents a question of first impression whether a prevailing slapp defendant enforcement of a judgment awarding attorney fees and costs under subdivision c of section is automatically stayed by the slapp plaintiff perfecting of an appeal from that judgment.we hold that a slapp plaintiff perfecting of an appeal from a judgment awarding attorney fees and costs to a prevailing slapp defendant under subdivision c of section does not automatically stay enforcement of the judgment.we further hold that to stay enforcement of such a judgment,the slapp plaintiff must give an appropriate appeal bond or undertaking under the money judgment exception to the automatic stay rule.
the petition for writ of supersedeas and the appeal have been consolidated for disposition.
factual and procedural background 
appellant dowling and his wife together the dowlings owned a townhouse in the penasquitos townhouse complex in the city of san diego.respondent zimmerman is an attorney.edward white and his wife grace white together the whites lived in the dowlings townhouse.harvey pollack pollack was the property manager of the penasquitos townhouse owners association ptoa.in january,the dowlings and the whites entered into an agreement under which the whites leased the townhouse with intent to purchase it.
a.the underlying unlawful detainer and harassment litigation 
in july,after a dispute arose between the dowlings and the whites involving the whites payment obligations and title to and possession of the subject townhouse,the dowlings commenced the first of three unsuccessful unlawful detainer actions against the whites in a period.the dowlings were represented by counsel john kopp,kopp in all three actions.the whites represented themselves in the first two actions.the dowlings voluntarily dismissed the first action without prejudice.
the dowlings second unlawful detainer action against the whites proceeded to trial.the court found the statutory notice was defective and entered a judgment of dismissal in favor of the whites.
on october,before the dowlings filed their third unlawful detainer action,edward white petitioned for and obtained a restraining order prohibiting dowling from harassing the whites for a period of one year.
on october,the dowlings filed their third unlawful detainer action against the whites shortly thereafter,zimmerman agreed to represent the whites in that action on a pro bono basis.when the whites reported to her that dowling was continuing to harass them,zimmerman sent several letters to dowling attorney,kopp,between october and november in an effort to investigate the matter and stop the claimed harassment pending the outcome of the unlawful detainer proceeding.
the november letter 
eventually,the whites asked zimmerman to petition the ptoa board of directors through the ptoa property manager,pollack,to investigate the whites claims regarding certain disturbances in the neighborhood,and to assist them in stopping the claimed harassment by dowling so that the whites could have the quiet use and enjoyment of the townhouse in the ptoa complex.
in her capacity as the whites attorney and based on information they provided to her,zimmerman on november,sent a letter hereafter referred to as the letter or the november letter to pollack,the ptoa property manager.the whites had informed zimmerman that pollack,as the property manager,was the appropriate person to whom ptoa homeowner complaints should be directed regarding safety concerns,ingress and egress problems,and nuisances in the complex.based on information provided by the whites,zimmerman sent the letter to five other individuals she believed were members of the ptoa board of directors.
in the november letter,zimmerman identified herself as the whites attorney,and explained the purpose of the letter 
the purpose of this letter is to advise you of certain unusual and even dangerous conditions occurring on the property and complex,and to give you the opportunity to correct and eliminate them.the situation interferes with the whites use and enjoyment of their property and may very well affect other residents enjoyment.this letter is notice to the ptoa,its board of directors,officers,and agents that the safety of your residents and owners may be at risk and we hope you will assist us in our efforts to create a more pleasant environment in the complex.
in the letter,zimmerman provided information about the dispute between the dowlings and the whites,and then made reference to dowling harassment of the whites 
in july,dowling began a concerted plan of harassment against the whites and entered into a series of behaviors which have now come to the attention of the san diego police department.dowling repeatedly tells residents that the whites are tenants,refuse to pay rent,and refuse to move.this is untrue.
zimmerman stated in the letter that the july unlawful detainer action filed by dowling was dismissed based on evidence he had rel ied on a forged document 
in july,dowling filed an unlawful detainer action which his attorney dismissed once it was learned that dowling was relying on a forged document to support his case.someone forged white name on a rental agreement.in september,dowling lost the second unlawful detainer action against the whites even though or because he offered the forged rental agreement as evidence.italics added.
zimmerman also listed various unusual occurrences such as the phone company disconnecting the whites telephone service and the utility company scheduling of a disconnecting of service at the telephonic direction of an unnamed male,among others,and asserted that dowling continuous threats against the whites and his daily prowling around their condo creates fear and apprehension in grace white.
march stipulation for judgment in the third unlawful detainer action 
in march,dowling and the whites entered into a stipulated judgment in favor of dowling in the third unlawful detainer action.zimmerman,acting as the whites counsel,negotiated the stipulated judgment on their behalf.the stipulation required the whites to return possession of the townhouse to the dowlings,but contained a provision that the parties reserved the right to recover damages through legal action at a later date.
b.the instant litigation 
dowling slapp complaint 
in november,dowling filed his slapp complaint naming zimmerman and edward white as the defendants,and alleging causes of action of these,the following four were alleged against zimmerman defamation fifth cause of action,misrepresentation sixth cause of action,intentional infliction of emotional distress tenth cause of action,and negligent infliction of emotional distress eleventh cause of action.
dowling defamation cause of action was based only on the following allegation 
zimmerman by her words and actions has impugned the reputation of plaintiff.these words and actions have been false.zimmerman has consistently published her false allegations to others on numerous occasions.zimmerman words have lowered the plaintiff s reputation in the eyes of his business associates and tenants and thus adversely affected present and future businesses.plaintiff has been damaged in an amount according to proof at trial.
dowling misrepresentation cause of action was based on allegations that zimmerman knowingly made unspecified false representations,and concealed unspecific material facts,during unspecified negotiations.
last,dowling two emotional distress claims were both based on his allegation that zimmerman published a false letter presumably the november letter,discussed ante.
dowling served zimmerman with the summons and complaint in march.acting in pro se,zimmerman answered the complaint and alleged various affirmative defenses,including the defense that dowling complaint was barred by the litigation privilege set forth in civil code section,subdivision b.
zimmerman special motion to strike under section 
in may,zimmerman filed her timely special motion to strike dowling complaint against her under the statute.zimmerman argued that the complaint was a meritless slapp suit intended to intimidate and punish her for assisting the whites in exercising their lawful right to petition the courts and the ptoa on the public issue of residential safety and nuisances within the meaning of subdivisions e and of section see fn,ante.zimmerman also argued that dowling was unable to meet his burden under the statute of establishing a probability of prevailing on his claims because the complaint contained only legal conclusions her statements in the november letter were not provably false factual assertions,and thus were not defamatory and those statements were privileged under the litigation privilege codified in subdivision b of civil code section see fn,ante,the common interest privilege codified in subdivision c of civil code section and the first amendment to the united states constitution.in support of her motion,zimmerman submitted her own declaration,the declarations of the whites,and documentary evidence that included among other things the november letter.
dowling opposed the motion to strike,contending among other things that the statute did not apply because no public issue was involved in the case.he also contended that zimmerman failed to make the requisite prima facie showing under the statute because the right to petition or exercise free speech,if any,belonged to the whites,not to zimmerman the november letter involved a private dispute between the whites and him the statute did not apply to a defamation action his papers showed a probability he would prevail in the action and zimmerman statements in her november letter were not privileged under civil code section.in support of his opposition,dowling submitted his own declaration,the declaration of his attorney kopp,and a copy of zimmerman executed substitution of attorney form from the underlying unlawful detainer proceedings.
zimmerman filed reply papers in which she challenged dowling evidence,and argued among other things that subdivisions e and of section contained no public issue requirement,and she published the november letter in connection with the unlawful detainer proceedings and in good faith contemplation of renewing the restraining order previously granted to her clients,the whites.she submitted her own supplemental declaration and that of edward white.dowling filed an unauthorized response to zimmerman reply papers.following oral argument on the motion,the court took the matter under submission.
decision and judgment of dismissal 
in july,the court issued its written decision granting zimmerman special motion to strike dowling complaint under the statute.the court determined that zimmerman had met her initial burden on the motion by showing that the november letter constituted conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right to free speech on matters of public concern and the constitutional right of petition under section,subdivisions e and e.the court explained that the letter addressed the public concerns of nuisance and safety at the penasquitos townhouse complex it was written in connection with the dowling underlying unlawful detainer action against the whites and it was directed to persons who held themselves out to be members of the board of directors of zimmerman client homeowner association.the court also explained that the letter made reference to conduct by dowling that might constitute a nuisance or a safety hazard,and zimmerman wrote it to advise the ptoa of the potential nuisance hazard.giving the statute the broad construction expressly mandated in subdivision a of section see fn,ante this section shall be construed broadly,and noting that the letter discussed the underlying unlawful detainer and harassment litigation,the court found that the letter would not have been written but for the pending litigation.
the court also determined that dowling had not met his statutory burden under section,subdivision b see fn,ante,of showing a probability of prevailing on the merits of his complaint.the court explained 
the complaint is pled without specificity and is without merit.while zimmerman was not yet counsel of record at the time the letter was written,the facts disclose that she was the whites attorney when she wrote the letter.moreover,the facts show that zimmerman wrote the letter within the course and scope of her representation of the whites.zimmerman letter was privileged under civil code section.therefore,dowling has not met his burden of showing a probability of prevailing.
judgment and zimmerman motion for attorney fees,subd.c 
on august,noting it had granted zimmerman special motion to strike dowling slapp complaint under section,the court entered a judgment dismissing the complaint with prejudice.the judgment also awarded to zimmerman reasonable attorney fees and costs under subdivision c of that statute in an amount to be determined.
zimmerman thereafter brought a motion for recovery of reasonable attorney fees under the mandatory provisions of section,subdivision c in her supporting declaration,zimmerman stated she had retained an attorney,james moneer moneer,for the nominal retainer fee of to represent her in the instant case as special counsel of record for the sole purpose of handling the a motion per section.she also stated that moneer fee was contingent on the result of her motion under subdivision c of the statute,and without the mandatory attorney fees provision of that subdivision she would not have been able to afford his services as an specialist.in his supporting and reply declarations,moneer provided evidence of his experience and expertise,and of the services he had rendered to zimmerman.he stated he had spent hours of billable time on her behalf at the rate of per hour,and the total amount of attorney fees requested in the motion was.
in september,the court awarded zimmerman,under subdivision c of section,the sum of hours at the rate of per hour as reasonable attorney fees for moneer legal services,plus costs incurred in furtherance of the special motion to strike in the amount of.the court amended the judgment to incorporate these attorney fees and cost awards.
dowling appeal and zimmerman 
on october,dowling filed his timely notice of appeal without posting an appeal bond.zimmerman thereafter filed notice of her from the order on her motion for attorney fees.
dowling motion to quash subpoena and vacate judgment debtor exam 
zimmerman attempted to enforce the judgment by serving dowling with a subpoena duces tecum and an order to appear at a judgment debtor examination that was eventually scheduled for february.
on january,dowling challenged zimmerman attempted enforcement of the judgment by bringing a motion to quash the subpoena and vacate the debtor examination order,contending that the perfecting of his appeal without the filing of an appeal bond or other undertaking automatically stayed enforcement of the judgment under section,subdivision d.
on january,the court denied dowling motion.the court found that the award of attorney fees in favor of zimmerman under section was a judgment directing payment of money within the meaning of section,subdivision a,and thus the perfecting of dowling appeal did not automatically stay enforcement of the judgment.the court also found that an undertaking consistent with the relevant statutes was required to effect a stay pending the appeal.
dowling petition for writ of supersedeas 
on february,dowling challenged the court ruling by filing his pending petition for writ of supersedeas the petition,seeking a stay of enforcement of the judgment pending disposition of his appeal.in his petition,dowling contends that the perfecting of his appeal automatically stayed enforcement of the judgment under the provisions of various statutes discussed,post,and thus he was entitled to such stay without filing an appeal bond or other undertaking.
on february,this court issued an order the february stay order staying the judgment debtor examination scheduled for the following day,february pending zimmerman response to the petition and disposition of the matter,and until further order of this court.
on february,this court issued another order stating the february previous stay order shall remain in effect until further order,and further ordering that this court would defer ruling on the petition for writ of supersedeas until disposition of the appeal.
zimmerman thereafter filed a request for immediate disposition of the petition.on march,this court denied zimmerman request.
discussion 
in his appeal,dowling contends the statute does not bar his tort action against zimmerman,and thus the court erred by granting zimmerman special motion to dismiss the action under this statute,because her november letter is not protected by subdivision e of section,the letter is outside the scope of section e of that section,and the letter is contrary to the statute and he has established the requisite probability of prevailing in this action by showing that zimmerman conduct is not privileged.alternatively,dowling contends the court abused its discretion by awarding zimmerman reasonable attorney fees under section,subdivision c,because she elected to appear in pro se,a pro se litigant can not recover attorney fees,and the fee award was excessive.we reject these contentions.

a slapp lawsuit is generally defined as a meritless suit filed primarily to chill the defendant exercise of first amendment rights.wilcox superior court th,d,fn.wilcox.slapp suits are brought,not to vindicate a legal right,but rather to interfere with the defendant ability to pursue his or her interests.characteristically,the slapp suit lacks merit it will achieve its objective if it depletes defendant resources or energy.the aim is not to win the lawsuit but to detract the defendant from his or her objective,which is adverse to the plaintiff.citation.church of scientology wollersheim th,d church of scientology.

special motion to strike slapp suits 
subdivision b of section authorizes a special motion to strike a slapp suit,and expressly makes subject to such a motion a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.italics added.
subdivision e of section expressly defines the first amendment activity from which a cause of action must arise within the meaning of section,subdivision b discussed,ante,in order to be the proper subject of a special motion to strike under the statute.church of scientology,supra,th at,d.subdivision e,as amended in,provides that the phrase act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,as used in section,includes four categories of conduct,which are separately defined in the subdivision four clauses

public issue limitations 
in its majority opinion in briggs supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court recently held that a slapp defendant moving under section to strike a cause of action arising from a statement made before,or in connection with an issue under consideration by,a legally authorized official proceeding within the meaning of clauses and of subdivision e of that section discussed,ante need not separately demonstrate that the statement concerned an issue of public significance.briggs,supra,cal th at,d,italics added,fn.omitted.the high court explained t hat the legislature,when enacting section,expressed in the statute preamble a desire to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,subd.a does not imply the legislature intended to impose,in the statute operative sections,an issue of public interest pleading requirement.briggs,supra,cal th at,d.the briggs court further explained that c lauses and of section,subdivision e,concerning statements made in public fora and other conduct implicating speech or petition rights,include an express issue of public interest limitation clauses and,concerning statements made before or in connection with issues under review by official proceedings,contain no such limitation.in light of this variation in phraseology,it must be presumed the legislature intended different issue requirements to apply to motions brought under clauses and of subdivision e than to motions brought under clauses and.citation.briggs,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
the briggs majority decision clarifies that clauses and of subdivision e of the statute protect conduct involving statements that implicate first amendment speech or petition rights and are made either before any legally authorized legislative,executive,judicial or other official proceeding,subd.e,or in connection with issues under review by any such official proceeding,subd.e and a defendant who brings a special motion under section to strike a lawsuit that arises from such protected conduct is not required to plead and prove that the defendant statements involved an issue of public interest.briggs,supra,cal th at,d,we conclude the court of appeal erred in construing section as if,contrary to the statute plain language,clauses and of subdivision e contained an issue of public interest limitation.
briggs also clarifies that clauses and of subdivision e of section protect conduct involving statements made in public fora,subd.e,and other conduct that implicates first amendment speech or petition rights,subd.e,but only if such public fora statements are made in connection with,or such other conduct is in furtherance of,a public issue and a defendant who brings a special motion under section to strike a lawsuit that arises from such protected conduct is not required to plead and prove that the defendant statements involved an issue of public interest.briggs,supra,cal th at,d,for potential cases where an analog to the official proceeding test does not readily,public forum,subd.e and other conduct,subd.e legislature did include an issue of public interest limitation.original italics.

dowling action falls within the ambit of section 
the first question we must decide is whether zimmerman met her initial burden of establishing a prima facie showing that dowling action against her for defamation,misrepresentation,and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress arose from any conduct on her part that implicated first amendment speech or petition rights and was protected by any one of the four clauses set forth in section,subdivision e,subd.b church of scientology,supra,th at,d.we conclude zimmerman met her burden.
dowling complaint shows that his defamation cause of action was based only on the allegation that zimmerman unspecified words and actions had impugned his reputation,and that she had consistently published unspecified false allegations that had lowered his reputation in the eyes of his business associates and tenants the complaint also shows that dowling misrepresentation cause of action was based on his allegation that zimmerman knowingly made unspecified false representations,and concealed unspecific material facts,during unspecified negotiations,presumably zimmerman negotiation on behalf of her clients,the whites,of the stipulated settlement of the dowling third unlawful detainer action against the whites.last,dowling two emotional distress claims were both based on his allegation that zimmerman published a false letter,presumably the november letter discussed,ante.
in support of her special motion under the statute to strike dowling complaint,zimmerman argued that the complaint was a meritless slapp suit intended to intimidate and punish her for assisting the whites in exercising their lawful right to petition the courts and the ptoa on the public issue of residential safety and nuisances within the meaning of subdivision e,clauses and,of section see text in fn,ante.she submitted her own declaration,the declarations of the whites,and documentary evidence that included among other things the november letter,and a harassment restraining order that edward white obtained in october prohibiting dowling from harassing the whites.
the submitted declarations show that in october,after the dowlings filed their third unlawful detainer action against the whites,zimmerman agreed to represent the whites in that action on a pro bono basis.when the whites reported to her that dowling was continuing to harass them,zimmerman sent several letters to dowling attorney,kopp,in an effort to investigate the matter and stop the claimed harassment pending the outcome of the unlawful detainer proceeding.in her declaration,zimmerman states she negotiated a stipulated settlement of that action.
the declarations also show that the whites asked zimmerman to petition the ptoa board of directors through the ptoa property manager,pollack,to investigate the whites claims regarding certain disturbances in the neighborhood and to assist them in stopping the claimed harassment by dowling so that the whites could have the quiet use and enjoyment of the townhouse in the ptoa complex.in her capacity as the whites attorney and based on information they provided to her,zimmerman prepared the november letter and sent it to pollack,the ptoa property manager.the declarations show the whites had informed zimmerman that pollack,as the property manager,was the appropriate person to whom ptoa homeowner complaints should be directed regarding safety concerns,ingress and egress problems,and nuisances in the complex.zimmerman and edward white state that,based on information the whites provided to her,zimmerman sent the letter to five other individuals she believed were members of the ptoa board of directors.
in the november letter,zimmerman identified herself as the whites attorney,and explained that the purpose of the letter was to advise you of certain unusual and even dangerous conditions occurring on the property and complex,and to give you the opportunity to correct and eliminate them.the situation interferes with the whites use and enjoyment of their property and may very well affect other residents enjoyment.this letter is notice to the ptoa,its board of directors,officers,and agents that the safety of your residents and owners may be at risk and we hope you will assist us in our efforts to create a more pleasant environment in the complex.
in the letter,zimmerman provided information about the unlawful detainer dispute between the dowlings and the whites,and made reference to dowling harassment of the whites.without expressly accusing dowling of forgery,the letter also stated that the july unlawful detainer action filed by dowling was dismissed based on evidence he had rel ied on a forged document.the letter also described various unusual occurrences and asserted that dowling continuous threats against the whites and his daily prowling around their condo creates fear and apprehension in grace white.
we conclude the court properly found that zimmerman met her initial burden of establishing a prima facie showing that dowling action arose both from statements she made made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body within the meaning of section,subdivision e,and from conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue within the meaning of section,subdivision e.the complaint and the evidence submitted by zimmerman established that all four of the tort causes of action alleged against her in dowling complaint arose from her acts of negotiating a stipulated settlement of a pending unlawful detainer action against the whites,and of writing and publishing the november letter,while she was acting in her capacity as pro bono counsel for the whites.the letter was written in connection with the pending unlawful detainer action.the letter also addressed conduct by dowling that arguably involved public issues of nuisance and safety.it stated,for example,that someone had twice entered the whites locked garage and turned the dial of their water heater off,which could be extremely dangerous,even fatal,to anyone in that building should the gas remain on,the flame be extinguished,and had the gas collected in the garage.zimmerman stated in her declaration that she directed the letter regarding the whites complaints about the neighborhood disturbances to pollack at his request,as he would forward such complaints to ptoa board members.the letter expressly stated that its purpose was to advise the ptoa,through these individuals,of the potential nuisance and the safety concerns.
dowling failed to show a probability of prevailing on his claims 
because zimmerman met her initial burden of making a prima facie showing that dowling lawsuit arose from her exercise of her free speech and petition rights,and the causes of action he alleged fell within the ambit of section,the burden shifted to dowling to establish a probability of prevailing on those claims,subd.b church of scientology,supra,th at,d.we conclude he failed to meet this burden.
as already discussed,dowling claims arose from zimmerman acts of representing the whites in connection with dowling third unlawful detainer action,negotiating a stipulated settlement of that action on their behalf,and writing and distributing to interested parties the november letter,which pertained to the legal disputes between the dowlings and the whites,dowling harassment of the whites,and the whites complaints about safety and nuisance problems at the townhouse complex where they lived.
we first conclude that the court properly found dowling complaint was pleaded without the requisite specificity.as already noted,dowling complaint alleged four causes of action against zimmerman defamation fifth cause of action,misrepresentation sixth cause of action,intentional infliction of emotional distress tenth cause of action,and negligent infliction of emotional distress eleventh cause of action.we preliminarily note that t he favored causes of action in slapp suits are defamation,various business torts such as interference with prospective economic advantage,nuisance and intentional infliction of emotional distress.wilcox,supra,th at,d,italics added.here,the complaint shows that dowling defamation cause of action was based only on the conclusory allegation that zimmerman unspecified words and actions and unspecified false allegations had lowered his reputation.as already discussed,in the letter zimmerman did not accuse dowling of forgery she stated that the july unlawful detainer action filed by dowling was dismissed based on evidence he had rel ied on a forged document.the letter did not state that dowling knew or should have known the lease agreement was forged at the time he relied on it.if allegedly defamatory statements are ambiguous and susceptible of a harmless as well as a defamatory meaning,the plaintiff must state the defamatory meaning the innuendo in which,according to his theory,they were used and understood in the light of the circumstances alleged in the inducement.witkin,cal.procedure ed.pleading,see also washer bank of america cal d.here,dowling failed to plead the requisite innuendo.
dowling misrepresentation cause of action was based on his allegations that zimmerman knowingly made unspecified false representations,and concealed unspecific material facts,during unspecified negotiations.it is that,i n california,fraud must be pled specifically general and conclusory allegations do not suffice.citations.thus the policy of liberal construction of the pleadings will not ordinarily be invoked to sustain a pleading defective in any material respect.citation.this particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which show how,when,where,to whom,and by what means the representations were tendered.citation.lazar superior court cal th,d.dowling conclusory allegations of misrepresentation are fatally defective.
dowling remaining causes of action for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress were also both based on a conclusory allegation,that zimmerman published a false letter presumably the november letter.with respect to the intentional tort,dowling failed to properly plead the requisite ultimate fact of extreme and outrageous conduct.see generally witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts.regarding his claim sounding in negligence,which incorporates by reference all preceding factual allegations,dowling failed to plead facts showing that zimmerman owed him a duty of care not to communicate with pollack,the ptoa property manager,on behalf of her clients regarding the suspected incidents of harassment occurring in the townhouse complex while the underlying unlawful detainer action was pending.we conclude dowling defectively pleaded complaint facially appears to be a slapp suit.wilcox,supra,th at,d.
we also conclude the court properly found that,the november letter would not have been written but for the pending litigation,and the letter was privileged under the litigation privilege codified in civil code section,subdivision b zimmerman wrote and published the letter in her capacity as pro bono counsel for the whites,and the letter clearly pertained to the pending underlying unlawful detainer litigation.it arguably pertained also to the prior harassment injunction litigation to the extent the whites had the right to apply for a renewal of the restraining order they had obtained against dowling.to the extent dowling slapp complaint was also based on statements that zimmerman made to dowling counsel,kopp,while negotiating the stipulated settlement of the unlawful detainer action on behalf of the whites,those statements were privileged under subdivision b of civil code section.
in sum,dowling failed to meet his burden of establishing a probability of prevailing on his tort claims against zimmerman.we thus conclude the court properly granted zimmerman special motion to strike dowling slapp complaint under the statute.
attorney fees 
dowling also appeals from the portion of the judgment awarding to zimmerman,under subdivision c of section,the sum of hours at the rate of per hour as reasonable attorney fees for associated counsel moneer legal services.in her supporting attorney fees motion declaration,zimmerman stated she paid attorney moneer a nominal retainer fee of to represent her in the instant case as special counsel of record for the sole purpose of handling the a motion per section,and moneer fee was contingent on the result of her motion under subdivision c of the statute.we must decide,as a matter of first impression,the issue of whether a slapp suit defendant,who appears in the action in propria persona and successfully moves for dismissal of the suit under section with the assistance of specially appearing retained counsel,is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees under the mandatory attorney fees provisions of subdivision c of that section.
zimmerman pro se status assisted by retained counsel 
dowling first contends the court abused its discretion by awarding attorney fees to zimmerman because she elected to appear in this action in pro se.we reject this contention.under subdivision c of section,a slapp defendant who prevails on a special motion to strike is entitled to a mandatory award of reasonable attorney fees.subdivision c of that section provides in part 
in any action subject to subdivision b,a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney fees and costs.italics added.
that subdivision authorizes the court to make an award of reasonable attorney fees to a prevailing defendant,which will adequately compensate the defendant for the expense of responding to a baseless lawsuit.citation.dove audio,rosenfeld,meyer susman th,d dove audio.
dowling cites no authority,and we have found none,for the proposition that a slapp defendant who initially makes an appearance in the action in pro se and later retains counsel who successfully brings both a special motion to strike the complaint under section,and a motion for reasonable fees and costs under subdivision c of that section,is barred from recovering such fees.the case law authorities upon which dowling relies are inapposite because none involved an award of fees under the statute 
because there is no clear statutory or case law authority on point,the determination of the issue presented must be guided by interpretation of legislative intent underlying section under the rules of statutory construction,which require courts to construe a statute to promote its purpose,render it reasonable,and avoid absurd consequences.robertson rodriguez th,d,citing brown superior court cal d.the fundamental rule of statutory construction is that the court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citations.select base materials board of equal.cal d,select base materials.
as already discussed,section was enacted to deter and prevent slapp suits.church of scientology,supra,th at,d.the statute is california response to the problems created by meritless lawsuits brought to harass those who have exercised their first amendment constitutional rights of free speech and petition for the redress of grievances.id.at,d.the legislative intent to afford the victims of slapp suits a swift and effective remedy is clear.california enacted section to provide a procedural remedy to resolve such a suit expeditiously.church of scientology,supra,th at,d,italics added.the legislature expressly set forth the intent and purpose underlying the statute in subdivision a of section 
the legislature finds and declares that there has been a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.the legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process.to this end,this section shall be construed broadly.italics added.
in deciding the issue presented,this court must therefore construe the statute broadly in order to effectuate its purposes and give effect to the legislature intent to provide a swift and effective remedy to slapp suit defendants.to prevail on a special motion to strike under section,a slapp defendant ordinarily must have competent legal representation,regardless of whether the defendant is an attorney or whether the defendant initially appears in the action in propria persona.the special motion to strike a slapp suit provided under section is the remedial tool the legislature gave to victims of such meritless suits.in our view,the purpose of the statute will be promoted by construing that statute broadly to permit a pro se slapp defendant,who has successfully brought a special motion to strike the offending slapp suit with the assistance of special retained counsel,to recover mandatory reasonable attorney fees to compensate the retained counsel for the legal services provided.we note that in the instant case,zimmerman provided evidence that without the mandatory attorney fees provision set forth in subdivision c of section,she would not have been able to afford moneer services as an specialist.
we hold that in order to effectuate the purpose of the statute and the legislature intent to deter slapp suits,a defendant who appears in a slapp action in propria persona and later retains specially appearing counsel who successfully brings on behalf of the defendant a special motion to strike the complaint under section,is entitled to recover an award of reasonable attorney fees under the mandatory provisions of subdivision c of that section in order to compensate the retained counsel for the legal services provided in connection with both the special motion to strike,and the recovery of attorney fees and costs under that subdivision.
amount of the attorney fees award 
dowling contends the amount awarded to zimmerman as reasonable attorney fees under subdivision c of section was excessive.he further contends the amount of such an award to a prevailing slapp defendant should not exceed the amount of attorney fees the defendant actually incurred here,the sum of.we reject these contentions.
the record in the instant case shows that the modified contingent fee agreement into which zimmerman and moneer entered provided that zimmerman would pay him a nominal retainer in the amount of,he would collect his attorney fees from her under the statute if she prevailed on her special motion to strike dowling slapp complaint,but he would absorb the loss of his billable time if the court denied the motion.in support of zimmerman motion for reasonable attorney fees,which he litigated on her behalf,moneer submitted his own declaration and other evidence showing he had spent hours of billable time on her behalf,at the rate of per hour,on the special motion to strike and the attorney fees motion,and the total amount of zimmerman attorney fees request was.the court awarded zimmerman,under subdivision c of section,the sum of only hours at the rate of per hour as reasonable attorney fees for moneer legal services plus costs incurred in furtherance of the special motion to strike in the amount of.this modest amount is clearly not excessive.
we conclude the court attorney fees award did not constitute an abuse of discretion.construing subdivision c of section broadly,as we must,subd.a,we reject dowling contention that the court should have limited the award to the incurred amount of.
attorney fees on appeal 
in her respondent brief on appeal,zimmerman asks this court to award her reasonable attorney fees and costs on appeal.as already discussed,subdivision c of section provides for an award of reasonable attorney fees to a slapp defendant who successfully brings a motion to strike,and we have concluded that the court attorney fees award in this matter was proper despite zimmerman status as a pro se litigant.
a statute authorizing an attorney fee award at the trial court level includes appellate attorney fees unless the statute specifically provides otherwise.citation.dove audio,supra,th at,d.section,subdivision c provides that a prevailing defendant is entitled to recover attorney fees and costs,and does not preclude recovery on appeal.dove audio,supra,th at,d.accordingly,zimmerman is awarded reasonable attorney fees on this appeal,the amount of which is to be determined by the trial court upon remand.
ii.petition 
in his petition for writ of supersedeas,dowling seeks a stay of zimmerman enforcement of the portion of the judgment awarding her reasonable attorney fees and costs under the statute pending disposition of his appeal in this matter.dowling appealed from the judgment without filing an appeal bond or other undertaking.zimmerman attempted to enforce the judgment by serving dowling with a subpoena duces tecum and an order to appear at a judgment debtor examination,and dowling brought a motion to quash the subpoena and vacate the examination,contending that the perfecting of his appeal automatically stayed enforcement of the judgment under section,subdivision d.the court denied dowling motion on the ground that the award of attorney fees in favor of zimmerman under section was a judgment directing payment of money within the meaning of section,subdivision a,and thus the perfecting of dowling appeal did not automatically stay enforcement of the judgment.the court also found that an undertaking consistent with the relevant statutes was required to effect a stay pending the appeal.
the issue we must decide is whether a prevailing slapp defendant enforcement of a judgment awarding reasonable attorney fees and costs under subdivision c of section is automatically stayed by the slapp plaintiff perfecting of an appeal from that judgment.we conclude that enforcement of such judgment is not stayed absent the filing of an appropriate appeal bond or other undertaking.
canons of statutory interpretation 
the question presented is governed by statutes.the applicable canons of statutory construction that guide our decision are.as already discussed,the fundamental rule of statutory construction is that the court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.select base materials,supra,cal d at.in determining that intent,we first examine the words of the statute itself.california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d.under the plain meaning rule,courts seek to give the words employed by the legislature their usual and ordinary meaning.lungren deukmejian cal d.if the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for construction.ibid.however,the plain meaning rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose.ibid.if the terms of the statute provide no definitive answer,then courts may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.people coronado cal th,d.we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.ibid.the legislative purpose will not be sacrificed to a literal construction of any part of the statute.select base materials,supra,cal d at.
as a general rule the automatic stay rule,the perfecting of an appeal automatically stays proceedings in the trial court both upon the judgment or order appealed from,and upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby,including enforcement of the judgment or order.see generally eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group to.the automatic stay rule is codified in section,subdivision a,which provides in part 
except as provided in sections to,inclusive,and in section,the perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from or upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby,including enforcement of the judgment or order italics added.
the purpose of the automatic stay rule is to protect the appellate court jurisdiction by preserving the status quo until the appeal is decided.the rule prevents the trial court from rendering an appeal futile by altering the appealed judgment or order by conducting other proceedings that may affect it.citation.elsea saberi th,d.
the automatic stay rule is subject to certain exceptions.perhaps the most common of the specified exceptions to the statutory automatic stay is set forth in section subdivision a hereafter also referred to as a or the money judgment exception,which provides 
a unless an undertaking is given,the perfecting of an appeal shall not stay enforcement of the judgment or order in the trial court if the judgment or order is for any of the following money or the payment of money,whether consisting of a special fund or not,and whether payable by the appellant or another party to the action.italics added.
if the money judgment exception applies,a bond or undertaking is required to obtain a stay of enforcement of a judgment or order pending disposition of the appeal.a see eisenberg,supra,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs,to.
the question in this case is whether the portion of the judgment awarding reasonable attorney fees and costs to zimmerman under section,subdivision c,is a judgment for money or the payment of money within the meaning of the money judgment exception codified in section a such that a bond or undertaking was required to stay enforcement of the judgment pending the disposition of dowling appeal.to answer this question we must not only interpret section a in light of the legislative intent underlying the statute with a view to promoting the general purpose of that statute discussed,post,but also harmonize these sections with the provisions of section,subdivisions a a,b,c and c,and section,subdivision d hereafter also referred to as section d.
when the legislature amended section in,it amended subdivision d of that section see stats,ch,which now provides 
d costs awarded by the trial court under chapter commencing with section of title shall be included in the amount of the judgment or order for the purpose of applying paragraph of subdivision a and subdivision b.however,no undertaking shall be required pursuant to this section solely for costs awarded under chapter commencing with section of title.italics added.
the amendment added the second sentence of subdivision d,specifying that no undertaking is required for a judgment consisting of only costs awarded under section et gallardo specialty restaurants,supra,th at,fn,d.thus,no bond or undertaking is required to stay enforcement of a judgment or order that consists only of costs awarded under section et enforcement of such a costs only judgment is automatically stayed pending disposition of a perfected appeal.see eisenberg,supra,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs,citing vadas sosnowski d.which predated amended d.expressing this legal principle in terms of incidental or routine costs,one leading commentator states that a judgment for incidental routine costs of suit alone as distinguished from discretionary costs awards or money judgments consisting of damages and costs is automatically stayed by appeal.eisenberg,supra,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs,citing d vadas sosnowski,supra,d at.bank of san pedro superior court cal th,d,bank of san pedro holding that a judgment awarding expert witness fees under section,subdivision c,even in the absence of any other monetary relief,is a judgment that directs the payment of money within the scope of former section,subdivision a and that such judgment is therefore not automatically stayed by the perfecting of an appeal.
although section d does not expressly refer to attorney fees awards,one commentator has suggested that a judgment solely for attorney fees,when awarded pursuant to contract,statute or law,should likewise be stayed automatically on appeal because such fee awards are expressly denominated by section et as recoverable costs of suit.eisenberg,supra,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs,citing,subds.a a,b,c c,original italics omitted,new italics added.

a the following items are allowable as costs under section attorney fees,when authorized by any of the following a contract.b statute.c law.c any award of costs shall be subject to the following when any statute of this state refers to the award of costs and attorney fees,attorney fees are an item and component of the costs to be awarded and are allowable as costs pursuant to subparagraph b of paragraph of subdivision a.any claim not based upon the court established schedule of attorney fees for actions on a contract shall bear the burden of proof.attorney fees allowable as costs pursuant to subparagraph b of paragraph of subdivision a may be fixed as follows a upon a noticed motion,b at the time a statement of decision is rendered,c upon application supported by affidavit made concurrently with a claim for other costs,or d upon entry of default judgment.attorney fees allowable as costs pursuant to subparagraph a or c of paragraph of subdivision a shall be fixed either upon a noticed motion or upon entry of a default judgment,unless otherwise provided by stipulation of the parties.attorney fees awarded pursuant to section of the civil code are allowable costs under section as authorized by subparagraph a of paragraph of subdivision a.italics added.
the amendment,in subd.a of relating to attorney fees,substituted any of the following for either of the following and added c law and in subd.c,relating to references in statutes to awards of costs and attorney fees,substituted subparagraph a or c of paragraph for subparagraph a of paragraph.see historical and statutory notes,west.supp.foll,italics added.
in light of the foregoing labyrinth of statutory authority,and applying the canons of statutory interpretation already discussed,we interpret section d as requiring an appeal bond or undertaking to stay enforcement of a judgment for reasonable attorney fees and costs awarded to a prevailing slapp defendant under subdivision c of section.in our view,such a judgment entered after the granting of a special motion to strike under the statute should be treated as a judgment for money or the payment of money within the meaning of the money judgment exception codified in section a such that a bond or undertaking is required to stay enforcement of the judgment pending the disposition of a slapp plaintiff appeal.turning to the express language of section,the statute that governs stays of enforcement of judgments and orders pending appeal,we note that a judgment for reasonable attorney fees and costs under the statute is unquestionably a judgment for payment of money,and is thus consistent with the language of section a,which as already discussed codifies the money judgment exception to the automatic stay rule and provides that a judgment for money or payment of money is not automatically stayed on appeal unless an undertaking is given.the language of amended section d expressly specifies that no undertaking is required for a judgment consisting of only costs awarded under section et.a judgment for reasonable attorney fees and costs under section,subdivision c such as the one at issue in the instant writ proceeding,however,is not a judgment solely for costs awarded under chapter commencing with section of title within the meaning of the second sentence of subdivision d of section.an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs under the statute can not be construed as an award of routine or incidental costs subject to the automatic stay rule under section d.section,subdivision c authorizes only the slapp defendant to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs after prevailing on a special motion to strike a complaint under the statute.a plaintiff who prevails by defeating the motion to strike is not entitled to recover fees and costs under the statute simply by prevailing on the motion.under section,subdivision c the plaintiff may recover fees and costs only by showing that the defendant special motion to strike was frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay within the meaning of section thus,a statutory award of attorney fees and costs under subdivision c of section is not routine because it is not reciprocal.as already discussed,only a judgment for routine costs,costs awarded under section et is stayed automatically by the perfecting of an appeal.d.
subdivisions a b and c of section together provide that attorney fees,when authorized under any california statute that refers to the award of costs and attorney fees are recoverable under section as an item and component of the costs here,zimmerman was awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs under subdivision c of section,the first sentence of which refers to attorney fees and costs.the foregoing subdivisions of section,however,can not be construed as controlling authority with respect to the issue presented here given the clear and compelling legislative intent underlying the statute and its purpose.as already explained,the legislature expressly set forth the intent and purpose underlying the statute in section,subdivision a which expressly states the legislative intent to broadly protect the right of petition.briggs,supra,cal th at,d.the courts have recognized that the common features of slapp suits are their lack of merit and chilling of defendants valid exercise of free speech and the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances.wilcox,supra,th at,d.by enacting the statute,the legislature intended to provide slapp defendants an efficient tool to quickly and inexpensively unmask and defeat slapp suits.ibid.at the trial court level,that tool is the special motion to strike a slapp complaint under the provisions of section,subdivision b.a determined slapp plaintiff intent on pursuing the litigation,however,may as happened here seek appellate review.we are persuaded the legislature intended to deter slapp litigation not only at the trial court level,but also in the appellate courts in order to protect the proper exercise of first amendment rights.requiring a slapp plaintiff who appeals from an adverse judgment under the statute to give an undertaking to stay enforcement of the portion of the judgment awarding reasonable attorneys fees and costs to the prevailing defendant under section,subdivision c,will promote meritorious appeals,and will deter continued slapp litigation at the appellate level.
in sum,construing section a together with the relevant provisions of sections subd.d and subds.a a,c c,and considering the legislative intent underlying the statute with a view to promoting the general purpose of that statute,we hold that a slapp plaintiff perfecting of an appeal from a judgment awarding attorney fees and costs to a prevailing slapp defendant under subdivision c of section does not automatically stay enforcement of the judgment.to stay enforcement of such a judgment,the slapp plaintiff must give an appropriate appeal bond or undertaking under the money judgment exception to the automatic stay rule.accordingly,dowling petition is denied.
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed and dowling petition for writ of supersedeas is denied.zimmerman shall recover her attorney fees and costs on appeal as the prevailing defendant under subdivision c of section,in addition to her costs in the related writ proceeding.the cause is remanded for a determination by the court of the amount of reasonable attorney fees and costs zimmerman shall recover from dowling under the provisions of section,subdivision c.
