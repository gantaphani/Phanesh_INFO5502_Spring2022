factual and procedural summary 
nadine sutherland has been employed by the mta as a bus mechanic since.in december of,sutherland was working at her job and holding a tool when she injured a finger on her left hand,her dominant hand.she recovered from the injury to her finger,but then developed tendonitis.thereafter,sutherland radial collateral ligament was partially torn,and she was treated with a series of cortisone injections.in february of,she had some loss of strength in her grip,but was deemed fully capable of performing her duties as a mechanic.she was not considered a qualified injured worker.
further problems ensued with sutherland left arm.she was diagnosed as having radial tunnel syndrome.in january of,sutherland had surgery.the surgery,which resulted in a scar on her on her forearm,was successful.approximately three months later,she returned to her job without any restrictions.but her symptoms returned,and she stopped working for days at a time in september of and february of.sutherland was treated with a corticosteroid injection into the radial tunnel and with an medication.during a disability leave that began on may,sutherland condition improved.
in the interim,sutherland saw several doctors regarding her workers compensation claim.in august of,mark mandel,the agreed medical examiner for sutherland workers compensation case,noted that sutherland job as a mechanic required her to lift and move items weighing up to pounds,although she occasionally lifted heavier items.mandel found that sutherland can do occasional lifting up to lbs.but would need assistance in lifting items heavier than that.
however,mandel concluded that in light of the industrial injury sutherland had suffered,her job would have to be modified for her to continue working as a mechanic.mandel determined that i f modification is not possible,then she is indeed to be considered a qualified injured worker.the mta determined that it could not provide the job modifications proposed by mandel and deemed her a qualified injured worker.
in september of,brent miller,sutherland primary treating physician,issued a progress report.he recommended amending sutherland work status to require no repetitive strenuous gripping or grasping with the left hand and a weight lifting restriction of pounds.miller found that this would preclude sutherland from returning to her usual and customary job as a heavy duty bus mechanic,and he recommended vocational rehabilitation.
in december of,sutherland through her union filed a grievance.the grievance alleged that she wanted to go back to work but that the mta acted in bad faith.sutherland referred to mandel observation that mechanics are required to lift items up to pounds,and that sutherland could lift items up to pounds.she thus requested back pay from august,the date of mandel report,and requested to be allowed to return to work 
several days later,the mta denied sutherland grievance.the mta denial of the grievance stated we are not able to modify your job to the degree indicated on the agreed medical examiner report.therefore based on the agreed medical examiner report you have been deemed a qualified injured worker.you are eligible to receive vocational rehab.the mta denial was based on its determination that sutherland complaint was not a grievance because there has been no contract violation and that the matter is a workers comp issue.
approximately six months later,on june,after a hearing on sutherland grievance,the mta again denied the grievance.the mta defined the issue as whether sutherland had been denied the opportunity to work.the mta noted that the union position was that since mandel,the agreed medical examiner,had found months earlier that sutherland would only need assistance in lifting objects weighing more than pounds,she would be able to return to work as a mechanic if the mta would accommodate this restriction.the mta observed that mandel had also suggested additional work restrictions for sutherland and a modification of her job with a lateral shift within the transit authority structure to a less job.however,the mta denied the grievance at the second step on the basis that the final decision on her ability to return to her occupation will be adjudicated by the worker compensation appeals board.
on june,the union requested that the mta arbitrate the grievance the mta refused to arbitrate sutherland request for back pay and to return to work.
on june,sutherland applied for a disability retirement from the mta.at the request of the mta in august of,yogaratnam evaluated sutherland,who was still on a total disability medical leave.sutherland did not at that time consider herself to have any current medical problem and stated that she would like to go back to work.yogaratnam examination revealed no evidence of any medical deficiency,and he concluded that sutherland may return to her regular work duties without restriction.the mta then denied sutherland request for a disability retirement.
in september of,the mta sent the workers compensation appeals board wcab a copy of yogaratnam report,which found sutherland capable of returning to her job without any restrictions.the wcab then ordered mandel to sutherland.
on november,mandel sutherland and issued to the wcab an agreed medical examiner final rating report.mandel suggested only as a prophylactic restriction a modified position as a mechanic,permitting her to return to work as long as she obtained some assistance in lifting items weighing more than,and finding that she did not need to be retrained.according to mandel,sutherland does have sufficient function that she can return to work as a mechanic a her classification at the mta.
mandel also noted in his november report that approximately three months earlier yogaratnam had similarly determined that sutherland could return to her regular job duties without restrictions.mandel concluded as follows i am not going to give her an actual restriction,but i am going to phrase it as a prophylactic restriction that is not of sufficient magnitude that it is going to impact upon her ability to safely perform her job the patient,therefore,should be returned to her job duties as a mechanic a,and this will obviate the need for retraining.
according to the mta risk management claims manager,the mta then decided to take mandel deposition to clarify statements in his report and to explain certain unspecified contradictions between his august report and his november report.apparently,some delay ensued because of mandel schedule,and an mta attorney finally took his deposition on april.
meanwhile,on april,the union filed a petition to compel arbitration.at a hearing on the matter,the trial court remarked that nothing in the collective bargaining agreements requires the mta to arbitrate the issue of an employee ability to return to work if the employee has a pending workers comp claim and an agreed medical examiner has stated that the employee needs modification,vocational rehabilitation or restriction.such an agreement would not make any sense.the trial court also opined that since the mta was abiding by the statements of the medical examiners,the union had not demonstrated a viable discrimination claim under labor code section a claim,however,later settled before the wcab and resolved in sutherland favor.
on august,the trial court denied the union petition to compel arbitration and for an award of attorney fees,and then denied the union alternative request to amend the complaint to state a claim for breach of contract.after the mta prevailed,it moved for attorney fees and costs as provided in the agreement,but thereafter withdrew its request.
on may,the mta permitted sutherland to return to work as a mechanic.at the time sutherland returned to work from her disability leave,her case before the wcab was still pending.
after the appeal in the present case was filed,all sutherland workers compensation claims were resolved.on december,sutherland was awarded a settlement as to the underlying disability claim and for a labor code section discrimination claim as to back pay or lost wages.the settlement specified that the amount awarded for back pay or lost wages was to be credited to the mta in the event of any recovery in the present case.
discussion 
workers compensation not an exclusive remedy here 
according to the mta,sutherland grievance seeking her return to work related directly to her workers compensation case,and her grievance was merely an attempt to circumvent the findings of the agreed medical examiner in the workers compensation proceeding.however,contrary to the mta contention,sutherland pending workers compensation claim does not defeat her effort to arbitrate the present claim.
the workers compensation act,et generally provides an exclusive remedy for injuries incurred in the course of a person employment,subd.a.where the exclusive remedy rule applies see shoemaker myers cal d,it precludes an action at law.doney tambouratgis cal d.the statutory language establishing workers compensation as an exclusive remedy against an employer provides that an employee industrial injury precludes an employee from bringing an action at law for damages against the employer,subd.a.the present case,however,involves a proceeding to compel arbitration that is in essence a suit in equity to compel specific performance of a contract.freeman state farm mut.auto.ins.cal d.the union equitable petition to compel arbitration thus does not fall within the statutory language,which prohibits only actions at law for damages.
the situation is akin to that in hicks allegheny east conference ass,where a teacher who received workers compensation benefits for an injury resulting from an altercation with a student was not precluded from filing a suit challenging the school sanction of probation placed upon her for the incident.the teacher sought on appeal only injunctive relief to enforce the grievance procedures contained in her employment contract.her suit was a suit in equity.as in the present case,the exclusivity provision in the workers compensation statute applied only to suits at law for damages.id.at.
additionally,sutherland workers compensation claim entailed a labor code section discrimination claim,which ultimately was settled in her favor,and such a claim is not subject to the exclusive remedy rule.in city of moorpark superior court cal th,d,our supreme court held that a labor code section claim did not provide the exclusive remedy for employment discrimination based on disability arising from an industrial injury.the court explained that labor code sections and,which set forth the exclusivity of the workers compensation remedy as against an employer,apply only to liability for compensation provided in division of the labor code,while section is in division of the code.city of moorpark superior court,supra,at,d.
thus,the plain language of the exclusive remedy provisions of the workers compensation law apparently limits those provisions to division remedies.remedies that the legislature placed in other divisions of the labor code are simply not subject to the workers compensation exclusive remedy provisions.city of moorpark superior court,supra,cal th at,d,see also currie workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.therefore,independent of any other reasons,because sutherland had a labor code section workers compensation discrimination claim,she is not subject to the exclusive remedy rule.
moreover,the present arbitration claim is the flip side of a workers compensation claim and distinguishable from it.sutherland arbitration claim does not seek compensation or concern any related right or liability,for an industrial personal injury.shoemaker myers,supra,cal d at.rather,she seeks her salary for when she was allegedly no longer suffering the disabling effects of an industrial injury and was able to work,but was denied the right to work guaranteed in the collective bargaining agreement.sutherland thus did not attempt to arbitrate injury compensation issues that were pending before the wcab,and the union acknowledges that there can not be a double recovery of back pay.
finally,in addition to the arbitration claim for back pay for the period when she was able but not permitted to work,sutherland also demanded to be returned to work indeed,the grievance as defined by the mta in its letter dated june,was whether the grievant has been denied the opportunity to return to work.that issue,as framed by the mta,may reasonably be construed by an arbitrator to include not just a demand for back pay for when sutherland should have been working,but also a demand that she actually be returned to work.however,a return to work is not one of the workers compensation benefits available by statute,and covered by division of the labor code to which the exclusive remedy rule would apply.see charles vacanti,state comp.ins.fund cal th,d.sutherland return to work was thus a remedy unavailable in this workers compensation context,further undermining the notion of the exclusivity of workers compensation as a remedy here.
accordingly,workers compensation is not an exclusive remedy in the present situation and does not bar arbitration of sutherland claim.
ii.general principles of arbitration 
a petition to compel arbitration is resolved in a summary proceeding with the trial court sitting as trier of fact and weighing declarations,documentary evidence and any oral testimony.engalla permanente medical group,cal th,d.pursuant to code of civil procedure section,unless the petitioner has waived arbitration,grounds exist for revocation of the agreement,or a party to the arbitration agreement is also a party to a pending matter with a third party and there is a possibility of conflicting rulings on a common issue,the trial court shall order the parties to arbitrate the controversy if it determines that an agreement to arbitrate the controversy exists.
unless the parties have clearly and unmistakably provided otherwise,the preliminary question of whether parties to a collective bargaining agreement have agreed to arbitrate a particular dispute is decided by the court,not the arbitrator.united public employees city and county of san francisco th,d.thus,the parties generally are not required to arbitrate the arbitrability question.litton financial printing div.nlrb,d,quoting at t technologies communications workers,d.
in determining whether a matter is subject to arbitration,courts apply the presumption in favor of arbitration engalla permanente medical group,supra,cal th at,d,and generally invoke ordinary rules of contract interpretation.maggio windward capital management th,d.doubts as to whether an arbitration clause applies to a particular dispute are to be resolved in favor of sending the parties to arbitration.the court should order them to arbitrate unless it is clear that the arbitration clause can not be interpreted to cover the dispute.engineers architects community development th,d.however,there is no public policy favoring arbitration of disputes which the parties have not agreed to arbitrate.united public employees city and county of san francisco,supra,th at,d.
the right to arbitration ultimately depends upon the terms of the collective bargaining agreement,and a petition to compel arbitration is essentially a suit in equity seeking specific performance of that agreement.united public employees city and county
