early in the morning of march,mohammad usman chaudhry usman was shot and killed by los angeles police officer joseph cruz.los angeles county department of the coroner the coroner took custody of usman body,but it did not notify his family of his death for days.this delay prevented usman family from burying him in accordance with their religion.
these events gave rise to a suit involving many plaintiffs,many claims,and many defendants.in this opinion,we address some of the issues,affirming in part and reversing in part.in a memorandum disposition filed concurrently with this opinion,we affirm on the remainder of the issues.
background 
usman was a year old muslim man.according to his family,he was autistic and often wandered from home.on march,officer cruz and his partner,officer david romo,saw usman sleeping in front of an apartment building in los angeles.suspecting that usman might be a drug user,they stopped their police cruiser and approached him.cruz asked usman to show his identification.usman complied.cruz gave the identification to romo,who returned to the cruiser to check for outstanding warrants.cruz testified at trial that,while romo was at the cruiser,usman lunged at cruz with a knife.cruz drew his gun and fired four shots,three of which struck usman in the chest and abdomen.when romo returned from the cruiser,cruz had a cut on his hand.usman died at the scene.
the coroner received usman remains and began to search for his next of kin.usman identification listed his address as the celebration theatre in west hollywood,california.on march,the day of the shooting,someone at the coroner ran a search in the records of the department of motor vehicles dmv.the dmv printout contained three addresses the address of the celebration theatre,an address in los angeles,and an address in bellflower,california.brian elias,an investigator for the coroner,visited the celebration theatre,but it was closed.joyce kato,another investigator,then took over the search.on march,kato ran a comprehensive search on accurint,a lexisnexis service for searching public records.that search disclosed several addresses connected with usman name.she made a note in the coroner file for usman that the only address consistently listed was that of the celebration theatre.
the bellflower address belonged to usman parents,rukhsana and mohammad afzal chaudhry the chaudhrys.kato overlooked that address and focused her search on the celebration theatre.she called and sent an email to the theatre.on april,she sent a letter to the theatre and began pursuing what turned out to be a false lead.on april,she requested information from the los angeles police department lapd.she received a response on april that indicated that usman had listed the celebration theatre as his address.she received a response to her april letter on april,but the response provided no useful information.on april,she her paperwork and noticed the bellflower address in the dmv printout.that same day,she ran that address in accurint,identified the chaudhrys,contacted usman mother by telephone,and notified her of his death.
in the days between usman death and the notification of his family,his body decayed.his mother testified that when she saw usman body,his skin was all over.i could touch him or kiss him his ears was all over,skin was all over,just like a bird face h is skin was falling off just like a bird face like a small shrink face there was no eye in the socket.she testified further,they cut his body without our permission.that is the worst thing you do with our person.we never allow.if we are there,we never allow to cut his body.the delay in notification and the decay of usman body prevented the chaudhrys from burying their son in accordance with the religious customs of islam.
usman estate estate,usman siblings usma and mohammad umar chaudhry usma and umar,and the chaudhrys sued various city and county defendants,seeking damages and declaratory and injunctive relief.three organizational plaintiffs interfaith communities united for justice and peace icujp,the islamic shura council of southern california shura,and the los angeles community action network lacan also sought declaratory and injunctive relief.the city defendants were the city of los angeles and the lapd collectively city,chief of police william bratton,and officers cruz and romo.the county defendants were the county of los angeles county,the coroner,and coroner officials anthony hernandez and lakshmanan sathyavagiswaran.
plaintiffs brought claims against the city defendants under the americans with disabilities act ada and the rehabilitation act of,for unreasonable seizure and excessive force under the fourth amendment and state law,for assault,battery,false imprisonment,and wrongful death.plaintiffs brought claims against all the defendants under,for violations of substantive due process and equal protection under the fourteenth amendment and of free exercise under the first amendment,for implementing unconstitutional policies or customs,in violation of monell department of social services,for failure to train and for supervisory liability,in violation of city of canton harris,and,for conspiracy to violate the first,fourth,and fourteenth amendments california law,for negligence,intentional infliction of emotional distress iied,and conversion and trespass to chattels and california law,for violations of civil rights under the california constitution and california civil code,b,and.
the district court rejected most claims before trial.the court granted the city defendants motion to dismiss under rule b as to plaintiffs claims for violations of equal protection,free exercise,and substantive due process plaintiffs and claims for conspiracy and plaintiffs claims for iied,negligence,discrimination,and violation of california civil code.the court dismissed lacan only claim,which alleged unconstitutional discrimination against homeless and disabled people,because lacan did not plead facts plausibly suggesting intentional discrimination.the court later granted summary judgment to officer romo on all claims to the county defendants on all claims to the city defendants on all claims except the estate and the chaudhrys claims for wrongful death and assault and battery and to officer cruz on plaintiffs claim for conversion.the court held that shura and icujp lacked organizational standing under hunt washington state apple advertising commission,because there was no showing that usman was a member of either organization.the court held further that usman siblings,usma and umar,lacked standing.it wrote,plaintiffs have failed to present any evidence indicating that usma and umar have a legally protected interest that falls into the category of an injury in fact.
the only remaining claims were the estate excessive force claim against cruz,the estate assault and battery claim against the city,and the chaudhrys wrongful death claim against cruz and the city.those claims went to trial.at trial,the estate and the chaudhrys presented evidence contradicting cruz version of events.they presented evidence that romo did not hear cruz yell knife that usman dna was not on the knife with which he allegedly attacked cruz that the knife was a boot knife,a kind of knife typically carried by police officers and that the pattern and trajectory of cruz gunshots showed he shot usman while usman was collapsing to the ground,rather than while he was advancing toward cruz.the jury found for the estate and the chaudhrys.it found that cruz used excessive force,that the excessive force caused usman death,and that cruz acted reckless ly,oppressive ly,or malicious ly.the jury awarded to the chaudhrys for their wrongful death claim under state law,and,based on usman pain and suffering,to the estate for its excessive force claim under.
the city and cruz filed renewed motions for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial.the district court denied the motion for a new trial and denied the motion for judgment as a matter of law as to the award.the district court granted the motion for judgment as a matter of law as to the award.it held that california law prohibits recovery for pain and suffering in survival actions,and that this prohibition is incorporated into.see.
the estate and the chaudhrys sought attorneys fees under b and california civil code h,requesting a total of.they also requested a modifier under california law.see ketchum moses,cal.the district court awarded fees of.
plaintiffs timely appealed most of the district court orders granting the defendants motions to dismiss and for summary judgment,its order vacating the estate damages verdict,and its reduced attorneys fees award.the city the attorneys fees award.cruz and the city initially appealed the chaudhrys verdict but later conceded that this part of the verdict should stand.
ii.discussion 
plaintiffs waived claims against some defendants by not addressing them in their opening brief.see kim kang,cir.for the purposes of this appeal,the remaining defendants are the city and cruz collectively the city defendants,and the county and the coroner collectively the county defendants.the following claims have been preserved for appeal and are addressed in this opinion the estate claim for damages for pain and suffering under the estate claim under california civil code the chaudhrys claim that cruz violated their substantive due process rights by killing usman the chaudhrys negligence claim against the county defendants usma and umar claim for substantive due process violations and their claims for iied and negligence and plaintiffs request for attorneys fees.in a memorandum disposition filed concurrently with this opinion,we address the remaining claims that have been preserved for appeal.
a.the estate pre death pain and suffering damages under 
under california survival statute,usman claim survived his death.see smith city of fontana,cir,overruled on other grounds by hodgers durgin de la vina,cir en banc.in survival actions,however,california does not allow a decedent estate to recover for the decedent pain and suffering.because federal law is silent on the measure of damages in actions,california disallowance of pain and suffering damages governs unless it is inconsistent with the policies of.see a robertson wegmann.the district court found that is not inconsistent with and struck the jury verdict in favor of the estate.we review that decision de novo,see eeoc wal mart stores,cir,and reverse.
one of congress primary goals in enacting was to provide a remedy for killings unconstitutionally caused or acquiesced in by state governments.see monroe pape,overruled in part on other grounds by monell,at berry city of muskogee,cir.the policies underlying include compensation of persons injured by deprivation of federal rights and prevention of abuses of power by those acting under color of state law.robertson,at.whether a limitation on damages applies in actions depends on whether the limit is inconsistent with goals of compensation and deterrence.id.at see bell city of milwaukee,cir,overruled in part on other grounds by russ watts,cir.neither the supreme court nor this court has addressed whether a state law denying pain and suffering damages is inconsistent with in cases where an alleged violation of federal law caused the victim death.the district courts in our circuit are divided.compare,venerable city of sacramento,d,consistent,with guyton phillips,inconsistent.
we begin our analysis with robertson,in which the supreme court considered a louisiana law that abated tort claims when a plaintiff died and was not survived by a spouse,child,parent,or sibling.at.the plaintiff in robertson filed a suit for malicious prosecution but died before trial.he was not survived by any close relatives.the tortious acts alleged in the suit had not caused robertson death.id.at.the fifth circuit refused to abate his claim,holding that the louisiana law was inconsistent with the policies of.id.at.the supreme court reversed.it held that louisiana abatement law was not inconsistent with for two reasons.first,the law did not undermine the compensatory goals of,which the court held did not require compensation of one who is merely suing as the executor of the deceased estate.at.second,the law did not undermine deterrence because,at least in situations in which there is no claim that the illegality caused the plaintiff death,an official would have no way of knowing in advance whether or not any particular victim would die without close relatives before conclusion of the suit.id.the court also found it important that the louisiana law would apply in only a small number of cases.id.at.
the court statement in robertson that does not require compensation to the decedent estate was made in a case where the alleged violation of federal law did not cause the decedent death.it is unclear whether the court intended its statement to apply when the violation did cause the death.we need not decide that question here.bell,at declining to address whether requires compensation for loss of life where the victim by virtue of death can not be made whole.what is clear is that,with respect to deterrence,the distinction between those violations of federal law that cause death and those that do not is crucial.the court in robertson repeatedly distinguished louisiana abatement law from cases in which deprivation of federal rights caused death.robertson,at see also id.at.
the practical effect of is to reduce,and often to eliminate,compensatory damage awards for the survivors of people killed by violations of federal law.section limits damages in survival actions to the victim economic losses.see people runyan,cal.in cases where the victim dies quickly,there often will be no damage remedy at all under.even in cases of slow death where economic damages might be available,limitation will often be tantamount to a prohibition,for the victims of excessive police force are often or unemployed.the same is likely to be true for prisoners whose death is caused by the deliberate indifference of jail or prison officials in violation of the eighth amendment.see,bureau of justice statistics,dep t of justice,profile of jail inmates,at,available at reporting that,as of,percent of prison inmates had monthly incomes of less than.therefore,a prohibition against pain and suffering awards for a decedent estate has the perverse effect of making it more economically advantageous for a defendant to kill rather than injure his victim.
three of our sister circuits have addressed state laws comparable to.all three held that those state laws were inconsistent with when the violation of federal law caused the victim death.in berry city of muskogee,the decedent,an inmate at muskogee city federal jail,was killed by fellow prisoners.at.his widow brought a suit against the city for violation of the eighth amendment,alleging that jail officials deliberate indifference to the decedent safety had led to his death.id.the tenth circuit rejected an oklahoma law limiting damages in survival actions to property loss and loss of decedent earnings between the time of injury and death.id.at.the court wrote,the state limitation laws are not suitable to carry out the full effects intended for cases ending in death of the victim.id.at.in bell city of milwaukee,a milwaukee police officer shot and killed the decedent,planted a knife on his body,and then lied about the circumstances of the killing.at.the decedent siblings and estate brought suit under.id.at.the seventh circuit rejected wisconsin laws precluding recovery of damages for loss of life and punitive damages in survival actions.id.at.the court wrote,i f section did not allow recovery for loss of life notwithstanding inhospitable state law,deterrence would be further subverted since it would be more advantageous to the unlawful actor to kill rather than injure.id.at.further,t o disallow punitive damages,the court said,would seriously hamper the deterrence effect of section.id.at.finally,in mcfadden sanchez,cir,the decedent was killed by police officers during the course of an arrest,and a jury awarded punitive damages.id.at.the second circuit rejected a new york law barring punitive damages in survival actions.the court wrote,w e have no doubt that limitations in a state survival statute have no application to a section suit brought to redress a denial of rights that caused the decedent death.id.at.
we agree with the reasoning in these cases.consistent with berry,bell,and mcfadden,we hold that california prohibition against pain and suffering damages limits recovery too severely to be consistent with deterrence policy.section therefore does not apply to claims where the decedent death was caused by the violation of federal law.
the city defendants argue that even if pain and suffering damages are available under,the jury award of was excessive in light of the evidence adduced at trial.because the district court held that pain and suffering damages were categorically unavailable,it did not reach the argument that the award was excessive.the district court is in the best position to assess the reasonableness of the award.we therefore remand to the district court to consider in the first instance a motion for remittitur.
b.the estate california civil code claim 
the district court dismissed under rule b the estate claim against the city defendants under california civil code,which provides a cause of action for violations of a plaintiff state or federal civil rights committed by threats,intimidation,or coercion.cal.the district court held that requires evidence of discriminatory intent.after trial,the estate moved to amend the judgment to reinstate its claim in light of the jury verdict on its excessive force claim.the district court denied the motion.we review de novo.see lacey maricopa,cir en banc.
the district court erred in dismissing the estate claim and in denying its motion to amend the judgment.the california supreme court has held that does not require proof of discriminatory intent.venegas cnty.of,cal.the estate won its excessive force claim under at trial.the city defendants concede in their brief to us that a successful claim for excessive force under the fourth amendment provides the basis for a successful claim under.see cameron craig,cir t he elements of the excessive force claim under are the same as under.bender cnty.of,d.
the city defendants nonetheless argue that the district court acted properly.they contend that the estate claim is entirely duplicative of its claim.we disagree.if the estate had prevailed on its claim,it could have received a multiplier of its attorneys fees to account for the risk of contingent representation.see infra at ketchum,at.such a multiplier is not available under.see city of burlington dague.we therefore reverse the district court dismissal of the estate claim and remand with instructions to amend the judgment to reflect the estate success on that claim.
c.the chaudhrys substantive due process claim against cruz 
the chaudhrys brought a claim against cruz for violating their fourteenth amendment right to substantive due process.they alleged that cruz killing of usman infringed their liberty interest in the companionship of their child.the district court dismissed that claim under rule b,holding that the chaudhrys had no legal interest in usman companionship once he reached the age of majority.reviewing de novo,see lacey,at,we reverse.our decisions recognize that parents have a liberty interest in the companionship of their adult children and have a cause of action under the fourteenth amendment when the police kill an adult child without legal justification.see porter osborn,cir curnow ex rel.curnow ridgecrest police,cir.
on appeal,cruz does not dispute that the chaudhrys properly stated a substantive due process claim.however,he argues that we should affirm the district court because,he contends,the chaudhrys substantive due process claim is entirely duplicative of the wrongful death claim on which they prevailed at trial.we disagree.prevailing on their substantive due process claim under would entitle the chaudhrys to attorneys fees,see b,while prevailing on their wrongful death claim does not.
to succeed on their substantive due process claim against cruz,the chaudhrys must prove he shot usman with the purpose to cause harm unrelated to the legitimate object of arrest.porter,at internal quotation marks omitted.after trial,the jury found that cruz conduct was reckless,oppressive,or malicious.the verdict thus establishes that cruz unreasonably killed usman,but not that he acted with the purpose of harming him.on remand,the district court should reinstate the chaudhrys substantive due process claim against cruz and conduct appropriate proceedings for its resolution.
d.the chaudhrys negligence claim against the county defendants 
the chaudhrys sued the county defendants for negligence based on the coroner failure to provide timely notice of usman death.the district court granted summary judgment to the county defendants,finding as a matter of law that the coroner was not negligent.we review de novo a grant of summary judgment.heinemann satterberg,cir.we reverse.
california government code specifies when a public entity is subject to tort liability.there is a rebuttable presumption of negligence under if the public entity violates a statute and the statute which was violated imposes a mandatory duty,the statute was intended to protect against the type of harm suffered,and breach of the statute mandatory duty was a proximate cause of the injury suffered.braman state,d.the chaudhrys contend that the coroner had a mandatory duty under california government code a to make a reasonable attempt to locate the family of a decedent.
in davila county of los angeles,d cal,the california court of appeal held that a q uite clearly imposes on coroners a mandatory duty to make a reasonable attempt to locate a decedent family,and that one of the purposes of a is to allow family members control over the disposition of the decedent remains.id.at.under davila,the coroner had a mandatory duty to make a reasonable attempt to locate and inform usman family of his death.
the county defendants argue that davila was impliedly overruled by the california supreme court recent decision in guzman county of monterey,cal.we disagree.the court in guzman did not mention davila,and davila is easily distinguishable.the statute at issue in guzman imposed on the operator of a water system a duty to notify consumers of any water contamination.guzman,p d at.the statute did not impose an express duty on any other party,but the plaintiffs in guzman argued it imposed an implied mandatory duty on the county in which a water system is located.id.at emphasis omitted.the court rejected that argument,holding that there was no such implied duty.by contrast,a,the statute at issue here and in davila,expressly imposes a duty on the coroner whenever the coroner takes custody of a dead body pursuant to law,he or she shall make a reasonable attempt to locate the family.davila,d at emphasis in original quoting cal.gov t code a.
the county defendants also argue that davila is inconsistent with the rule cited in guzman that there is no mandatory duty when the duty itself involves the exercise of discretion.guzman,at citation omitted.the county defendants point to two cases.in ellerbee county of los angeles,d,the statute required a sheriff to file a writ of execution in accordance with the judgment creditor written instructions.the creditor instructions,in turn,requested the sheriff to act promptly and as soon as possible.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.those instructions did not impose any mandatory duty on the sheriff,who retain ed complete discretion to determine how and when it is feasible to allocate departmental resources to effect service.id.in department of corps.superior court,d,the statute provided that the commissioner of corporations may act under certain circumstances,but it did not require any action at all.id.at emphasis omitted.as in ellerbee,the statute in department of corps.grant ed the commissioner pervasively discretionary authority.id.at.
the duty in a does not allow the sort of discretion allowed in ellerbee and department of corps.contrary to the county defendants argument that a provides no way to objectively measure the government action,reasonableness is a quintessentially objective measure.see,people w
