factual background 
campania voluntary dismissal and proposed amended answer 
campania retained the rooks law firm in october,after scott mann,a person with disabilities,sued mrsi and a,alleging that they were responsible for supplying him with a defective wheelchair that collapsed and caused him to fall to the ground and fracture his right arm.mrsi was insured by credit general insurance cgi,a large insurance corporation.cgi hired campania to retain counsel and manage the defense of any claims brought against cgi insureds.campania selected the rooks law firm to represent mrsi and agreed to pay rooks attorneys and paralegals hourly rates of and,respectively.the contract further required that rooks submit monthly invoices to campania and,in turn,be reimbursed every sixty days for all of its reasonable fees and expenses.
the lawsuit against mrsi progressed in illinois state court and eventually settled in september after mann backed down from his original demand for million and dismissed his claim in exchange for payable over seven years.rooks thereafter presented campania with a final invoice for in fees and expenses.campania refused to pay,asserting that rooks had breached the contract by failing to submit monthly invoices to campania between july and september.campania also maintained that rooks had performed legal services that were substandard because rooks was unable to convince the state trial judge to allow mrsi to bring a counterclaim for indemnity against the,thus barring the possibility of any recovery of settlement costs from the.
in response to campania actions,rooks sued campania in state court for breach of contract.campania,in turn,filed a separate legal malpractice claim against rooks.both of these cases were removed to federal court,consolidated,and assigned to district judge suzanne conlon,who entered a uniform scheduling order immediately after the assignment of the case in august.three months later,upon a joint motion of the parties,judge conlon issued an amended scheduling order establishing january,as the deadline for completing all discovery and filing any dispositive motions.the order explicitly stated that no further extensions would be granted and that trial would commence during the march civil term.
this case moved forward uneventfully until january,when campania filed two separate motions a mere six days before the date for the close of discovery.in its first motion,campania asked the district court to dismiss its counterclaim for monetary damages caused by rooks alleged legal malpractice.in the second motion,campania asked the district court for leave to amend its answer in order to deny retaining rooks and argue that hired rooks to represent mrsi in the underlying state court suit and raise an affirmative defense that,in any event,campania was not liable for damages because rooks breached the contract by committing legal malpractice.
campania amended answer reflected a complete reversal in trial strategy,for campania had previously admitted that it was the party that hired and agreed to reimburse rooks for the costs of defending mrsi.campania was prompted by the fact that cgi had allegedly filed for bankruptcy in the state of ohio on some date unspecified prior to january.the practical effect of cgi bankruptcy was that campania could no longer anticipate reimbursement from cgi if the district court entered a judgment in rooks favor.thus,by moving to amend its pleadings,campania was attempting to change its trial strategy and argue that it was acting merely as an agent for cgi and,thus,had no legal obligation to pay rooks fees and expenses.
naturally,rooks opposed the motion to amend,arguing that it would be prejudiced by campania newly minted theory of defense because the discovery deadline was set to expire in six days and,thus,rooks would have no opportunity to depose any witnesses who might have knowledge about cgi business relationship with campania.after considering the parties respective arguments,the trial court entered a minute order stating that campania fails to show good cause for its delay in asserting new theories of liability,while plaintiffs demonstrate prejudice.the court granted campania motion to dismiss its legal malpractice claim but denied campania motion to amend its answer on file.
campania proposed counterclaim and motion to amend,extend and continue 
in the meantime,mann commenced a new lawsuit against campania in the circuit court of cook county.this suit was filed january,and alleged that campania failed to make more than the first two installment payments required in exchange for mann dismissal of the case.
on january,a full nine days after the expiration of the discovery date,campania sought leave in federal court to file a counterclaim that repackaged and resurrected its earlier allegations against rooks.that is to say,campania alleged that it was liable for the damages caused by mrsi tortious conduct only because rooks had negligently named than a party to the settlement agreement.campania further requested the district court to reopen discovery and stay the federal case pending the outcome of the state court lawsuit,which ostensibly would determine the exact extent of campania liability to mann.the court denied the motion and barred campania from introducing any evidence at trial in support of its new theory of defense that not a party to rooks contract to perform legal services for mrsi.
the parties waived their right to a jury trial and went to trial before the bench march.after considering the testimony,documentary evidence,and applicable case law,the trial judge concluded that the party that hired the rooks law firm to defend mrsi.the court determined that rooks was acting within the scope of its authority when settling the case and that the settlement was fair and reasonable.the judge also ruled that rooks billed campania at a reasonable rate.in addition,the court credited the testimony of frank rowland,a partner at rooks,who stated that as part of his normal course of business he regularly mailed invoices to campania during the entirety of the representation between october and september.relying mainly on rowland testimony,the trial judge thus found that rooks had substantially complied with the contract monthly billing procedures and that any extent to which rooks failed to do so consisted of only an immaterial breach of contract that failed to absolve campania of its duty to pay rooks for services rendered.thus,the court ruled in favor of rooks on its breach of contract claim and awarded in compensatory damages plus in statutory prejudgment interest.
ii.discussion 
campania argues that the trial court committed reversible error in four separate respects refusing to allow campania to amend its answer refusing to allow campania to amend its complaint or introduce evidence that rooks committed malpractice by including campania as a party in the settlement of the underlying state court lawsuit finding as a fact that campania breached the contract with rooks and awarding rooks prejudgment interest.we have determined campania arguments to be without merit.we fail to perceive any abuse of discretion with the judge rulings,and we conclude that the judge factual findings and damages awards were supported by the evidence presented at trial.
motion practice 
motion to amend answer 
initially,we consider whether the district judge erred when denying campania motion to file an amended answer,which disavowed the earlier admission that campania hired rooks to represent mrsi and sought to assert that cgi hired rooks instead and raised what campania called the affirmative defense that it was not liable for breach of contract because rooks had allegedly committed legal malpractice.campania claims that it could not have amended its answer earlier in the litigation because it had no previous knowledge that cgi filed for bankruptcy and the malpractice claim did not accrue until january,when mann sued campania for breaching the settlement agreement.campania also asserts that rooks would have suffered no prejudice from the amendment because rooks knew all along that there was an agency relationship between cgi and campania and that campania was unsatisfied with the quality of rooks legal services.br.at.
we review a court denial of a motion to amend an answer for an abuse of discretion,justice town of blackwell,cir,and will reverse only if the district court has abused that discretion by not providing a justifying reason for its decision.perrian,cir.in this case,we hold that the denial of campania motion to amend was proper because campania failed to act with diligence and the proposed amendment would have injected a new issue into the case on the eve of trial.in addition,we conclude that campania affirmative defense was not a cognizable affirmative defense at all it was merely a rendition of the facts campania intended to argue at trial.
rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure provides that a party may amend its pleadings after a responsive pleading has been served only by leave of the court or by written consent of the adverse party.although the rule reflects a liberal attitude towards the amendment of pleadings,courts in their sound discretion may deny a proposed amendment if the moving party has unduly delayed in filing the motion,if the opposing party would suffer undue prejudice,or if the pleading is futile.foman davis,d bethany pharm.qvc,cir.
we accept the representation of campania attorney that cgi was placed into liquidation upon filing its bankruptcy petition some time after this case was removed to federal court.b.however,nothing in this record supports campania argument that it attempted to amend the complaint and assert an agency theory soon after learning of cgi bankruptcy.this record is barren of any evidence establishing the date when cgi became insolvent,or when the ohio state court began liquidation proceedings,or when campania corporate officers became aware of these facts,or even when counsel himself learned of this information from his client.even if campania had supplied the court with these facts,we would find it hard to believe that campania had no knowledge whether it was an agent or a contractual partner of cgi at the time this civil action was filed if campania had a viable agency defense to rooks contract claim,then it has failed to offer any explanation why the existence of that defense was dependent in any way on whether cgi was or was not in liquidation.thus,the district court could have reasonably determined that the proposed amendment was unduly delayed.doe howe military,cir in re stavriotis,cir justice,at murphy white hen pantry,cir.
furthermore,we believe that it was reasonable for the trial judge to conclude that rooks would have been unduly prejudiced had she granted campania untimely motion.a trial court may deny leave to amend when the amendment would cause the opposing party to bear additional discovery costs litigating a new issue and the moving party does not offer to reimburse the nonmoving party for its expenses.dussouy gulf coast inv,cir select creations paliafito am,wright,miller kane,federal practice procedure at.
campania agency defense would have complicated this straightforward breach of contract dispute by raising additional,complex issues merely six days prior to the discovery deadline that was agreed upon by both parties.see caligiuri first colony life ins,d,noting that questions of agency are complicated questions of fact.because campania admitted in its original answer that it retained rooks,rooks could not have foreseen the possibility of litigating whether cgi was legally responsible for paying rooks bills.the parties had conducted no discovery on this subject,and discovery would have delayed this matter for several months,for at least three potential witnesses were no longer employed by cgi or campania by the time the motion was filed.we are convinced that the trial judge was acting within her discretion when she denied campania motion to amend its answer and further barred campania from introducing any evidence to support this defense.principal mut.life ins.charter barclay hosp,cir sanders venture stores,cir murphy,at.
it also was proper to deny campania motion to include what it called the affirmative defense that,if the factfinder should determine that campania was contractually obligated to pay rooks invoices,then the amount due should be offset by the amount of damages allegedly caused by rooks legal malpractice.a court may determine that a proposed amendment is futile if it sets forth facts or legal theories that are redundant,immaterial,or unresponsive to the allegations in the complaint.desalle wright,cir.campania tells us that the purpose of its amendment was to clarify the reasons why campania refused to pay rooks bills.br.at.we are convinced that such an amendment was unnecessary because the burden of proving substantial performance of the agreement rested upon campania.wildman,harrold,allen dixon gaylord,d.campania original answer denied breaching the contract on the grounds that rooks failed to handle the case with reasonable care and skill.doc.this denial,on its own terms,squarely placed at issue the question of whether rooks fulfilled its contractual obligations,including its duty of care.thus,the affirmative defense raised in campania amended answer was properly rejected as superfluous desalle,at see also state farm mut.auto.ins.riley.
motion to file counterclaim and continue trial 
we next consider campania claim that the district judge abused her discretion when refusing to allow campania to file a counterclaim,extend discovery,and stay the case indefinitely pending the resolution of a separate lawsuit filed against campania in illinois state court.because campania filed the motion nine days after the deadline for discovery had deadline agreed to by the parties several months district court denied the motion as untimely.upon review of the court decision for an abuse of discretion,united states mlk,cir,we conclude that campania failed to demonstrate any good cause that would justify its delay.
in this case,the district court,acting upon a joint motion of the parties,entered a scheduling order barring any further discovery proceedings after january.campania sought to reopen discovery after mann initiated a lawsuit against campania in illinois state court on january.campania tendered only the first two payments required under the settlement agreement but thereafter fell behind in its obligations mann lawsuit sought to recover the damages campania owed him.in the proposed counterclaim filed in federal court,campania sought reimbursement for these damages because it alleged that the rooks law firm committed malpractice when it drafted an agreement making than party liable for paying the settlement.campania requested discovery into rooks alleged malpractice.campania also asked judge conlon to stay the federal case until such time as the pending state court action proceeded to a judgment purportedly establishing campania full amount of liability.based on the record before us,we are convinced that the trial court denial of campania motion was proper.
