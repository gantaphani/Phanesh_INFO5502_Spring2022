defendant the city of pleasanton enacted an ordinance approving a proposed residential development on land owned by plaintiffs jennifer and frederic lin.real party in interest kay ayala,a former city councilperson and member of an unincorporated association operating under the name save pleasanton hills,gathered the number of voter signatures necessary to hold a referendum on the ordinance,subd.b.the superior court granted the lins petition for a writ of mandate directing the city clerk to refrain from certifying the referendum petition based on its failure to comply with the text requirement of section,subdivision b.it granted in part ayala motion to strike the writ petition as a slapp strategic lawsuit against public participation code of civil procedure section,but denied her request for attorney fees on that motion.
in this appeal,ayala contends the writ petition should have been denied in its entirety because the issues it presented were not ripe for review the court erred when it issued the writ based on the referendum petition failure to include documents that were referred to in the challenged ordinance but were neither attached as exhibits nor incorporated by reference the court should have granted the motion as to additional causes of action and the court should have awarded her costs and attorney fees as a prevailing party on the motion.we agree that the trial court erred in its interpretation of the text requirement of section,subdivision b and reverse the order granting the writ petition.we affirm the court ruling on the motion,but remand the case for a redetermination of ayala entitlement to costs and attorney fees.
factual and procedural background 
the lins own approximately acres of land in the city of pleasanton.in,the city approved a development on the lin property that included an golf course.this approval was rescinded in a referendum election held november.
in november of,approval of a planned unit development pud was sought by the lins agents,james tong and charter properties.the originally proposed plan,which was to be known as oak grove and was designated,consisted of residential units on approximately acres of the lins parcel,with the remaining land to be dedicated to the city for open space and recreational uses.the proposed development plan included a number of documents detailing the particulars of the intended project an aerial overview,a topographic map,a grading plan,a slope map,a site development profile showing proposed elevations,a tree report,a geological and geotechnical report,landscape guidelines and residence design guidelines.
the city commissioned a draft environmental impact report eir as required by the california environmental quality act,california public resources code section et ceqa.the report considered four alternative plans.following the period for public comment and a public hearing that concluded in october,the city adopted resolutions certifying that the eir was adequate and complete,adopting the ceqa findings,and approving the mitigation monitoring and implementation plan for the oak grove planned unit development mmip.the ceqa findings determined that a alternative considered in the eir alternative was the preferred project.
the city adopted ordinance,an ordinance approving the application of james tong,charter properties oak grove development,for pud development plan approval,as filed under case.it also adopted companion ordinance,an ordinance approving a development agreement between the city of pleasanton and jennifer lin and frederic lin regarding the oak grove development.ordinance provided that it would be of no force or effect if ordinance were set aside by referendum.
ordinance,which approved the development plan,contained two exhibits,each of which was specifically incorporated by reference into the ordinance itself a document entitled environmental findings and statement of overriding considerations attached as exhibit a,and a document entitled final conditions of approval,oak grove property,attached as exhibit b.the development agreement that was the subject of ordinance,was attached to the final conditions of approval as exhibit d to that document.the development plan that was approved by ordinance was referred to in that ordinance and in its exhibits,but it was not attached or incorporated by reference 
following the adoption of ordinances and,ayala circulated a referendum petition entitled referendum against an ordinance passed by the city council ordinance approving the application of james tong,charter properties oak grove development,for pud plan approval,as filed under case.the petition was comprised of a copy of ordinance,the ceqa findings attached to and incorporated into that ordinance as exhibit a,the conditions of approval attached to and incorporated into that ordinance as exhibit b,and the development agreement attached to the conditions of approval as exhibit d.the referendum petition did not contain a copy of the development plan.appellant obtained more than the requisite amount of voter signatures and submitted the petition to the city clerk,who certified it for filing.
the lins filed a petition for writ of mandate directing the city clerk to declare the referendum petition invalid.ayala was named as the real party in interest.code civ.the first cause of action alleged that the referendum petition violated section because it did not contain the full text of ordinance.the second cause of action alleged that the petition violated section because it did not advise voters that the repeal of ordinance would be of no force and effect if ordinance were invalidated.the third cause of action alleged that information distributed to voters and available on the website for save pleasanton hills was false and misleading under section.the fourth cause of action sought declaratory relief based on the theories alleged in the first three causes of action.
ayala filed a demurrer to the petition arguing that it failed to state a cause of action,along with an motion under code of civil procedure section.after holding a combined hearing on the petition for writ of mandate,the demurrer and the motion,the trial court issued a written order granting the lins petition for writ of mandate based on the first cause of action 
the petition is granted as to the first cause of action,which alleges noncompliance with the requirement found in california elections code section b that the full text of any ordinance sought to be repealed by referendum petition be attached to the referendum petition itself.the requirements of section b are construed strictly,and when in doubt,ambiguities should be resolved with an eye to protecting the electorate from confusing or misleading information and to guarantee the integrity of the electoral process.citations.while the referendum petition of defendant ayala did not have to attach the entire development plan to achieve technical compliance with section as the development plan was not expressly incorporated by reference,the failure to include at least some portion of the development plan exhibits thereto frustrates the purpose of section,which is to ensure that members of the electorate are adequately informed so that they can intelligently exercise their rights.citation.the final conditions of approval,which were attached to the petition as exhibit b and which modify the development plan,are meaningless and potentially misleading without including at least some portions of the development plan.citations.the final conditions of approval modify the terms of the development plan,including,for example,construction of mitigation measures,specific design guidelines such as maximum house heights,building floor measures,maximum grading slopes,placement of side drives in setback areas,and design review procedures.see referendum petition,ex,b at.in addition,the final conditions of approval impose numerous conditions on specific lots.these modifications and conditions are rendered meaningless,are potentially misleading,without the relevant portions of the referendum petition and a map indicating the location of each lot.the information in the referendum petition thus does not accurately inform voters of the contents of the ordinance sought to be invalidated.citation.referencing outside sources that are available for review elsewhere does not cure the potentially misleading nature of the referendum as presented.citation.
the court sustained ayala demurrer as to the second and third causes of action.it granted her motion as to the third cause of action based on misrepresentation,denied that motion as to the other causes of action,and declined to award ayala attorney fees.ayala appeals,challenging the granting of the writ petition on the first cause of action,the court denial of her motion as to the second and third causes of action,and the court denial of attorney fees on her motion.
ii.discussion 
sufficiency of referendum petition 
the trial court granted the petition for a writ of mandate because it concluded the referendum petition should have contained at least a portion of the development plan approved by ordinance.ayala contends it was not necessary for her to include the development plan in the referendum petition because it was not part of the text of the ordinance.because this issue is one of law based on undisputed material facts,we review the trial court decision de novo.defend bayview hunters point com.city and county of san francisco th,d defend bayview.
article ii,section of the california constitution empowers the legislature to establish procedures governing municipal referenda.see mapstead anchundo th,d.when the requisite number of registered voters signs a valid petition for a referendum on a local ordinance,the legislative body that passed the ordinance against which the referendum is filed must either repeal it or place the referendum on the ballot for the voters to determine.
section establishes the required contents of a referendum petition challenging a municipal ordinance.subdivision b of section provides,each section of the referendum petition shall contain the identifying number or title,and the text of the ordinance or the portion of the ordinance that is the subject of the referendum.the purpose of these requirements is to reduce confusion as to the contents of referendum petitions in the minds of electors.billig voges d.billig.a city clerk has a ministerial duty to reject a petition that violates section,subdivision b.defend bayview,supra,th at,d.
case law has interpreted the text requirement of section,subdivision b to include the words of the ordinance itself and documents that are physically attached as exhibits or incorporated by reference.in billig,supra,d at,the court upheld the rejection of a referendum petition that included the city attorney summary of the rezoning ordinance being challenged,but omitted a portion of the ordinance and two exhibits which comprise d the major portion of the ordinance.in chase brooks d,a referendum petition was found defective when it did not include an exhibit to the challenged ordinance that set forth the legal description of the affected real property.in nelson carlson th,d,a referendum petition challenging the adoption of a land use plan through a resolution by the city council violated the text requirement because it did not include a copy of the general plan that was attached to the resolution and expressly incorporated by reference.and in defend bayview,supra,th at pages,d,a referendum petition was properly rejected where it did not include the redevelopment plan that was adopted by the challenged ordinance and expressly incorporated by reference.
the referendum petition at issue in this case contained the text of ordinance the two exhibits that were attached to and incorporated by reference into that ordinance and an exhibit to one of the two exhibits incorporated by reference into the ordinance.no documents that were attached or specifically incorporated into the ordinance were omitted.the referendum petition satisfied the plain language of section,subdivision b.
the lins argue the referendum petition was defective because it did not contain a copy of the development plan that was adopted by ordinance.we disagree.the development plan was not included in the text of that ordinance,was not attached as an exhibit,and was not expressly incorporated by reference.it may well be the case that an informed voter would prefer to review portions of the development plan before determining whether to sign a referendum petition that could ultimately result in that plan being set aside.but section,subdivision b requires the text of the ordinance being challenged,not the inclusion of additional information a conscientious voter might want to know before signing the petition.see we paula herrera th,d we care petition for initiative amending general plan to require voter approval of certain measures affecting land use density required only full text of measure being enacted,not full text of general plan.
the decision in mervyn reyes th,d mervyn does not require a different result.in mervyn,the city of hayward had adopted a general plan changing the designation of real property owned by a department store to open space,parks and recreation.a few years later,an initiative petition was circulated to the open space land use designations parks and recreation,baylands,limited open space of the general policies plan map and the supporting policies in effect on january.id.at,d.the initiative did not include the text of the portion of the general plan that was being,the voters were asked to sign a petition that did not include the substance of the law that would go into effect if the initiative were passed.ibid.noting that an initiative petition,similar to a referendum,must contain the text of the measure being enacted pursuant to section,the court concluded that the text of the measure in that case included the pages of the general plan that were affected by the measure.mervyn,at,d.the initiative petition was defective because it did not include those pages.
we do not interpret the mervyn decision to mean that a petition for initiative or referendum must include the text of all laws potentially affected by the proposed measure.that proposition was specifically disavowed in we care,supra,th at pages,d.nor do we agree with the trial court conclusion in this case that the development plan approved by ordinance is analogous to the portions of the general plan that were deemed to be a part of the text of the initiative in mervyn.
in mervyn,the initiative proponents sought to reenact portions of the city general plan that were in effect as of a certain date.the measure thus consisted of those portions of the general plan.because the initiative petition referred to the portions of the general plan that were being reenacted by their title only,it did not contain the full text of the measure at issue and voters reading the petition would not have known the substance of the law whose enactment was sought.mervyn,supra,th at,d.in the present case,by contrast,the referendum petition advised voters of the precise language of the ordinance being challenged and its attached exhibits.
we find it significant,though not dispositive,that mervyn involved an initiative rather than a referendum petition.although t he purpose and function of the initiative and referendum are identical in the sense that both provide a vehicle for voters to directly challenge local land use decisions mervyn,supra,th at,d see also,d,they approach this task from opposite directions.an initiative is drafted by its proponents and is the very law whose enactment is sought,whereas a referendum seeks to set aside a law that has been drafted by others.see.
the court in mervyn quite reasonably required the drafters of an initiative designed to reenact portions of a general plan to include in the initiative petition that portion of the general plan that was being reenacted.by contrast,the proponents of a referendum petition are required by statute to include the text of the ordinance being challenged and are thus constrained by language drafted by others.in this case,for whatever reason,ordinance did not include the development plan it approved,nor did it incorporate that plan by reference or attach it as an exhibit.ayala had no direct control over the drafting of the ordinance and it would place an unreasonable burden on her and on other referenda proponents to determine whether additional documents that were neither included nor incorporated by reference ought to be included in the referendum petition.
the text requirement of section is designed to reduce voter confusion regarding the content of a referendum to a practical minimum.see creighton reviczky d.interpreting former.in all but the most extreme situations,this purpose is fulfilled by construing the text to include the language of the ordinance itself,plus any documents attached as exhibits or expressly incorporated by reference.though it is possible to hypothesize a case in which the content of a local ordinance would be so sparse as to be intelligible only when read with documents falling outside this definition of text,the city hereby approves the development plan for property owned by jane,more is not required in a referendum petition unless the text as so defined would be affirmatively misleading.see,hebard bybee th,d hebard referendum petition defective where it misstated title of challenged zoning ordinance in a manner that made it unclear how much land was affected and how zoning would be changed.
here,the text of the ordinance itself was not misleading.while it did not include the development plan,the ordinance and accompanying exhibits advised voters that the project at issue was a residential development on acres.these materials described the location and nature of the site,the history of the proposed development,the environmental review that had been conducted,the mitigation measures that would be implemented and a number of other details about the property and proposed project.some voters might have wanted additional information contained in the development plan itself,but there was nothing misleading about the information that was provided 
we therefore conclude that barring extreme circumstances not presented by this case,section,subdivision b does not require a referendum petition to include documents that were neither attached to the challenged ordinance nor expressly incorporated by reference.the right to referendum is a precious one rossi brown cal th,d,and citizens wishing to exercise this right should not be required to guess at the documents to be included in a referendum petition.limiting the text requirement of section to the words of the challenged ordinance and those documents attached to it or incorporated by reference provides citizens circulating a referendum petition with fair notice of its required contents and insures that voters presented with the petition will know the language of the ordinance being challenged.this strikes a reasonable balance between a citizen right to circulate a referendum petition and the voters interest in being adequately apprised of the issue presented.if a voter requires additional information about the effects of the ordinance at issue,he or she can seek it out before deciding whether to sign a referendum petition.see we care,supra,th at,d.
our interpretation of the text requirement also ensures that city and county clerks charged with certifying referendum petitions will not be called upon to make evaluations of a petition validity.in certifying a referendum petition,a clerk duty is limited to the ministerial function of determining whether the procedural requirements have been met.billig,supra,d at.this duty includes a determination of whether the petition includes the text of the ordinance challenged.ibid.were we to construe the text requirement to include documents that were neither attached to nor expressly incorporated into the ordinance itself,the ministerial duty of checking the text could too easily be transformed into a discretionary act exceeding the straightforward comparison of the submitted petition with the statutory requirements for petitions that is authorized by law.see alliance for a better downtown millbrae wade th,d.
in their petition for rehearing,the lins argue for the first time that the development plan was incorporated by reference into ordinance based on the following language in that ordinance now,therefore,the city council of the city of pleasanton does hereby ordain as follows section.approves case,the application of james tong,charter properties,for planned unit development pud development plan approval subject to the conditions shown on exhibit b,attached here and incorporated herein by this reference.this language explicitly incorporated into the ordinance exhibit b,the final conditions of approval,but did not explicitly incorporate the development plan itself.the lins argue that notwithstanding an explicit incorporation of the development plan,the reference to the plan made it an integral part of the ordinance.
in support of their argument,the lins cite a number of cases for the proposition that a document or statute may incorporate another even when the exact phrase incorporates by reference is not used.none address the issue of incorporation by reference in a context similar to the one before us.most involve the interpretation of an ordinance or statute that expressly refers to another statute or ordinance.see,tosh california coastal com.d.monterey county ordinance requiring a permit for all types of work specified in a uniform building code provision incorporated by reference that building code provision city and county of san francisco carpenter funds admin.office d.local ordinance that imposed a payroll tax on certain employers but provided an exemption for any organization described in section c or d or a of title of the united states code incorporated those federal provisions by reference mar sakti internat.th,d code civ,subd.b,which requires a court to allow intervention i f any provision of law confers an unconditional right to intervene incorporated by reference,which grants employers the right to become a party to a lawsuit by an injured employee against a third party in re cox cal d,trespassing ordinance that stated it would not apply when its application would result in an act prohibited by the unruh civil rights act incorporate d the unruh civil right act.others cases cited by the lins involve the interpretation of a contract,deed,or pleading that refers to another document.see shaw regents of university of california th,d patent agreement signed by university professor incorporated the royalty provisions of the university policy regarding patents,which was referred to in the patent agreement and set forth on the back of the form mecchi picchi d,probate court should have considered affidavit by a decedent regarding the disposition of property as an integral part of the deed when it was referred to in that deed ludgate ins.lockheed martin th,d judgment on the pleadings improperly granted based on plaintiff failure to specifically state in its complaint that it was incorporating by reference several documents that were attached to the complaint and were discussed and referred to therein.
read together,and as relevant here,these cases stand for the uncontroversial proposition that when an ordinance refers to a separate statute or document,the substance of the latter will affect the meaning of the former.this is simply a way of giving effect to the all the words within an ordinance when ascertaining its meaning.see donovan poway unified school dist.th,d when interpreting a statute,courts strive to give effect to every word and phrase.here,the issue is not the meaning of ordinance,but whether its text includes documents not explicitly incorporated.it is one thing to say that a statute reference to a different statute or document incorporates the substance of that other statute or document it is quite different to say the text of a statute includes any document or other law referred to in the statute.
were we interpreting the meaning of ordinance,it might well be necessary to look to the specific language of the development plan to which that ordinance refers.but that is not our task here.rather,we must determine whether a document that is not attached to an ordina
