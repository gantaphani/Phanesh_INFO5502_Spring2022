background 
the facts of this case are straightforward and uncontested.the plaintiffs appellees in this court are representatives of a class of more than nine thousand former and current doj attorneys who brought suit in the court of federal claims in,claiming compensation under fepa for overtime work performed from to the date of a final judgment in this case.the court of federal claims granted class certification in.doe united states,c,doe ii 
following discovery,the parties brought for summary judgment on the issue of liability in.the plaintiffs submitted a variety of documents on summary judgment in support of their claim that overtime was officially ordered or approved.the plaintiffs submitted the deposition transcripts of former assistant attorney general stephen colgate,in which he confirmed that component heads expect their attorneys if necessary to put in the extra hours to get the job done,at,and that it has been the culture of the department of justice that attorneys are to put in the hours necessary to get the job done,and if that requires extra hours they are to put those hours in to get the job done,at.the plaintiffs particularly emphasized excerpts from various editions of the united states attorney manual spanning to,which stated that assistant united states attorneys are professionals and should expect to work in excess of regular hours without overtime premium pay,see also at.
it was undisputed that at least some members of the class at some times worked more than a workweek.the parties differed as to the interpretation of the statute and the interpretation and effect of the pertinent opm regulation.fepa generally mandates overtime compensation to federal employees in grade or below for hours of work officially ordered or approved in excess of hours in an administrative workweek.a.the government argued that the plaintiffs were not entitled to compensation because the pertinent regulation required that overtime be ordered or approved in writing by an officer or employee to whom this authority has been specifically delegated.c.the government maintained that the requirement of a writing was not satisfied.the plaintiffs contended that because the doj expected,encouraged,or induced plaintiffs to work substantial amounts of overtime and had knowledge that plaintiffs work substantial amounts of overtime,they have authorized and approved the overtime under.compl.at.
the court of federal claims held in favor of the plaintiffs,granting the plaintiffs summary judgment motion and denying the government motion.doe i.at.the court of federal claims found that n o plaintiff in the class has requested overtime,and it follows that no authorized official could have ordered or approved it in writing.id.at.the court further explained that the p laintiffs do not allege that they were explicitly ordered to work overtime by an authorized official,but that management expectations and their caseloads require work in excess of forty hours a week to complete sic satisfactorily.id.at.the court recognized that until the decision in anderson united states,wl,our predecessor court,the court of claims,had strictly enforced the opm regulation requirement that an order or approval for overtime be made in writing.however,the court concluded that the court of claims adopted a more equitable approach in recent years,doe i.at,and that t he phrase ordered or approved as used in the pay statutes became subject to broader interpretations,including inducement,encouragement,and perhaps expectation.id.at.the court concluded that official inducement suffices to warrant compensation and that there was extensive documentation in the record establishing such inducement 
t he department of justice informed attorneys that it expected them to work overtime when necessary.authorized department officials testified that they understood the job to require overtime work.the department manual states that attorneys should expect to work in excess of regular hours.these factors,along with management understanding and approval of the process show that department officials moved into the area of inducement.
id.at citing byrnes united states.finding that the official policy at the department of justice has been to accept overtime work from its attorneys without paying for it,the court of federal claims held that because all such overtime was induced the c lass members are entitled to overtime pay if they can meet the standards of proof required by law,id.at.
the court of federal claims certified its summary judgment order for interlocutory appeal on the ground that j udicial economy will be served by seeking appellate review of this court liability determination before we address damages.doe ii,c,slip op.at.the government timely petitioned our court for permission to take an interlocutory appeal.we granted this petition and have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to d.doe united states,misc.
discussion 
we review the court of federal claims grant of summary judgment without deference.agwiak united states.
fepa was first enacted in.federal employees pay act of,ch,stat.initially codified at as amended at.in its present form,the act provides 
for,and intermittent tours of duty,hours of work officially ordered or approved in excess of hours in an administrative workweek,or in excess of hours in a day,performed by an employee are overtime work and shall be paid for at the rates provided in a.
a.this overtime requirement applies only to employees in grade or below,and an employee may not receive overtime if such payment would increase the employee aggregate compensation in excess of the maximum allowable rate for grade employees.id.fepa allows the head of an agency to grant an employee compensatory time off from his scheduled tour of duty instead of payment under section.id.a.the head of an agency also may,with the approval of opm,grant annual premium pay of up to percent instead of overtime compensation when an employee is in a position in which the hours of duty can not be controlled administratively,and which requires substantial amounts of irregular,unscheduled overtime duty with the employee generally being responsible for recognizing,without supervision,circumstances which require the employee to remain on duty.id.c.
fepa expressly delegated rulemaking authority to the then civil service commission,providing that t he civil service commission is hereby authorized to issue such regulations as may be necessary for the administration of the foregoing provisions of this act,stat.at.shortly after the act was passed,the civil service commission adopted an implementing regulation.see,july.the civil service commission was supplanted by opm in,which has since been responsible for fepa regulations under identical statutory language.see civil service reform act of,a,stat,see also substantially the same regulation has applied from to the present.the current regulation provides 
authorization of overtime pay.
c overtime work in excess of any included in a regularly scheduled administrative workweek may be ordered or approved only in writing by an officer or employee to whom this authority has been specifically delegated.
emphasis added.for convenience,we refer to the regulation as the opm regulation.
beginning in the and ending in the,our predecessor court,the court of claims,repeatedly had occasion to consider fepa and its accompanying regulations.curiously,we have not had occasion to interpret the overtime provision of the statute or regulations in published opinions since that time.
in these court of claims cases,the government persistently argued that the opm regulation did not permit overtime compensation unless an authorized official ordered or approved the overtime work in writing.as the court of federal claims correctly noted here,the court of claims early decisions agreed with the government,maintaining a strict interpretation of the statute and regulation to require prior official written authorization.in post united states,wl,the court in dictum described the opm writing regulation as a necessary safeguard against subjecting the government to improper expense.id.at.soon thereafter in tabbutt united states,wl,the court of claims rejected a claim to overtime compensation brought by investigators who based their claim on the fact that their supervisors approved daily work records that reflected overtime.the court held that the supervisors approval of these daily reports could hardly be said to take the place of an order for these men to work overtime,or of an approval of their claim to compensation for having done so.id.at.
the court of claims insistence on written authorization or approval climaxed in gaines united states,where it rejected a fepa overtime claim.the plaintiff in gaines worked for the civil aeronautics administration in a position that required a considerable amount of travel,and he claimed that he was required to be on official duty in excess of the prescribed work week.id.at.the court discussed fepa and the pertinent regulation,and it explained that any claim for overtime under fepa must be based upon the performance of overtime services which were expressly authorized or approved in writing by an officer or employee to whom such authority has been specifically delegated.id.at.finding no such authorization,and relying on post and tabbutt,the court entered summary judgment in favor of the government,stating a bsent the written authorization or approval as required by the statute and regulation,plaintiff is not entitled to recover.see also gray united states,dismissing plaintiff fepa overtime claim,which argued entitlement to compensation because authorized supervisors reviewed overtime work records and were aware of his overtime hours,on the authority of tabbutt,post and gaines because the official authorized to approve overtime did not at any time officially approve or order in writing any agent to work overtime.
the court of claims decision in anderson,took a dramatically different approach to the opm regulation written order requirement.in anderson,no overtime in excess of the administrative workweek was ordered or approved in writing as required by the opm regulation.id.at.indeed,i n withholding written orders for or approval of the overtime,the agency authorized officials intended to withhold compensation for the services performed.id.at.the court concluded that the substantive purpose of fepa was to ensure compensation for officially ordered or approved overtime work that the regulation procedural writing requirement could not be used to subvert the intent of the act and that the government could not refuse to pay compensation if it had orally induced its employees to work overtime.id.at.it was not disputed that the plaintiffs worked beyond the fepa workweek and that the work of the customs and border patrol agents involved was not the kind of work which could be easily accommodated to a,week.id.at.according to the court 
the failure of the commissioner of customs to translate the week into administrative reality for the patrol inspectors,and his suggestion of voluntary overtime to the district superintendents and their subordinate supervisory officials,together with his knowledge of the use made by them in rationalizing the extension of voluntary overtime,afford ample evidence of approval of the overtime worked by the plaintiffs by an official with authority under the statute and the regulations to give such approval.
id.at.because t he writing was required by the regulations,not by the statute and because t he withholding of written orders or approval reflected observance of the letter of the regulation but denial of the substance of the statute,it could not protect the government against fepa liability.id.at.according to the court,fepa mandate to pay additional compensation for overtime hours,when the work was,as here,officially ordered or approved overrides the regulation procedural requirement.id.at.
anderson ushered in a series of cases where the court,following anderson,awarded fepa compensation for overtime induced by government officials even though there was no written order or written approval.these cases embraced anderson reasoning that the civil service commission was without authority to attach procedural limitations to the substantive policy of fepa.see,fix united states,holding that the statute entitles an employee to compensation if induced or required to work overtime and that i f the regulations attempt to lay down any other rule,they can not stand since they would then be plainly inconsistent with the governing pay legislation as we have construed it rapp united states,holding that the government contention in denying overtime compensation runs counter to the federal employees pay act of because,as anderson stated,the mandate to pay additional compensation for overtime hours,when the work was,as here,officially ordered or approved,is overriding quoting anderson.at adams united states,relying on anderson theory that in circumstances where overtime work has been orally induced,the mandate of the statute overrides the lack of written authorization or approval.therefore,as the plaintiffs here urge,these cases held the writing requirement invalid as inconsistent with the purpose of fepa because it added a procedural requirement that was not reflected in the statute.rb at.
to some extent,these cases also suggested that equitable considerations prevented the government from denying overtime compensation where it induced overtime work.see baylor united states,to allow defendant to avoid payment of overtime compensation because it chose to require overtime indirectly rather than directly would obviously be inequitable.adams.at explaining that denying recovery for induced overtime would permit t he officials of the department of justice to commit a wrong for which their employees would be without remedy and that t he inequity of such a result is manifest see also mcquown united states,wl congressional reference opinion by a review panel of commissioners of the court of claims,holding that the plaintiff was induced and coerced by his supervisors with the knowledge and approval of officials authorized to approve overtime work,thereby estopping the defendant from relying on the provisions that overtime must be officially ordered or approved in writing.
court of claims decisions are,of course,binding upon us unless undermined by intervening supreme court or en banc authority.bankers trust united states,citing.am.oil united states dep t of energy,en banc see also united states,en banc.the problem is that the court of claims decisions discussed in the preceding section are not consistent with each other.the court of federal claims aptly observed here that an employee seeking overtime can likely find an opinion of the court of claims that fits his situation regardless of what it may be.doe i.at quoting anderson.at skelton,dissenting.the plaintiffs argue that we should continue to reject the writing requirement as did our predecessor court in the more recent anderson line of cases.the government urges that we follow gaines and the earlier cases that strictly enforced the written order requirement on the theory that under the principle of stare decisis,t he anderson panel had no more authority to discard prior cases than any other panel.reply br.for the appellant at.in this respect we agree with the plaintiffs.when the court of claims sat en banc,as it typically did in the anderson line of cases,we are obligated to follow the court most recent decision because an en banc court may modify or effectively overrule its earlier decisions.see george warren united states.
alternatively,the government urges that the opinions in the anderson line of inducement cases were all decided before the supreme court decision in schweiker hansen,d,and that hansen effectively overruled these cases.we agree.in holding that the opm regulation was invalid because it added a procedural writing requirement to the substantive requirements of fepa or because the result was inequitable,the anderson line of cases is inconsistent with hansen.
hansen involved the social security act,which extended benefits to a person who has filed application.g d.benefits could be paid retroactively for the twelve months prior to the filing of an application.id.j.the regulations promulgated pursuant to the social security act required the application to be in writing,and the social security manual required administrators to inform applicants that their applications must be filed in writing,hansen,at.when the plaintiff orally applied for benefits,the social security administrator erroneously informed her that she was not entitled to benefits and,in violation of the manual,failed to inform the plaintiff that the regulations required her to file a written application.id.the plaintiff subsequently learned that she was entitled to benefits,and she filed a written application,including a claim for retroactive benefits for the twelve months prior to her oral application.id.at.this claim was denied.while the facts of hansen were substantially similar to those in the anderson line of cases,the plaintiff challenge to the writing requirement in hansen was more limited.rather than suggesting that the writing requirement was entirely invalid,the plaintiff urged that the regulation was entitled to less respect than the substantive policies of the statute and that the agency could therefore be estopped from relying on the regulation writing requirement.
the second circuit held in favor of the plaintiff,and the supreme court described this decision in language that echoed the anderson line of cases the second circuit considered the regulation requirement a mere procedural requirement of lesser import than the fact that the plaintiff had been substantively eligible for the benefits under the statute.id.at.the court concluded 
the second circuit majority distinction between the plaintiff substantiv e eligib ility and her failure to satisfy a procedural requirement does not justify estopping petitioner in this case.congress expressly provided in the act that only one who has filed application for benefits may receive them,and it delegated to petitioner the task of providing by regulation the requisite manner of application.a court is no more authorized to overlook the valid regulation requiring that applications be in writing than it is to overlook any other valid requirement for the receipt of benefits.
id.at.emphases added third and fourth alterations in original.in so holding,the supreme court necessarily concluded that the writing requirement was not invalid simply because it added an additional procedural requirement to the substantive requirements of the statute.this result is directly at odds with the anderson line of cases.
after hansen,in boulez commissioner,the district of columbia circuit sustained a treasury regulation addition of a writing requirement to the internal revenue code provision regarding compromise agreements with the internal revenue service.id.at.the court quoted the supreme court earlier instruction that it is the duty of all courts to observe the conditions defined by congress for charging the public treasury,id.at quoting fed.crop ins.merrill,and it explained that hansen taught that this principle is no different where the requirement is promulgated by the agency charged by congress with administering a statute,boulez,at citing hansen,d see also am.airlines,austin.the court further elaborated on hansen reasoning,explaining that the supreme court held that no distinction between substantive and procedural requirements suffices to mitigate the court responsibility to ensure observance of regulations governing claims on the public fisc.id.citing hansen,at.
the anderson line of cases fares no better if it is viewed as resting on equitable considerations.hansen directly held that such considerations could not impose liability on the government,at,a result reinforced in office of personnel management richmond,d.the plaintiff in richmond,a recipient of federal disability annuity,was given an outdated publication in that incorrectly advised him that he could work without forfeiting his disability payments.at.the plaintiff disability payments were terminated once he began working.he argued that the government was estopped from terminating his benefits because it gave him incorrect advice.id.at.the court stated that a ll parties here agree that the award the plaintiff seeks would be in direct contravention of the federal statute upon which his ultimate claim to the funds must rest.id.at.relying on hansen,the court rejected the plaintiff estoppel claim because the equitable doctrine of estoppel can not grant respondent a money remedy that congress has not authorized.id.at.while richmond addressed a statutory limitation,the opinion cited hansen in support of its holding,which treated statutory and regulatory requirements concerning the payment of money from the treasury as equally binding.id.at.expressly following hansen and richmond,our court held in koyen office of personnel management,that t he supreme court has left no doubt that it is the duty of all courts to observe the conditions defined by congress for charging the public treasury.id.at quoting hansen,at.we therefore denied compensation despite the equities in favor of compensation because we we re bound by the dictates of richmond.id.at.
thus,to the extent that the anderson line of court of claims cases held that the civil service commission was without authority to impose a procedural written order requirement because it restricted the substantive scope of the overtime statute or because of equitable considerations,they are inconsistent with hansen and richmond.in light of hansen and richmond,we are compelled to hold that the anderson line of cases is no longer good law and that the written order requirement is not invalid on the ground that it imposes a procedural requirement that limits the right to overtime compensation under the statute or because it is inequitable.see bankers trust,at.we address below the plaintiffs arguments that the writing requirement is invalid under the statute for other reasons.
the plaintiffs assert that the writing requirement is only an administrative direction to employing agencies concerning procedures for administering an attempt to limit the statutory pay entitlement congress had enacted for federal employees.br.for appellees at.the plaintiffs argue that fepa itself limits opm role to that of establishing merely administrative regulations.
although there are some situations in which a statutory or regulatory requirement is purely an administrative directive that is not enforceable in litigation the opm regulation here is not such a regulation.fepa provides that t he office of personnel management may prescribe regulations necessary for the administration of this subchapter.a emphasis added.we held in contreras united states,that the annual and sick leave act of,in which congress authorized opm to issue regulations necessary for the administration of the act,allows opm to fill gaps in the statutory scheme left by congress if it does so in a manner that is consistent with the policies reflected in the statutory program.id.at quoting.we see no reason why fepa similarly phrased mandate to opm should be interpreted any differently.opm was not limited by the statute to promulgating merely administrative directives,but was empowered to issue regulations setting forth substantive requirements.
in fact,congress relied heavily on the civil service commission,opm predecessor,to promulgate substantive standards for overtime statutes even before the passage of fepa.for example,in the war overtime pay act of,ch,stat,congress invested the civil service commission with the power to promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary and proper for the purpose of coordinating and supervising the administration of the overtime statute.id,stat.at.although the act itself entitled federal employees to overtime compensation without any reference to the procedure for authorizing overtime work,the civil service commission regulations limited the authority to order overtime to officer s or employee s to whom such authority has been specifically delegated by the head of the department or agency.supp.congress incorporated the substance of the civil service commission standard in fepa,thus suggesting approval of the civil service commission broad exercise of its rulemaking power.
contrary to the plaintiffs claim,we also note that opm did not intend in the regulation to establish a mere administrative instruction.the opm regulation was clearly designed to interpret or expound upon the fepa officially ordered or approved requirement,a.this intention is highlighted by the regulation usage of parallel language overtime work may be ordered or approved only in writing,c.none of the prior cases has suggested that the regulation should be interpreted as a mere administrative instruction.
we next consider whether opm regulation is entitled to chevron deference,see chevron natural res.def.council,d.chevron contemplates a analytic process.id.at.first,we ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue if so,we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if,however,the statute is ambiguous,we proceed to chevron step two whether the agency responsible for filling a gap in the statute has rendered an interpretation that is based on a permissible construction of the statute.koyo seiko united states,quoting chevron,at.
the first step of the chevron analysis here centers on the phrase ordered or approved.fepa does not specify the form in which overtime must be ordered or approved,and these words are ambiguous as to whether they refer to written or oral authorization or both.dictionaries at the time fepa was enacted in make clear that the term order may refer to either a written or oral direction.see vii a new english dictionary on historical principles ed the second edition of which is known as the oxford english dictionary.an authoritative direction,injunction,mandate a command,oral or written an instruction.see also webster new international dictionary ed.to give an order to to command.so too,modern dictionaries make clear that an order may refer to either an oral or written order.see x the oxford english dictionary ed.a.an authoritative direction,injunction,mandate a command,oral or written an instruction.webster third new international dictionary providing various definitions for an order,including a formal written authorization to deliver materials,to perform work,or to do both.the term approve is broad enough to connote an oral or written approval.see i a new english dictionary on historical principles ed.to confirm authoritatively to sanction.webster new international dictionary.to sanction officially to ratify to confirm see also webster third new international dictionary to express often formally agreement with and support of or commendation of as meeting a standard.since the statutory terms order and approve are broad enough to encompass either written or oral communications or both,these terms are ambiguous.see,smiley citibank south dakota,d see also,boulez,at section a is facially ambiguous.it does not specify that compromise agreements must be in writing,nor does it explicitly sanction oral settlements.there is no suggestion here that this ambiguity may be resolved by resort to fepa legislative history or by other traditional tools of statutory construction.clearly,the first chevron present.
we then turn to the second chevron analytic step.the supreme court has recognized that a very good indicator of the applicability of chevron treatment is express congressional authorizations to engage in the process of rulemaking or adjudication that produces regulations or rulings.united states mead,d see also pesquera mares australes united states.the opm regulation,adopted b y virtue of the authority vested in the sic civil service commission by section of the federal employees pay act of,exec.order.july,has the necessary degree of formality to warrant chevron deference.under chevron,if a statutory term is ambiguous,the agency regulation implementing it is binding in the courts unless procedurally defective,arbitrary or capricious in substance,or manifestly contrary to the statute.household credit,pfennig,d quoting mead,at.we have said that the party contesting the regulation bear s the burden of showing that the agency approach is arbitrary or otherwise unreasonable.koyo seiko,at.the plaintiffs here have not met this burden with respect to opm regulation.
the plaintiffs argue that the opm regulation is an unreasonable interpretation of fepa that is not entitled to chevron deference,relying on the supreme court decision in ragsdale wolverine world wide,d,because the regulation addition of a writing requirement is contrary to fepa.in ragsdale,the supreme court held invalid a regulation under the family and medical leave act of,et,which allowed monetary recovery for an employer technical violation of the regulation without a showing of the prejudice to the employee.at.the statute,however,expressly required an employee to show actual prejudice from an employer actions as a prerequisite to compensation.id.at.the supreme court held that a regulation can not stand if it is manifestly contrary to the statute.id.at.quoting united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.likewise,in brown gardner,d,the supreme court invalidated a department of veterans affairs regulation that required veterans to prove negligence on the part of the veterans administration in order to recover certain benefits that the statute mandated simply upon proof of injury.id.at.
these supreme court decisions do not help the plaintiffs in the present case because the opm regulation written order requirement does not contradict the language of fepa.fepa merely limits compensation to those employees whose overtime work has been officially ordered or approved.a.this statement in and of itself is not at odds with the regulation writing requirement,nor does it suggest that inducement is sufficient to constitute official order or approval.and the act clearly contemplated that overtime would be ordered or approved through a somewhat formal procedure by providing an exception where such procedure is impossible.where formal control is impractical,such as if an employee is in a position in which the hours of duty can not be controlled administratively and requires substantial amounts of irregular,unscheduled overtime duty,fepa allows the employee to receive premium pay for this duty on an annual basis at an appropriate percentage,not less than percent nor more than percent,of the rate of basic pay for the position.c.
significantly too,the fair labor standards act of,ch,stat.codified as amended at flsa,enacted before fepa,incorporated a different standard for overtime compensation that allowed recovery for inducement.under flsa,an employee is entitled to overtime pay if the employer suffer s or permit s the employee to work overtime g see also the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized the expansive nature of this particular language,stating that a broader or more comprehensive coverage of employees would be difficult to frame.united states rosenwasser.see also,nationwide mut.ins.darden,d tony and susan alamo found.sec y of labor,d.our sister circuits have interpreted this standard as requiring only that an employer knows or has reason to believe the employee is continuing to work and the duties are an integral and indispensable part of the employee principal work activity.mumbower callicott,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also,pabst.gas,cir holzapfel town of ne
