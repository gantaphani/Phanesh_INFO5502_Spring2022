karton succeeded in collecting on the judgment within two months of its entry.since then,he has vigorously pursued further collection efforts against dougherty in california,pennsylvania,and tennessee.in addition,he has twice returned to the superior court to request awards of the attorney fees he has incurred in enforcing the judgment.both times,he failed to give notice to dougherty that he was seeking such relief.both times,the court granted his requests in their entirety.with the most recent such award,entered in february,the principal amount of the judgment has ballooned to,plus in interest.

background 
complaint,proof of service,default,and default judgment 
in june,dougherty retained karton to represent him in a marital dissolution action.the written retainer agreement provided that if karton monthly bills were not paid in full within thirty days,then karton reserved the right to charge simple interest at the rate of ten percent per annum on the unpaid portions of the monies owed.the agreement also contained the following attorney fees provision in the event legal services are commenced in connection with the enforcement of this agreement or the collection of the fees the costs,whether in the form of a demand,a court action,or an arbitration proceeding,the prevailing party to the extent permitted by law shall be entitled to legal fees for services,as well as court arbitration costs.
on march,karton filed suit against dougherty in los angeles county superior court,seeking to recover in allegedly unpaid fees and costs,plus interest thereon at the rate of ten percent per annum.karton filed a first amended complaint on march.
on march,karton filed a proof of service of the summons and first amended complaint.the first page of the proof of service identifies the process server as william russell dougherty,the person served and title as margaret,the person with whom left title or relationship to person served as margaret,and the date and time of delivery as march,at.the proof of service identifies the manner of service as substituted service.there is,however,no attached affidavit showing reasonable diligence in first attempting personal service.the proof of service also fails to state both the date on which the papers were mailed to the person to be served and the date and place of execution of the proof of service.the proof of service was signed by paul kern,a registered process server.
the superior court file contains a document issued by the court and dated april,stating that t he request for entry of a civil default submitted in karton action against dougherty has been turned down because the proof of service was defective.the file does not contain the request for entry of default to which this document corresponds.
on may,karton filed another request for entry of default and a second proof of service.on the same day,the clerk entered the default as requested.
the second proof of service states that william russell dougherty was both the process server,the person served and title,and the person with whom left title or relationship to person served,and it identifies the date and time of delivery as march,at.it identifies the manner of service as personal service by personally delivering copies to the person served.it is signed by paul kern and states that it was executed on march.
on june,the trial court entered a minute order denying without prejudice karton request for entry of default judgment,partly on the ground that karton had failed to submit a computation of interest only a bottom line number is provided.the court ordered karton to submit new papers with the problems corrected within days.
on july,the court entered a minute order again denying without prejudice karton request for entry of default judgment,partly on the ground that the computation of prejudgment interest does not appear to be correct,and attaching the court own computation.the court again ordered karton to submit new papers with the problems corrected within days.
on july,karton filed a declaration and a memorandum of points and authorities in support of his request for entry of default judgment.in his memorandum of points and authorities he claimed he was entitled to interest of through june,but he gave no explanation of how he derived that number.his declaration said nothing about interest,and he attached no other documents supporting the claimed amount of interest.
on august,karton filed a declaration in support of his request for default judgment.attached as exhibits were his retainer agreement with dougherty,his billing statements to dougherty,and a spreadsheet that displayed the amounts and dates of karton bills,the amounts and dates of dougherty payments,and the interest accrued on unpaid bills.according to the spreadsheet,the total amount of unpaid fees and costs was,and the total interest was,for a combined total of as of may.in the declaration to which the spreadsheet was attached,karton stated the total of principal plus interest through may,is.the daily interest is.inasmuch as i have used the principal sum of without interest for purposes of default,the difference between and is that is the amount of interest that is requested.karton statement that he used the principal sum of for purposes of default was presumably a reference to his operative first amended complaint,which alleged only in unpaid fees and costs.thus,although karton own calculations showed less than in accrued interest on outstanding fees and costs of,and karton first amended complaint alleged only in outstanding fees and costs,karton requested an interest award of 
on august,the trial court entered default judgment in the principal sum of,plus accrued prejudgment interest of through august,plus costs of and attorney fees of,for a total of as of august,with prejudgment interest continuing to accrue at the rate of per day until entry of judgment.the judgment further provides that the court expressly reserves jurisdiction to modify attorney s fees and costs incurred after the date hereof.
the superior court file contains a letter from wells fargo bank dated august,informing dougherty that karton had levied on roughly in dougherty accounts.it is undisputed that by october,karton had seized approximately of dougherty funds in partial satisfaction of the default judgment.
ii.dougherty motions to vacate and other applications 
dougherty filed a number of motions and other applications in the trial court,seeking to set aside the default or stay the proceedings.none was successful.
on july,after entry of default but before entry of the default judgment,dougherty filed a request for a stay.in a supporting declaration,dougherty counsel stated that dougherty had requested arbitration of the fee dispute before the los angeles county bar association.he further stated that the bar association had found that the request was timely,rejecting karton contention that it was not.on that basis,dougherty requested a stay of these proceedings pending arbitration.on july,the court entered a minute order denying dougherty request on the ground that defendant has no standing.
on september,after entry of the default judgment,dougherty filed an ex parte application for a stay and return of property pending a hearing on a motion to set aside the default judgment.on the same day,the court entered a minute order denying the ex parte application without prejudice.
on september,dougherty filed a motion to set aside the default and default judgment,to be heard on october.on october,dougherty petitioned for bankruptcy protection.he did not appear for the october hearing on his motion to set aside,and the superior court placed the motion off calendar.
on september,dougherty filed an ex parte application for a temporary restraining order enjoining any further collection efforts by karton and requiring him to return property already seized,pending a hearing on the motion to vacate that was calendared for october.on the same day,the court entered a minute order denying the ex parte application.
on november,dougherty filed a motion to set aside the default,to be heard on december.the superior court file contains no minute order or notice of ruling concerning the motion,and the trial court docket reflects that no hearing was held on december.
on december,dougherty filed a motion to set aside the default,to be heard on january.in opposition,karton contended that the action was stayed because of dougherty bankruptcy filing.on january,the trial court denied the motion without prejudice.
on february,the bankruptcy court entered a stipulated order modifying the bankruptcy stay to permit the superior court to decide all motions,including to set aside the default and default judgment,and all other matters that may be properly brought before it,including those pertaining to the further liquidation of the karton claim.the stipulation,signed by counsel for both karton and dougherty,recited that the superior court had denied without prejudice dougherty previous motions to vacate the default and default judgment because the court had believed that the bankruptcy stay prohibited the court from ruling on the motions.
on april,dougherty filed a motion to set aside the default,to be heard on may.on may,the trial court entered a minute order placing the motion off calendar at the request of m oving p arty.
in sum,dougherty filed seven motions or other applications as follows july,prejudgment,request for stay,denied for lack of standing september,postjudgment,request for stay,denied without prejudice september,motion to set aside,taken off calendar the day after dougherty filed his bankruptcy petition september,application for temporary restraining order,denied november,motion to set aside,no hearing and no ruling december,motion to set aside,denied without prejudice and april,motion to set aside,taken off calendar at dougherty request.four of the seven were motions to set aside the default and default judgment.three of those four were never ruled upon,and the fourth was denied without prejudice 
iii.the fee award and sister state enforcement proceedings 
in the bankruptcy proceeding,dougherty did not succeed in discharging his debt to karton.
on april,karton filed an application in the superior court for an award of supplemental attorney fees totaling.karton claimed that he had incurred the fees from through in opposing dougherty motions in the superior court and in resisting dougherty efforts to discharge the debt in bankruptcy.the requested amount also included for karton own time spent working on the bankruptcy matter.
karton contended that b ecause the judgment was entered as a default,no notice of this motion is required to be given to the defendant.underlining omitted.accordingly,karton did not give notice to dougherty.
in its tentative ruling,the superior court expressed concern about the lack of notice and said that t he court needs authority for granting the relief here without notice to dougherty.the court ultimately relented,however,and granted karton unnoticed request,thereby increasing the principal amount of the judgment to,plus interest of as of july,with interest continuing to accrue at the rate of per day 
at some point dougherty relocated to pennsylvania and then to tennessee.karton has continued to pursue collection efforts in both states,and dougherty has continued unsuccessfully to resist those efforts.
on june,a pennsylvania trial court denied on grounds of res judicata dougherty petition to foreign default judgment.dougherty appealed,and the superior court of pennsylvania affirmed.the appellate court,citing pennsylvania case law,reasoned that it was required to give full faith and credit to the california judgment as long as dougherty had the opportunity to appear and defend in california.the court cited dougherty september,motion to set aside which was taken off calendar after dougherty filed his bankruptcy petition and his december,motion to set aside which was denied without prejudice because of the bankruptcy stay as showing that the pennsylvania trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that dougherty had already been given a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issues raised in his petition.dougherty also argued that he was entitled to notice of karton request for an award of supplemental attorney fees.the pennsylvania appellate court concluded that because the california trial court had decided that issue,res judicata applied to it as well.
as a result of the pennsylvania enforcement proceedings,dougherty and his wife,upon their relocation to tennessee,entered into an agreement with karton to give him the proceeds of the sale of their pennsylvania home,in partial satisfaction of the judgment.the record before us contains a declaration from karton in which he estimates that the sale will generate approximately to be applied against the default judgment.the record also contains unsworn statements by dougherty counsel estimating that karton will receive well over from the sale.
on october,a tennessee trial court likewise rejected dougherty attempt to have the judgment stayed,vacated and set aside.the court,having read the opinion of the pennsylvania appellate court,agreed that the issue of whether the default judgment obtained in california was legitimately obtained was fairly litigated in the california court and the issue is now a matter of res judicata.dougherty voluntarily dismissed his appeal from that order,contending that he simply does not have the resources to continue an appellate defense in tennessee and that he simply can not risk further fees being added to what he believes is a wrongful judgment.
as a result of the tennessee enforcement proceedings,karton garnished approximately percent of dougherty wages in tennessee.the record reflects that the garnishment remained in effect as of may,and the record contains no evidence as to whether the garnishment terminated thereafter.karton has also filed a separate lawsuit in tennessee against dougherty and his wife,alleging claims for violation of tennessee fraudulent transfer statute,common law fraud,abuse of process,malicious prosecution,and civil conspiracy.karton complaint alleges that dougherty fraudulently transferred certain assets to his wife,which transfers were done in order to avoid satisfaction of the default judgment.the complaint specifically identifies the home that dougherty and his wife have purchased in tennessee,and the complaint asks the court to set aside all fraudulent transfers made by dougherty and order dougherty to turn over to karton all assets so transferred in order to satisfy the default judgment.
iv.the action 
in,dougherty filed suit against karton in los angeles county superior court,seeking to set aside the default judgment and the fee award.karton demurred on the basis of collateral estoppel,arguing that dougherty attacks on the judgment were precluded by the rulings on dougherty previous series of nine motions,both noticed and ex parte,to set aside the j udgment.
by minute order entered january,the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,stating that t he doctrine of collateral estoppel bars the plaintiff claims.on february,the court entered judgment on the merits in favor of karton.in a postjudgment order entered april,the court awarded karton attorney fees and costs totaling.
dougherty appealed from the judgment,but karton moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that dougherty had not posted a bond ordered by the trial court as security for a potential fee award in favor of karton.the record reflects that the deadline for posting the bond was after the trial court sustained karton demurrer without leave to amend.the court of appeal dismissed the appeal.
v.the fee award 
on february,karton again applied to the superior court for an award of supplemental attorney fees,costs,and interest.karton claimed he had incurred the fees from through in his ongoing enforcement efforts in pennsylvania,tennessee,and california.according to karton memorandum of points and authorities,as of the filing of the instant motion,and subject to an update to be submitted at the time of the hearing,dougherty owes karton,as of december,the sum of.again,karton gave no notice to dougherty and contended that none was required.karton also filed an ex parte application for an order shortening time for the hearing on his request for fees,and the court granted the application.
on february,the trial court granted karton fee request.the court order provides that as of january,the principal amount of the judgment,is increased by plus interest of plus plus,resulting in a total of.the order concludes by instructing the clerk to issue,upon a request,a writ of execution in the amounts of principal and interest,as of january.
on may,dougherty filed a motion for relief from the february order amending the judgment.the motion was based on code of civil procedure section,subdivisions b and d,as well as the court inherent equitable powers dougherty contended that in early march,in response to a document production request in the tennessee fraudulent transfer litigation,karton produced copies of his request for attorney fees and the order granting it.in his motion,dougherty attacked both the february order,the order granting karton first request for an award of supplemental attorney fees,and the original default judgment on various grounds,including the lack of notice of the february proceeding.
on august,the trial court entered an order denying dougherty motion.on august,dougherty filed a notice of appeal,purporting to appeal from both the february,order amending the judgment and the august,order denying his motion for relief from the february order 
discussion 
dougherty was entitled to notice of karton requests for postjudgment attorney fees 
dougherty argues on appeal,as he did in his motion for relief from the fee award,that he was entitled to notice of karton applications in and for awards of supplemental attorney fees.we agree.
a judgment creditor is entitled to the reasonable and necessary costs of enforcing a judgment.recoverable costs include attorney fees incurred in enforcing the judgment if,as here,the judgment includes an award of attorney fees pursuant to a contractual attorney fees provision,see miller givens th,d.the judgment creditor may seek to recover attorney fees incurred in enforcing a judgment by filing either a memorandum of costs under section,subdivision b,or a noticed motion under section,subdivision a.
karton application for attorney fees does not cite either section or section,so the first question we must resolve is whether karton application should be regarded as a memorandum of costs under the former statute or a motion under the latter.we conclude that it must be treated as a memorandum of costs under section,because section expressly calls for the filing of a noticed motion,subd.a see also,subd.b the notice of motion shall be served on the judgment debtor.because karton gave dougherty no notice of his application for fees,the application was not a noticed motion.we therefore conclude that karton application for attorney fees like his application for attorney fees must be treated as a memorandum of costs under section 
that conclusion does not relieve karton of his obligation to give notice to dougherty,however,because section too requires notice.the statute provides that a judgment creditor shall serve a copy of the memorandum of costs on the judgment debtor,subd.b.
karton nonetheless contends that he was not required to serve a copy on dougherty.as support for that contention,karton relies upon section,which provides in relevant part no bill of exceptions,notice of appeal,or other notice or paper,other than amendments to the pleadings,or an amended pleading,need be served upon any party whose default has been duly entered or who has not appeared in the action or proceedings.on that basis,karton argues that because dougherty was in default,he was not entitled to notice of karton applications for postjudgment attorney fees.we disagree 
the interpretation of a statute is a pure question of law that we review de novo.people ex rel.lockyer shamrock foods cal th,d.in interpreting sections and,we are guided by the following familiar principles the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.literal construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute.the intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.citations.an interpretation that renders related provisions nugatory must be avoided citation each sentence must be read not in isolation but in the light of the statutory scheme citation and if a statute is amenable to two alternative interpretations,the one that leads to the more reasonable result will be followed citation.lungren deukmejian cal d.
we note first that neither party is aided here by the maxim that when a general and particular provision are inconsistent,the latter is paramount to the former.on the one hand,section is particular with respect to parties whose default has been entered but is general with respect to other notice s or paper s.on the other hand,section is particular with respect to memoranda of enforcement costs but is general with respect to judgment debtor s,it does not distinguish default judgment debtors from other judgment debtors.thus,the maxim that the particular controls over the general does not tell us whether section particular rule for parties in default controls over section particular rule for memoranda of enforcement costs,or the other way around.
we conclude nonetheless that section must be interpreted as requiring service of the memorandum of costs on all judgment debtors,including default judgment debtors,for the following reason section provides that if the judgment creditor files a memorandum of costs and the judgment debtor does not timely file a motion to tax costs,then the court is required to allow all of the costs claimed in the memorandum of costs,subd.d if no motion to tax costs is made within the time provided in subdivision c,the costs claimed in the memorandum are allowed see ahart,california practice guide enforcing judgments and debts the rutter group,to if a timely motion to tax is not filed by the judgment debtor,enforcement costs claimed in the judgment creditor memorandum are automatically allowed and added to the judgment.consequently,if karton were right that a default judgment debtor is not entitled to notice of a memorandum of costs under section,then the statute would compel trial courts to grant all of the costs requested in such memoranda,because judgment debtors who are unaware of the proceedings will never have the opportunity to file motions to tax.in effect,every default judgment would become a blank check in favor of the judgment creditor.we can not believe that the legislature intended to create such a rule,which would make error and mischief virtually inevitable.
this case illustrates the dangers inherent in the sorts of uncontested proceedings that would result if karton were right.karton memorandum of costs is improper on its face,for the following reason a memorandum of costs under section like a noticed motion under section must be filed not later than two years after the costs have been incurred,subd.b,subd.a.that is,the memorandum or noticed motion may seek only those costs incurred within two years before filing.but karton attorney fee application like his attorney fee application requests fees incurred throughout the four years before it was filed.
other problems have already been noted.for example,the order granting the fee application contains arithmetical errors that added an extra to the default judgment,which originally was worth only of which was paid less than a month after the judgment was entered 
under karton interpretation of the statutes,sections and would prohibit trial courts from rooting out such errors,requiring them instead to the memoranda of costs filed by default judgment creditors in one uncontested proceeding after another again,we can not believe that the legislature intended such a result.
for all of the foregoing reasons,we conclude that notwithstanding section,section required karton to serve his fee application on dougherty.the trial court thus erred as a matter of law when it concluded that dougherty was not entitled to notice.
apart from the merits,the trial court also stated certain procedural grounds for denying dougherty motion for relief from the order granting karton fee application,but we conclude that those procedural grounds too are unsound.first,the court said that section is not grounds for modifying,amending or revoking an order,but that is not correct.the statute provides that t he court may,upon any terms as may be just,relieve a party or his or her legal representative from a judgment,dismissal,order,or other proceeding taken against him and may,on motion of either party after notice to the other party,set aside any void judgment or order,subds.b,d.second,the court said that adverse rulings are not surprise justifying relief under section.although the statement is correct,it is irrelevant.as a matter of law,dougherty was entitled to notice of karton fee application,but he received none until after the application was granted.consequently,as a matter of law,the order granting the application constituted a surprise for purposes of section.the order was a surprise not because it was adverse but rather because it was issued in a proceeding of which dougherty was entitled to receive notice but received none.
on appeal,karton raises one further procedural point.he contends that dougherty exclusive avenue for relief was a motion for reconsideration under section,rather than a motion for relief under section,and that dougherty motion failed to satisfy section jurisdictional requirements.we conclude that,on the contrary,an order issued in a proceeding of which a party was entitled to receive notice but received none is precisely the kind of surprise to which section was intended to apply.karton cites no case holding to the contrary,and we are aware of none dougherty was not merely asking the trial court to rethink a ruling on which dougherty had already received an opportunity to be heard on the merits.rather,he was seeking relief from an order issued in a proceeding from which he had been wrongly excluded.section purpose is to provide a remedy for such wrongs,among others.
in sum karton was required to serve his fee application on dougherty,and the trial court erred as a matter of law in concluding to the contrary.the court thus abused its discretion when it denied dougherty motion for relief from the order granting karton fee application.horsford board of trustees of california state university th,d legal error constitutes abuse of discretion.the trial court should have granted dougherty motion and vacated its february,order on karton application for a second award of supplemental attorney fees and costs 
ii.the default judgment is void on the face of the record 
dougherty argues that the default judgment is void on the face of the record and therefore should be vacated,because it awards relief that exceeds what was demanded in karton operated first amended complaint.in particular,dougherty argues that t he superior court entered the default judgment against dougherty for the amount of,but t his amount was not in the complaint.we agree.
under section,subdivision a,t he relief granted to the plaintiff,if there is no answer,can not exceed that demanded in the complaint.the courts have consistently held section is an unqualified limit on the jurisdiction of courts entering default judgments.as a general rule,a default judgment is limited to the damages of which the defendant had notice.further,the courts have reaffirmed the language of section is mandatory.therefore,in all default judgments the demand sets a ceiling on recovery.finney gomez th,d,quoting greenup rodman cal d.
because that ceiling is jurisdictional,a default judgment is void when the damages are in excess of the damages specified in the complaint or the statement of damages.yeung soos th,d.a void judgment may be challenged at any time.ibid.
the damages awarded in the default judgment exceeded the damages pled in karton complaint.the complaint sought allegedly unpaid legal fees and costs totaling,plus prejudgment interest pursuant to the retainer agreement at the rate of percent.karton own billing records and calculations based thereon,which he submitted in support of his successful request for entry of default judgment,show that as of may,the total accrued interest was less than on outstanding fees and costs of over,with additional interest continuing to accrue at the rate of per day.but the default judgment awarded karton interest of over as of august,on unpaid fees and costs of just.that can not be correct,according to karton own evidence.adding three months of interest at per day to less than of accrued interest as of may,which was calculated on over of principal,the total accrued interest in late august would have been roughly.thus,interest of over in early august on a smaller principal amount is mathematically impossible.
the record shows how this error occurred.in the declaration to which karton billing records and calculations were attached,karton stated the total of principal plus interest through may,is,principal of plus interest of,as shown by his own evidence and calculations.the daily interest is.inasmuch as i have used the principal sum of without interest for purposes of default,the difference between and is that is the amount of interest that is requested.thus,knowing that he had pleaded only in unpaid fees and costs in the complaint,but apparently believing that the correct figure was over,karton asked the court to give him the difference and call it interest.
the law does not permit that.the operative complaint sought in unpaid fees and costs,so the default judgment could award no more than that amount to karton,regardless of whether he later came to believe the actual figure was higher.the operative complaint sought interest at the rate of percent,so the default judgment could award no more than percent interest to karton.in fact,it awarded interest of as of august.at an annual rate of percent,it would take years or years and days to accrue that much interest on a principal sum of.thus,for the interest award to have been within the amount demanded in the complaint,dougherty would have to have owed karton the full by late november.but karton own records show that by the end of november the total fees and costs karton had billed to dougherty were under,of which dougherty had paid more than.thus,again,it is mathematically impossible for the interest awarded in the default judgment to be within the amount demanded in the complaint.
we note further that karton statement in his declaration that t he daily interest is,which was incorporated in the judgment,shows that the excess amount of the judgment was indeed an award of additional principal rather than some sort of gross miscalculation of interest.calculated at an annual rate of percent and on the basis of a year the daily interest on a principal sum of is.calculated at an annual rate of percent and on the basis of a year,the daily interest on a principal sum of is for a year,it would be.thus,karton calculation of the daily amount of prejudgment interest,which was incorporated in the judgment,was based on the principal sum of,not the that he alleged in the complaint.
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude that the default judgment is void on the face o
