united states surgical corporation appeals from the decision of the united states district court for the central district of california granting judgment of willful infringement of patent in favor of applied medical resources corporation applied,and awarding damages,enhanced damages,attorney fees,and prejudgment interest totaling million.applied med.res.surgical,civ.because the district court did not err in not applying collateral estoppel to the reasonable royalty rate,substantial evidence supports the jury verdict of willful infringement,and the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence regarding a prior litigation,we affirm.
background 
the patent is entitled trocar with floating septum seal and was issued to applied as assignee.the invention relates to surgical devices called trocars,which are used as access ports into the abdomen during laparoscopic surgery.laparoscopic surgery is performed by inflating the abdomen and inserting instruments through trocars.it is important for the trocar to maintain a seal with the instrument otherwise,the insufflation gas used to inflate the abdomen would leak and potentially cause serious complications.
early trocars did not accommodate instruments of different diameters.for example,inserting a relatively small instrument through a large seal would produce a gap between the instrument and the seal,allowing the insufflation gas to leak out from the abdomen.as a result,surgeons were required to either use multiple trocars with differently sized seals or flip top adapters to accommodate differently sized instruments.the invention of the patent eliminates the need for adapters,describing a trocar which maintains a seal around instruments of various sizes,using a floating seal.specifically,claim recites a trocar whose seal includes excess material at its outer portions,which permits the seal orifice to move without allowing gas to leak.patent,ll.claim,which depends from claim,further requires that the excess material be configured in a bellows shape,ll.
the parties to this appeal are no strangers to each other and to this court.applied first sued surgical in the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia in applied i,alleging that surgical sale of its versaport trocars versaport i infringed the patent,as well as two other applied patents.in,a jury found that surgical willfully infringed claims and of the patent as well as two other applied patents,and awarded damages in the form of a reasonable royalty.the court granted judgment for million and entered a permanent injunction enjoining further infringing sales effective may.applied med.res.surgical.we affirmed that judgment on june.applied med.res.surgical.
during the applied i litigation,surgical began redesigning its versaport trocar.surgical completed its redesign shortly after the applied i verdict and began selling the redesigned versaport versaport ii by june,on april,applied filed a second complaint against surgical in the united states district court for the central district of california,alleging that versaport ii infringed the patent applied ii.the parties filed competing motions for summary judgment applied,for infringement of claim of the patent,and surgical,for noninfringement and invalidity of claim.on february,the district court granted applied motion for summary judgment of infringement of claim,and entered a permanent injunction effective november.surgical appealed to this court,and we affirmed the court judgment and injunction on september.applied med.res.surgical.
having resolved liability and validity issues,the district court then held a trial to determine the damages owed to applied for surgical infringing sales of versaport ii,and to determine whether surgical infringement was willful.before trial,surgical moved to establish as a matter of law that the reasonable royalty for infringing sales of versaport ii was,arguing that the reasonable royalty established in applied i for infringing sales of versaport i was binding under principles of collateral estoppel.surgical also sought to preclude introduction of evidence related to the jury finding of willful infringement in applied i.the court denied both motions.the court first held that the jury would make its own independent determination of the reasonable royalty rate in and was thus not bound by the royalty rate in applied emphasis in original.the court also concluded that evidence regarding applied i was relevant to willful infringement and damages because the fact that surgical had infringed the patent once before in its actions in response thereto is probative of its intent to infringe the patent a second time.
the trial commenced on july.at the close of applied,surgical again moved for judgment as a matter of law that the reasonable royalty from applied i for infringing sales of versaport i estopped applied from asserting that a different damages determination should apply in applied ii.the court denied the motion,stating that it had already ruled on that.surgical also moved for judgment as a matter of law of no willful infringement.the court deferred that ruling under federal rule of civil procedure b until after the jury rendered its verdict.
on july,the jury found that surgical infringement was willful and awarded applied damages of.surgical renewed its motions for judgment as a matter of law on the grounds of collateral estoppel and lack of willful infringement.at the same time,applied filed a motion for enhanced damages.the court denied both of surgical motions for judgment as a matter of law on october.on the same day,the court granted applied motion and enhanced compensatory damages by.applied then moved for attorney fees,prejudgment interest,and interest.the court granted that motion on january.
on january,the court entered final judgment in favor of applied in the amount of million.surgical timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
collateral estoppel 
we review a trial court application of collateral estoppel by applying the law of the regional circuit.see bayer ag.biovail,because the application of collateral estoppel is not a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of this court,this court applies the law of the circuit in which the district court sits.the ninth circuit has reviewed the application and of collateral estoppel by trial courts under varying standards,either without deference or for abuse of discretion.compare mcquillion schwarzenegger,cir we review de novo the application of collateral estoppel.united states real prop.located at santa barbara drive,cir application of collateral estoppel is reviewed de novo,with bates union oil of,cir we review a district court decision to apply collateral estoppel for abuse of discretion.garrett city county of san francisco,cir the availability of collateral estoppel is subject to de novo review,but application of the doctrine,if available,is reviewed for abuse of discretion.we need not resolve which standard should apply to the collateral estoppel analysis because even under a more exacting plenary review,the result in this case would be the same.
on appeal,surgical argues that the district court erred in refusing to give collateral estoppel effect to the reasonable royalty rate found by the jury in applied surgical contends that all of the requirements for application of collateral estoppel are satisfied because the reasonable royalty rate was actually litigated in applied i,it was decided by a jury,and the jury determination was essential to the district court final judgment in applied ii.surgical maintains that the issue that the applied i jury decided is the same issue presented in applied ii,and points out that both cases involved the same parties,the same patent,and the same type of product.in addition,according to surgical,the infringement in applied ii is an uninterrupted continuation of the infringement in applied i,and therefore the correct date of a hypothetical negotiation in applied ii is the time period used in applied i,rather than.
applied responds that the court properly denied collateral estoppel effect to the reasonable royalty rate found by the jury in applied i because that determination was for infringing sales of versaport i,and should not limit surgical liability for later infringing sales of versaport ii.applied contends that because the parties independently litigated infringement,willfulness,and damages for versaport i and versaport ii,the products constitute separate infringements and require separate hypothetical negotiations to determine damages.according to applied,the hypothetical negotiation relating to versaport ii involved market conditions that did not exist at the time of the hypothetical negotiation in applied i,increased demand for the patented product and decreased supply resulting from surgical enjoinment from making versaport 
we agree with applied that the district court properly denied collateral estoppel effect to the reasonable royalty rate found by the jury in applied under collateral estoppel,once a court has decided an issue of fact or law necessary to its judgment,that decision may preclude relitigation of the issue in a suit on a different cause of action involving a party to the first case.allen mccurry,d citing montana united states,d see also san remo hotel,city and county of san francisco,d.as we explained in arkla,united states,
collateral estoppel is appropriate only if the issue to be decided is identical to one decided in the first action the issue was actually litigated in the first action resolution of the issue was essential to a final judgment in the first action and the parties had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first action.
id.at citation omitted.here,collateral estoppel is not appropriate because the necessary reasonable royalty determination in applied ii is not identical to that decided in applied 
as an initial matter,the juries in both applied i and applied ii employed a reasonable royalty calculation because actual damages could not be adequately proved.wang,toshiba,citing fromson western litho plate supply.a reasonable royalty is the amount that a person,desiring to manufacture,use,or sell a patented article,as a business proposition,would be willing to pay as a royalty and yet be able to make,use,or sell the patented article,in the market,at a reasonable profit.al nyman sons,citations omitted.the objective of a reasonable royalty calculation is to determine the amount necessary to adequately compensate for an infringement.maxwell baker.
when an established royalty does not exist,a court may determine a reasonable royalty based on hypothetical negotiations between willing licensor and willing licensee.fromson,at.we have held that a reasonable royalty determination for purposes of making a damages evaluation must relate to the time infringement occurred.hanson alpine valley ski area,the key element in setting a reasonable royalty is the necessity for return to the date when the infringement began.quoting panduit stahlin.fibre works,cir see also fromson,at holding that hypothetical royalty negotiations methodology speaks of negotiations as of the time infringement began.
consistent with our precedent,reasonable royalty damages are not calculated in a vacuum without consideration of the infringement being redressed.id.we are required to identify the infringement requiring compensation,and evaluate damages based on a hypothetical negotiation at the time that infringement began,not an earlier one.id.here,the issue of reasonable royalty damages in applied ii is not identical to the issue of reasonable royalty damages in applied i because the infringements requiring compensation began at separate and distinct times.the infringement in applied ii was caused by sales of versaport ii,which began in,whereas the infringement in applied i was caused by sales of versaport i,which began in.because versaport i and versaport ii caused two separate infringements,and each infringement commenced on a different date,it follows that the reasonable royalties may well be different from each other.reasonable royalty damages for the infringement caused by versaport ii are tied to sales of versaport ii beginning in.we can not relate reasonable royalty damages for versaport ii sales back to a separate and past infringement caused by versaport i sales beginning in.indeed,the issue of reasonable royalty damages for versaport ii sales could not have been and was not considered,much less decided,in applied i because that product had not yet been determined to infringe.we conclude that the damages issues in applied i and applied ii are not identical,and therefore the jury award of reasonable royalty damages for infringing sales of versaport i in applied i does not preclude another jury evaluation of reasonable royalty damages for infringing sales of versaport ii at a different time in applied ii.
further,there is no legal or factual basis for viewing the separate infringements caused by sales of versaport i and versaport ii as the same infringement.surgical has asserted that versaport ii is a different product from the versaport i trocar the product that was at issue in applied i is vastly different than the new versaport ii at issue in this case.emphasis added.surgical has also agreed that versaport ii involved different infringement issues than versaport i because the seals were different f rom this thorough and careful process emerged an entirely different,trocar,with a completely new and improved seal system.emphases added.having conceded that versaport i and versaport ii were different infringements,surgical attempt to conflate the two products for purposes of damages fails.because the determination of reasonable royalty damages is tied to the infringement being redressed,a separate infringement beginning at a different time requires a separate evaluation of reasonable royalty damages.to argue otherwise,surgical would have to concede that it has willfully violated the permanent injunction in applied 
surgical argues that its infringement of the patent has been continuous and uninterrupted since,and therefore that the damages issue in applied ii was decided in applied surgical also contends that there can be no genuine dispute that the issues in applied i and applied ii were the same because the final judgment in applied i had stated that applied is entitled to a seven percent royalty on the sales of each surgical product which infringed the patent.we disagree.that the infringement activity caused by versaport i and versaport ii may appear to be continuous in time does not mean that it is a continuous infringement in law.the sales of versaport ii constituted a separate and distinct infringement from sales of versaport i,and applied is entitled to prosecute and recover damages for each infringement under the statute.indeed,simply because the same company sold two different products which infringed a patent does not prevent the patentee from litigating and collecting separate damages for each infringement.further,we reject surgical contention that the district court denial of collateral estoppel for purposes of damages is inconsistent with its grant of collateral estoppel for purposes of validity.a conclusion in applied i that the patent is not invalid properly estops surgical from making the same arguments in applied ii.the issue is the same.that the validity of the patent was adjudicated in applied i does not mean,however,that the reasonable royalty rate for infringing sales of versaport ii was also decided in applied i.the damages issues are not the same.
surgical asserts that even if there were a lack of total identity of issues between applied i and applied ii,the issues must be deemed identical for collateral estoppel purposes because,in both litigations,there was substantial overlap in the evidence,application of the same rule of law,similar matters embraced in preparation,and closely related claims involving the same patent,the same parties,and the same type of product.that argument misses the point.we recognize that there may be instances,which we do not address here,in which two products,even if not identical,may present the same damages analysis.that is not the case here.the two infringements caused by versa
