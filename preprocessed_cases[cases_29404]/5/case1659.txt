appellant practice management information corporation pmic appealed the judgment entered in favor of respondent lorena alamo following a jury trial on alamo causes of action for pregnancy discrimination and retaliation in violation of the california fair employment and housing act,et.feha,and wrongful termination in violation of public policy.among other arguments,pmic contended that the trial court erred in instructing the jury pursuant to former caci instruction,and that alamo had to prove her leave was a motivating reason for her discharge,and refusing to instruct the jury pursuant to baji instruction that pmic could avoid liability under a or defense by proving it would have made the same discharge decision in the absence of a discriminatory or retaliatory motive.we initially affirmed the judgment,and pmic filed a petition for review with the supreme court.after granting the petition for review and deciding a related issue in harris city of santa monica cal th harris,the supreme court directed this court to vacate our decision and to reconsider the cause in light of its decision in harris.
in accordance with harris,we now hold that the trial court prejudicially erred in instructing the jury with the former versions of caci,and because the proper standard of causation in a feha discrimination or retaliation claim is not a motivating reason,as used in the caci instructions,but rather a substantial motivating reason,as set forth in harris.we further hold that pmic was not entitled to an instruction on the or defense because it failed to plead that defense or any other affirmative defense alleging that it had a legitimate,or reason for its discharge decision in its answer.we accordingly reverse the judgment and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual background and procedural history 
civil action 
following the termination of her employment,alamo filed a civil action against her former employer,pmic.in her complaint,alamo alleged three causes of action for pregnancy discrimination in violation of the feha and the california constitution,wrongful termination in violation of public policy,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.after the trial court partially granted and partially denied pmic motion for summary adjudication,the case was tried to a jury on alamo statutory feha claim and common law wrongful discharge claim.
ii.trial evidence 
pmic is a small company that publishes medical coding and compliance books.alamo began her employment with pmic in july where she worked as a clerk in the collections department.she was later promoted to the position of lead collections clerk and was primarily responsible for billing and collecting payments from pmic largest customers.alamo received regular pay raises during her employment,and as of january,her base rate of pay was per hour.alamo direct supervisor was michelle cuevas,the operations manager.cuevas in turn reported to gregory trupiano,pmic executive vice president,and to james davis,pmic founder and president.
on january,alamo began a leave of absence.her baby was born approximately two weeks later on january.on february,alamo requested an additional six weeks of maternity leave to bond with her baby,which was granted by pmic.alamo was scheduled to return to work on april.
while alamo was on leave from pmic,marcell moran was hired on a temporary basis to fill alamo position.alamo had recommended that moran fill in for her during her leave because moran previously had worked at pmic and remained good friends with alamo.moran began working in alamo position in february and was paid per hour for her work.at that time,moran was also pregnant with a due date in september.moran was planning on moving out of the los angeles area before the birth of her baby and only intended to work at pmic on a temporary basis while alamo was on leave.
prior to alamo leave of absence,cuevas had some concerns about alamo performance,but did not consider any of these problems to be serious enough to warrant formal discipline.cuevas testified that there were times when alamo failed to timely contact customers about invoices that were past due and cuevas had to remind alamo to follow up on those accounts.cuevas also testified that alamo at times had poor working relationships with other employees,some of whom complained that alamo treated them rudely.in addition to orally counseling alamo about improving her interpersonal skills,cuevas sent an email to her subordinates in january reminding them to treat all pmic employees in a professional manner.however,cuevas never felt that it was necessary to issue alamo any written warnings about her performance prior to her leave.
during alamo leave of absence,cuevas became aware of other performance problems that caused her more concern.cuevas specifically testified that she learned alamo had not taken any action on certain customer accounts with large unpaid invoices even though cuevas had requested that alamo resolve those accounts before her leave.cuevas also testified that alamo had told her that pmic could not collect on two outstanding accounts because the customers were no longer in business,which cuevas later learned was untrue.according to cuevas,pmic had to take a loss on some of alamo accounts because too much time had passed to collect payment from the customer.cuevas intended to discuss these performance issues with alamo once she returned from her leave in april.to that end,cuevas advised alamo not to return to work until april,when cuevas would be back in the office from vacation.
alamo denied that she had any performance problems at pmic.she testified that the customer accounts that pmic was claiming alamo had neglected were actually assigned to cuevas and that cuevas merely had asked alamo to assist her by following up on certain unpaid invoices,which alamo did.alamo also testified that she was never counseled by cuevas,either orally or in writing,about her interpersonal skills in working with other employees.
in,approximately one week before her scheduled return date,alamo requested and received permission from trupiano to come into the office to have lunch with a coworker,maria alcocer.alamo did not ask cuevas for permission to visit the office at that time because it was her understanding that cuevas was on vacation.on april,alamo had lunch with alcocer in pmic break room.as alamo was leaving,she had a verbal altercation with moran,the person filling in for her,in the hallway outside the office.the argument began because moran wanted to know why alamo had not given moran her new cell phone number.according to moran,alamo said that she was having a lot of personal problems and did not want to talk to anyone.alamo also said that she felt moran was being mean to their coworker,alcocer.according to alamo,moran initiated the argument,yelled at her in an angry manner,and then told alamo,well,that good,you going to get fired anyways.later that day,alamo contacted both trupiano and cuevas by telephone and asked them about moran statement that alamo was going to be fired.cuevas told alamo that they would discuss the matter when alamo returned to work the following week.
shortly after alamo left the office,moran had a separate verbal altercation with alcocer.alcocer and moran had been having a personality conflict for several months that escalated into an argument that day.as described by alcocer,moran approached her desk and began yelling at her because alcocer recently had complained to cuevas that moran was being rude to her.moran told alcocer that she should talk to moran directly about any problems between them instead of complaining to cuevas.after the argument with moran,alcocer decided to take a leave of absence because she felt that moran and another employee named elaine rodriguez were being verbally abusive to her.alcocer began her leave on april,and she did not return to work until four months later in august.
on april,alamo returned to work from her maternity leave.after working for about three hours,alamo was called into a meeting with cuevas and trupiano and told that her employment was being terminated.according to alamo,cuevas said during the meeting that she felt alamo was not doing her job and specifically mentioned one unpaid account.there was no mention of alamo recent visit to the office for lunch with alcocer or to her verbal altercation with moran.there was also no mention of alamo pregnancy or maternity leave.at the end of the meeting,cuevas explained that if alamo signed a release waiving any claims she might have against pmic,cuevas would be able to provide alamo with a positive employment reference.alamo,however,refused to sign the release.
cuevas testified that,as of april,she believed pmic should terminate the employment of both alamo and moran,and she made that recommendation to her superiors,trupiano and davis.cuevas explained that she did not feel that alamo prior performance problems,standing alone,were serious enough to warrant termination.however,when alamo history of poor performance was considered with her recent act of insubordination in visiting the office without cuevas permission and then having a verbal altercation with a coworker,cuevas felt that termination was warranted.cuevas admitted that she did not talk to alamo about what happened during the altercation before deciding that alamo should be discharged.cuevas further admitted that alamo had received permission to visit the office from trupiano,but testified that alamo nevertheless was insubordinate in ignoring cuevas instruction that alamo not return to work until the following week.cuevas also stated that she believed alamo knew that cuevas would not have allowed her to come into the office when cuevas was not there given the ongoing conflict between alcocer and moran.cuevas testified that her recommendation to discharge alamo had nothing to do with her pregnancy or maternity leave,but rather was based solely on alamo performance and insubordination issues.
trupiano and davis were both involved in the final decision to terminate alamo employment.trupiano testified that he agreed with cuevas that alamo should be discharged based on her poor work performance and insubordination,but decided to defer to davis as to whether moran also should be discharged given that she had no other disciplinary issues.davis testified that he made the decision to terminate alamo employment based solely on her performance issues in neglecting her assigned customer accounts,her act of insubordination in visiting the office without cuevas permission,and her misconduct in engaging in a verbal altercation with a coworker.davis testified that he decided not to discharge moran for her involvement in the altercation because it was her first incident of inappropriate conduct.at trial,both davis and trupiano denied that alamo was terminated for any reason related to her pregnancy or maternity leave.following alamo discharge,pmic decided to provide her with one month of severance pay not conditioned upon the signing of any release.
iii.jury verdict and attorney fees award 
at the conclusion of the trial,the jury returned a general verdict in favor of alamo and awarded her damages in the amount of.with respect to alamo request for punitive damages,however,the jury found that she failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that pmic acted with malice,oppression,or fraud.following the verdict,the trial court granted alamo motion for attorney fees and costs as the prevailing plaintiff under the feha and awarded her counsel attorney fees in the amount of.
iv.pmic appeal 
pmic filed a timely notice of appeal.on september,we affirmed the judgment in favor of alamo.while recognizing that related instructional issues were pending before the supreme court in harris that could inform this matter,we initially concluded that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury on the standard of causation in alamo claims,and in refusing to instruct the jury on the or defense.on january,the supreme court granted pmic petition for review and deferred further action in the matter pending disposition of the related issues in harris.on may,following its decision in harris,the supreme court transferred the matter to this court with directions to vacate our decision and to reconsider the cause in light of the harris decision.
discussion 
pmic raises two instructional error arguments on appeal.first,pmic argues that the trial court prejudicially erred in instructing the jury pursuant to former caci,and that alamo had to prove her pregnancy or leave was a motivating reason for her discharge,rather than the but for cause of her discharge.second,pmic asserts that the trial court prejudicially erred in refusing to instruct the jury pursuant to baji that pmic could avoid liability under a defense by proving it would have made the same discharge decision even in the absence of any discriminatory or retaliatory motive.
relevant jury instructions 
the trial court instructed the jury on the essential elements of alamo causes of action with former versions of caci wrongful discharge in violation of public policy,caci disparate treatment under feha,caci retaliation under feha,and caci failure to prevent discrimination or retaliation under feha.with respect to caci,and,the trial court instructed the jury that alamo had to prove,among other elements,that her pregnancy or taking of a leave was a motivating reason or a motivating factor for her discharge.with respect to caci,the trial court instructed the jury that alamo had to prove,among other elements,that she was subjected to discrimination or retaliation because she took a leave.the trial court also instructed the jury on the definition of a motivating reason with caci,stating that a motivating reason is a reason that contributed to the decision to take certain actions even though other reasons also would have contributed to the decision.
the trial court refused pmic request that caci,and be modified to state that alamo must prove her pregnancy or taking of a leave was a substantial motivating reason,as opposed to a motivating reason,for her discharge.the trial court also refused pmic request that caci definition of a motivating reason be modified to state that if the same decision would have been made in the absence of any discriminatory or retaliatory motive,then discrimination or retaliation was not a substantial motivating reason for the decision.finally,the trial court refused pmic request that the jury be instructed on the or defense with baji,which states,in pertinent part if you find that the employer action,which is the subject of plaintiff claim,was actually motivated by both discriminatory and reasons,the employer is not liable if it can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that its legitimate reason,standing alone,would have induced it to make the same decision.

iii.the harris decision 
like alamo,the plaintiff in harris filed suit against her former employer,the city of santa monica the city,for pregnancy discrimination in violation of the feha after the city terminated her employment.harris,supra,cal th at.in its answer to the plaintiff complaint,the city denied her allegations and asserted as an affirmative defense that it had legitimate,reasons to discharge her as an,probationary employee.id.at.at trial,the city asked that the jury be instructed on the defense with baji.the trial court refused to give the requested instruction,and instead instructed the jury pursuant to former caci that the plaintiff had to prove her pregnancy was a motivating for the discharge.ibid.by a special verdict,the jury found that the plaintiff pregnancy was a motivating reason for the city decision to discharge her and awarded her damages.ibid.the court of appeal reversed the judgment and remanded for a new trial on the ground that the requested instruction in baji was an accurate statement of california law and the refusal to give the instruction was prejudicial error.the supreme court granted the plaintiff petition for review.id.at.
in harris,the supreme court described the central question before it as follows in an employment discrimination action brought under the feha,w hat is the trier of fact to do when it finds that a mix of discriminatory and legitimate reasons motivated the employer decision harris,supra,cal th at.in answer to that question,the supreme court held that,w hen a plaintiff has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that discrimination was a substantial factor motivating his or her termination,the employer is entitled to demonstrate that legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons would have led it to make the same decision at the time.if the employer proves by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision for lawful reasons,then the plaintiff can not be awarded damages,backpay,or an order of reinstatement.however,where appropriate,the plaintiff may be entitled to declaratory or injunctive relief.the plaintiff also may be eligible for an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs id.at.because the jury in harris was not properly instructed on these legal principles,the supreme court affirmed the court of appeal judgment overturning the jury damages verdict and remanded the matter for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.id.at.
in addressing the specific instructional error issues that were raised in harris,the supreme court reached three legal conclusions that guide our resolution of this appeal.first,the court concluded that the feha prohibition on discrimination in employment because of a person protected characteristic,subd.a means that a plaintiff alleging unlawful discrimination must show that discrimination was a substantial motivating factor,rather than simply a motivating factor,in the disputed employment decision.harris,supra,cal th at.because the prohibition on discrimination is not limited to instances where discrimination is a but for cause of the employment decision,however,the plaintiff is not required to prove but for causation to establish liability under the feha.id.at.the jury in harris erroneously was instructed under former caci to determine whether discrimination was a motivating for the plaintiff termination,and instead should have been instructed to determine whether discrimination was a substantial motivating for the termination decision.id.at.
second,the supreme court concluded that where the plaintiff has proven that discrimination on the basis of a protected characteristic was a substantial motivating factor in the adverse employment action,a showing by the employer that it would have made the same decision in the absence of discrimination is not a complete defense to liability.harris,supra,cal th at.however,a showing by the employer may preclude an award of reinstatement,backpay,or damages and limit the plaintiff available remedies to declaratory or injunctive relief,and where appropriate,an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs.id.at.accordingly,when supported by the evidence,a jury in a case alleging unlawful termination should be instructed that it must find the employer action was substantially motivated by discrimination before the burden shifts to the employer to make a showing,and that a showing precludes an award of reinstatement,backpay,or damages.id.at.
third,the supreme court concluded that b ecause the burden is on a defendant to make a showing,it should plead this defense in its answer.harris,supra,cal th at.in other words,if an employer wishes to assert the defense,it should plead that if it is found that its actions were motivated by both discriminatory and nondiscriminatory reasons,the nondiscriminatory reasons alone would have induced it to make the same decision.ibid.in harris,the city did not plead the defense in its answer to the complaint.however,the city did plead that a ny alleged adverse employment actions of which plaintiff complains were not based on plaintiff gender sex,pregnancy or any other alleged discriminatory practice,but instead were based on one or more legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons.nor were any of the employment actions of defendant taken under pretext.ibid.the court reasoned that this asserted defense was sufficient to put the plaintiff on notice that the city intended to defend on the basis that it had not discriminated against her and had a legitimate reason for discharging her,and was consistent with the city defense at trial.ibid.under such circumstances,the court determined that the fact that the city did not plead a defense did not adversely affect the plaintiff substantial rights,and the omission did not bar the trial court from giving a instruction.ibid.
iv.the trial court erred,in part,in instructing the jury 
a.the trial court erred in instructing the jury with former caci,and.
pmic contends that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the standard of causation in a claim because the caci instructions given to the jury did not express the but for standard of causation required under the feha.pmic argues that an employee alleging a discriminatory or retaliatory discharge in violation of the feha must prove his or her protected status or activity was the but for cause of the discharge rather than a motivating reason for the discharge.pmic also asserts that the failure to properly instruct the jury on the standard of causation constitutes reversible error.
the supreme court in harris rejected the specific causation argument that pmic is raising here.as discussed,the court in harris held that the plaintiff in an employment discrimination action arising under the feha is not required to prove but for causation to establish liability,but rather must show by a preponderance of the evidence that discrimination was a substantial motivating factor in the adverse employment decision.harris,supra,cal th at.in rejecting a but for standard of causation,the supreme court reasoned that,g iven the feha statement of its purposes and the harms it sought to address,we can not ascribe to the legislature an intent to deem lawful any discriminatory conduct that is not the but for cause of an adverse employment action against a particular individual.id.at.as the court further observed,discrimination can be serious,consequential,and even by itself determinative of an employment decision without also being a but for cause.id.at.thus,contrary to pmic primary argument on appeal,the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on a but for standard of causation for alamo claims.
in light of the holding in harris,however,we conclude that the trial court did err in instructing the jury with the former versions of caci,and because the instructions required alamo to prove that her pregnancy or leave was a motivating reason for her discharge,rather th
