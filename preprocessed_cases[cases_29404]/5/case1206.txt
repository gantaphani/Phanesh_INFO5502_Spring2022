it is difficult to imagine that the barbie doll,so perfect in her sculpture and presentation,and so comfortable in every setting,from california girl to chief executive officer barbie,could spawn such acrimonious litigation and such egregious conduct on the part of her challenger.in her wildest dreams,barbie could not have imagined herself in the middle of rule proceedings.but the intersection of copyrights on barbie sculptures and the scope of rule is precisely what defines this case.
james hicks appeals from a district court order requiring him,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,to pay mattel,in attorneys fees that it incurred in defending against what the district court determined to be a frivolous action.hicks brought suit on behalf of harry christian,claiming that mattel barbie dolls infringed christian claudene doll sculpture copyright.in its sanctions orders,the district court found that hicks should have discovered prior to commencing the civil action that mattel dolls could not have infringed christian copyright because,among other things,the mattel dolls had been created well prior to the claudene doll and the mattel dolls had clearly visible copyright notices on their heads.after determining that hicks had behaved boorishly during discovery and had a lengthy rap sheet of prior litigation misconduct,the district court imposed sanctions.
we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the complaint filed by hicks was frivolous under rule.in parsing the language of the district court sanctions orders,however,we can not determine with any degree of certainty whether the district court grounded its rule decision on hicks misconduct that occurred outside the pleadings,such as in oral argument,at a meeting of counsel,and at a key deposition.this is an important distinction because rule sanctions are limited to misconduct regarding signed pleadings,motions,and other filings.consequently,we vacate the district court orders and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.in so doing,we do not condone hicks conduct or suggest that the district court did not have a firm basis for awarding sanctions.indeed,the district court undertook a careful and exhaustive examination of the facts and the legal underpinnings of the copyright challenge.rather,the remand is to assure that any rule sanctions are grounded in conduct covered by rule and to ensure adequate findings for the sizeable fee award.
background 
as context for examining the district court determination that the underlying copyright action was frivolous,we begin by discussing the long history of litigation between mattel and hicks past and current clients harry christian christian daughter,claudene and the collegiate doll company cdc,claudene proprietorship.
prior litigation between mattel and cdc 
mattel is a toy company that is perhaps best recognized as the manufacturer of the barbie doll.since barbie creation in,mattel has outfitted her in fashions and accessories that have evolved over time.in perhaps the most classic embodiment,barbie is depicted as a doll with long blonde hair and blue eyes.mattel has sought to protect its intellectual property by registering various copyrights,including copyrights protecting the doll head sculpture.mattel has vigorously litigated against putative infringers.
in,claudene christian,then an undergraduate student at the university of southern california usc,decided to create and market a collegiate cheerleader doll.the doll,which the parties refer to throughout their papers as claudene,had blonde hair and blue eyes and was outfitted to resemble a usc cheerleader.
mattel soon learned about the claudene doll.after concluding that it infringed certain barbie copyrights,mattel brought an administrative action before the united states customs service in in which it alleged that the claudene doll,manufactured abroad,had pirated the head sculpture of the teen talk and superstar barbies.the customs service ruled in cdc favor and subsequently released a shipment of claudene dolls undaunted,mattel commenced a federal court action in in which it once again alleged that cdc infringed various of mattel copyrights.at the time,claudene christian was president of cdc and harry christian was listed as of the company and chief financial officer.cdc retained hicks as its counsel.after the court dismissed cdc multiple counterclaims,the case was settled.mattel released cdc from any copyright infringement liability in exchange for,among other things,a stipulation that mattel was free to challenge cdc alleged copyright of the claudene doll should cdc or any successor in interest challenge mattel right to market its barbie dolls.
ii.the present action 
seizing on a loophole in the parties settlement agreement,within weeks of the agreement,harry christian,who was not a signatory to the agreement,retained hicks as his counsel and filed a federal court action against mattel.in the complaint,which hicks signed,christian alleged that mattel obtained a copy of the copyrighted claudene doll in,the year of its creation and then infringed its overall appearance,including its face paint,by developing a new barbie line called cool blue that was substantially similar to claudene.christian sought damages in the amount of billion and various forms of injunctive relief.in an apparent effort to demonstrate that the action was not a sham,claudene christian and cdc were also named as defendants.subsequently,hicks alleged in a letter to mattel counsel that an additional doll called virginia tech university barbie also infringed the claudene doll copyright.hicks,however,never amended the complaint to plead allegations about virginia tech barbie.
two months after the complaint was filed,mattel moved for summary judgment.in support of its motion,mattel proffered evidence that the cool blue barbie doll contained a copyright notice on the back of its head,indicating that it predated claudene head sculpture copyright by approximately six years mattel therefore argued that cool blue barbie could not as a matter of law infringe claudene head sculpture copyright.mattel similarly contended that the copyright on the virginia tech barbie head sculpture also significantly predated the purported copyright on the claudene head sculpture.virginia tech barbie and other barbie dolls contained a head sculpture that was copyrighted in and originally appeared on superstar barbie.
at a counsel meeting required by a local rule,mattel counsel attempted to convince hicks that his complaint was frivolous.during the videotaped meeting,they presented hicks with copies of various barbie dolls that not only had been created prior to the date of claudene creation,but also had copyright designations on their heads that claudene creation.additionally,mattel counsel noted that the face paint on some of the barbie dolls was virtually identical to that used on claudene.hicks declined mattel invitation to inspect the dolls and,later during the meeting,hurled them in disgust from a conference table.
having been unsuccessful in convincing hicks to dismiss christian action voluntarily,mattel served hicks with a motion for rule sanctions.in its motion papers,mattel argued,among other things,that hicks had signed and filed a frivolous complaint based on a legally meritless theory that mattel head sculptures infringed claudene copyright.hicks declined to withdraw the complaint during the safe harbor period provided by rule,and mattel filed its motion.
seemingly unfazed by mattel rule motion,hicks proceeded with the litigation and filed a motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure f to obtain additional discovery.in particular,he sought information regarding the face painting on certain barbie dolls and the face sculpture combinations used by mattel after.the district court summarily denied the motion.it later noted,in the context of its summary judgment order,that it is unclear what christian is requesting when he seeks access to barbies.
hicks then began filing additional papers that were characterized by frequency and volume.following official completion of the summary judgment briefing schedule,hicks filed what was styled as a supplemental opposition.in those papers,christian asserted for the first time that the head sculpture of mattel ceo barbie which was created in infringed christian copyright in the claudene doll.he did not,however,move for leave to amend the complaint.
hicks later filed additional papers alleging that several additional barbie dolls infringed the claudene sculpture.as with ceo barbie,no motion for leave to amend the complaint was filed.then,following oral argument,hicks filed a copy of a supplemental registration of claudene that the united states copyright office had issued five days prior to the argument.the supplemental registration clarified that the nature of the original claudene copyright was intended to be the sculpture and the painted face and that the nature of authorship covered both artwork and sculpture.
iii.the district court orders 
the district court granted mattel motions for summary judgment and rule sanctions.the court ruled that mattel did not infringe the claudene copyright because it could not possibly have accessed the claudene doll at the time it created the head sculptures of the cool blue copyrighted in and virginia tech copyrighted in barbies.the court also rejected christian theory that the mattel dolls had infringed the totality of claudene appearance,including its face paint,because the copyright is limited in scope and extends only to sculptures and not artwork alternatively,the court found that mattel had been using face paint on dolls produced before the claudene doll was created in,such as colonial barbie and pioneer barbie,and therefore could not have infringed the claudene doll even if the claudene copyright protected artwork.finally,the court found that mattel,as owner of various barbie head sculpture copyrights,had the exclusive right to prepare derivative works of its own copyrighted works.see.thus,mattel has the right to paint and its own copyrighted sculptures.
in adjudicating the summary judgment motion,the district court did not consider any of christian supplemental summary judgment filings.it noted that the papers not only exceeded the permissible page limits,but also failed to adhere to local rule,which established various type font requirements.
as for mattel rule motion,the district court found that hicks had filed a meritless claim against defendant mattel.a reasonable investigation by hicks would have revealed that there was no factual foundation for christian copyright claim.indeed,the district court noted that hicks needed to do little more than examine the back of the heads of the barbie dolls he claims were infringing,because such a perfunctory inquiry would have revealed the copyright notices on the cool blue and virginia tech barbie doll heads.
additionally,the district court made other findings regarding hicks misconduct in litigating against mattel,all of which demonstrated that his conduct fell below the standards of attorneys practicing in the central district of california.the district court singled out the following conduct 
sanctions imposed by the district court against hicks in a related action against mattel for failing,among other things,to file a memorandum of law in support of papers styled as a motion to dismiss and failing to appear at oral argument 
hicks behavior during the early meeting of counsel,in which he toss ed barbie dolls off a table 
hicks interruption of christian deposition after christian made a damaging admission that a barbie doll allegedly infringed the later created claudene doll head when asked whether the pioneer barbie doll infringed claudene,christian stated,i think so b ecause it got the look at that juncture,hicks requested an immediate recess,during which he lambasted his client in plain view of mattel attorneys and the video camera.
hicks misrepresentations during oral argument on mattel summary judgment motion about the number of dolls alleged in the complaint to be infringing and whether he had ever reviewed a particular barbie catalogue when a videotape presented to the district court by mattel demonstrated that hicks had reviewed it during a deposition 
hicks misstatement of law in a summary judgment opposition brief about the circuit holdings regarding joint authorship of copyrightable works.
after mattel submitted a general description of the fees that it incurred in defending against christian action,the court requested mattel to submit a more specific itemization and description of work performed by its attorneys.mattel complied.
the district court awarded mattel in attorneys fees.at the outset of its order,the court summarized the findings in its earlier order,namely that it had predicated its rule decision on hicks filing a frivolous complaint and further found that he had behaved boorishly,misrepresented the facts and misstated the law.in discussing rule purpose of deterring such conduct,the district court made further findings about hicks behavior during prior of which were completely unrelated to this case.the prior litigation referenced by the district court included the following 
the district court earlier award of attorneys fees to mattel in a related action,and certain behavior by hicks during the copyright infringement action that mattel had filed against cdc 
hicks failure to comply with a briefing schedule established by the first circuit in an unrelated action in and 
hicks filing of conclusory opposition papers in an unrelated action in the southern district of new york in response to a summary judgment motion in.
the district court next considered various arguments that hicks had advanced in opposition to mattel fee application.hicks first contended,without much elaboration,that a fee award would have a ruinous effect on his finances and ability to practice law the district court held,however,that repeated reprimands and sanctions imposed in prior litigations clearly have not had the desired deterrent effect on his behavior,and it concluded that hicks would not be punished sufficiently if the court were to impose mere sanctions.hicks also argued somewhat ironically that mattel fees request was excessive in light of how simplistic it should have been to defend against christian action.the district court disagreed,reasoning that like the court in brandt schal,cir,the judiciary has little sympathy for the litigant who fires a big gun,and when the adversary returns fire,complains because he was firing blanks.
having rejected hicks reasons for eschewing a fees award,the district court made the following observations and findings 
the court has considered whether an award of monetary sanctions less than the fees actually incurred would represent an appropriate sanction.the court has concluded that it would not.there is no dispute that hicks was directly responsible for filing and pursuing this frivolous suit.nor is there any dispute that the fees sought were actually incurred and paid.moreover,the court is satisfied from the documentation provided by mattel counsel that the fees incurred were reasonable.while recognizing the significant burden this award imposes,the court has concluded that in light of hicks failure to respond to lesser sanctions and his continuing disregard for the most basic rules governing an attorney professional conduct,the costs of his unacceptable behavior should fall squarely on him.finally,while the court may reimburse an adverse party for expenses incurred in disposing of frivolous litigation,it can never compensate the judicial system for the time spent to dispose of an action that should never have been brought.the court can only hope that a sanction of this size will,at last,put a stop to hicks continuing pattern of abuse.
emphasis added.
the court is satisfied that the other attorneys fees mattel has claimed are both reasonable and proximately caused by hicks pursuit of this frivolous action t he court grants mattel its attorneys fees in the amount of.

discussion 
standards of review 
the standard of review is particularly important here with reference to the district court summary judgment determination in favor of mattel.that order has not been appealed and christian is not a party to this appeal.hicks argues that we should review the summary judgment order to determine whether there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether mattel infringed claudene.while such a determination could be instructive in determining whether a complaint was frivolous when filed because a plaintiff who survives a summary judgment motion would necessarily have demonstrated that there are triable,potentially meritorious issues,we review the district court factual findings and legal conclusions under a far more deferential standard than the traditional de novo review of a summary judgment order.we review the district court decision to impose rule,if they are warranted,the reasonableness of the actual amount abuse of discretion.cooter gell hartmarx,d.in conducting our review of the district court factual findings in support of the sanctions,we would be justified in concluding that the court had abused its discretion in making the findings only if they were clearly erroneous.id.at.the district court legal findings must be affirmed unless they result from a materially incorrect view of the relevant law.id.at.
ii.imposition of rule sanctions 
the district court found that hicks filed a meritless claim against defendant mattel.a reasonable investigation by hicks would have revealed that there was no factual foundation for plaintiff copyright claim.hicks challenges these findings,arguing that the issues were more complex than the district court recognized.before considering this operative issue,we first consider rule principles that guide our review.
general rule principles 
filing a complaint in federal court is no trifling undertaking.an attorney signature on a complaint is tantamount to a warranty that the complaint is well grounded in fact and existing law or proposes a good faith extension of the existing law and that it is not filed for an improper purpose.
rule provides in pertinent part 
a signature.every pleading,written motion,and other paper shall be signed by at least one attorney of record in the attorney individual name 
b representations to court.by presenting to the court whether by signing,filing,submitting,or later advocating a pleading,written motion,or other paper,an attorney or unrepresented party is certifying to the best of the person knowledge,information,and belief,formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances 
the claims,defenses,and other legal contentions therein are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for the extension,modification,or reversal of existing law or the establishment of new law 
the allegations and other factual contentions have evidentiary support or,if specifically so identified,are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.
the attorney has a duty prior to filing a complaint not only to conduct a reasonable factual investigation,but also to perform adequate legal research that confirms whether the theoretical underpinnings of the complaint are warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for an extension,modification or reversal of existing law.golden eagle distrib.burroughs,cir.one of the fundamental purposes of rule is to reduce frivolous claims,defenses or motions and to deter costly meritless maneuvers,thereby avoid ing delay and unnecessary expense in litigation.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.nonetheless,a finding of significant delay or expense is not required under rule.where,as here,the complaint is the primary focus of rule proceedings,a district court must conduct a inquiry to determine whether the complaint is legally or factually baseless from an objective perspective,and if the attorney has conducted a reasonable and competent inquiry before signing and filing it.buster greisen,cir.
b.the district court findings regarding the meritless claim 
did hicks have an adequate legal or factual basis for filing the complaint 
hicks filed a single claim of copyright infringement against mattel.the complaint charges that the cool blue barbie infringed the copyright in the claudene doll head.in addition,in a subsequent letter to mattel counsel,he claimed that virginia tech barbie also infringed claudene.hicks can not seriously dispute the district court conclusions that,assuming the applicability of the doctrine of prior creation,christian complaint was legally and factually frivolous indeed,as a matter of copyright law,it is well established that a work can not infringe a one.see grubb kms patriots,cir noting that prior creation renders any conclusion of access or inference of copying illogical.
copyright infringement requires proof that a plaintiff owns a valid copyright in the work and that the defendant copied the work.feist pub n,rural.serv,d.proof of copying often revolves around whether the defendant had sufficient access to copy the work.access is only a theoretical issue in this case,however.by simple logic,it is impossible to copy something that does not exist.thus,if mattel created its doll sculptures before cdc created claudene in,it is factually and legally impossible for mattel to be an infringer.
the record of creation is telling and conclusive.the cool blue barbie doll uses the neptune daughter doll head which was created in,some six years before the claudene doll.the virginia tech barbie doll uses the superstar sculpture which mattel created in.the superstar doll was the subject of the federal court litigation,and hicks should have been well aware of the prior creation,not to mention that the copyright notice including date of creation appears prominently on the back of the dolls heads.
recognizing the futility of attacking prior creation,hicks argues that the paint on the claudene doll face features a light makeup that is distinctive and that the two barbie dolls thus infringe claudene overall appearance and presentation.this argument fails because,among other things,mattel used the light face paint on the pioneer barbie,which was created two years before the claudene doll,thus defeating once again any claim of copying it also bears noting that mattel has been repainting various doll heads for decades.under hicks theory,cdc use of an infringing doll head coupled with new face paint would result in liability for mattel repainting of its barbie doll sculptures.neither common sense nor copyright law countenance such a result,even if the claudene doll were deemed a derivative work.see entm t research group,genesis creative group,cir holding that owners of copyrighted works have broad latitude to copyright derivatives thereof if they have adequate originality 
in the face of facts and law clearly against his client,hicks sought to resurrect the copyright claim by deluging the district court with supplemental filings,including entirely new claims regarding a different assortment of barbie dolls and dolls.the dolls included,for example,the ceo doll,which used the neptune daughter head with a modified mouth.
the district court did not consider any of hicks supplemental filings,noting that hicks failed to comply with local rules regarding page limitations and typefaces.given the chameleon nature of the claims and hicks from the theory back to the theory,the district court was justified in putting an end to hicks serial filings.the district court has considerable latitude in managing the parties motion practice and enforcing local rules that place parameters on briefing.we can not say that the court abused its discretion by declining to consider hicks multitudinous efforts to circumvent the court local rules and to expand the scope of an already frivolous suit.at some point,enough is enough.see ross,cir noting that the process of evaluating a summary judgment motion would be flouted if requests for more time,discovery,or the introduction of supplemental affidavits had to be considered even if requested well after the deadline set for the introduction of all information needed to make a ruling has passed.
consequently,in the face of undisputed evidence concerning the of the barbie dolls,
