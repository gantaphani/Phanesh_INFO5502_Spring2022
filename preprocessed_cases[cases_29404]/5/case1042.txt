we must decide whether environmental organizations are prevailing parties within the meaning of the equal access to justice act when,before judgment,the bureau of land management withdraws its challenged decision to conduct a timber sale.
plaintiffs klamath siskiyou wildlands center,cascadia wildlands project,and umpqua watersheds klamath sued the bureau of land management of the united states department of the interior blm,alleging that a planned timber sale in the willy slide area of the medford district,among other decisions,violated the national environmental policy act nepa,et,and the forest lands policy and management act flpma,et.klamath sought a preliminary injunction a declaration that the challenged decision violated certain laws a permanent injunction against the project until the blm complied with those laws and an award of costs and attorneys fees.
klamath filed its complaint in october of.the blm own guidelines barred proceeding with the willy slide timber sale between october,and may,although a blm official could waive this restriction.while for summary judgment were pending before a magistrate judge,the parties stipulated that the blm would stay authorization of the sale until the magistrate judge made a recommendation on the and any objections had been resolved.the stay lasted only until may,at which point klamath would have the option of moving for a preliminary injunction.the magistrate judge adopted this stipulation in january of.
meanwhile,in a different lawsuit,the same plaintiffs had challenged,on similar grounds,two other timber sales that the blm had proposed.on november,we decided in favor of klamath in the appeal of that case.see klamath siskiyou wildlands ctr.boody,cir.at the time,the for summary judgment were still pending in this case before the magistrate judge.the day after boody came down,the magistrate judge filed findings and recommendations f r.the magistrate judge concluded that boody was directly on point and that klamath was entitled to summary judgment on some of its claims.
that same day november,the blm on its own vacated its earlier rulings and granted klamath protest of the willy slide timber sale.in a letter to klamath,the blm noted the objections to its previous decision,as well as recent case law pertaining to similar activities and nepa analysis.the blm stated that,in light of those two considerations,it would wait to award the willy slide sale until such time that supplemental analysis and has been completed as appropriate.it is unclear whether the blm did this before or after it found out about the magistrate judge f 
the blm then moved to dismiss this case without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that it was either moot or unripe,objecting to the f r on the same basis.the district court granted the motion to dismiss on both grounds.it concluded that the action was no longer ripe because klamath claims were contingent upon future events the blm may or may not proceed with the willy slide timber sale.if the blm decides to offer the timber for sale again,klamath will be able to challenge the sale and any under lying sic environmental documents.alternatively,the action was moot because the court could not grant klamath any effective relief as the willy slide timber sale decision has been withdrawn and the annual species reviews have been held invalid in boody.
klamath then moved for attorney fees and costs under the equal access to justice act eaja.over the blm objection,the district court granted the motion.the blm timely appeals.
in this country litigants ordinarily must pay their own attorney fees,contrary to the rule that prevails in england.this american rule can change,but usually only by private agreement or statute.and indeed congress has passed many statutes to allow parties who sue the united states to recover attorney fees in certain circumstances,but only if they were prevailing parties in the lawsuit.see buckhannon bd.dep t of health and human,d.
one such statute is the equal access to justice act the term prevailing party,in this as in other statutes,is a term of art that courts must interpret consistently throughout the united states code.id.at.smith,cir applying the buckhannon definition of prevailing party to the eaja see also sole wyner,d citing cases interpreting prevailing party language in various federal statutes.it means a party in whose favor a judgment is rendered,regardless of the amount of damages awarded.citizens for better forestry forest,cir quoting buckhannon,at.quoting black law dictionary ed.
this definition requires the party to have achieved a material alteration in the legal relationship of the parties that is judicially sanctioned.buckhannon,at.internal quotation marks omitted carbonell ins,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the material alteration and the judicial sanction are two separate requirements.see carbonell,at.
the material alteration in the legal relationship of the parties must be relief that the prevailing party sought,for r espect for ordinary language requires that a plaintiff receive at least some relief on the merits of his claim before he can be said to prevail.hewitt helms,d.the form in which the relief comes is less important than that it be the relief the plaintiff sued to get.thus,an order remanding a case to an administrative agency for further proceedings passes the buckhannon test,where such a remand is what the plaintiff or petitioner sought.li keisler,cir explaining that the prevailing parties had sought either to reopen removal proceedings or to obtain a remand for review of a specific legal claim.even a voluntary stipulation,adopted by the district court,to stay deportation proceedings earns an immigrant petitioning for review prevailing party status,so long as the stay was the primar y concern of the case and secured the petitioner much of the relief he had sought.carbonell,at.
whatever form it takes,the material alteration must consist of actual relief,not merely a determination of legal merit.a favorable determination on a legal issue,even if it might have put the handwriting on the wall,is not enough by itself.better forestry,at.poland chertoff,cir,furnishes a vivid example of this rule.we upheld a judgment in favor of the plaintiff on one claim but reversed on another.id.at.the damages award was based on the claim with respect to which we reversed the judgment,so we vacated the award and remanded for the plaintiff to seek a remedy.id.at.we also vacated the district court award of attorney fees because the plaintiff had not won any relief on the merits of his claim,even though he had established his claim as a matter of law and on remand could seek redress for injuries suffered.id.at.thus,the court must formally indicate that the plaintiff is entitled to some actual or equitable relief in order to establish a material alteration.id.a moral victory,in other words,is not enough.see hewitt,at.
buckhannon also emphasized the necessity of a judicial imprimatur.at.the lodestar of this requirement is that a plaintiff is not a prevailing party if it only achieves the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct.id.at.rejecting the catalyst theory.thus,buckhannon concluded that the repeal of a statute the plaintiff had challenged does not make the plaintiff prevailing.even though the repeal perhaps accomplish ed what the plaintiff sought to achieve,it merely represents the defendant voluntary change in conduct,which lacks a judicial sanction or imprimatur.id.at.in short,the judicial sanction must be an enforceable entitlement to relief.it must allow one party to require the other party to do something it otherwise would not be required to do.jankey poop deck,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to receive what one sought is not enough to prevail the court must require one opponent to give it.
all together,this case law establishes that the sine qua non of prevailing party status is an enforceable,judicially sanctioned award of much of the relief the plaintiff sought.see better forestry,at a party must have a judgment or something similar formally delivered in its fa
