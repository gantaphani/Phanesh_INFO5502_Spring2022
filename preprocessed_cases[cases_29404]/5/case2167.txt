this is an appeal from a postjudgment order of the superior court granting a prevailing defendant motion for contractual and statutory attorney fees,expert fees and costs in the total amount of.plaintiff individuals steve carver and other chevron dealers dealers filed this action against chevron,chevron and several of its management employees for damages for breach of contract lease provisions,fraud and alleged violations of california antitrust laws bus,hereinafter the cartwright act.dealers won a jury verdict awarding damages on some of their theories,but the judgment was reversed on appeal by this court with directions to enter judgment in favor of chevron.carver chevron may,wl nonpub.opn.our prior opinion.on remand,chevron obtained an award of attorney fees and costs against dealers under the lease attorney fees clause,in conjunction with section,the attorney fees provision of the cartwright act,and code of civil procedure section,allowing an award of expert fees and costs.chevron was deemed the prevailing party in the action as a whole.code civ.
on appeal of the order granting chevron motion for contractual and statutory attorney fees and costs,dealers assert the trial court incorrectly found as a matter of law that all the relevant statutory criteria for such an award had been met in this action,with respect to the competing policies found in the cartwright act,in civil code section pertaining to awards of contractual attorney fees,and in certain portions of the code of civil procedure that provide for awards of attorney fees or litigation costs.code civ,subd.a.dealers generally argue the trial court misinterpreted the language of the lease attorney fees clause pertaining to a party who substantially prevailed upon different aspects of the action.the particular challenges dealers make to the award are that it should have excluded fees and costs incurred in defense of the cartwright act claims,as not authorized by contract the individual defendants,who were not parties to the lease and a negligence cause of action that was voluntarily dismissed before trial,subd.b.
dealers additionally claim that the trial court erred or abused its discretion in awarding chevron and the individual defendants expert witness fees and related costs under code of civil procedure section,which requires an award of costs where a party fails to obtain a more favorable judgment than would have been obtained by acceptance of a pretrial settlement offer.they argue the offer made per dealer plus a waiver of attorney fees and costs was unreasonable in its terms.
having studied the record and the applicable statutory provisions,we conclude that with respect to the portion of the attorney fees award that is not based on the contract or tort theories arising out of or related to the lease agreement,but rather represents the defense of the cartwright act claims,the trial court decision does not adequately account for all of the competing policies that have been developed in this area,and erroneously attempts to award attorney fees under a reciprocal rights theory under the cartwright act.however,the attorney fees and costs award is well supported on the contract and related tort theories arising out of the lease agreement,as to the defense of both chevron and the individual defendants,and under code of civil procedure section.accordingly,we reverse the postjudgment order with directions to the trial court to make appropriate findings and apportionment to delete only that part of the award that represents the attorney fees portion of the defense of the cartwright act claims.
factual and procedural background 
aunderlying trial and judgment on appeal 
as set forth in our prior opinion,chevron,a refiner manufacturer and retailer of petroleum products,sells chevron brand gasoline through service stations,some of which it owns and operates and some of which it leases to franchisees,such as dealers,through written leases and supply contracts.in,chevron introduced a variable rent program,which became mandatory for all lease renewals executed after january.extensive disputes developed between chevron and dealers,leading to the filing of this action.the operative pleading,dealers third amended complaint,alleged causes of action arising from chevron variable rent program,including intentional misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,concealment,breach of contract,breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and unlawful horizontal and vertical restraints of trade.dealers causes of action for breach of contract and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing were alleged against the corporation alone,excluding the individual defendants.the complaint also names a third individual defendant who was not found liable at trial.the individual defendants,chevron management employees,were named in the causes of action for intentional misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,concealment,negligence,and unfair trade practices.bus,et.
many of dealers causes of action were disposed of in chevron favor in pretrial motion proceedings.chevron made a settlement offer under code of civil procedure section of per dealer,plus a waiver of attorney fees and costs,but it was not accepted by dealers.
at trial,the jury returned verdicts against chevron on the causes of action for intentional misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,and concealment however,chevron prevailed at trial on the claims for breach of contract,breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and unlawful vertical restraint of trade.chevron appealed the judgment against it.dealers also appealed the judgment against them on their first and second causes of action under the cartwright act.
on appeal,our prior opinion reversed the judgment against chevron on the intentional misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,and concealment causes of action,as well as reversing the underlying order denying chevron judgment notwithstanding the verdict.accordingly,we directed the trial court to enter judgment in favor of chevron on those causes of action.in addition,the judgment in favor of chevron on the causes of action for unlawful horizontal and vertical restraints of trade was affirmed cartwright act.chevron was awarded costs on appeal.on remand,judgment was entered in favor of chevron on the case as a whole.
proceedings on motion for attorney fees and costs 
following the reversal on appeal of the judgment in favor of dealers on some issues,chevron filed its motion for an award of attorney fees and costs,based on the attorney fees clause found in the leases,its status as prevailing party,and also on the code of civil procedure section offer that was not accepted by dealers.it provided a memorandum of costs and attorney declarations regarding fees and costs incurred.the attorney fees request alone was for a total amount of.extensive opposition was filed,including a stipulation among the dealers that if apportionment of the award were to be granted,it should be divided by the number of dealers,rather than the number of stations.reply papers and declarations followed,as did several continuances to complete the extensive paperwork.
the attorney fees provision found in the dealer leases reads as follows 
in the event of any lawsuit between company and dealer or any arbitration proceeding pursuant to section hereof arising out of or relating to the transactions or relationship contemplated by this lease regardless whether such action alleges breach of contract,tort,violation of a statute or any other cause of action,the substantially prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs of suit including its reasonable attorneys fees.if a party substantially prevails on some aspects of such action but not others,the court or arbitrator may apportion any award of costs or attorneys fees in such manner as it deems equitable.
trial court ruling 
after hearing and a motion to tax costs,the trial court granted,in part,chevron motion for attorney fees and costs,citing code of civil procedure actually.chevron was awarded attorney fees in the amount of.based on chevron code of civil procedure section offer of per dealer plus a waiver of attorney fees and costs,not accepted by dealers,chevron was also awarded expert witness fees in the amount of.chevron was further awarded costs of suit trial court level in the amount of,and costs relating to the previous appeal of.accordingly,dealers were ordered to pay chevron the total sum of.
the trial court reasoning set forth in the order included the following key passages first,the court found unpersuasive the dealers arguments that a reciprocal right to attorney fees should not be granted because of the unequal bargaining power of the parties,or because it might discourage pursuit of meritorious claims because of the economic consequences.the court found the contracts leases providing for an award of attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party were not unconscionable.
next,the trial court ruled that the chevron attorney fees clauses did not require dealers to waive any rights under the cartwright act bus,subd.a,or the federal petroleum marketing practices act,united states code section,et.pmpa instead,the fee provisions make the recovery of the attorney fees mutual.the court distinguished covenant mutual insurance company young d.covenant mutual,as relied upon by dealers,because there,the appellate court held that the trial court was incorrectly attempting to override the legislature intention to provide for such recovery by statute.id.at,citing.the appellate court in covenant mutual expressly stated that it was not dealing with contractual attorney fees provisions and distinguished its statutory analysis of civil code section from the provisions of civil code section,which imposes reciprocity on unilateral contractual provisions.covenant mutual,supra,d at.
next,the trial court found applicable the reasoning of the supreme court in murillo fleetwood enterprises,cal th,d,murillo.in that case,the plaintiff lost his suit under the consumer warranty act act,et,the lemon law.the prevailing defendants sought to recover their costs and expert witness fees under code of civil procedure sections,subdivision b and,subdivision c.the supreme court rejected the plaintiff argument that the more specific provisions of the song beverly act prohibited the prevailing defendants from obtaining such recovery,and therefore those defendants were allowed to recover their costs and expert witness fees.thus,in murillo,the supreme court explained 
because the provisions of the song beverly act do not expressly disable a prevailing defendant from recovering section costs and fees in general,or expert witness fees in particular,we find nothing in the act prohibiting the trial court exercise of discretion to award expert witness fees to seller under the circumstances of this case.murillo,supra,cal th at,d.
the trial court went on to deny dealers request to limit the amount of recovery to attorney fees and costs on appeal based on the dealers argument they had prevailed on three causes of action at the trial level,stating as its reasoning 
whether plaintiffs had prevailed before a jury does not negate that chevron is the prevailing party in this litigation.not only was chevron partially successful at trial,chevron prevailed on appeal when the court reversed the judgment notwithstanding the verdict.as stated in the judgment entered on november,plaintiffs shall take nothing by their complaint against defendants chevron,jordan tragaer,larry denning and nick vigil and the action against said defendants is dismissed 
with reference to the amount of attorney fees sought,chevron request was reduced from the requested amount of to,with reasons stated the court finds that chevron attorneys hourly rates are reasonable based on the specialized skill of the attorneys.nonetheless,after reviewing the billing,the court finds that some charges could have been reduced had a paralegal performed the tasks and some charges were excessive based upon the totality of circumstances.
finally,on chevron request for expert witness fees and costs under california code of civil procedure section,the trial court found that chevron had prevailed on every cause of action,and at the time of the offer,chevron had already incurred in costs and attorney fees of.the trial court further ruled 
given the substantial risks of paying costs at the time of the offer,chevron is correct that this is not just a nominal offer,based upon the reasoning set forth in jones dumrichob th,d.nonetheless,the court exercises its discretion to limit the recoverable expert witness fees from the requested.the court initially notes that chevron has attempted to recover expert witness fees made prior to the offer of january,in the amount of,and these are deemed stricken.the balance of these fees is also reduced because the amount of expert witness fees sought is shocking.chevron shall recover its expert witness fees based upon the offer in the amount of.
in response to a separate motion by dealers for apportionment of the award,the trial court exercised its discretion,based upon the particular facts of this case combined with chevron conflicting arguments about its defense efforts,to order the responsibility for paying the award to be apportioned among the service stations involved,as owned by the dealers.the trial court issued a further order nunc pro tunc setting forth the apportioned amount each dealer was to pay.
dealers appealed the order we have received an amicus brief from the service station dealers of america,a trade group,setting forth its support of dealers appeal,and citing to the pmpa,united states code section,et,as influential authority in the attorney fees context,as will be further explained in part id,post,subd.d cal.rules of court,rule b.

contentions 
to evaluate dealers challenges to the award,we are required to evaluate the attorney fees clause here in light of statutory standards for prevailing party attorney fees and costs entitlements,and with specific reference to the general policies promoted by cartwright act fees and costs awards.dealers main claims of error are that the fees and costs incurred in defense of the cartwright act claims can not fall within the scope of the attorney fees clause of the lease,and are not authorized by contract or by statute.further,they claim the trial court misread the provisions of the attorney fees clause of the lease,insofar as it refers to a possible award to a party who substantially prevails on some aspects of such action but not others,such that the court may apportion any award of costs or attorneys fees in such manner as it deems equitable.
dealers subsidiary claims are that these statutes required the court to exclude fees and costs incurred in defense of a negligence cause of action that was voluntarily dismissed before trial,subd.b,and that apportionment was required as to fees incurred in defense of the individual defendants,who were not parties to the lease.
statutory framework 
basic litigation costs rules are outlined in santisas goodin cal th,d,whether a party to litigation is entitled to recover costs is governed by code of civil procedure section,which provides,in subdivision b,that e xcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute,a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.for the purpose of determining entitlement to recover costs,code of civil procedure section defines prevailing party as including,among others,a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered.code civ,subd.a.also,a defendant against whom the plaintiff does not recover any relief is a prevailing defendant.santisas goodin,supra,cal th at,d.
under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,attorney fees are allowable as costs under code of civil procedure section,when authorized by any of the following a contract.b statute.c law.as pointed out by the supreme court in santisas goodin,code of civil procedure section does not independently authorize recovery of attorney fees.rather,consistent with subdivision a of code of civil procedure section,code of civil procedure section recognizes that attorney fees incurred in prosecuting or defending an action may be recovered as costs only when they are otherwise authorized by statute or by the parties agreement.santisas goodin,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
in our case,there is a contractual attorney fees clause,bringing civil code section into play a in any action on a contract,where the contract specifically provides that attorney fees and costs,which are incurred to enforce that contract,shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party,then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract,whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.
however,civil code section,subdivision b specifies where an action has been voluntarily dismissed or dismissed pursuant to a settlement of the case,there shall be no prevailing party for purposes of this section.
this appeal requires us to read the above rules in conjunction with the attorney fees clause of the cartwright act,section 
a any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter,may sue therefor in any court having jurisdiction in the county where the defendant resides or is found without respect to the amount in controversy,and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,interest on his or her actual damages pursuant to section,and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief,and shall be awarded a reasonable attorneys fee together with the costs of the suit.emphasis added.
it will be noted that this attorney fees clause of the cartwright act,section,subdivision a,is a unilateral fees clause,referring to an award to a prevailing party who is any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason of anything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter.emphasis added.the section plain language does not create any reciprocal right on the part of a prevailing defendant to such an award of a reasonable attorneys fee together with the costs of the suit,as incurred in defense of an action,italics added.
cartwright act claims 
we are required as a threshold matter to determine if the normal reciprocal effect of civil code section on the contractual attorney fees clause here will effectively create such a reciprocal effect on the statutory fees provision of the cartwright act,section,subdivision a.here,the trial court granted,in part,chevron motion for attorney fees and costs,citing code of civil procedure actually.this miscite,obviously referring to the civil code,has no effect on the reasoning or validity of the trial court decision.we focus on the substance thereof.
dealers begin by arguing that in place of civil code section,the trial court analysis should have focused on code of civil procedure section,and that such an analysis should have led to denying any award of fees attributable to noncontract claims,either statutory or tort,in view of the specific language of this clause.they rely upon the introductory language in code of civil procedure section,that except as attorney fees are specifically provided for by statute,the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement,express or implied,of the parties but parties to actions or proceedings are entitled to their costs,as hereinafter provided.their argument is that the cartwright act is another such specific provision by statute that removes attorney fees obligations from the scope of code of civil procedure section,subd.a.
similarly,dealers rely upon the introductory language in code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,to the same effect,providing e xcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute,a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,attorney fees are allowable as costs under code of civil procedure section,when authorized by any of the following a contract.b statute.c law.however,the question is whether section,subdivision a of the cartwright act otherwise indicates,such that attorney fees incurred to defend against such claims are not subject to a reciprocal contractual attorney fees clause,or other reciprocal effect as created by law.
here,the trial court ruled that chevron lease attorney fees clauses did not require dealers to waive any rights under the cartwright act,subd.a,stating instead,the fee provisions make the recovery of the attorney fees mutual.the court distinguished covenant mutual,supra,d,as relied upon by dealers,because there the court held that the trial court was erroneously attempting to override the legislature intention to provide such recovery by statute.id.at.also,the trial court noted that in covenant mutual,the analysis did not address contractual attorney fees provisions,such as under civil code section.covenant mutual,supra,d at.
in murillo,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court dealt with a potential conflict between code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,giving a prevailing party a right to recover costs,and a separate costs provision in the act,et murillo,supra,cal th at,d.the attorney fees provision of the act,subd.d,states if the buyer prevails in an action under this section,the buyer shall be allowed by the court to recover as part of the judgment a sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses,including attorney fees based on actual time expended,determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the buyer in connection with the commencement and prosecution of such action.as noted by the supreme court,the act has no comparable provision for prevailing sellers,and it is this asymmetry that gives rise to the legal dispute in this case.buyer contends that,because the act specifically provides for the recovery of costs only by a prevailing buyer,a seller is prohibited from recovering costs even if it prevails in a lawsuit under the act.in contrast,seller contends nothing in the act expressly disables section from applying to a prevailing seller.murillo,supra,cal th at,d.the court decided for the seller 
we note that when the legislature intends to restrict the recovery of costs to just one side of a lawsuit,it knows how to express such restriction.citation.we conclude buyer argument we should interpret civil code section d despite its lack of an express exception to section b as an exclusive,provision so as to avoid implicating the validity of dozens of other statutes,is meritless.having found buyer cited authority distinguishable and no express exception in civil code section d to the general rule set forth in section b permitting a prevailing defendant to recover its costs,we conclude the court of appeal below ruled correctly that sellers were entitled to their costs.murillo,supra,cal th at,d.
in murillo,supra,cal th at page,d,the supreme court was careful to state that its opinion did not address the issue of authorization for the recovery of attorney fees,only litigation costs,in view of the existence of many statutes cited the court said,sellers are not seeking attorney fees,and there is no default attorney fee recovery provision akin to section b.indeed,the law is to the contrary.see except as attorney fees are specifically provided for by statute,the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement,express or implied,of the parties.murillo,supra,cal th at,d.thus,we believe that the supreme court conclusions that there was no express exception in the song beverly act,subd.d to the general rule set forth in code of civil procedure section,subdivision b permitting a prevailing defendant to recover its costs,and that the sellers were therefore entitled to costs of suit when they prevailed,should not be extended beyond its applicability to costs of suit,into the contractual attorney fees area.murillo,supra,cal th at,d.
accordingly,we should not assume,based on any of the authority presented,that the attorney fees provision in favor of a prevailing plaintiff under the cartwright act may be read reciprocally in favor of a prevailing defendant,for other than standard costs of suit.code civ,subd.b.since there is a contractual attorney fees clause here giving rise to the claimed attorney fee entitlement,murillo does not govern this situation.rather,we believe the cartwright act fees provision is the kind of other statutory provision that will override a general litigation costs entitlement under code of civil procedure section,for purposes of assessing attorney fees as costs under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.
similarly,the attorney fees entitlement authorized by code of civil procedure section also refers to a limitation on the right of parties to agree to fees entitlements,by stating except as attorney fees are specifically provided for by statute,the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement,express or implied,of the parties but parties to actions or proceedings are entitled to their costs,as hereinafter provided.we accordingly conclude that the attorney fees clause in the lease agreements can not be construed to cover chevron costs of defending against the cartwright act claims,and the trial court was required by statute to make an apportionment of those defense costs and to delete them from the amount of attorney fees claimed under the parties agreement.it was error not to do so,and we are required to reverse the order to this extent and return the matter to the trial court for these further proceedings.
we are supported in this conclusion by the analysis in covenant mutual,supra,d.holding,does not expressly or impliedly authorize attorney fees for agents successful in defending a breach of warranty of authority suit.there the court did not have any contractual fee agreement before it.however,it was required to discuss the general concept of reciprocal fees provisions in the statutory context,and made these policy comparisons 
there is a salient difference between attorney fee provisions which individuals or institutions insert in private contracts and those which lawmakers enact in public legislation.the former are created by private parties for their own private advantage and almost always favor the party with the greater bargaining power.the latter,on the other hand,are created by legislators as a deliberate stratagem for advancing some public purpose,usually by encouraging more effective enforcement of some important public policy.through enactment of section the legislature has evidenced it regards private imposition of unilateral to be against the public interest.at the same time,in literally scores of specific areas of the law it has intentionally imposed as a means of advancing the public interest.the fact lawmakers offer a bounty for plaintiffs who sue to enforce a right the legislature has chosen to favor in no sense implies it intends to offer this same bounty to defendants who show they have not violated the right.indeed the more logical explanation is that the legislature desires to encourage injured parties to seek thus simultaneously enforce public situations where they otherwise would not find it economical to sue.covenant mutual,supra,d at.fns.omitted.
moreover,the argument by amicus curiae that the attorney fees provision found in the pmpa,subd.d is a provision and does not create any reciprocal right of which a petroleum marketer defendant can take advantage,also supports our reasoning to some extent,as showing there is a companion public policy stated in this professional field to allow those challenges to petroleum marketers practices in dealing with their franchisees that are based on statute,to be litigated without the plaintiffs incurring enormous exposure to contractual attorney fees.the statutory protections of the cartwright act also require as much.
in conclusion,dealers are correct that the cartwright act defense falls outside the scope of the lease attorney fees clause here.
substantially prevailing party on some aspects of such action.
in this argument,dealers focus upon the specific language of the attorney fees clause,that permits the trial court,as required by equitable considerations,to make a determination that a party substantially prevailing on some aspects of the action,but not others,should be awarded costs or attorney fees as apportioned.they contend that since they prevailed at trial on the misrepresentation claims,at least until reversal was ordered on appeal,the trial court should have taken that into account as an equitable consideration and apportioned the costs and fees award accordingly.similarly,dealers contend that since they succeeded in the pretrial stage in having chevron summary adjudication motions denied,they should also be considered to have substantially prevailed in some aspects of the action in this regard.they also appear to generally contend that there is no basis for any contractual attorney fees award for the tort causes of action.
the latter argument is clearly contrary to the authority of santisas goodin,supra,cal th,d,that depending on the language of the applicable contractual attorney fees clause,it may support an award of attorney fees to a prevailing party whether the litigation was based on tort or contract,if it arose out of a relationship originally created by contract.more importantly,dealers can not show that the trial court erred or abused its discretion in determining that they had not prevailed on any aspects of this litigation,in light of the favorable judgment that chevron obtained after appeal.even in light of the specific language of the attorney fees clause,allowing for an equitable determination that a party may have substantially prevailed in some but not other aspects of the case,dealers can not show that there was any failure by the trial court to address or to decide correctly all the issues presented here.there was no error on the part of the trial court in interpreting that provision.
individual defendants apportionment 
we first point out that the record does not show that dealers conducted any discovery in the fees and costs proceedings on the separateness of the defense efforts as to the corporation or its management employees who were named as individual defendants.nor does the record show that dealers raised this argument to the trial court.accordingly,we would be justified in declining to address it,as a factual issue not appropriately addressed on appeal due to the lack of a factual record.mattco forge,arthur young and company th,d.
even if we do consider the record adequate on this point and the matter to be a question of law that we may consider de novo,see fn,post,we would find the record inadequate to support dealers claims in this respect.our analysis must begin with the attorney fees clause here,referring to any between chevron and a dealer arising out of or relating to the transactions or relationship contemplated by this lease regardless whether such action alleges breach of contract,tort,violation of a statute or any other cause of action,and giving rise to a right to recover costs on the part of the substantially prevailing party,including its reasonable attorney fees.the claims against these individual defendants clearly grew out of the transactions or relationship contemplated by the lease,and the attorney fees clause is broad enough to cover such allegations.it is not dispositive that the individual defendants were not signatories to the lease,since the corporation carried out the defense of its employees for their acts in their official capacities.the employees did not necessarily incur attorney fees on their own behalf,for which they were personally liable,but it is not disputed that a defense had to be provided and the corporation incurred such expenses.
moreover,both the corporation and the individual defendants were charged with various forms of fraud and suppression of fact,as well as negligence.the contract and breach of covenant claims were restricted to the corporation,chevron.the remaining causes of action pertained to statutory claims or equitable remedies.the gist of the allegations about the individual defendants was that they were acting within the course and scope of their employment in making the alleged misrepresentations.as stated in the attorney declaration in support of the motion for attorney fees,if the individual defendants had not been named as parties,they would nevertheless have been material witnesses,since they were the ones who dealt directly with the individual dealers on the lease problems.accordingly,the trial court had an adequate factual basis on which to conclude that the investigation and defense of the corporation and of the individual defendants were closely related and involved the same issues.there was no reversible error in this regard.
voluntary dismissal before trial,subd.b 
where a plaintiff voluntarily dismisses an action with prejudice,the defendant is ordinarily one in whose favor a dismissal has been entered,who therefore qualifies as a prevailing party within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,and who is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs unless another statute expressly provides otherwise.santisas goodin,supra,cal th at,d.here,dealers only dismissed the cause of action voluntarily before trial,and now claim on appeal that an apportionment for the defense of that particular claim must be made and deducted from the fees award 
in santisas goodin,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court framed the issue as whether,in an action asserting both tort and contract claims all arising from a contract containing a broadly worded attorney fee provision,and where the plaintiff has voluntarily dismissed that action before trial,the defendant should be able to recover any of the attorney fees incurred in defending the action.the court concluded that in such voluntary pretrial dismissal cases,although civil code section,subdivision b will bar recovery of attorney fees incurred in defending the contract claims,there is no bar to recovery of attorney fees incurred in defending the related tort or other noncontract claims.whether attorney fees incurred in defending tort or other noncontract claims are recoverable after a pretrial dismissal depends upon the terms of the contractual attorney fee provision.santisas goodin,supra,cal th at,d.however,the court declined to resolve the issue of the appropriate allocation of recoverable attorney fees that were incurred to litigate common issues between the contract and tort claims.id.at,fn,d.
as applied here,this analysis indicates that we must look to the contractual attorney fee provision terms.they provide that in any action arising out of or relating to the transactions or relationship contemplated by this lease regardless whether such action alleges breach of contract,tort,violation of a statute or any other cause of action,the substantially prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs of suit,including reasonable attorney fees.this is broad in its terms,suggesting chevron could have been allowed its fees with respect to the substantive nature of the dismissed cause of action,negligence.the question is whether,in failing to make such an allocation,the trial court abused its discretion or misinterpreted the applicable statute,subd.b where an action has been voluntarily dismissed or dismissed pursuant to a settlement of the case,there shall be no prevailing party for purposes of this section.
we see no such abuse of discretion or erroneous statutory interpretation here.although it would have been the better practice for the trial court to deal more specifically with the provisions of civil code section,subdivision b,to state whether there was any prevailing party for purposes of the section,it was at most harmless error to fail to do so.in the first place,it was not an entire action that was voluntarily dismissed,but only one cause of action among many.thus,the statute by its terms does not appear to apply.secondly,the defense of the negligence cause of action could reasonably have been found to have been inextricably intertwined with the defense of the negligent misrepresentation cause of action that went to trial.dealers acknowledged this relationship between the different causes of action below.thirdly,both the corporate and the individual defendants were charged in this negligence cause of action,but there were other similar causes of action alleged against them,and the trial court could have reasonably found the defenses overlapped to some extent.accordingly,dealers are not clearly as a matter of law entitled to a declaration that chevron was not the prevailing party for purposes of the voluntarily dismissed cause of action for negligence.
code of civil procedure section award 
in reviewing an award of costs and fees under code of civil procedure section,the appellate court will examine the circumstances of the case to determine if the trial court abused its discretion in evaluating the reasonableness of the offer or its refusal.pineda los angeles turf club,d.pineda jones dumrichob,supra,th at,d jones.the purpose of code of civil procedure section is to encourage the settlement of litigation without trial.pineda,supra,d at.its effect is to punish the plaintiff who fails to accept a reasonable offer from a defendant.ibid.to implement these principles,the following rule has been developed 
where,as here,the offeror obtains a judgment more favorable than its offer,the judgment constitutes prima facie evidence showing the offer was reasonable and the offeror is eligible for costs as specified in section.the burden is therefore properly on plaintiff,as offeree,to prove otherwise.elrod oregon cummins diesel,d.elrod.
in ruling on chevron request for expert witness fees and costs under code of civil procedure section,the trial court found that chevron had prevailed on every cause of action.as of the time of the offer,which was to pay to each dealer,along with the waiver of any attorney fees and costs claims,chevron had already incurred in costs and fees of.the trial court concluded this was not merely a nominal offer citing jones,supra,th,d.however,the trial court,in its discretion,reduced the recoverable expert witness fees from the requested amount,to.
dealers contend here that the trial court failed to make an appropriate exercise of discretion in awarding expert witness fees,by not applying the proper analysis to determine whether chevron offer was made in good faith.they argue there was no appropriate evaluation made of the circumstances at the time the offer was made,from the perspective of the defendants.elrod,supra,d at.dealers point to the fact that the offer was made approximately one and years before trial,while discovery was still ongoing and the issues were still being developed.before trial,chevron was denied the summary adjudication it sought as to out of the causes of action.of the eight causes of action that went to trial,dealers prevailed on three of them.chevron had a large exposure to damages,potentially multimillion dollar damages,and dealers contend the offer could not reasonably have been found to be a good faith one.in any event,dealers contend that since the three individual defendants did not make any settlement
