opinion of the court 
in this appeal we must decide whether the requirement in the equal access to justice act eaja,that an application for attorneys fees be filed within thirty days from the final disposition in an adversary adjudication means days from the time at which the agency issues a final and appealable order or,days from the time at which the final order becomes unappealable.the occupational safety and health review commission interpreted the statute to mean days from the date on which the order of the agency became final and appealable and denied appellant request for fees pertaining to the administrative proceeding.we will reverse.the language of,and policy behind,the eaja counsels that the term final disposition means final and unappealable.thus,an application for attorney fees pursuant to is timely if filed prior to the expiration of days from the date the decision of the agency becomes final and unappealable.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
the occupational safety and health review commission had jurisdiction to evaluate the secretary of labor petition pursuant to c of the occupational safety and health act osh act,et.our jurisdiction over an appeal from a final order by the commission is provided by of the osh act.
we have plenary review over the commission legal interpretation of the eaja,rock,cir.because the eaja is a statute of general applicability and the occupational safety and health administration is not charged with administering it,we are not required to afford much deference to osha regulatory interpretations.id.at while no deference is accorded to the benefits review board interpretation of the act as it does not administer it,we have indicated that we will respect that interpretation if it is reasonable.citations omitted see also adams fruit barrett,d a precondition to deference under chevron is a congressional delegation of administrative authority.
ii.factual and procedural background 
the facts relevant to our review are not in dispute.in,an osha compliance officer inspected a work site that involved removing and replacing a sewer line in newark,new jersey.scafar contracting was the trenching contractor responsible for the depth and safety of the trenches.as part of the inspection,the officer issued scafar two citations alleging serious and willful violations of the occupational safety and health act.the proposed penalties were for the alleged willful violations and for the alleged serious violations.scafar contested the citations and eventually the proceeding came before an administrative law judge in february and april of.in his july,decision,the alj vacated the willful violations and reduced the penalty for the serious violation to.
the secretary filed a petition for discretionary review with the commission on august,requesting review of the july decision.the commission did not accept the invitation to review and entered a notice of final order upholding the alj decision,which had an effective date of september.on october,the secretary filed a petition for review of the july decision with us.however,no action on the merits was taken because the secretary abandoned her appeal by filing a motion to withdraw the appeal on december.we granted the motion on january.scafar filed its application for fees and expenses under the eaja within days of the date we dismissed the secretary appeal.the secretary filed its opposition to the application,but we chose not to decide the fee issue.herman scafar contracting,cir.april,this court does not act substantively on the application of scafar for attorney fees and expenses under the equal access to justice act.instead,we remanded the application to the commission,holding that they shall treat the motion as if filed on the date it was filed in this court.id.we further pointed out that there were no adversary proceedings in this court as the petitioner herman after filing her petition moved to dismiss the petition and the respondents scafar and the commission did not oppose the motion.id.the commission then remanded to the alj without acting on the application.for purposes of this litigation,we will continue to treat the application for fees as being filed on february.
the alj issued his decision on september,granting scafar application for in fees,after finding that the secretary was not substantially justified in issuing and pursuing enforcement of meritless osh act violations.in her petition for discretionary review,the secretary renewed her allegation that the application with respect to the agency adjudication was untimely the commission granted review and adopted the secretary position that the application was untimely for the fees sought under.sec.of labor scafar contracting.the commission applied osha regulations to find that the period for filing a fee application began to run on september,the alj july,decision became final and appealable.under the commission construction,the time for scafar to file its application expired on october,well before the february,filing date that we indicated in our remand order.the commission reversed the alj and remanded for the determination of the proper amount attributable solely to the prior proceeding before us.although scafar attempted to appeal this decision,we ruled that the remand order was not a final order and thus we had no jurisdiction for the appeal.see scafar contracting,herman,cir.december.
on remand,the alj awarded scafar for fees and expenses incurred in connection with the proceedings before us scafar petitioned the commission for discretionary review,but the commission declined and issued a notice of final order on august.this appeal was taken august.
iii.discussion 
the equal access to justice act was enacted to award private litigants their expenses incurred in defending against unreasonable government actions.as the statute provides awards of these fees and expenses for both administrative and judicial proceedings,the eaja has been bifurcated between and.despite the separate statutes,the provisions are closely intertwined and in certain circumstances will shift the proper forum for the decision on the application.
with respect to agency proceedings,the applicable statute is,which provides,in part,that 
an agency that conducts an adversary adjudication shall award,to a prevailing party other than the united states,fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection with that proceeding,unless the adjudicative officer of the agency finds that the position of the agency was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.
a.to be entitled to this award of fees,a prevailing party must file an application with the agency within thirty days of a final disposition in the adversary adjudication.a.however,
w hen the united states appeals the underlying merits of an adversary adjudication,no decision on an application for fees and other expenses in connection with that adversary adjudication shall be made under this section until a final and unreviewable decision is rendered by the court on the appeal or until the underlying merits of the case have been finally determined pursuant to the appeal.
id.pursuant to the osh act,the secretary has days after the issuance of a final order to file her appeal.a,b.
when an appeal to our court is taken,the forum for deciding fees shifts to the second statute.c if a court reviews the underlying decision of the adversary adjudication,an award for fees and other expenses may be made only pursuant to section d of title,united states code.in turn,the applicable provision becomes,which provides that 
in awarding fees and other expenses under this subsection to a prevailing party in any action for judicial review of an adversary adjudication,as defined in subsection b c of section of title,united states code,the court shall include in that award fees and other expenses to the same extent authorized in subsection a of such section,unless the court finds that during such adversary adjudication the position of the united states was substantially justified,or that special circumstances make an award unjust.
d.therefore,we are empowered to award fees for both the agency adjudication and the civil action,if we reach the underlying merits.earlier,however,we declined to rule on the fees because we did not reach the merits of the appeal,and instead remanded to the commission.
thus,we are presented with the question of how the term final disposition in should be interpreted.as is the case in all exercises of statutory interpretation,we must first look to the plain language of the statute.there is no need to resort to legislative history unless the statutory language is ambiguous.united states doe,cir quoting velis kardanis,cir.in reviewing the language of the statute,we find that the term final disposition is ambiguous.unlike final judgment in is defined as final and not clear definition of final disposition is present,nor can be gleaned from the surrounding language the absence of language indicating when a final disposition occurs requires us to look beyond the text of the statute to determine when the filing period begins to run.
we start with a discussion of.how our circuit and others solved the ambiguity originally found in the term final judgment in provides valuable insight into how we should interpret final disposition in.
the final word on final judgment 
an application for fees in the civil action must be filed within thirty days of final judgment in the action.d b.the statute now defines the term final judgment as a judgment that is final and not appealable.d g.before this congressional amendment,courts of appeal were divided on the issue of whether the days began to run from the district court decision or from the time at which the district court decision became unappealable.compare mcquiston marsh,cir a request for attorneys fees under subsection d is untimely if filed more than days after the district court has entered judgment.with mcdonald schweiker,cir disagreeing with mcquiston and interpreting final judgment to mean final and unappealable.despite the congressional resolution of final judgment and the separate statute for agency proceedings,we begin with a discussion of the cases because the reasons for interpreting this clause aid our understanding of the term final disposition.
in mcdonald,the court of appeals for the seventh circuit addressed the question of whether an application for such an award is untimely if filed more than days after the district court renders its final judgment,although less than days after any appellate proceedings are completed.at the court noted that the term final judgment was not defined in the eaja and that various definitions abounded in our statutory provisions.id.at.the court explicitly rejected the contention presently put forth by the secretary waivers of sovereign immunity are to be narrowly the court found that there was no difference to the treasury of the united states if the period for making a fee application runs from the end of the district court proceedings or from the end of all the proceedings the amount of the fee award will not be affected and that is the important thing to the public fisc.id.at.the practical consequences also favored finding that the time ran from the date the decision became unappealable.the court noted that under the alternative construction,a prevailing party would have to file several fee applications because the eaja authorized awards for both the district court and appellate level and the party would not know the total amounts to which they were entitled.id.
the seventh circuit also expressed one other overwhelming concern.if the eaja requires a prevailing party to file its application prior to the expiration of the time for the government appeal,this creates an incentive for the agency to appeal that is contrary to the remedial intent of the eaja.specifically,the court was concerned that early filing delivers into the hands of the government a potent,acknowledged,and from the standpoint of the policy of the equal access to justice act perverse weapon for discouraging meritorious fee applications.id.at.using the situation before them as an example,the court explained that 
t he government is unlikely to pursue an appeal where the stakes are only.its adversary knows this and knows also that if he increases the stakes to the government by applying for fees,the government as it emphasized to us in its briefs and at argument will be more likely to appeal the underlying judgment.
id.in light of this potential conflict,the seventh circuit found that 
the framers of the equal access to justice act could not have meant to create such a dilemma when they used the words final judgment without in all likelihood considering what the words might mean in the setting of the present case.they wanted to make it easier,not harder,for people of limited means to collect their small claims from the government.
id.citing,cong d sess.the court also pointed out that the general accounting office will not approve payment on eaja claims until all appellate proceedings are at an end.ultimately,the seventh circuit held that final judgment meant final and unappealable and reinstated the appellant application as timely.
we addressed the ambiguity of final judgment in taylor united states of america,cir.in taylor,the appellant had filed his application for fees within days from the date the secretary told him that she would not appeal the district court decision.this filing date,however,was outside the days from the district court decision and the district court dismissed the application as untimely.we reversed and cited with approval the decision in mcdonald.we found that the final and not appealable construction avoids both unnecessary fragmentation of fee petitions and the waste of judicial resources that would be caused by filing petitions for fees in cases that are ultimately reversed or remanded.id.at.we found it somewhat anomalous to require an eaja petition to be filed before the petitioner can know the amount he or she will seek and before the petition may even be addressed.id.we also noted an impending congressional amendment,clarifying the meaning of final judgment in as final and not appealable,and adopted that construction.
the unsettled word on final disposition 
unlike,congress has never endeavored to define final disposition in.congress did,however,empower the administrative conference in to establish model rules for the agencies in enacting the general purposes of the eaja.the conference specifically addressed the confusion over final disposition and created a model rule such that final disposition means the date on which a decision or order disposing of the merits of the proceeding or any other complete resolution of the proceeding,such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal,become a sic final and unappealable,both within the agency and to the courts.administrative conference of the united states,model rule,emphasis added.thus,the conference intended final disposition to mean final and unappealable.the conference explained that they hoped to provide consistency among agency proceedings as well as with court cases,and avoid the confusion that sometimes arises as to whether an application must be filed with an agency to preserve rights even though some portion of a case is being appealed to the courts.id.at.
the secretary argues that we owe no deference to the model rules or the conference because the conference no longer exists.notwithstanding osha interpretation,the eaja is a statute of general applicability and we do not owe deference to any particular agency interpretation.however,as the court of appeals for the circuit recently noted,b ecause congress gave the chairman of the administrative conference the task of overseeing the adoption by each agency of uniform procedures,the conference views warrant at the very least possible skidmore deference.adams sec,we conclude that the conference position defining final disposition as final and unappealable provides a sound and consistent approach for interpreting the eaja,irrespective of whatever level of skidmore deference may be appropriate.
in attempting to discredit the model rules,the secretary points to the regulations enacted by osha.these regulations say tha
