in brandt superior court cal d,brandt,this court held that in a tort action against an insurance company for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing,an insured may recover as damages those attorney fees that are incurred in the same action and are attributable to the attorney efforts to recover policy benefits that the insurer has wrongfully withheld.we reasoned that when an insurer tortious conduct consists of depriving its insured of policy benefits,the attorney fees that the insured reasonably and necessarily incurs to obtain those policy benefits constitute an economic loss proximately caused by the insurer tort,and thus those attorney fees now commonly referred to as brandt fees are recoverable as tort damages.id.at.
the issue here is this when an insured assigns a claim for bad faith against the insurer,and the assignee brings a tort action against the insurer that includes a claim for wrongfully withheld policy benefits,may the assignee recover brandt fees our answer is yes.
facts and procedural background 
luis sanchez,doing business as machinery moving hereafter sanchez,was in the trucking business,specifically,transporting commercial machinery.in june,sanchez contracted to deliver two commercial dryers to five star dye house,five star,a designer jeans manufacturer that uses dryers in the manufacturing process.during transportation of the dryers,one fell while on sanchez truck and was damaged.five star refused to accept delivery of the damaged dryer.
five star sued sanchez for negligence the underlying action,seeking as damages the profits it lost while the damaged dryer was being repaired.sanchez tendered defense of the action to his liability insurance carrier,essex insurance company essex.essex denied coverage,however,and refused to defend sanchez in the action.sanchez undertook a defense using his own funds the trial resulted in a judgment against him for million,plus costs.
sanchez then assigned to five star all of his claims and causes of action against essex in exchange,five star agreed to delay execution on the judgment in the underlying action until the claims against essex for the judgment amount were exhausted.notwithstanding the assignment,sanchez remained liable for the full judgment amount,plus interest 
essex then filed this action in superior court for declaratory relief against both five star and sanchez.essex sought a declaration that it did not have a duty to defend sanchez in the underlying action.under the assignment from sanchez,five star against essex for,among other claims,breach of contract and tortious breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.during the course of the litigation,sanchez was dismissed as a defendant in the declaratory judgment action,based on his assignment of all claims to five star.
the trial court found the existence of an insurance contract between sanchez and essex,potential coverage under that policy for five star claim against sanchez,and bad faith by essex in not defending sanchez in the underlying action.the court awarded five star million in damages against essex,but it denied five star request for brandt fees.
the court of appeal affirmed the trial court judgment against essex,but it reversed as to the denial of attorney fees.the court of appeal held that when an insured assigns a bad faith cause of action against an insurer,the assignee receives the right to recover the policy benefits in full,including brandt fees.the court expressly disagreed with another court of appeal decision,xebec development partners,national union fire ins.th,d xebec,which held to the contrary.
we granted essex petition for review to determine whether assignment of a tort action against an insurer for wrongfully withholding policy benefits includes the right to recover brandt fees.
ii.legal background 
a.the american rule and brandt 
embodied in code of civil procedure section,the american rule states that except as provided by statute or agreement,the parties to litigation must pay their own attorney fees.in addition to its various statutory exceptions see,the american rule is subject to common law exceptions that this court has created.trope katz cal th,d.brandt,supra,cal d,is the source of one such exception.
in brandt,an insured sued the insurer for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,seeking damages that included attorney fees.brandt,supra,cal d at.citing the american rule and code of civil procedure section,the trial court struck the portion of the complaint seeking attorney fees.brandt,supra,cal d at.we held that when an insurer denies coverage in bad faith,the insured can recover attorney fees in an action to recover the policy benefits.id.at.
after observing that an insurer breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is a tortious act,we reasoned in brandt when such a breach occurs,the insurer is liable for any damages which are the proximate result of that breach.citation.citation.when an insurer tortious conduct reasonably compels the insured to retain an attorney to obtain the benefits due under a policy,it follows that the insurer should be liable in a tort action for that expense.the attorney fees are an economic caused by the tort.citation.these fees must be distinguished from recovery of attorney fees qua attorney fees,such as those attributable to the bringing of the bad faith action itself.what we consider here is attorney fees that are recoverable as damages resulting from a tort in the same way that medical fees would be part of the damages in a personal injury action.brandt,supra,cal d at.
in a tort action for wrongful denial of policy benefits,brandt allows the insured to recover as tort damages only the attorney fees incurred to obtain the policy benefits wrongfully denied.brandt,supra,cal d at.but attorney fees expended to obtain damages exceeding the policy limit or to recover other types of damages are not recoverable as brandt fees.see cassim allstate ins.cal th,d,attorney fees to obtain emotional distress damages and punitive damages not recoverable under brandt.this follows from the rationale of brandt the tort of bad faith against the insured entitles the insured to recover the policy benefits in full,undiminished by attorney fees,but not to recover attorney fees in general.allowing recovery of attorney fees incurred to obtain damages beyond the policy limit or to obtain punitive damages would allow the insured to recover attorney fees as attorney fees,violating the american rule,embodied in code of civil procedure section,that parties generally must pay their own attorney fees.rather,brandt merely entitles the insured to all of the benefits due under the policy,undiminished by the expenses incurred in retaining an attorney to recover under the policy.cassim allstate ins,supra,at,d,conc.dis.opn.of baxter.
this court has in various decisions reaffirmed brandt rule awarding attorney fees to an insured who is injured by the bad faith conduct of the insurer.cassim allstate ins,supra,cal th at,fn,d,white western title ins.cal d,see also track mortgage group,crusader ins.th,d campbell surety services,th,d.the brandt rule is now a but narrow exception to the general rule that each party to litigation must pay its own attorney fees.
b.the general rule of assignability 
california,as set forth both in case law and by statute,maintains a policy encouraging the free transferability of all types of property.see,farmland irrigation dopplmaier cal d,robert jacobs,westoaks realtors,d.i t is a fundamental principle of law that one of the chief incidents of ownership in property is the right to transfer it.bias ohio farmers indemnity d.
this chief incident of ownership applies equally to tangible and intangible forms of property,including causes of action.originally codified in,section states a thing in action,arising out of the violation of a right of property,or out of an obligation,may be transferred by the owner.an assignment is a commonly used method of transferring a cause of action.
although the assignability of causes of action is derived from the common law,section had the effect of liberalizing restrictions on the types
