the captioned case is before us by virtue of the district court highly principled certification for immediate interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.we are called on to answer an important removal and remand question which arises in the context of diversity jurisdiction under,is unique to louisiana class actions because of the state statutory scheme,and has polarized the judges of the eastern district of louisiana.this question implicates the prong of the test for diversity jurisdiction,and asks 
when considering the class plaintiffs motion to remand,can attorney fees that the court may allow to class representatives pursuant to paragraph of a of the louisiana code of civil procedure lccp be included in calculating the requisite amount in controversy,absent some other provision of louisiana law that specifically authorizes the award of attorney fees 
to get this divisive question before us under b,the district judge denied the motion of the class representatives to remand the case to the state court in which they filed it as a putative class action against the chevron,and from which chevron removed it to the district court.the parties agree,and the facts confirm,that complete diversity exists between the class representatives and chevron leaving the amount in controversy as the sole contested issue on appeal.
for the reasons explained below,we answer yes to today question.and,as none contest that the amount here in controversy crosses threshold of when all allowable attorney fees are attributed exclusively to the class representatives,we affirm the refusal to remand this case to the state court of origin,and return it to the district court for further proceedings.
facts and proceedings 
just after noon on the day following an industrial accident at chevron chemical plant in james parish,louisiana,counsel for the class representatives filed the instant tort action in the state district court for that parish.the petition identifies chevron as the defendant,the suit as a class action,and the members of the putative class as all persons or entities located within five miles of the plant who may have suffered damages as a result of the incident.the class representatives petition asserts louisiana causes of action in negligence and strict liability,and alleges that t he claims of the plaintiffs herein for compensatory damages are all each sic individually less than.in addition to seeking certification of the class,determination of chevron liability to the class for compensatory damages,and recognition of the right of each individual class member to bring a separate action to establish the quantum of his damages,the petition asks the state court to allow the class representatives to recover their costs for the prosecution of this class action.
chevron removed the case to the eastern district of louisiana,asserting that diversity is complete and the amount in controversy is sufficient to support diversity jurisdiction when attorney fees allowable under a are attributed to the class representatives pursuant to in re abbott laboratories abbott a defines the representative parties reasonable expenses of litigation as including attorney fees.
the class representatives timely filed a motion to remand,insisting that abbott interpreted a as attributing attorney fees to the class representatives only when a separate louisiana statute louisiana revised statute in abbott authorizes assessing a reasonable attorney fee to the defendant,over and above compensatory and any other damages.they rely on the facts that no one of them or any other class member,for that matter is claiming a quantum of damages in this tort suit that could exceed jurisdictional amount threshold for diversity jurisdiction,without including interest and costs such as attorney fees,and not only are they not seeking attorney fees under any specific louisiana statute that expressly provides for such recovery they are not entitled to recover attorney fees from the defendant,chevron,in this ordinary louisiana tort suit,grounded as it is in negligence and strict liability 
the district judge noted and described in detail the division among those judges of his court including himself who had considered whether alone,in the absence of a separate attorney fees statute,the attorney fees allowable to class representatives under a are includable in calculating the amount in controversy for purposes of diversity jurisdiction noting which judges had answered yea and which nay.rather than perpetuate this split of authority by ruling one way or the other on the issue,the court denied the class representatives motion to remand and granted chevron motion to certify the question for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
when there is complete diversity between all plaintiffs and all defendants,we review de novo an order denying remand to state court on the ground that the amount in controversy exceeds the minimum jurisdictional requirement 
background removal from state courts of louisiana 
subject to specific exceptions not here relevant,louisiana prohibits a plaintiff from alleging or demanding a specific dollar amount of damages,limiting the prayer for relief to such damages as are reasonable in the premises.to accommodate the situation when the removal sought is from a louisiana court and subject matter jurisdiction is grounded in diversity of citizenship,we have modified the usual rule for determining whether the amount in controversy is present.in such louisiana situations,we permit the party seeking to maintain federal jurisdiction to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the amount in controversy exceeds when the case is one that has been removed from state court,such party may satisfy this burden in either of two ways by demonstrating that it is facially apparent from the petition that the claim likely exceeds or by setting forth the facts in in the removal petition,but sometimes by support a finding of the requisite amount.
we have not yet clearly,indeed,might not be able to precise quantum of evidence required to preponderate and thereby show an amount in controversy sufficient to establish diversity jurisdiction.in de aguilar a case situated identically to this stated that,because the plaintiffs,in a bold effort to avoid federal court,specifically allege d that their respective damages will not exceed the jurisdictional amount,
t he preponderance burden forces the defendant to do more than point to a state law that might allow the plaintiff to recover more than what is pled.the defendant must produce evidence that establishes that the actual amount in controversy exceeds the jurisdictional threshold 
the category of state laws that the de aguilar panel appears to have had in mind are those embodying the familiar maxim that a court may award more in damages than the plaintiff demands this maxim contemplates the existence of a state statute or doctrine that entitles a plaintiff to recover more than he has demanded.louisiana is such a state,and has been at least since when its code of civil procedure was enacted.before that,essentially every state court petition concluded with an express prayer for general and equitable relief,which was considered to be a prerequisite for obtaining a judgment in excess of or different from the plaintiff express prayer or demand.enactment of the louisiana code of civil procedure eliminated the need for such a talismanic incantation,thenceforth treating every petition as though it contains such a prayer and expressly permitting a judgment to exceed the prayer or demand 
except for a judgment by default,a final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled,even if the party has not demanded such relief in his pleadings and the latter contain no prayer for general and equitable relief 
thus,if a defendant in a louisiana suit can produce evidence sufficient to constitute a preponderance showing that,regardless of the style or wording of the demand,the amount in controversy actually exceeds s jurisdictional threshold,that louisiana case will then resemble any other case,bringing into play the foundational rule of removal jurisdiction the plaintiff can defeat diversity jurisdiction only by showing to a legal certainty that the amount in controversy does not exceed and we have emphasized that this is not a exercise rather,the plaintiff must make all information known at the time he files the complaint.
finally,our special accommodation for testing the amount in controversy in louisiana cases in which the quantum of the plaintiffs demand could not have been alleged in dollars because of lccp proscription,has engendered the recognition that the federal district court calculus must include attorney fees when an applicable louisiana statute allows the award of such fees until,however,those cases involved individual actions,not class actions.
then along came abbott.it required us to decide,in the context of louisiana class actions,whether the potential for an award of attorney fees under a louisiana statute specific to the cause of action at issue price fixing in abbott must be included by the district court in determining the amount in controversy and,if so,how such fees are to be attributed being a case rather than an ordinary tort case,abbott implicated,which provides 
any person who is injured in his business or property by any person by reason of any act or thing forbidden by this part may sue in any court of competent jurisdiction and shall recover threefold the damages sustained by him,the cost of suit,and a reasonable attorney fee 
this provision obviously requires the court to tax attorney fees to the losing defendant,over and above damages,and in addition to other costs.generally,in the context of a louisiana class action,attorney fees under would be attributable pro rata to each prevailing class member as a person who is injured.thus,the sole relevant issue in abbott was whether a changes the attribution to require that the total amount of attorney fees assessable against the defendant under be attributed exclusively and entirely to the class representatives.
none dispute that in abbott we answered this question in the affirmative,holding that,in calculating the amount in controversy,all awardable attorney fees must be attributed to the class representatives to the exclusion of the other members of the class neither is it disputed that we based that holding on a requirement that attorney fees allowed as an element of litigation expenses are to be allowed exclusively to the class representatives.
although today inquiry begins with abbott rule attributing all class action attorney fees to the class representatives,it is important to recognize at this juncture that in abbott we were not required to decide,and in fact could not and thus did not decide,whether,in the absence of a separate statute imposing attorney fees on the losing defendant such as in abbott,a either requires or permits the attorney fees that the court may allow to the class representatives to be included in the calculation.the obvious reason why this issue which is the one squarely presented to us today was not before us in abbott is that there was present in abbott a state statute,that was specific to the cause of action,was separate from and in addition to a,and mandated the payment of attorney fees to prevailing class members.therefore,the only question presented in abbott was whether,for purposes of calculating the amount in controversy,attorney fees recoverable under were attributable ratably to all class members,or exclusively and entirely to the class representatives.thus,a sole function in abbott was to supply the ratio decidendi for holding that attorney fees allowable in a louisiana class action must be attributed to the class representatives.it follows,then,that because a separate attorney fees statute was present in abbott,anything we might have said about attorney fees allowable under a,when standing alone,would have been dicta.
nevertheless,some judges of the eastern district of louisiana have read abbott expansively,apparently conflating its attribution holding with the unaddressed question of a authorizing the allowance of attorney fees vel non.these jurists have read abbott to stand for the proposition that,absent some other attorney fees statute,the attorney fees allowable as distinct from attributable under a can not be counted toward the class representatives amount in controversy.more than one of these judges seized on abbott use of the word key in referencing to,to read our holding as requiring the presence of a separate attorney fees statute every time.but such a reading would make the word key carry much more water than intended.
key in abbott is not synonymous with indispensable or prerequisite or sine qua non,or necessary.it is merely a rhetorical segue to the factual observation that,in that particular case,the attorney fees,which happened to be authorized by a separate statute,were attributable to the class representatives and thus includable in calculating the amount in controversy.this in turn obviated any need to look to a as a possible source of authority to allow attorney fees.simply put,our reference in abbott to the other statute as key can not be read to mean that attorney fees must be supplied by a separate statute in every case.in fact,after that segue,is never again mentioned in the abbott opinion the entire substantive analysis focuses on the attribution function of a,never mentioning its authorization function.
as settled law,abbott rule of attribution of attorney fees to the class representatives is not questioned by the parties.abbott did not,given the presence of,could whether,standing alone,a can also serve as an independent source of attorney fees in the absence of a separate statutory source.this is the question that has divided the judges of the eastern district of louisiana since abbott,and this is the res nova question squarely presented today.
as noted,there is no provision of louisiana law that allows,much less commands,the court to impose an award of attorney fees on the defendant who is cast in judgment in an individual action tort case.so,if this were an individual tort action rather than a class action,the determination of the amount in controversy for purposes of removal and remand could not include attorney fees.but alas,this is a louisiana class action,so we are bound,in the wake of abbott,to analyze a further and determine whether,in addition to being the source of abbott holding that attorney fees are attributable to class representatives,this code article,standing alone,is also the source of a exception to louisiana rule.for the reasons hereafter explained,we hold that it is.
a,louisiana code of civil procedure 
plain wording 
in its entirety,a reads 
the court may allow the representative parties their reasonable expenses of litigation,including attorney fees,when as a result of the class action a fund is made available,or a recovery or compromise is had which is beneficial,to the class 
literally,this article is expressed permissively,using may rather than shall and conditionally,authorizing the court to allow the representative parties to recover litigation expenses which expressly include attorney fees only if the class litigation is the producing cause of either a a common fund that is available to the class or b some other type of recovery or compromise that is beneficial to the class.we first note that,on its face,this code article does not condition the court authority to grant fees on the class being successful to the point of judgment rather,a requires only the availability of either a common fund or some other result that is beneficial to the class the fund or the other recovery can eventuate either from a judgment or from some disposition,such as settlement,compromise,alternative dispute resolution,or the like.
we next note that the plain wording of a does not literally limit the permissible sources available for attorney fees.facially,the code article does not restrict the source of such fees to the fund or other recovery for the benefit of the class the article requires only that such benefit result from the class litigation.neither does the article either expressly authorize or expressly prohibit the court tagging the defendant with such fees.the official revision comments to a can be read as the legislature elimination of any question of source by stating its intention that attorney fees allowed to the class representatives under authority of a are to be paid out of the fund or benefits made available by the class representatives litigation efforts.in louisiana scheme,however,such comments are not the law,but rather are instructive or clarifying.like legislative history,they are most compelling when the code article itself is we are not prepared to say that a is ambiguous instead,we assume arguendo that a does not authorize the court to assess attorney fees to the class action defendant rather,that only the common fund or the other benefits made available to the class by the class representatives litigation are eligible sources of such fees.
under that assumption,a remains a statute,but the shifting is not between the class and the defendant.instead,the shifting is between the class representatives and the rank and file members of the class.furthermore,such shifting is not restricted to common fund cases which this case is not the court can allow fees to the class representatives either from a fund made available or from a recovery or compromise which is beneficial to the class.thus,in a case like this one,each class member damage recovery could be reduced by the court and shifted to the class representatives,even if a were construed narrowly to prohibit the court from assessing attorney fees to the losing tortfeasor.
in every louisiana class action,then,the class representatives could receive attorney fees from either the defendant directly,pursuant to a separate attorney fee statute,or the members of the class indirectly,as a result of a fee shifting and attribution.in either case,calculation of the anticipated recovery of the class only one that matters for purposes of include those potential attorney fees in addition to damages,just as abbott commands.we know from zahn international paper that in class actions,we separately test the amount in controversy of each class member,whether class representative or rank and file.we also know from zahn that we are not to aggregate the potential recovery of class members in addition,instructs that the jurisdictional amount is satisfied when the potential recovery including attorney fees when appropriate of only one plaintiff exceeds threshold.and abbott confirms that when the federal court has jurisdiction over at least one member of the class by virtue of diversity of citizenship and a sufficient jurisdictional amount,that court has supplemental jurisdiction over all diverse class members,including those whose claims fall short of threshold 
mandatory or permissive 
the class representatives would make much of the fact that a authorization for the court to allow them attorney fees is couched in permissive terms,employing may rather than shall.such reliance is misplaced.the only other federal court of appeals to have addressed this issue directly is the ninth circuit which,in galt jss scandinavia squarely held that where an underlying statute authorizes an award of attorney fees,either with mandatory or discretionary language,such fees may be included in the amount in controversy.notably,the state statute at issue in galt did in fact provide for the discretionary award of attorney fees,so the quoted language clearly is not dictum.as one leading treatise notes 
there is authority for the proposition that when the applicable substantive law makes the award of an attorney fee discretionary,a claim that this discretion should be exercised in favor of the plaintiff makes the requested fee part of the statutorily required amount in controversy 
here,the class representatives petition includes the prayer for their costs for the prosecution of this class action,and a defines expenses of litigation to include attorney fees.therefore,even though the general rule is that interest and court costs are not includable in calculating the amount in controversy attorney fees are includable when the state statute allowing cost shifting expressly defines the allowable expenses of litigation to include attorney fees especially when the plaintiffs expressly pray for recovery of costs.in the instant case,a expressly authorizes the court to allow attorney fees to the class representatives as a defined element of the expenses of litigation and although that alone is sufficient in light of lccp authorization of judgments that exceed prayers or demands,it is further confirmed by the class representatives prayer for recovery of costs.furthermore,on this point we are bound by abbott,which relied on a to include attorney fees in the calculation of the class representative amount in controversy.declining to create a circuit split with the ninth circuit,we hold that when there is state statutory authority for the court to award attorney fees to class representatives,either with mandatory or discretionary language,such fees may be included in the amount in controversy.
symmetry a as a default provision 
the propriety of this holding is underscored by a functional analysis of a in the context of louisiana statutory class action scheme.such a contextual reading of a reveals that it is louisiana default provision for attorney fees in class actions.remembering that as a general rule,louisiana does not authorize the court to award attorney fees in tort suits,and a stands as a statutory exception to that general rule for purposes of class actions,the function and necessity of using may rather than shall becomes.a completes the attorney fees picture for louisiana class actions by covering the situation in which there is no separate statutory provision for attorney fees,and such fees could not be assessed against a defendant cast in judgment were the action based on an individual delictual claim rather than a class claim.the way that a harmonizes louisiana attorney fees rules in the context of class actions is by empowering,without mandating,the court to allow attorney fees to class representatives from funds or other sources of recovery made available to the by judgment,settlement,or long as such favorable result is the product of the class litigation.
quite simply,when there is a separate statute such as in abbott that mandates assessment of attorney fees in favor of the class and against the defendant,there is no need for the court to invoke a default authorization to shift a portion of the class members recovery for the benefit of those class representatives who have contracted with the attorneys and could be out of pocket for various costs and expenses.but when,as here and in myriad other louisiana tort class actions attorney fees are not recoverable under some separate statute,a clutches in to supply the default rule,authorizing the court to allow attorney fees and other costs to the class representatives out of the sums recoverable by the entire class in recompense for,the funds made available by judgment,compromise,or any other source,as long as it results from the class litigation and is for the benefit of all class in a common fund or in separate,individual recoveries.of course,this is only meet and right when the recovery from which attorney fees are allowed flows from the class action litigation.
it is this default function of a complementing as it does,those situations,such as in abbott,in which separate statutes mandate attorney explains why the redactors of louisiana civil procedure code consciously employed the permissive may rather than the mandatory shall.were it otherwise,the class representatives would be,or at least could be,the unintended beneficiaries of double dipping in an situation,receiving fees first from the defendant and then from their fellow class members as a result of a mandatory shall taxing of their respective shares of either a common fund or separate awards of damages,would constitute a windfall to the class representatives rather than a making them whole,as clearly intended.the use of may avoids the potential of such a windfall to the class representatives,imp
