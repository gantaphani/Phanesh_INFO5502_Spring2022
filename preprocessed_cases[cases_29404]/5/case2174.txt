plaintiff gemini aluminum corporation gemini appeals a judgment in favor of defendant california custom shapes,ccs,entered after a jury rejected gemini claim that ccs intentionally interfered with its prospective economic advantage.gemini contends the court erred by instructing the jury that it had the burden of showing ccs wrongful conduct twice,first to establish a prima facie case and again to defeat ccs affirmative defense of the privilege of competition.gemini also contends the court erred by defining wrongful for purposes of defeating the privilege as conduct constituting an independently actionable tort,the misappropriation of trade secrets.we conclude there was no prejudicial instructional error,and accordingly affirm the judgment.
gemini also appeals a postjudgment order awarding ccs in attorney fees under civil code section for the bad faith prosecution of a claim for misappropriation of trade secrets.gemini contends the award was improper because its case was not objectively frivolous,a standard applicable to sanctions under code of civil procedure section,and there was no evidence of its subjective bad faith.we find no abuse of discretion and affirm the order.we remand the matter to the trial court,however,for its determination of an award to ccs of attorney fees on appeal.
factual and procedural background 
ray williams,who was a principal of taskmaster industries corporation taskmaster invented the taskmaster workbench.in the spring of taskmaster and makita entered into a contract under which taskmaster would manufacture the workbenches under the makita name and makita would market them to the public.taskmaster received purchase orders from makita for workbenches to be marketed at sam club and other stores.
gemini and ccs are both extruders and finishers of aluminum parts.taskmaster hired gemini to extrude and paint,or powder coat,aluminum parts for the workbenches.gemini subcontracted with ccs to perform the powder coating.
gemini began shipping aluminum parts to taskmaster in june.in july or august,ccs discovered defects in parts it had powder coated for gemini.ccs and gemini blamed the problem on each other workmanship.the parties were unable to resolve the dispute,and by september,ccs ceased coating the taskmaster parts,put gemini on a credit hold and demanded a cod payment for parts it had finished but not delivered to gemini.however,in response to gemini threatened lawsuit,ccs delivered the materials to gemini on a credit basis.
taskmaster experienced financial problems,and by was in arrears to gemini.gemini had stopped shipping materials to taskmaster the previous month.unaware of these facts,on september,ccs principal,richard price,instructed one of his salespersons,larry jackson,to go get the taskmaster business.price believed that in addition to powder coating,ccs was capable of extruding the aluminum parts for the taskmaster workbench.on the same date,jackson sent taskmaster a letter soliciting its account.
in late september ccs filed a small claims action against gemini,seeking for unpaid invoices.on november,four days before the scheduled trial date,gemini sued ccs in municipal court for breach of contract and related counts.ccs against gemini for breach of contract and related counts.on november,ccs filed another small claims action against gemini,seeking an additional in damages.
in gemini sued taskmaster for in unpaid invoices.
in january taskmaster first ordered aluminum parts for the workbench from ccs.between then and early june ccs billed taskmaster for materials it ordered.taskmaster paid only of that amount,and,by june ccs refused to perform additional work for it.
in september taskmaster filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter,and its debt to gemini was presumably discharged.in any event,taskmaster never paid gemini the arrearages.
in december gemini sued ccs in superior court for misappropriation of trade secrets,unfair competition and conversion.gemini alleged that ccs used the die drawings gemini provided it,which drawings identify taskmaster as its customer and are used to fabricate the aluminum parts for the workbench,to solicit taskmaster business.the parties stipulated to consolidate the various actions in superior court.in june gemini filed a first amended complaint,adding a cause of action for interference with prospective economic advantage.in its answer,ccs raised the privilege of competition as an affirmative defense.
a jury trial began in august.at the outset,gemini decided to pursue only its causes of action for conversion and interference with prospective economic advantage.however,it stated that its misappropriation of trade secrets claim would be encompassed within the interference claim.
at the close of gemini,ccs moved for nonsuit.the court granted the motion as to the conversion cause of action,but denied it as to the interference cause of action.
after several days of testimony,the jury deliberated less than one hour before unanimously finding that ccs did not intentionally interfere with gemini prospective economic relationship with taskmaster.as an advisory matter,the jury also determined gemini acted in bad faith in pursuing its claim for misappropriation of trade secrets.the jury awarded ccs on its.judgment was entered for ccs on the complaint and on september.gemini unsuccessfully moved for a new trial.
ccs then moved for attorney fees under section,arguing gemini pursued its claim for misappropriation of trade secrets in bad faith.the court granted the motion based on the history of this lawsuit,stating the claim for misappropriation was a not uncommon kind of response to ccs small claims collection action,and finding a lack of evidence to support the claim.the court awarded ccs after determining that a minimum of percent of its attorney fees was related to the misappropriation claim.
discussion 
ijury instructionsa 
gemini contends the trial court improperly required it to prove ccs wrongdoing twice,first to establish its prima facie case for interference with prospective economic advantage and second to defeat ccs affirmative defense of the privilege of competition.the court instructed the jury that for purposes of the prima facie case,ccs interference could range between conduct which violates established business customs,standards,or ethics and misappropriation of the trade secret of another,but to defeat the privilege of competition ccs must have used means that,considered by themselves,constituted a misappropriation of trade secrets.
the tort of intentional interference with prospective economic advantage imposes liability for improper methods of disrupting or diverting the business relationship of another citation.citation.crosstalk productions,jacobson th,d.the elements of the tort have been stated as follows an economic relationship between the plaintiff and some third party,with the probability of future economic benefit to the plaintiff the defendant knowledge of the relationship intentional acts on the part of the defendant designed to disrupt the relationship actual disruption of the relationship and economic harm to the plaintiff proximately caused by the acts of the defendant.citations.westside center associates safeway stores,th,d westside center associates.
california law has long recognized a competition privilege which protects one from liability for inducing a third person not to enter into a prospective contractual relation with a business competitor.the privilege applies where a the relation between the competitor and third person concerns a matter involved in the competition between the actor and the competitor,and b the actor does not employ improper means,and c the actor does not intend thereby to create or continue an illegal restraint of competition,and d the actor purpose is at least in part to advance his interest in his competition with the other.citation.in short,the competition privilege furthers free enterprise by protecting the right to compete fairly in the marketplace.one may compete for an advantageous economic relationship with a third party as long as one does not act improperly or illegally.bed,bath beyond of la jolla,la jolla village square venture partners th,d,some italics added bed,bath beyond.
in della penna toyota motor sales,cal th,d,della penna,the supreme court disapproved of treating the defendant justification,or privilege to interfere with prospective economic relations as an affirmative defense.rather,i n light of the particular importance of free competition in the area of noncontractual business relations,it held instead that a plaintiff seeking to recover for an alleged interference with prospective contractual or economic relations must plead and prove as part of its that the defendant not only knowingly interfered with the plaintiff expectancy,but engaged in conduct that was wrongful by some legal measure other than the fact of interference itself.citation.westside center associates,supra,th at,fn,d,italics added,citing della penna,supra,cal th at,d.
as this court has explained,della penna requirement that a plaintiff plead and prove such wrongful conduct to recover for intentional interference with prospective economic advantage has resulted in a shift of burden of proof.it is now the plaintiff burden to prove,as an element of the cause of action itself,that the defendant conduct was independently wrongful and,therefore,was not privileged rather than the defendant burden to prove,as an affirmative defense,that its conduct was not independently wrongful and therefore was privileged.bed,bath beyond,supra,th at,d.
we agree that under della penna,the court improperly shifted the burden regarding the privilege of competition between gemini and ccs.gemini had the burden of proving in its that ccs conduct was independently wrongful and thus not protected by the privilege of competition.however,gemini suffered no prejudice since the court instructions ultimately required it to establish that ccs conduct was not privileged.instructional error in a civil case requires reversal where it seems probable that the error prejudicially affected the verdict.citations.citation.gab business services,lindsey newsom claim services,th,d,citing soule general motors cal th,d.
although difficult to ascertain,the true crux of gemini instructional challenge appears to be that the court improperly required it to establish ccs separate tort of misappropriation of trade secrets to defeat the competition privilege.gemini suggests it was merely required to show ccs violation of industry standards.at trial,gemini elicited testimony that it would be unethical,really bad business or not customary in the industry for ccs to solicit the account of a company with which it was currently doing business,such as gemini gemini,however,cites no authority for its proposition.where a point is merely asserted by counsel without any argument of or authority for its proposition,it is deemed to be without foundation and requires no discussion.people ham d,disapproved of on another ground in people compton cal d,fn,people sierra th,d.in any event,we find gemini position unpersuasive.
in della penna,the court declined to specify the scope of interference that would qualify as wrongful.della penna,supra,cal th at,d.in a concurring opinion,justice mosk stated the tort of interference requires objective,and unlawful,conduct or consequences and may be satisfied by intentional interference by independently tortious means or restraint of trade,including monopolization.id.at,d,conc.opn.of mosk,justice mosk eschewed the notion that wrongful interference could be measured by the so called business ethics standard citation,which presupposes that t he nature of the conduct which is acceptable today may prove unacceptable tomorrow citation.id.at,d,conc.opn.mosk,
in the absence of a definitive statement by the supreme court,the meaning of wrongful conduct is best derived from a review of earlier california cases that have applied a wrongfulness standard in assessing a defendant alleged intentional interference with prospective economic relations.arntz contracting paul fire marine ins.th,d.in centre city,silldorf,burdman,duignan eisenberg d,this court explained the plaintiff must show the defendant interference is somehow,based on facts that take its actions out of the realm of legitimate business transactions.there,we held the court erred by granting the defendant law firm summary judgment when the evidence showed the firm breached its fiduciary duties to the plaintiff through the improper use of confidential information.id.at.
in san francisco design center associates portman companies th,d san francisco design center,on which the trial court here relied,the court held that to defeat the privilege of competition,the defendant conduct must be unlawful or illegitimate.that is,the competitor conduct must have violated a statute or constituted a tort such as fraud or unfair competition.the defendant conduct must be independently actionable.citations.san francisco design center,supra,th at,d,fns.omitted,citing conoco inman oil,cir,wrongful means refers to means which are intrinsically is,conduct which is itself capable of forming the basis for liability of the actor doliner brown.
the court reasoned that r equiring proof that the competitor wrongful conduct is independently actionable will provide a clearer guide to competitors in the conduct of their business affairs.detached from the concepts of actionable or unlawful,the term wrongful provides little assistance in guiding future activities the term wrongful is far too broad and covers much activity which should not defeat the competition privilege.san francisco design center,supra,th at,d.in della penna,the court cited san francisco design center favorably for the proposition that to defeat the privilege of competition the defendant conduct must be unlawful or illegitimate.della penna,supra,cal th,d.
we conclude the nebulous industry standards test advanced by gemini does not satisfy della penna requirement that the defendant conduct was wrongful by some legal measure other than the fact of interference itself.della penna,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.the court acknowledged in della penna that b ecause ours is a culture firmly wedded to the social rewards of commercial contests,the law usually takes care to draw lines of legal liability in a way that maximizes areas of competition free of legal penalties.id.at,d.the imposition of liability for interference based merely on opinions that the solicitation of a competitor business was unethical or violated industry standards would create uncertainty and chill,not maximize,competition.
when the violation of industry standards is eliminated as a basis of liability,the only alleged wrongful interference of ccs was its misappropriation of gemini trade secrets.accordingly,the trial court did not err by instructing the jury that gemini had the burden of proving ccs committed the separate tort of misappropriation 
although the above discussion is dispositive,we note that had the trial court instructed the jury that gemini could defeat the privilege by proving ccs violation of industry standards or unethical conduct,the outcome would not have been more favorable to gemini.as elements of its interference claim,gemini was required to prove it had an economic relationship with taskmaster with the probability of future economic benefit to it,and economic harm proximately caused by ccs conduct.limandri judkins th,d baji.gemini did not meet its burden.
williams and hardy,taskmaster and gemini principals,respectively,had a critical meeting in late september.williams planned to give hardy a check in partial payment of the that taskmaster owed gemini,but he either decided not to make the offer or hardy rejected it.in any event,williams abruptly left the meeting after deciding it was time for a divorce from gemini.
further,in the fall of williams and his partner,virgil pettigrew,refused gemini request for personal guarantees or other agreement securing taskmaster payment of arrearages to gemini.hardy testified he would not have shipped any additional products to taskmaster without payment or some type of security agreement,conditions that were never satisfied.further,gemini sued taskmaster in november for nonpayment.
