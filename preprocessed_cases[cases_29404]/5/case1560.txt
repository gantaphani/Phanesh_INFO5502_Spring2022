in sharon superior court cal th,d,sharon,we validated a second parent adoption,in which the partner of a birth mother adopted the mother child,while the mother remained a coparent.subsequently,the prevailing party in that case,annette annette,sought attorney fees under the private attorney general attorney fee statute,code of civil procedure section to be paid by the losing party,sharon sharon.the trial court awarded such fees but the court of appeal reversed.as will be explained at greater length below,the court concluded that because of annette large personal stake in the outcome of the litigation,she was not acting as an authentic private attorney general.we granted review to address that issue.we subsequently ordered supplemental briefing on the following question does section authorize an award of attorney fees against a litigant who has done nothing to adversely affect the rights of the public or a substantial class of people other than raising an issue in the course of litigation over private rights and interests that results in an important appellate precedent adverse to that litigant 
as explained below,we do not decide whether the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the extent and scope of the litigation transcended annette personal stake in its outcome.rather,we hold that section does not authorize an award of attorney fees against an individual who has done nothing to adversely affect the rights of the public or a substantial class of people other than raise an issue in the course of private litigation that could establish legal precedent adverse to a portion of the public,and that therefore fees should not be awarded in the present case.as elaborated below,both the language and legislative history of section support this interpretation.we therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeal on that basis.
statement of facts 
the facts are for the most part undisputed.sharon and annette were in a committed relationship from through.in sharon was artificially inseminated and gave birth to zachary.while retaining her parental rights,sharon consented to annette adoption of the child.sharon,supra,cal th at,d.
in,sharon was again artificially inseminated by the same sperm donor and gave birth to joshua.sharon and annette made the same agreement allowing annette to adopt joshua while sharon retained her parental rights.thereafter the relationship between sharon and annette deteriorated and annette left the family home.annette filed a motion for an order of adoption.sharon moved for court approval to withdraw her consent to adopt and to dismiss annette petition.sharon relied on several arguments,including that the form of second parent adoption sought was unlawful.sharon,supra,cal th at,d.
the trial court denied the motion to dismiss the adoption.sharon filed and the court of appeal granted a petition for writ of mandate,holding that the form of second parent adoption sought by annette was without statutory basis.we granted annette petition for review and reversed,finding that second parent adoptions like that sought by her were lawful.we remanded the matter for resolution of factual issues related to sharon claim that her consent to the adoption had been gained by fraud and duress and to ensure that the relevant administrative and statutory requirements of the second parent adoption had been satisfied.sharon,supra,cal th at,d.
before the resolution of the other issues,annette moved for an award of attorney fees in the amount of pursuant to section.annette sought the fees for legal services provided by her counsel,charles bird of the firm luce,forward,hamilton and scripps luce,in the court of appeal and supreme court leading to the decision in sharon 
annette supporting papers noted that although the matter was not yet fully resolved,annette had prevailed in the supreme court on the second parent adoption issue,an issue of benefit to a large class of persons,and argued that she was therefore entitled to an award of fees pursuant to the private attorney general provisions of section for that portion of the case.
bird,annette attorney,filed a declaration stating that he was initially approached in august of by someone who had written an amicus curiae brief or letter brief on annette behalf,when the matter was pending in the court of appeal,out of concern that the outcome of the case may have a,detrimental effect.bird eventually decided to represent annette,and argued on her behalf in the court of appeal.when the court decided against annette solely on the ground that second parent adoption was without statutory basis,bird prepared an unsuccessful petition for rehearing and then a successful petition for review in this court.he prepared the briefs and argued the case in this court,which included extensive analysis of the legislative history of the relevant statutes,a brief responding to the various amici curiae,an answer to sharon petition for rehearing and an answer to sharon petition for a writ of certiorari in the united states supreme court.
bird declaration further stated that annette and luce had entered into a written engagement agreement providing for payment of a fee at a described rate and for the reimbursement of expenses,with an estimation that the cost of oral argument in the court of appeal was likely to run between and.he discussed with annette that if she lost in the court of appeal,the fees from continuing the litigation would likely outstrip her ability to pay,but that he would continue to represent her on the second parent adoption issue because of his concern for the law made by the case.he explained that his firm would take the chance of prevailing and potentially recovering attorney fees based on the public benefit resulting from the work.
the trial court awarded in attorney fees to annette.the court found the supreme court decision conferred a significant nonpecuniary benefit on a large class of persons and resolved an important issue of law.the trial court also concluded,for reasons elaborated below,that notwithstanding the fact that annette had a personal stake in the outcome of the litigation,the cost of the litigation was out of proportion to that stake.
the court of appeal reversed.while not disputing that the litigation conferred significant benefits on a large class of persons and resolved an important issue of law,the court concluded that annette personal stake in the litigation,the vindication of her rights as an adoptive parent,were so large that a private attorney general award under section was not justified.in so concluding,the court rejected annette argument that nonpecuniary interests such as hers were not to be counted among the personal interests that could defeat a section award.
we granted review and subsequently sought the supplemental briefing described above.
ii.discussion 
a.the necessity and financial burden requirement 
eligibility for section attorney fees is established when plaintiffs action has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest,a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons and the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate.woodland hills residents,city council cal d,woodland hills.
there is no question that the litigation here did yield a substantial and widespread public benefit.in sharon,supra,cal th at page,d,we estimated that there were between and second parent adoptions in the state that would be jeopardized by the court of appeal ruling invalidating such an adoption.but sharon and annette disagree as to whether the third factor applies in the present case.
as this court has elaborated with respect to this third requirement hereafter sometimes referred to as the necessity and financial burden requirement an award on the private attorney general theory is appropriate when the cost of the claimant legal victory transcends his personal interest,that is,when the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit placed a burden on the plaintiff out of proportion to his individual stake in the matter.citation.woodland hills,supra,cal d at.a court generally determines whether the litigation places a disproportionate burden on the individual by comparing the expected value of the litigation at the time it was commenced with the costs of litigation.see los angeles police protective league city of los angeles d.los angeles police protective league.
the above method assumes that a plaintiff has a pecuniary interest in the litigation that is more or less quantifiable.what happens when a plaintiff has no pecuniary interest annette argues that when no pecuniary interest is present,a plaintiff as a matter of law meets the necessity and financial burden requirement.she points to language in press lucky stores,cal d,press,a case in which we determined that a party that enforced a right to gather signatures for a statewide initiative petition in front of a supermarket was eligible for section.fees.in considering the necessity and financial burden requirement,the press court stated that plaintiffs personal interests in the outcome of the oil profits initiative were sufficient to induce them to bring this action is irrelevant.as the statute makes clear,subdivision b of section focuses not on plaintiffs abstract personal stake,but on the financial incentives and burdens related to bringing suit.indeed,in the absence of some concrete personal interest in the issue being litigated,the putative plaintiff would lack standing to bring an action.press,supra,cal d at,fn.annette interprets this language as signifying that when a party has no pecuniary interest in the outcome of the litigation,it will automatically satisfy the necessity and financial burden requirement.
sharon disagrees with this interpretation of press,and points to several court of appeal cases holding that private,nonpecuniary interests of some kind can disqualify a party from eligibility for section attorney fees.see punsly ho th,d hammond agran th,d hammond williams san francisco bd.of permit appeals th,d families unafraid to uphold rural el dorado county bd.of supervisors th,d but see families unafraid,at,d dis.opn.of sims.
although annette argues that nonpecuniary interests may not disqualify a party from eligibility for section attorney fees,her defense of her own attorney fee award does not depend on that proposition being categorically true.rather,the trial court in the present case,while not ruling out that annette personal interest could render her ineligible for section fees,instead concluded that the cost of the litigation transcended those interests.admitting the difficulty if not impossibility of estimating the monetary value of annette personal interests in her children,it observed that annette attorney,charles bird,offered to represent her because of the public significance of the litigation and the importance of second parent adoptions for families and children throughout california.it also noted that prior to bird entry in the case,annette had produced only letter briefs that were inadequate for addressing the second parent adoption issue.the court of appeal,on the other hand,held,and sharon now argues,that bird motivation is not relevant,and that annette considerable personal interests in vindicating her parental rights disqualifies her from attorney fees.
we need not decide whether the trial court abused its discretion in holding that the costs of the present litigation transcended annette personal interests.as discussed below,we conclude that even if the trial court was within its discretion in so holding,section attorney fees may not be awarded in the present case for a different reason sharon is not the type of party on whom private attorney general fees were intended to be imposed.
sharon litigation is not within the scope of section 
sharon contends that section attorney fees should not be imposed on parties such as herself,an individual who has only engaged in litigation to adjudicate private rights from which important appellate precedent happens to emerge,but has otherwise done nothing to compromise the rights of the public or a significant class of people.we agree.
in evaluating sharon claim,we are mindful that section is an exception to the general rule in california,commonly referred to as the american rule and codified in section,that each party to a lawsuit must ordinarily pay his or her own attorney fees.trope katz cal th,d.in support of the american rule is the argument that since litigation is at best uncertain one should not be penalized for merely defending or prosecuting a lawsuit,and that the poor might be unjustly discouraged from instituting actions to vindicate their rights if the penalty for losing included the fees of their opponents counsel.fleischmann maier brewing,d.
although not explicit in either the statute or case law,it may be supposed that one unspoken justification for departing from the american rule in the case of section private attorney general fees is that it is equitable to impose public interest attorney fees on parties that have done something to adversely affect the public interest.indeed,although no case has explicitly addressed the matter,our review of the case law reveals that in virtually every published case in which section attorney fees have been awarded,the party on whom the fees have been imposed had done something more than prosecute or defend a private lawsuit,but instead had engaged in conduct that in some way had adversely affected the public interest.in woodland hills,for example,the plaintiff was requesting attorney fees for successfully blocking the city of los angeles unlawful approval of a subdivision.woodland hills,supra,cal d at.in serrano priest cal d,in which this court first endorsed the doctrine of private attorney general fees,the historic underlying litigation compelled the state to change its method of distributing school funding to comply with the equal protection clause of the state constitution.in other words,in both these cases,public interest litigation obtained a substantial benefit by causing a change in the defendant behavior,whose actions or failure to act was somehow impairing the statutory or constitutional rights of the public or a significant class of people.and so it is in the other published cases we have reviewed 
to determine whether there is in fact an implicit requirement that the party on whom attorney fees are imposed be responsible for adversely affecting the public interest,we first look first to the words of the statute,because they generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.murphy kenneth cole productions,cal th,d.although the statute does not explicitly address the type of conduct that would make a party liable for attorney fees,it does suggest what conduct the legislature had in mind.section authorizes fees for any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest italics added.the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest implies that those on whom attorney fees are imposed have acted,or failed to act,in such a way as to violate or compromise that right,thereby requiring its enforcement through litigation.it does not appear to encompass the award of attorney fees against an individual who has done nothing to curtail a public right other than raise an issue in the context of private litigation that results in important legal precedent.
we also find support for this interpretation in the legislative history.according to one legislative history document,the purpose of section is to provide statutory authority for an award of attorneys fees in public interest litigation.com.on judiciary,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended may.testimony before the senate committee on the judiciary on behalf of section affirmed that the statute would effectuate the enforcement of laws enacted by the legislature of the state in the public interest.com.on judiciary,hearing on assem.bill reg.sess,testimony of john phillips.as these passages suggest,the legislature was focused on public interest litigation in the conventional sense litigation designed to promote the public interest by enforcing laws that a gover
