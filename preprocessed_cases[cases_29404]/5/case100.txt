this case presents the question of whether appellants,a pair of criminal defense attorneys,committed civil contempt when they accepted legal fees from their client in the face of an earlier protective order restraining the defendant client from disbursing certain assets.
the appellants,attorneys jack hill and kenneth,began representing the client,stephen saccoccia,in and,respectively.saccoccia and his were convicted in and in separate trials their appeals from the criminal convictions were resolved against them in.
the government first sought in to recover virtually all of the fees paid to counsel.the government did not at that time pursue a contempt theory instead,it sought to reach the sums paid to the lawyers both before and after trial as forfeited funds under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et.the district court rejected the government forfeiture claim as to fees paid before the jury verdict of conviction.it allowed the claims for fees paid after the jury verdict but before entry of the judgment of approximately span in.
this court vacated the order as to the fees.the government then tried again,via a motion filed in,to obtain an award of the fees,this time utilizing a civil contempt theory.the district court again agreed and ordered the defense lawyers to turn over these fees to the government.
we reverse.we find that the protective order at issue in this case did not clearly and unambiguously enjoin hill and from accepting the attorneys fees in question,and so the civil contempt finding can not stand.
a.the indictment,protective order,and trial 
in,saccoccia,his wife,and a host of other defendants were indicted for crimes arising out of a scheme to launder million in illegal drug distribution proceeds see united states saccoccia saccoccia v,d.saccoccia,his wife,and several of the other defendants were charged with,inter alia,one count of rico conspiracy.see united states saccoccia saccoccia iv,cir.the indictment contained a forfeiture count for the defendants interests in various assets these included named bank accounts,business property and proceeds including gold and jewelry,and in currency in that such sum in the aggregate represents the proceeds the said defendants obtained directly and indirectly from the racketeering activity.
four days after the initial indictment was returned,the district court,pursuant to d a entered an ex parte protective order the order enjoining saccoccia and the other defendants,and their agents and attorneys,from transferring assets that the government alleged would be forfeitable upon conviction.see saccoccia v,d at.the interpretation of that order is at issue in this case.the order banned the transfer of specific assets,such as certain bank accounts.it also stated that saccoccia and his agents,attorneys and others,shall not,without approval of this court alienate,dissipate,or transfer or take,or cause to be taken,any action which would have the effect of in any way diminishing the value of any property named in attachment a to this order.attachment a includes among the named property the following in currency for which the defendants are jointly and severally liable.
saccoccia attorneys were concerned from the outset about whether any attorneys fees paid by saccoccia would be subject to forfeiture.in early,shortly after saccoccia was indicted,appellant hill and another attorney met with assistant united states attorneys ausas james leavey and michael davitt and asked them about their office policy regarding forfeiture of the fees paid to defense attorneys.see united states saccoccia saccoccia iii,d,aff in part,vacated in part,cir.leavey told them that the attorney office in rhode island had never sought to forfeit reasonable fees paid to attorneys.id.specifically,hill testified that leavey said that he and the government in rhode island had never done that.it was not their policy to do that,and they did not intend to do that,subject to the caveat of reasonableness,in terms that monies received were reasonable,in light of the services rendered and expenses and so forth.however,leavey testified at a forfeiture hearing that he also told the two defense attorneys that day that this case may be the first one where a forfeiture of reasonable attorneys fees would be sought.
a couple of weeks later,hill and the other attorney again met with leavey,this time to discuss the possibility of a plea agreement for saccoccia.id.leavey stated during that discussion that if the parties reached agreement on a plea,leavey would include in the written plea agreement a provision that the government would not seek forfeiture of reasonable attorneys fees.id.
later,in the fall of,appellant told leavey that he,too,might represent saccoccia and asked about the government forfeiture policy.id.leavey essentially repeated what he had told hill,stating to that the attorney office in rhode island had never sought to forfeit reasonable attorneys fees.id.later testified that leavey told him during that conversation that leavey was aware that there were other assets out there that had been specifically frozen,and leavey essentially said that if you find an asset which is frozen,you can have it for attorney fees,as long as it reasonable and as long as none of it goes to saccoccia or his wife.also testified that leavey his office had never sought forfeiture of fees and had no intention of doing so in this reiterated to him by the attorney for the district of rhode island during a telephone call shortly after conversation with leavey 
on september,during a hearing before the district court attorneys for saccoccia and other defendants argued in support of their motions to compel the government to reveal precisely which of saccoccia assets it had frozen,and upon what authority,so that defense counsel could look to any unfrozen accounts for legal fees and defense costs.during that hearing,an attorney representing saccoccia suggested that there was a race for the proceeds developing between the government and defense counsel he told the court that he had at one point called ausa leavey to tell him about an unfrozen account in switzerland and leavey replied,do tell me because if you tell me i am going to have to go get it.ausa leavey argued in response that the government should not be forced to specify the frozen accounts for the defense because that would give saccoccia free rein to go to all the other accounts that he has,if he had any at all.he suggested that the defense should instead give the government a list of all of saccoccia assets,and the government would then tell the defense which if any were unfrozen.later in the hearing,he characterized the government position as g ive us assets of a hundred and forty million dollars and everything over that is yours for legal counsel.
the district court denied the defense motions.in so doing,it noted its understanding that the government can not deprive a criminal defendant of his only assets available for attorneys fees without any showing that the assets are connected to illegal activity.however,it said that that was not the situation before the court.the main legal precedent the defense team cited for its position was distinguishable,the court said,because in that case,
the government had left the defendant with nothing but the shirt on his back.so that,in effect,what the government had done was taken all of the assets of the defendant and left the defendant unable to pay counsel.
there been no such showing in this case it would seem to the court that the minimum that the defendants would have to present to the court is something to indicate that the tying up of their assets is depriving them of funds needed to conduct their defense and that is lacking.
saccoccia eventually went to trial on march,the jury found him guilty of one count of rico conspiracy,as well as numerous substantive counts of money laundering and related offenses under,and.the jury determined,as part of its finding as to the substantive counts,that saccoccia had laundered.however,it did not make any finding as to rico forfeiture saccoccia waived jury trial on that issue,and no finding was made as to rico forfeiture prior to sentencing.see united states saccoccia saccoccia i,aff,cir.
the district court sentenced saccoccia on may,to a term of imprisonment and a fine in excess of million the court also,pursuant to rico,ordered saccoccia to forfeit in excess of million.on june,the court issued a written opinion explaining its forfeiture conclusion and reiterating that saccoccia had to forfeit more than million.id.at.judgment of conviction entered on june,the conviction,sentence,fine,and forfeiture were affirmed on appeal in.united states saccoccia saccoccia ii,cir.
b.the fees 
the issues on appeal,more than twelve years after saccoccia conviction,concern the fees received by his attorneys in the period between the jury verdict on march,and the imposition of sentence,opinion on forfeiture,and judgment of conviction,on may,june,and june,respectively.in an earlier proceeding discussed further below,the district court found that appellant hill received a total of in fees.saccoccia iii,d at.of that total,hill received before the jury verdict against saccoccia,while t he remaining was received on march.id.it is this which is still at issue as to hill.all but of hill total fee was paid in the form of checks or wire transfers from a swiss attorney,valentin landman the payments ranged in size from to.id.the remaining was delivered,in cash,to appellant office.id.the date of this cash transfer is not clear stated in a deposition that it was between february and march of,but could not provide a more exact date.
meanwhile,was also receiving payment of his own fees.the district court found that b etween january and april,received approximately.one hundred thousand dollars of that amount was delivered anonymously to his office in cash installments ranging from to.id.the court found that kept of the total as payment for his fees,while the rest was given to him for distribution to attorneys and others.id.received of his total fee before saccoccia was found guilty and the remaining in the weeks after the jury verdict.id.as to,it is the which the government now seeks to recover.
during an august,hearing,testified that various gold and jewelry merchants in rhode island and massachusetts had told him,before saccoccia trial,that they had done legitimate business with saccoccia over the years and that they had records to prove it.also testified that he was told by saccoccia that some of the monies the defense attorneys received as fees were the proceeds of loans saccoccia had made earlier that were being repaid by the debtors,while other funds used for attorneys fees stemmed from loans made to saccoccia by others.specifically,testified that saccoccia said one of the payments consisted of the proceeds of a loan saccoccia had made that had nothing to do with illegality but instead stemmed from his other businesses.also stated that saccoccia told him on several occasions that a large sum of money that had been wired to defense counsel from switzerland for fees stemmed from funds loaned to saccoccia by an individual and a bank.he further testified that he had seen documents that appeared to be loan documents,promissory notes bearing saccoccia signature,which confirmed for him that the latter payments were indeed loan proceeds.he stated loan proceeds that never touched the saccoccia sic hands are not covered by that protective order,i would think.accounts receivable owed to him that never touched his hands and were never in his possession are encompassed by that order either.
c.the first proceeding for forfeiture of attorneys fees 
after the defense attorneys had received the disputed funds but before the filing of any motion seeking a return of fees on grounds of forfeiture,the government sought leave in august,pursuant to k to depose various defense attorneys,including appellants,on the subject of their legal fees and saccoccia assets generally.at a february,hearing on the application,the district court asked ausa leavey whether the purpose of deposing the attorneys to learn about their fees was to forfeit them.leavey replied 
the purpose at this point,your honor,would be to locate the money that saccoccia now has and to seize them sic to satisfy the judgment.if there is a next step after that,in going after attorneys fees that he has already paid the attorneys,we are not at that stage at this point.
the district court granted the government k application on august,pursuant to that order,hill and were deposed on march and.
the government filed a motion on january,based on the deposition testimony and evidence from the criminal trials,seeking to compel hill,and several other defense attorneys involved in the saccoccia case to turn over their fees.specifically,the government sought the return of from hill and from.it argued that the fees were forfeitable under c,which applies to proceeds of a rico conspiracy that have been transferred by a defendant to another person,or m,which makes other property of a defendant forfeitable as substitute assets when the proceeds can not be located.see saccoccia iii,d at.alternatively,the government argued that if the fees were not forfeitable under c or m,they were forfeitable nonetheless because they had been transferred in violation of the order.id.this was purely a statutory rico forfeiture argument and not a contempt argument.id.at.
on july,the district court issued its decision,finding for the government in part and ordering hill and to disgorge and,respectively.id.those were the amounts,the district court found,that hill and had received after the march jury verdict against saccoccia.it reasoned that prior to the verdict,hill and were reasonably without cause to believe the money used to pay them was subject to forfeiture,c,and therefore even though the funds were in fact proceeds of money laundering violations,they were not forfeitable under c.saccoccia iii,d at.the same result did not obtain for fees,the court held,because a t that point,there no longer was any reasonable doubt about the saccoccias guilt,and it had become clear that virtually all of their assets were proceeds of their rico violations.id.emphasis added.
the district court rejected the government alternative argument that all the fees,including verdict payments,had to be disgorged because their acceptance violated the order.it wrote that the argument does not withstand scrutiny.id.at.the court explained 
the mere fact that an order is entered enjoining the transfer of property does not make the property forfeitable.nor does the property become forfeitable solely because it is transferred in violation of such an order.if that were so,property described in or transferred in violation of such an order would become forfeitable even if it,later,was determined not to be property described in subsection a of.such legal alchemy would violate the plain language of subsection d.
id.at quoting d.
hill and appealed,arguing that the district court order was improper because they had already spent the fees in question.saccoccia iv,at.this court agreed,holding that the substitute assets provision,m,plainly does not afford an avenue through which the government may reach a third party untainted assets as a substitute for tainted assets which the third party had already transferred prior to the date of forfeiture.saccoccia iv,at.we vacated the portion of the district court decision requiring hill and to forfeit their fees and remanded for further proceedings.id.at.
d.the attempt to recover fees on a civil contempt theory 
on february,in the wake of this court decision in saccoccia iv,the government filed a motion seeking to compel hill and to turn over the money still at received by hill and the received by after march,the ground that,in accepting those fees,the attorneys had committed civil contempt by violating the protective order.the district court accepted this argument on october,it found hill and in contempt and ordered that they disgorge the fees.saccoccia v,d at.
in its decision,the district court examined whether the government had established,by clear and convincing evidence,that the attorneys had engaged in civil contempt.it utilized the usual civil contempt inquiry whether the alleged contemnor had notice of the order whether the order was clear,definite,and unambiguous whether the alleged contemnor had the ability to comply with the order and whether the alleged contemnor violated the order.id.at.there was no doubt that the attorneys had notice of the order.id.at.as to prong,hill and had argued that the order was unclear,inter alia,because it was impossible for them to determine whether a particular one hundred dollar bill paid to them as part of their fees came from the specific million in currency that had been enjoined.id.at.the district court rejected this argument,writing 
hill and appear to rely on what some courts have referred to as the four corners rule which states that prohibited conduct must be ascertainable from the four corners of the order.however,that reliance is misplaced.the four corners rule simply requires that the prohibited conduct be clearly described in the order itself.in this case,the protective order does clearly describe the prohibited conduct.it specifically enjoins the transfer of the in currency for which the defendants are jointly and severally liable.
id.citation omitted.the court found that the attorneys could have complied with the order by simply refusing to accept fees.id.finally,the court found that the order had been violated because there is no question that the fees at issue were part of the referred to in the protective order.id.
hill and timely appealed 
in civil contempt cases,we first look to the text of the order to determine whether it is clear.as to findings of fact,we review for clear error,while t he trial court ultimate finding on contempt is reviewed for abuse of discretion.project kemp,cir.importantly,though,our review will proceed more searchingly when,as here,we are confronted with a finding of contempt than when we are called upon to consider a finding exonerating a putative contemnor from a charged contempt.id.at.
substantive principles of civil contempt 
civil contempt may be imposed to compel compliance with a court order or to compensate a party harmed by.mccomb jacksonville paper.however,r ecognizing the contempt power virility and damage potential,courts have created a number of prudential principles designed to oversee its deployment.project,at.as the district court properly noted,the proof must establish that the alleged contemnor had notice that he was within the order ambit,id.at that the order was clear and unambiguous,accusoft palo,cir quoting project,at that the alleged contemnor had the ability to comply,see united states rylander,d stating that where compliance is impossible,neither the moving party nor the court has any reason to proceed with the civil contempt action and that the order was indeed violated,project,at.this court has sometimes combined the related clear and unambiguous and violation prongs,asking whether the putative contemnor has violated an order that is clear and unambiguous.id.when the question turns on findings of fact,a complainant must prove civil contempt by clear and convincing evidence.id.internal quotation marks omitted quoting langton johnston,cir.
we focus on the clear and unambiguous prong together with the violation prong.this court has,over the years,provided guidance as to how the clear and unambiguous requirement should be analyzed.first,t he test is whether the putative contemnor is able to ascertain from the four corners of the order precisely what acts are forbidden.goya foods,wallack mgmt,cir quoting gilday dubois,cir.the purpose of this four corners rule is to assist the potential contemnor by narrowly cabining the circumstances in which contempt may be found.it is because t he consequences that attend the violation of a court order are potentially dire,project,at,that courts must read court decrees to mean rather precisely what they say,id.quoting nba properties,gold,cir.as the supreme court has written 
the judicial contempt power is a potent weapon.when it is founded upon a decree too vague to be understood,it can be a deadly one.congress responded to that danger by requiring that a federal court frame its orders so that those who must obey them will know what the court intends to require and what it means to forbid.
int l longshoremen ass philadelphia marine trade ass n,d identifying the specificity requirements of.d as relevant to certain contempt inquiries see also sanders air line pilots ass n,int l,cir.along the same lines,we must read any ambiguities or omissions in a court order as redound ing to the benefit of the person charged with contempt.nba properties,at second alteration in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
finally,if the clear and unambiguous test is to have any content,it can not be applied in the abstract.the question is not whether the order is clearly worded as a general matter instead,the clear and unambiguous prong requires that the words of the court order have clearly and unambiguously forbidden the precise conduct on which the contempt allegation is based.see perez danbury,cir rejecting district court finding that an order was clear and unambiguous where the district court appeared to rule in a vacuum and failed to evaluate whether the order was clear and unambiguous with reference to the conduct in question.the order in this case,therefore,must have left no reasonable doubt that an attorney would be violating its terms were that attorney to accept the verdict attorneys fees in question.project,at.
application of the civil contempt requirements 
we discuss two,the meaning of the order,and second,the adequacy of the evidence to show that the payments came out of assets restricted by the order.the two issues are interconnected.the clarity of the order is judged in connection with the facts presented.here,as we discuss,the order does not say that all of saccoccia assets are restricted,nor does it say that all assets received from saccoccia become restricted on a finding of guilt.as to the evidence,the government did not prove that these particular payments to the attorneys came out of restricted assets.
the order text and context 
the relevant portion of the order states that it barred saccoccia and his attorneys from alienating,dissipating,or transferring in currency for which the defendants are jointly and severally liable.
it is true that the purpose of the order was to preserve assets so that they would be available for later forfeiture should the government prevail on its forfeiture claim.beyond that,however,the exact relationship between the forfeiture laws and the order was not specified.more fundamentally,we think that the order did not clearly establish that there were no assets from which fees could be paid.
the phrase in currency does not itself identify assets or state whether it is inclusive of all assets belonging to saccoccia.further,the order did not itself distinguish between tainted and substitute assets it instead referred only to assets for which saccoccia is jointly and severally liable.a reasonable person,reading the order in,could have had legitimate doubts as to whether it restrained any substitute assets,as defined by m.indeed,that year,several courts held that such substitute assets may not be restrained prior to conviction.see,in re assets of martin,cir holding that d a does not authorize restraints on substitute assets 
thus the order,when issued,could have been interpreted in various ways.it could have meant that the court believed that all of saccoccia assets were tainted and that none could be used to pay attorneys fees but it did not say that expressly or even impliedly.it could have meant that at least million in assets had to be preserved for the government,and that any party,including a lawyer,seeking payment of any kind from the saccoccia coffers had to satisfy the court that he was being paid from the unprotected excess or would risk losing the assets.but it did not expressly say that either.it also could have been read to mean that the government had the right to identify up to million in tainted assets that would be frozen,but also bore the burden of making specific identifications,leavi
