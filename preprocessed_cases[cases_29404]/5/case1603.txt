the plaintiffs in this case david bergstein and affiliated business entities sued the lawyers who represented their adversaries david molner and others in litigation over various financial transactions.plaintiffs asserted that the lawyers engaged in illegal conduct when they solicited and received confidential,privileged,proprietary information from plaintiffs former attorney,and used that information in devising the legal strategy to be employed in the litigation against plaintiffs.
the defendant lawyers filed a special motion to strike the complaint under code of civil procedure section,the strategic lawsuit against public participation statute.the trial court granted the motion and awarded attorney fees to defendants.the court concluded the complaint arose from protected first amendment activity there was insufficient evidence to show defendants conduct was illegal as a matter of law and plaintiffs did not show a probability of prevailing on their claims,both because the statute of limitations had run and because the litigation privilege barred plaintiffs claims.
we affirm the trial court orders.
the background 
plaintiffs are involved in acquiring,producing and distributing motion pictures,as well as in commercial transactions in other business sectors.their activities require the involvement of entities or individuals willing to provide financing.david molner and entities he controlled aramid entertainment fund limited and others aramid participated in a number of financial transactions relating to plaintiffs film production and distribution business,making a series of loans to plaintiffs from to.
in,the business relationship between plaintiffs and aramid became highly adversarial.molner and aramid hired defendants stroock and stroock and lavan llp and its partner,daniel rozansky,and levene neale bender yoo brill and its partners,david neale,irving gross,and beth young to represent them in litigation against plaintiffs.plaintiffs describe this as molner and aramid war and a fight to the death litigation struggle that spawned numerous lawsuits in california,new york,and elsewhere.the levene neale firm was to craft and institute involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against plaintiffs and affiliated entities,and the stroock firm was to construct and implement a litigation strategy against plaintiffs and affiliated entities that involved filing a series of lawsuits at or about the same time as the involuntary bankruptcy proceedings were initiated.
attorney susan tregub was plaintiff bergstein lawyer for over a decade,and she represented the other plaintiff entities as well.she was intimately familiar with and had access to plaintiffs confidential,privileged and proprietary information,including core operating and financial documents,electronic records and other records,and was the custodian of critical documents related to plaintiffs.she effectively served as plaintiffs general counsel,maintaining an office in the same suite with some of the plaintiff companies,and was paid a monthly retainer.
in late,tregub and plaintiff bergstein had a falling out over fees,and tregub threatened bergstein that she would bring him down.
on march,aramid,represented by the stroock firm,sued plaintiff bergstein for breach of personal guarantees given to secure loans from aramid,and at about the same time,the levene neale firm,on behalf of creditors including aramid,filed involuntary bankruptcy petitions against affiliated entities of plaintiffs.
tregub,despite her previous and to some extent continuing representation of plaintiffs,began working for aramid and david molner in november or december.she coordinated and organized the filing of the involuntary bankruptcy proceedings,and she assisted aramid in the litigation against plaintiffs arising out of loan transactions in which she had been directly involved even though aramid interests were clearly directly adverse to plaintiffs interests.
on march,bergstein and other plaintiffs sued tregub for breach of fiduciary duty and professional negligence,ultimately in august obtaining a multimillion dollar verdict and punitive damages.
the complaint 
on april,two years or so after filing suit against tregub,plaintiffs filed this lawsuit against defendants,alleging causes of action for aiding and abetting tregub breach of fiduciary duty interference with contractual relations and prospective economic advantage and unjust enrichment.in addition to the facts we have just recited and other colorful but irrelevant matters,the complaint alleged,by way of introduction,that 
in the course of their representation of aramid,defendants knowingly used the confidential,privileged,proprietary information of plaintiffs and affiliated entities to carry out a litigation attack on plaintiffs.defendants solicited and received this confidential,privileged,proprietary information from susan tregub,plaintiffs former attorney.tregub admittedly concealed material evidence at defendants direction.
during the period prior to the filing of legal proceedings against plaintiffs,defendants received a steady flow of confidential,privileged,proprietary information from tregub to assist them in their efforts.they exchanged drafts of pleadings with her,emailed back and forth about various issues,and participated in telephone conference calls and in person meetings while tregub was present defendants knowingly received from tregub confidential,privileged,proprietary information about bergstein,his business dealings,and the various entities through which he conducted business.defendants knowingly used tregub assistance in devising the legal strategy to be employed against bergstein they used tregub to obtain documents,identify witnesses,and solicit potential creditors 
defendants actions have caused plaintiffs to be involved in lengthy,protracted,contentious,and expensive legal proceedings t he litigations,litigation fees and costs,resources devoted to the litigations,and negative publicity accompanying the litigations have resulted in nearly incalculable injury and damage to plaintiffs business interests 
the substantive allegations of the complaint appear in paragraphs through of the complaint.part i allegations describe the background giving rise to the underlying litigation described ante.part ii and part iii allegations describe,respectively,defendants preparation for a litigation war against plaintiffs and defendants improper use of plaintiffs confidential information,in preparation for the litigation and after it was filed.part iv allegations describe plaintiffs lawsuit against tregub for professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty and defendants resistance to discovery demands in that lawsuit.part v allegations allege defendants knowledge of tregub representation of plaintiffs,and part vi allegations describe plaintiffs damages.
we begin with a sampling of the substantive allegations of the complaint.plaintiffs allege 
aramid and defendants began working with tregub to initiate legal proceedings against plaintiffs beginning in november or december.this involved two projects,a master complaint against bergstein and several affiliated entities and the involuntary bankruptcy petitions.both projects involved defendants knowing solicitation,receipt,and use of plaintiffs confidential,privileged,proprietary information.
prior to december,stroock and rozansky began drafting the master complaint.tregub revised the draft,and b y working on and assisting with the preparation of the master complaint,tregub provided confidential information about plaintiffs to stroock and rozansky,who took and used this confidential information without plaintiff consent 
during the preparation of the master complaint,stroock and rozansky invited tregub to attend strategy sessions,at which they strategized about ways to put maximum pressure on plaintiffs including by the litigation contemplated in the master complaint and parallel bankruptcy proceedings.
stroock and rozansky used the master complaint containing plaintiffs confidential information as the basis for the complaints they intended to file solicited advice and support from the levene neale defendants regarding the planned litigation for aramid and u ltimately,stroock and rozansky,on behalf of aramid and working in conjunction with tregub,filed multiple lawsuits in federal and state court against certain plaintiffs.
as stroock and rozansky knew,the factual information supporting the claims that were asserted were derived from the master complaint that tregub and defendants drafted 
in addition,defendants participated in preparing papers in another action seeking a temporary restraining order,and rozansky sought and received from tregub information regarding the relationships between bergstein and others,as well as documents that tregub obtained while she represented plaintiffs.
tregub also worked with defendants levene neale and its partners to prepare petitions,motions,and other papers necessary to force the entities affiliated with bergstein into involuntary bankruptcy.the complaint then describes the consultations and communications between tregub and the levene neale firm,and alleges the firm solicitation and use of the information tregub provided,including preparation of a master strategy memorandum,identification of entities to be placed in bankruptcy,and communications on that subject.in addition,the levene neale firm orchestrated the improper purchase of a claim against entities affiliated with plaintiffs,for use in the involuntary bankruptcy proceedings,by working with tregub and using confidential information she provided the complaint gives examples of communications on this topic.
a levene neale partner worked with and directed tregub in contacting former employees of entities to prepare declarations in support of an emergency order appointing a trustee.levene neale filed the bankruptcy petitions and motion communicated with tregub on strategy and so on.the complaint describes other efforts by the stroock firm,involving involuntary bankruptcy proceedings in other jurisdictions,to acquire claims against another company to which bergstein had lent millions of dollars,and to scour the globe to locate other potential creditors of that company.
the complaint also alleges that after months of participating in communications involving tregub,defendants attempted to hide their conduct by forwarding emails to and from tregub through an intermediary,using a pivot and pass strategy,with tregub proving information to aramid,and aramid forwarding the information to defendants.
defendants continued to assist tregub in breaching her duties even after the various lawsuits were filed.
the complaint then describes the lawsuit plaintiffs filed against tregub on march,for professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty the tregub case their requests for discovery from tregub and subpoenas for documents from defendants and defendants repeated refusals to abide by their discovery obligations in the tregub case the complaint alleges that when defendants began working with tregub,they were aware tregub represented plaintiffs in the past and continued to represent plaintiffs and affiliated entities in ongoing litigation.
the complaint describes plaintiffs nearly insurmountable damage and injury to their business operations since the filing of the bankruptcy proceedings and the loan litigation,and alleges their value and businesses are diminished by and bergstein lost the benefit of his miramax deal because of the ongoing litigation.
the anti slapp motion 
defendants filed special motions to strike the complaint under the statute.their motions alleged plaintiffs claims were based on defendants conduct in filing litigation filing litigation is protected activity under the statute and plaintiffs could not prevail on their claims because the claims were barred both by the statute of limitations and by the litigation privilege.
plaintiffs opposition contended their claims did not arise from protected activity.they asserted that the complaint alleged defendants participated in the theft of confidential and privileged documents and information,and in the unlawful purchase of claims for the purpose of forcing an involuntary bankruptcy,and that this was nonlitigation conduct not protected under the statute,separate and distinct from defendants ultimate filing of any litigation.plaintiffs asserted their claims are based on the other conduct rather than statements made in connection with litigation and their relation to litigation is merely incidental.the gravamen of their complaint,they contended,was tregub blatant disregard of her duty of loyalty to her clients and theft of privileged and confidential information and,of course,defendant participation in those unlawful acts.
plaintiffs opposition included more than pages of documents,including dozens of email communications among tregub,molner and various defendants,and asserted that defendants conduct was not protected by the statute because the conduct was illegal as a matter of law.on this last point,the entirety of plaintiffs argument was this here,defendants engaged in conduct that they knew was illegal.they used tregub inside information to buy bankruptcy claims despite knowing that to do so was unlawful.see,app.federal rules of bankruptcy procedure,rule improper to purchase claims to force involuntary bankruptcy.they offer no defense to their active participation in illegal activities,and the statute offers no protection for defendants participation in illegal activities.in any event,plaintiffs contended,they showed a likelihood of prevailing on the statute of limitations and litigation privilege defenses asserted by defendants.
the trial court,in a thorough page decision,granted the special motion to strike,and later awarded defendants in attorney fees.plaintiffs appealed from both orders.
discussion 
a defendant may bring a special motion to strike any cause of action arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states constitution or the california constitution in connection with a public issue.code civ,subd.b.when ruling on an motion,the trial court employs a process.it first looks to see whether the moving party has made a threshold showing that the challenged causes of action arise from protected activity.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,equilon.if the moving party meets this threshold requirement,the burden then shifts to the other party to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on its claims.ibid.in making these determinations,the trial court considers the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based,subd.b.our review is de novo.soukup law offices of herbert hafif cal th,fn.soukup.
in this case,plaintiffs first contend that,as a threshold matter,the statute does not apply because defendants engaged in unlawful acts that are not protected by the statute.they further contend that c laims arising from aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duties are not subject to the statute,even if they occur in the context of litigation.they contend their claims are not barred by the statute of limitations or the litigation privilege,and they should have been permitted to amend their complaint to rais e claims.
we find no merit in any of plaintiffs contentions,and address them in turn.
the first prong of the statute protected activity 
the moving party has the initial burden of making a prima facie showing that one or more causes of action arise from protected activity.equilon,supra,cal th at see code civ,subd.e.
statements made in litigation,or in connection with litigation,are protected by code of civil procedure section,subdivision e.briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th.courts have taken a fairly expansive view of what constitutes activity for purposes of section.see kashian harriman th.in making a prima facie showing,however,it is not enough to establish that the action was filed in response to or in retaliation for a party exercise of the right to petition.navellier sletten cal th,city of cotati cashman cal th.rather,the claim must be based on the protected petitioning activity.navellier,at.
when a cause of action involves both protected and unprotected activity,the court looks to the gravamen of the claim to determine if the claim is a slapp.peregrine funding,sheppard mullin richter hampton llp th,peregrine funding.protected conduct which is merely incidental to the claim does not fall within the ambit of code of civil procedure section.martinez metabolife,th,peregrine funding,supra,at.determining the gravamen of the claims requires examination of the specific acts of alleged wrongdoing and not just the form of the claim.peregrine funding,supra,at.
a.the illegality claim 
plaintiffs first argue that the statute does not apply because defendants conduct was illegal as a matter of law,relying on flatley mauro cal th flatley.
in flatley,the court held that a defendant whose assertedly protected speech or petitioning activity was illegal as a matter of law,and therefore unprotected by constitutional guarantees of free speech and petition,can not use the statute to strike the plaintiff complaint.flatley,supra,cal th at.the court stated the rule this way where either the defendant concedes,or the evidence conclusively establishes,that the assertedly protected speech or petition activity was illegal as a matter of law,the defendant is precluded from using the statute to strike the plaintiff action.id.at.in flatley,an attorney communications to the plaintiff a demand letter and subsequent telephone calls constituted criminal extortion as a matter of law and so were unprotected.id.at.the evidence of the defendant communications was uncontroverted.id.at.the court emphasized that its conclusion that the defendant communications constituted criminal extortion as a matter of law was based on the specific and extreme circumstances of this case.id.at,fn.
plaintiffs contend that conclusive evidence that a violation of any state statute has occurred is sufficient to trigger application of the illegality exception and bar a defendant from seeking the protection of the law.here,they say,their evidence conclusively established that defendants aided and abetted tregub violation of business and professions code section,subdivision e section provides that it is the duty of an attorney t o maintain inviolate the confidence,and at every peril to himself or herself to preserve the secrets,of his or her client.
we reject plaintiffs contention for two reasons.first,case authorities after flatley have found the flatley rule applies only to criminal conduct,not to conduct that is illegal because in violation of statute or common law.and second,even if we accept the contention that the illegality exception may in some circumstances apply to statutory violations that are not criminal conduct,we could not apply the illegality exception in this case.as we explain post,plaintiffs opposition papers in the trial court failed even to cite the statutory violation on which they now rely and that omission is fatal under the supreme court authority plaintiffs cite to support their contention.
i.the cases 
in mendoza adp screening and selection services,th mendoza,a panel of this court expressly rejected the plaintiff contention that every violation of a statutory prohibition necessarily removes the violator out from under the protective umbrella of the statute.id.at.mendoza explained 
our reading of flatley leads us to conclude that the supreme court use of the phrase illegal was intended to mean criminal,and not merely violative of a statute.first,the court in flatley discussed the attorney underlying conduct in the context of the penal code criminalization of extortion.second,a reading of flatley to push any statutory violation outside the reach of the statute would greatly weaken the constitutional interests which the statute is designed to protect.as the defendant correctly observes,a plaintiff complaint always alleges a defendant engaged in illegal conduct in that it violated some common law standard of conduct or statutory prohibition,giving rise to liability,and we decline to give plaintiffs a tool for avoiding the application of the statute merely by showing any statutory violation.mendoza,supra,th at,id.at the defendant republishing to its clients of information disclosed on megan law web site was protected activity,notwithstanding statutory prohibitions on the use of such information.
other courts have taken the same view,and fremont reorganizing faigin th fremont is particularly germane.in that case,the plaintiff argued that statements by the defendant lawyer to the insurance commissioner violated his duties of confidentiality and loyalty owed to the plaintiff as a former client,so his conduct was illegal and could not be protected activity under the flatley rule.the court,in an opinion by justice croskey,disagreed,citing several court of appeal opinions,including mendoza,that have rejected attempts to apply the rule from flatley to noncriminal conduct.fremont held,c onsistent with these authorities,that the rule from flatley is limited to criminal conduct.conduct in violation of an attorney duties of confidentiality and loyalty to a former client can not be illegal as a matter of law within the meaning of flatley,so the statute is not inapplicable on this basis.id.at.
for similar conclusions,see price operating engineers local union th,price rejecting claim that a union allegedly defamatory statements in flyers were not covered under the statute because defamatory speech is illegal t he term illegal in flatley means criminal,not merely violative of a statute see also cross cooper th,even if the plaintiff conclusively demonstrated that the defendant disclosure of information on the location of a registered sex offender was unauthorized as a matter of law,under mendoza,that unauthorized,but noncriminal,conduct would not preclude protection gerbosi gaims,weil,west epstein,llp th,we understand flatley to stand for this proposition when a defendant assertedly protected activity may or may not be criminal activity,the defendant may invoke the statute unless the activity is criminal as a matter of law.intelligator th,failure to comply with rule of the california rules of court is not the type of criminal activity addressed in flatley cabral martins th,the defendant attorneys actions in probate proceedings and litigation defense were neither inherently criminal nor otherwise outside the scope of normal,routine legal services even if their actions had the effect of defeating or forestalling the plaintiff ability to execute her judgment for child support,thereby according to the plaintiff violating the child support evasion statutes,this is not the kind of illegality involved in flatley.
ii.the soukup case 
plaintiffs resist the conclusion in the cases,relying on soukup,supra,cal th,a decision filed the same day as flatley.soukup involved the enacted slappback statute code civ,and the court said that an illegal act is an act f orbidden by law,and that the term illegal,as used in the slappback statute,was not intended to refer only to criminal violations.soukup,at fn.according to plaintiffs,the supreme court discussion of illegality in soukup signaled that the flatley rule is not limited to criminal conduct and instead extends to any unlawful activities.
the courts that subsequently decided fremont,mendoza,price and the other pertinent authorities,however,did not get this signal.that is because the slappback statute is a very different law with a very different purpose,as soukup itself makes clear.a slappback is a malicious prosecution or abuse of process lawsuit that arises from the filing or maintenance of an earlier cause of action that has been dismissed as a slapp.the legislature expressly stated that a slappback cause of action should be treated differently from an ordinary malicious prosecution action because a slappback is consistent with the legislature intent to protect the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of free speech and petition by its deterrent effect on slapp litigation and by its restoration of public confidence in participatory democracy.code of civ,subd.a.
as soukup points out,code of civil procedure section treats slappbacks differently from ordinary malicious prosecution actions in two ways.first,it makes inapplicable to special motions to strike a slappback certain procedures that would normally apply to such motions and sets forth different procedures.soukup,supra cal th at.after describing these differences,the court continued the import of these provisions is to stack the procedural deck in favor of the slappback plaintiff confronted with a special motion to strike.id.at.the second way in which section treats slappbacks differently from ordinary malicious prosecution actions is to provide a limited exemption for slappbacks from the statute in subdivision h.that subdivision provides a special motion to strike may not be filed against a slappback by a party whose filing or maintenance of the prior cause of action from which the slappback arises was illegal as a matter of law,subd.h.ibid.
it was in this context that the soukup court observed that the term illegal as a matter of law included statutory violations that were not criminal in soukup,a labor code violation was at issue.not only was the context different slappback suits rather than slapp suits but also the court was careful to specify the narrowness of its holding i f a defendant assertedly protected constitutional activity is alleged to have been illegal and,therefore,outside the ambit of the statute,the illegality must be established as a matter of law either through the defendant concession or because the illegality is conclusively established by the evidence presented in connection with the motion to strike.soukup,supra,cal th at.thus soukup cited paul for council hanyecz th paul,disapproved on other grounds in equilon,supra,cal th at page,footnote,where the defendants own moving papers show ed that they in fact did violate the political reform act when they laundered campaign contributions paul,supra,at soukup,at.
further,soukup tells us that,in slappback cases,the burden of establishing that the underlying action was illegal as a matter of law is the plaintiff burden.soukup,supra,cal th at.and,in demonstrating the illegality,the plaintiff must identify with particularity the statute or statutes violated by the filing and maintenance of the underlying action.citation.this requirement of identifying a specific statute prevents a plaintiff from advancing a generalized claim that a defendant conduct was illegal and provides notice to both the defendant and the court about the particular statute or statutes the defendant is alleged to have violated as a matter of law so as to allow the defendant to intelligibly respond to,and the court to assess,the claim.additionally,the plaintiff must show the specific manner in which the statute or statutes were violated with reference to their elements.a generalized assertion that a particular statute was violated by the filing or maintenance of the underlying action without a particularized showing of the violation will be insufficient to demonstrate illegality as a matter of law.soukup,supra,cal th at.
plaintiffs opposition to the special motion to strike did not comply with soukup requirement that plaintiffs provide notice to both the defendant and the court as to the particular statute they asserted defendants violated,so as to allow the defendant to intelligibly respond to,and the court to assess,the claim.soukup,supra,cal th at.plaintiffs papers opposing the special motion to strike did not mention business and professions code section plaintiffs first and only mention of section occurred in counsel rebuttal argument at the hearing on the motion,when counsel said that section actually expressly holds or provides that violation of privilege is a tort,and defendants aided and abetted the violation so they are vicariously liable for that tort.as we noted in our recitation of the facts,ante at page,plaintiffs opposition papers claimed only that defendants used tregub inside information to buy bankruptcy claims despite knowing that to do so was unlawful a claim they do not assert on appeal.
we think it fair to assume that had plaintiffs provided the notice required by soukup in their opposition papers,defendants may have disputed one or another element of the claim,such as whether they acted with the intent of facilitating the commission of tregub violation of the statute.see gerard ross d,articulating the knowledge required for aiding and abetting liability a defendant can be held liable as a cotortfeasor on the basis of acting in concert only if he or she knew that a tort had been,or was to be,committed,and acted with the intent of facilitating the commission of that tort.and certainly if defendants had disputed any element of the claim they aided and abetted a violation of business and professions code section,no conclusion could be drawn,as a matter of law,that their conduct was illegal.flatley,supra,cal th at if a factual dispute exists about the legitimacy of the defendant conduct,it can not be resolved within the first step but must be raised by the plaintiff in connection with the plaintiff burden to show a probability of prevailing on the merits.birkner lam th,c onduct that would otherwise come within the scope of the statute does not lose its coverage simply because it is alleged to have been unlawful or unethical.
in short,soukup does not help plaintiffs here.its definition of illegality applied to the slappback statute.and even if soukup broader definition of illegal ity as a matter of law were appropriate for application in the first prong of a slapp analysis,it would be improper to apply it here,where plaintiffs failed to give the notice to both the defendant and the court of the particular statutory violation,as expressly required by soukup.soukup,supra,cal th at.
in sum,soukup does not advance plaintiffs claim of illegality,and the authorities after flatley reject it.
b.the gravamen of the complaint 
plaintiffs next argue that,apart from the illegality claim,their claims do not arise from protected activity.they articulate their contention this way even though the background of this lawsuit is the litigation between molner and bergstein,the defendants here are not being sued because they are molner litigation counsel or for any written or oral statement they made in a judicial proceeding.rather,they are being sued for the unprotected conduct of aiding and abetting the breach of tregub fiduciary duties to plaintiffs,for receiving confidential and privileged information belonging to plaintiffs,for interfering with tregub contractual obligation to plaintiffs to maintain their confidences,and for interfering with bergstein prospective economic advantage.
plaintiffs own words reveal their mistaken view of the applicable legal principles.the statute definitional focus is not the form of the plaintiff cause of action but,rather,the defendant activity that gives rise to his or her asserted liability and whether that activity constitutes protected speech or petitioning.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at.thus we examine the specific acts of wrongdoing alleged,without particular heed to the form of action within which it has been framed peregrine funding,supra,th at,and the critical point is whether the plaintiff cause of action itself was based on an act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech.citations.city of cotati cashman,supra,cal th at.
plainly,aiding and abetting the breach of tregub fiduciary duties and interfering with tregub contractual obligation to plaintiffs to maintain their confidences are the causes of action plaintiffs assert,not the specific acts of alleged wrongdoing that give rise to those causes of action.almost all of the specific acts of alleged wrongdoing in the complaint are litigation activities.we have described the complaint in detail and will not repeat that description here,but the factual basis for defendants allegedly tortious activity is centered in defendants role as counsel for molner and aramid molner enlisted defendants for the litigation prong of his campaign.defendants knowingly used confidential,privileged information to carry out the litigation attack tregub began working with defendants to help coordinate and organize the bankruptcy proceedings.defendants knowingly used tregub assistance in devising the legal strategy to be employed defendants exchanged drafts of pleadings with tregub.stroock and rozansky work ed with tregub to draft multiple lawsuits against plaintiffs.the litigation,litigation fees and costs,and negative publicity have resulted in nearly incalculable injury and on and on.
plaintiffs rely on coretronic cozen th coretronic,but their reliance is misplaced.in coretronic,the plaintiffs disclosed confidential information to the defendant law firm to aid in an evaluation of insurance coverage for a trade dispute lawsuit filed against the plaintiffs,and the defendant law firm at the same time undertook representation,in another matter,of the company e s that was suing the plaintiffs.the plaintiffs sued the law firm,alleging it concealed its status as e s counsel in the other action to gain access to the plaintiffs sensitive information that would benefit e s in its lawsuit against the plaintiffs.id.at.we concluded that the gravamen of the complaint was premised on defendants failure to disclose their representation of e s,while obtaining from plaintiffs their confidential information involving their defense of the lawsuit e s brought against them.id.at.while the concealment occurred in the context of litigation,it was clear that any litigation activity is only incidental to plaintiffs allegations of wrongdoing.ibid.
in short,in coretronic,the lawsuit arose from the law firm concealment of its representation of e s while obtaining plaintiff sensitive information,not from the law firm protected activity representing their clients in pending or threatened litigation.coretronic,supra,th at.as we said there,it is not the law firm advocacy that is the target of the complaint,but rather the fact of the law firm dual representation that was the basis for the plaintiffs claims of concealment and fraud.id.at.in this case,by contrast,it is precisely the defendants advocacy on behalf of their clients in the loan and bankruptcy litigation that forms the basis for all of plaintiffs causes of action.
peregrine funding explains the point nicely plaintiffs argue the fundamental basis or gravamen of their claims rests in the defendant law firm breaches of duty and not its petitioning activity.but the fact is that some of the alleged actions constituting these breaches of duty involved petitioning activity the firm undertook on behalf of its client s ome of the specific conduct complained of involves positions the firm took in court,or in anticipation of litigation we can not conclude these allegations of classic petitioning activity are merely incidental or collateral to plaintiff claims against the law firm.peregrine funding,supra,th at id.at law firm orchestrated the bankruptcies of the and then,after it withdrew from their representation,selectively responded to a discovery request by withholding documents that would have been harmful to themselves these acts appear to constitute protected conduct in that they were litigation tactics the firm employed to benefit its client s position in an ongoing lawsuit.
plaintiffs cite other cases where the plaintiffs have sued their former counsel for breach of the duty of loyalty,and courts have found those claims are not subject to the statute.but in those cases,as in coretronic,the plaintiffs do not challenge the defendant law firm conduct in the litigation coretronic,supra,th at,but instead base their claims on the defendant attorney acceptance of representation adverse to the former client,benasra mitchell silberberg knupp llp th,once the attorney accepts a representation in which confidences disclosed by a former client may benefit the new client due to the relationship between the new matter and the old,he or she has breached a duty of loyalty t he breach of fiduciary duty lawsuit may follow litigation pursued against the former client,but does not arise from it breach of the duty of loyalty occurs whether or not confidences are actually revealed in the adverse action.
here,unlike any of the breach of loyalty cases,the activity that gives rise to defendants asserted liability navellier sletten,supra,cal th at is defendants conduct in receiving and using confidential information to prepare for and prosecute litigation against plaintiffs.in the complaint own words,defendants knowingly used the confidential,privileged,proprietary information of plaintiffs and affiliated entities to carry out a litigation attack on plaintiffs and affiliated entities.defendants litigation activities are at the core of plaintiffs claims.clearly those claims arise from protected activity within the meaning of the statute.
the second prong of the statute the probability of prevailing 
plaintiffs next contend they have in any event shown a probability of prevailing on their claims.they point out that under this second prong of the statute,they need only present evidence that,if believed,would be sufficient to establish a prima facie case and sustain a judgment in their favor.navellier sletten,supra cal th at.defendants assert,however,that plaintiffs can not prevail because their claims are barred as a matter of law,both by the litigation privilege and by the statute of limitations.we agree with both points 
a.the litigation privilege 
a plaintiff can not establish a probability of prevailing if the litigation privilege precludes the defendant liability on the claim.fremont,supra,th at.the litigation privilege is defined in civil code section,subdivision b section b,and precludes liability arising from a publication or broadcast made in a judicial proceeding or other official proceeding.fremont,at.under the usual formulation of the privilege,it applies to any communication made in judicial or proceedings by litigants or other participants authorized by law to achieve the objects of the litigation and that have some connection or logical relation to the action.silberg anderson cal d.many cases have explained that section b encompasses not only testimony in court and statements made in pleadings,but also statements made prior to the filing of a lawsuit,whether in preparation for anticipated litigation or to investigate the feasibility of filing a lawsuit.hagberg california federal bank fsb cal th.
to effect its purposes access to the courts without fear of later harassment by derivative tort actions,encouraging open communication and zealous advocacy,promoting complete and truthful testimony,giving finality to judgments,and avoiding endless litigation the litigation privilege is absolute and applies regardless of malice,and has been given broad application.rusheen cohen cal th.
in a page argument,plaintiffs contend their claims are not barred by the litigation privilege because the complaint does not challenge defendants communicative acts,but rather challenges the lawyers conduct of aiding and abetting tregub breach of fiduciary duty and facilitating tregub breach of contract with plaintiffs.this contention contains the same flaw infecting plaintiffs assertion that their claims do not arise from protected activity the complaint itself plainly demonstrates otherwise.notably,nowhere in plaintiffs argument do they provide record citations for defendants conduct.
plaintiffs tell us that two cases are instructive.one is kimmel goland cal d kimmel and the other is susan israels th israels.in kimmel,the supreme court held that noncommunicative acts specifically,the illegal recording of confidential telephone conversations for the purpose of gathering evidence to be used in future litigation were not privileged.kimmel,at.as the court said,the litigation privilege does not bar recovery for injuries from tortious conduct regardless of the purpose for which such conduct is undertaken.ibid.similarly,in israels,the court held that the litigation privilege does not shield defendants including the lawyer representing the defendant in a criminal proceeding for sexual battery from liability for reading and disseminating the plaintiff private mental health records for the purpose of gathering evidence to be used in the course of a criminal proceeding.israels,at.israels held the plaintiff invasion of privacy action did not depend on the publication or broadcast of her mental health records but rests on the defendant conduct in reading those records conduct that was similar to the defendants conduct of secretly recording telephone conversations in kimmel.israels,at.notably,israels also held that the plaintiff abuse of process and infliction of emotional distress claims,based on subpoenaing,communicating and the plaintiff with her mental health records,were barred by the litigation privilege.id.at.
neither of these cases assists the plaintiffs here,because they do not identify any of defendants conduct that was not a communication made in a judicial proceeding or prior thereto to achieve the objects of the litigation.simply claiming that aiding and abetting tregub breach of fiduciary duty and facilitating tregub breach of contract is conduct does not make it so.
in short,defendants have established all the elements necessary to assert the litigation privilege.as the trial court pointed out,plaintiffs claims are based on allegations that defendants solicited and used confidential information for the purpose of filing various actions against plaintiffs.the complaint expressly alleges communicative activity throughout.these communicative activities of counsel were made in or in anticipation of judicial proceedings,and were plainly made to achieve the objects of the litigation and had some connection or logical relation to the action.silberg anderson,supra,cal d at.consequently,the litigation privilege applies to bar plaintiffs claims.
plaintiffs add a final paragraph to their argument on this point,quoting from rothman jackson th,where the court held that the litigation privilege should not be extended to litigating in the press.see id.at defendants statements at a press conference claiming plaintiff knowingly and intentionally made false accusations against one of defendants in order to extort money from him were not protected by the litigation privilege.from this correct premise,plaintiffs state,without further explanation,that the intentional interference claims based upon defendants false press statements are likewise not covered by the litigation privilege.
while plaintiffs do not cite to the record in their argument,we presume they are referring to an allegation in the introductory section of the complaint,where they allege that stroock partner and well known entertainment transactional lawyer schuyler moore even bragged to the press that his clients,aramid and molner,and his firm would stop at nothing to kill bergstein other business ventures specifically his efforts to arrange for the purchase and sale of miramax from disney.in their opposition,defendants presented an email from a bloomberg news reporter to a lawyer involved in the miramax acquisition,saying that schuyler moore will be quoted saying that creditors of bergstein companies would block any attempt to acquire the film studio miramax.
with that exception,there is nothing in the complaint about any statements by any of the defendants to the press,much less any false statements.nor is it clear that the statement in the reporter email is tortious.the complaint alleges there were many negative articles in the press,written by a reporter who spoke with molner and tregub,that damaged bergstein,and that tregub communicated with reporters and shared plaintiffs and affiliated entities confidential,privileged,proprietary information long before any litigation was filed.but these are not allegations relating to defendants.in short,under rothman jackson,the litigation privilege would not shield defendants from liability based on making false statements to the press,but the complaint makes no such allegations.
b.the statute of limitations 
defendants also contend plaintiffs can not prevail on their claims because they are barred as a matter of law by the statute of limitations.we agree.
under code of civil procedure section section,a n action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission,other than for actual fraud,arising in the performance of professional services shall be commenced within one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,or four years from the date of the wrongful act or omission,whichever occurs first,subd.a.
in this case,plaintiffs filed suit on april.but 
on march,more than two years earlier,plaintiff bergstein and others filed their complaint against tregub for breach of fiduciary duty and professional negligence,alleging that tregub provided confidential information to aramid counsel strook strook sic lavan llp and 
on march,plaintiff bergstein executed a declaration stating that,after he learned of the litigation aramid filed against him and of the involuntary bankruptcy filings by the levene neale firm,he immediately suspected that tregub might be behind both the aramid and the bankruptcy filings.and 
on march,plaintiff bergstein lawyers wrote to rozansky and another lawyer at the stroock firm about the bankruptcy proceedings and the aramid complaint,and said,among other things we have received information that susan tregub has been assisting you and your law firm as well as certain alleged creditors in connection with those proceedings and in connection with the aramid complaint.it further appears that tregub has disclosed to you and your law firm confidential information of plaintiffs that tregub obtained while representing them and,the plaintiffs intend to pursue any and all legal remedies they have that arise out of the use of any and all confidential information and assistance provided by tregub please be aware that we consider any communications between your firm and tregub to be evidence that will have to be produced in any resulting litigation that will hereafter follow to determine the extent to which your firm was complicit in tregub breach of her fiduciary obligations and 
on april,after receiving a letter from stroock lawyer rozansky saying the stroock lawyers had not received confidential information from tregub,plaintiffs lawyers again wrote to the stroock lawyers.they said,for example f or at least the past several months attorneys in your firm have been communicating with tregub,including receiving information from tregub pertaining to some or all of the plaintiffs and their various legal and business affairs.those communications constituted improper dissemination of confidential information and violated privilege,and your firm involvement in these actionable activities will not be tolerated.moreover,your firm may be exposed to independent tort liability and ethics violations for receipt use of such wrongfully obtained information from tregub and plaintiffs reserve all rights related to your conduct.the letter demanded immediate return of all documents in any form between the firm and tregub pertaining to plaintiffs or their business dealings,and demanded the stroock firm cease and desist from engaging in such communications with tregub.also 
on september,counsel for one of the alleged debtors in the involuntary bankruptcy proceedings filed a motion to disqualify the levene neale firm on the ground that the firm knowingly utilized confidential privileged information of alleged debtors obtained by the levene firm from their susan tregub,and knowingly assisted and aided tregub in the violation of her duties of loyalty and confidentiality to the alleged debtors.
on october,in a against stroock client aramid,plaintiffs alleged that aramid aided and abetted tregub to breach her fiduciary duty by inviting tregub to attend strategy sessions with counsel for the aramid defendants,which tregub did attend and participate in,to strategize about ways to put maximum pressure on bergstein,including litigation to be filed against bergstein and others and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings to be filed against affiliated entities 
the documents just described show that,by their own admission,plaintiffs discover ed,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the facts constituting defendants wrongful act
