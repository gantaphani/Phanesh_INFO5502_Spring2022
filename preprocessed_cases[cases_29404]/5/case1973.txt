under the probate code,an attorney for the administrator of an estate may be paid for extraordinary services under a contingency fee agreement if the trial court approves the agreement after a noticed hearing,subd.c.the trial court may dispense with notice for good cause,subd.c.
in this case,the trial court approved an agreement entitling counsel to attorney fees based on hourly rates and the total number of hours worked.the trial court dispensed with notice of the hearing and sealed a portion of the record so that creditors of the estate would not learn about the fee agreement until after they had concluded settlement negotiations with the estate.
counsel managed to resolve most of the creditors claims through settlement,reducing about million in original claims to million in settlements.counsel also obtained about in payments,resulting in an estate with a negative net worth of million.pursuant to the approved agreement,the administrator petitioned the trial court for approximately million in attorney fees.
upon learning of the fee petition,a creditor objected to the agreement on the ground that it left nothing for creditors.the trial court decided not to award fees pursuant to the agreement and instead awarded.
the administrator appeals the trial court order,arguing that counsel was entitled to an award under the agreement.we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion because the agreement was not a contingency fee agreement within the meaning of the probate code,and the trial court erred in dispensing with notice of the hearing.further,the fee award was just and reasonable under the circumstances.we therefore affirm.
background 
on august,dan stevenson killed himself.on january,appellant kenneth petrulis was appointed administrator with will annexed.letters of administration issued two days later.petrulis,an attorney,chose the firm of goodson wachtel goodson,where he worked,to represent the estate.the trial court approved a stipulation providing that petrulis would not share in goodson attorney fees,and goodson would not share in petrulis commissions.
in the first half of,petrulis served notice of the proceedings on creditors.numerous claims,totaling more than million,were filed.several creditors requested special notice of the proceedings.see,all further statutory references are to the probate code unless otherwise indicated.
on march,petrulis filed a petition to establish the estate ownership of property.the petition alleged that stevenson had been insolvent for the last years of his life he had borrowed funds from several creditors lenders,often using the funds from one lender to repay funds borrowed from another lender.stevenson had purchased one or more life insurance policies naming some of the lenders as beneficiaries,who had received policy proceeds after his death.the payment of those proceeds,according to the petition,had the effect of defrauding other creditors.petrulis sought to recover the insurance proceeds as well as double damages see.the petition was served on the lenders.
in april and may,several lenders filed objections to the petition.in june,petrulis filed a reply to the objections,explaining that the lenders had charged usurious interest on the loans,and some of the lenders had defrauded other creditors through the receipt of life insurance proceeds.petrulis argued that the lenders,collectively,constituted a single joint venture or partnership.
in subsequent amended petitions,filed in september and february,petrulis alleged that the lenders had charged usurious rates and defrauded other creditors by accepting assignments of the life insurance proceeds.he sought to recover usury penalties and specified interest payments,reduce the balance of the loans by the amount of interest paid,and recover property fraudulently transferred to other creditors.
on august,petrulis filed an ex parte petition,seeking the trial court approval of three agreements related to goodson compensation as counsel for the estate.the petition recited that the estate had no assets to inventory the estate primary asset was a claim against the lenders for the recovery of insurance proceeds and a potential recovery of usurious interest the estate also had a claim against prudential insurance company of america prudential for wrongfully paying proceeds to certain lenders under two life insurance policies and wrongfully withholding proceeds from the estate under a third policy the lenders claims against the estate exceeded million and the estate was without resources to defend itself against the lenders and to pursue its own claims.
petrulis requested that the trial court dispense with notice of the petition to the lenders,other creditors,and prudential on the ground that knowledge of the details and structure of the agreements would put the estate at a disadvantage in the litigation.petrulis also sought to dispense with notice for the sake of expediency in light of an impending trial date in one matter.the petition stated that t he creation of a pool of assets for the estate will permit those creditors who are owed money to receive some or all of the amounts owed.
in one of the proposed agreements,barbara stevenson,the decedent surviving spouse,sole beneficiary,and trustee of the stevenson family trust,agreed to loan the estate for litigation costs,with the remaining costs to be advanced by goodson.in another agreement,the estate agreed that goodson would be paid on a contingency fee basis in bringing suit against prudential goodson was entitled to percent of any recovery obtained before a trial became probable,percent thereafter.
the third proposed agreement,the lodestar fee agreement,stated that goodson would be paid its normal hourly rates multiplied by a factor of two hundred percent for work on claims involving the lenders,plus reimbursement of costs.the multiplier was said to be appropriate given the contingent nature of the payment of said fees and the deferral of the payment of said fees,if at all.the lodestar fee agreement further provided if the assets of the estate after payment of all other statutory attorney fees and costs,representative commissions and any other administrative costs net assets are not adequate to pay the attorney fees in full,goodson agrees to reduce its attorney fees to an amount equal to the greater of the net assets available in the estate which are payable to and are paid to goodson or goodson normal hourly rates without a multiplier.and if the net assets were not adequate to pay goodson using its normal hourly rates,barbara was personally obligated to make up the difference,not to exceed.goodson was to have a lien on the estate claims and any recovery.
on september,after a hearing attended by petrulis and an attorney representing barbara,the trial court,commissioner ronald hauptman presiding,dispensed with notice of the petition,approved the three agreements,and ordered the petition to be sealed until all litigation matters had been resolved.
respondent william wilks had filed a creditor claim against the estate,seeking million in unpaid loans and interest.he had also requested special notice.after negotiations with the estate,wilks reduced his claim to.at the time,he did not know about the existence or approval of the lodestar fee agreement.the estate accepted wilks compromise,agreeing not to contest it or seek to increase or decrease the amount.the trial court approved the settlement.
the estate engaged in settlement negotiations with other lenders,working with a forensic accountant in that effort.the estate was successful in negotiating a reduction in the amounts of almost all claims some lenders agreed that they owed money to the estate.upon petition by petrulis,the trial court approved the settlements with these lenders,around in all.
on august,petrulis filed a petition for the payment of attorney fees pursuant to the lodestar fee agreement.a hearing was scheduled for september.according to the petition,goodson had spent hours on the lenders claims,which had initially totaled about million.through settlement,goodson had reduced that amount to around million.in addition,certain lenders had agreed to pay money to the estate,totaling.the estate therefore had a negative net worth of about million.
in the petition,petrulis contended that,based on normal hourly rates,goodson would be entitled to in attorney fees.but using the multiplier set forth in the lodestar fee agreement,petrulis actually requested fees of million,plus in costs.notice of the hearing on the petition was served on,among others,creditors who had requested special notice.
after receipt of the notice,wilks filed objections to the petition.he pointed out he had never been given notice of the lodestar fee agreement or an opportunity to object to it.he asserted that goodson had induced him to reduce his million claim to around by telling him he would probably get on the dollar of his compromised claim.wilks argued that goodson petition,if granted,would leave the estate with no assets for same situation that existed before goodson did any work for the estate.thus,goodson efforts would have generated attorney fees,nothing more.
at the hearing on the petition,petrulis recommended that the trial court make an interim award of.the trial court awarded and continued proceedings on the issue pending mediation of claims the estate had brought against barbara and the family trust.the mediation was unsuccessful.
on april,the trial court,judge warren ettinger presiding,conducted a trial on petrulis fee petition and the estate claims against barbara and the trust.petrulis testified that,in seeking approval of the lodestar fee agreement,he had wanted to dispense with notice because t he terms of the fee agreement would reveal our litigation strategy and give an advantage to the people we were suing.
the proceedings resumed on may.at the end of the session,the trial court commented that goodson had done a heroic job on behalf of the estate,and petrulis testimony had been flawless.but the court expressed concern with the idea that the lawyers are the only ones who are going to get the money and elaborated t his is not,in my opinion,a lodestar case.it is going to happen.i wish i could tell the lawyers for the estate they were going to get paid their money,but i am going to make an award that i believe is an appropriate award,and i hope that they are successful when it comes to the insurance company so there is enough money in the pot so that they can get paid.the court took the matter under submission.
in a statement of decision filed july,the trial court found in favor of barbara and the family trust on all claims.the court did not rule on the fee petition at that time.in fact,more than days after taking the attorney fee issue under submission,the trial court still had not issued a ruling on the petition.
on december,petrulis filed a petition for writ of mandate with this court,seeking a peremptory writ directing the trial court to issue a ruling on the attorney for petition.on january,we filed an opinion and order,instructing the trial court to rule on the matter within days petrulis superior court,wl nonpub.opn.
on february,the trial court issued a minute order,concluding t he estate can not be considered to have received a benefit if only attorney fees and administrative costs are generated.though the lodestar contract was approved by the court,we must assess realistically what benefit there was to the estate by settlements reducing claims,and which go unpaid.g ood faith with creditors would require a substantial payment consistent with the settlement.the estate should not have been created to pay legal fees.the issue of litigation counsel fees may be reconsidered on the filing of a final account the court awarded in fees and in costs.a formal order was later entered to the same effect.petrulis appealed.
discussion 
we review the trial court decision for an abuse of discretion.see estate of gilkison th,d estate of heller th,d.we find no such abuse.
approval of lodestar fee agreement 
petrulis bases his primary challenge to the attorney fee award on section,subdivision c,which provides in part an attorney for the personal representative may agree to perform extraordinary service on a contingent fee basis subject to the following conditions the agreement is written and complies with all the requirements of section of the business and professions code.the agreement is approved by the court following a hearing noticed as provided in probate code section italics added hereafter section c.
section,in turn,states notice of the hearing on the petition shall be given as provided in section to all of the following persons each person listed in section.c.section requires that at least days notice of the hearing be given to,among others,a ll persons who have requested special notice,subd.a b.for good cause,the trial court may dispense with notice,subd.c.
petrulis argues that,once the trial court approved the lodestar fee agreement,goodson was entitled to fees according to the plain terms of the agreement payment for total hours worked,using goodson normal hourly billing rates and a multiplier of percent.we disagree for two reasons.first,the approved fee agreement does not come within section c.second,the trial court,at petrulis request,erroneously dispensed with notice of the hearing on the proposed agreement.
scope of section c 
as stated,section c permits an attorney to perform extraordinary services on a contingency fee basis provided the fee agreement is first approved by the court.c.such services include litigation to benefit the estate and the settlement of creditors claims.see estate of hilton th,fn,d estate of keith d,cal.rules of court,rule c,adopted,cal.decedent estate practice,to.the question here is whether the lodestar fee agreement constitutes a contingency fee agreement within the meaning of the statute.we conclude it does not.
under the agreement,goodson was to be paid for the total number of hours worked based on hourly the firm normal hourly rates if sufficient assets were available after the estate paid administrative expenses see,otherwise,at normal hourly rates.barbara was personally obligated to pay up to in attorney fees if normal hourly rates were used.
contingency fee agreements typically provide that counsel shall recover a flat or percentage of any recovery,that is,if there is a recovery.see roa lodi medical group,cal d,app.dism,d epstein abrams th,fn,d dimitriou,fee agreement forms manual.fees under a contingency fee agreement are not a sure thing.no recovery means no fees.see draper aceto cal th,d,jalali root th,d.but here the agreement provided for an award of fees once goodson started work on the matter regardless of the outcome.the existence and value of assets in the estate determined only whether the fee award would be based on normal hourly rates or double those rates.naturally there was a risk that the fee award might not be paid or example,barbara might not honor the personal that risk is inherent in all fee agreements and does not,by itself,give rise to a contingency fee agreement.
further,the use of percentages in contingency fee agreements ensures that the client will receive a portion of any recovery.yet,the lodestar fee agreement gives attorney fees priority over everything but the estate administrative expenses,potentially leaving nothing for creditors or the sole beneficiary.indeed,goodson argues that,under the agreement,it was entitled to fees of more than million notwithstanding that the assets in the estate were worth only about,and the estate owed the lenders around million.
courts frequently distinguish between contingency fees,on the one hand,and hourly rate compensation,on the other.see,andre city of west sacramento th,d statutory attorney fee award should be based on number of hours reasonably expended and reasonable hourly rate,not contingency fee agreement rothman dolin th,d after dissolution of law firm,shareholders were to share equally in fees received from contingency fee cases and hourly rate cases in re orange county,attorney fee agreement based on benchmark hourly billing rates,subject to minor adjustment under other factors,was not a contingency fee agreement under california law.
state statutes also distinguish between contingency fee agreements and agreements providing for hourly compensation.see bus,regulating percentages used in certain contingency fee agreements,noncontingency fee agreements shall state hourly rates see also franklin appel th,d discussing legislative history of statutes governing fee agreements.consistent with these statutes,the state bar has drafted three sample written fee agreement forms an hourly litigation agreement an hourly agreement and a contingency fee agreement based on percentages of any recovery.see dimitriou,fee agreement forms manual,supra,appen.c.one leading treatise recommends that a petition seeking approval of a contingency fee agreement under section c make reference to the percentages used in the agreement.cal.decedent estate practice,supra,c,par.
finally,the legislative history of section c supports the conclusion that the lodestar fee agreement is not within the scope of the statute.enacted in,section c reflected the legislature concern that t here is old case law,predating the expansion of the jurisdiction of the superior court sitting in probate and making the probate court a general power court that an attorney for a personal representative may not receive extraordinary compensation based upon a contingent fee agreement.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced,stats,ch.the committee analysis noted although the expansion of the probate court jurisdiction probably now permits the court to approve a contingent fee contract thus overruling prior case law by implication,the result is uncertain.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill,supra,at.in particular,the legislature was concerned about two older cases,estate of kerr cal d,and estate of hastings d.see assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill,supra,at.
in estate of kerr,supra,cal d,the california supreme court had observed that a contingent fee contract for services rendered as attorney for an executor is invalid.id.at.nevertheless,the court upheld the fee contract before it,which entitled counsel to of the recovery,because the legal services were performed for the sole beneficiary of the estate,not the executor.id.at.and in estate of hastings,supra,d,the court of appeal invalidated a contingency fee agreement,which gave counsel percent of any recovery,explaining t he allowance for attorneys fees to be made by the court should be a definite,fixed and certain cash allowance,and not a percentage of the value of assets recovered or to be recovered for the estate,particularly of assets which are not yet finally a part of the estate and which might not become or remain a part of the estate,which was the situation in the instant case at the time the order was made.the order appealed from did not actually allow or fix a fee or an amount of compensation but rather adopted a formula or gauge or measure for determining the amount of the fee to be allowed at some future time.id.at.
by enacting section c,the legislature overruled estate of kerr and estate of hastings and permitted an estate attorneys to be compensated for extraordinary services by way of an agreement that grants them a percentage or portion of any recovery.as the legislature recognized,there are some instances when the probability of recovery on a lawsuit or other claim might cause the normal compensation of the attorney for the personal representative to be uneconomical for the estate or the attorney,absent a contingency fee contract.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill,supra,at,italics added.
in this case,the lodestar fee agreement did not state that goodson would receive a percentage or portion of any recovery.rather,it authorized goodson to take the entire recovery.and in the petition for the payment of attorney fees,petrulis claimed,incredibly,that goodson was entitled to more than the entire recovery.further,the agreement guaranteed that goodson would be awarded attorney fees in some on normal hourly rates if the estate assets were inadequate to pay double hourly rates.accordingly,the lodestar fee agreement did not constitute a contingency fee agreement,and section c did not apply 
lack of notice of the petition 
in the alternative,the trial court erred in dispensing with notice of the hearing on the petition to approve the lodestar fee agreement.the trial court approved the agreement by way of an ex parte petition,dispensed with notice of the hearing,and ordered the petition sealed until the estate concluded all litigation.sections c and,subdivision a,required notice of such a hearing unless there was good cause to dispense with it,subd.c.as we explain,good cause did not exist.
petrulis contends the lack of notice was proper because he did not want creditors to learn about his litigation strategy if they did,he argues,they would have had an unfair advantage in the litigation.also,expediency supposedly justified the lack of notice because of an approaching trial date.
notice is the cornerstone of estate proceedings.see,notice of all probate hearings general notice provisions manner of notice request for special notice of estate proceedings notice of hearing on petition to administer estate,notice of administration of estate to decedent creditors notice of decedent death to state notice of hearing on petition to award interim attorney fees notice of hearing on petition to award attorney fees upon final accounting.as a matter of fundamental rights,creditors who are known or reasonably ascertainable must be a manner reasonably calculated to provide actual probate proceedings have been instituted.see tulsa professional collection services pope,d venturi taylor th,d.the presumption is therefore in favor of notice under section c.
contrary to petrulis concerns,the lodestar fee agreement did not disclose litigation strategy.it simply described the estate claims against the lenders,namely,the lenders had charged usurious interest,and some lenders had improperly received life insurance proceeds.the estate petition to establish ownership of property and its reply to the creditors objections,both of which were filed before the petition to approve the lodestar fee agreement,disclosed exactly this litigation strategy.thus,the fee petition and the lodestar fee agreement did not reveal anything new.
further,litigants are not permitted to play hide and seek with respect to theories of liability.the estate had no choice but to disclose its litigation strategy in various papers filed with the court during the course of the its petition to establish ownership of property,reply to the creditor objections,mediation brief,and trial brief.there can be little reason to keep something secret when routine court proceedings require that it be disclosed before and after an ex parte hearing.
nor should creditors be kept in the dark about a method of compensating an estate attorney.the lodestar fee agreement arguably gave goodson the right to recover all of its fees out of the estate twice the normal hourly creditors could recover anything.consequently,the lenders had a significant interest in knowing about goodson compensation before negotiating with the estate to reduce the amount of their claims.a court can not approve an agreement under section c unless it finds that the agreement is in the best interests of the persons who are interested in the estate,subd.c,which includes creditors,subd.a.here,an entire group of interested persons was excluded from the process.
last,expediency did not justify dispensing with notice.the record does not suggest the lenders were at fault for the estate failure to seek approval of the lodestar fee agreement at an earlier point.and by invoking expediency and keeping the agreement a secret,the estate should have known that it was merely postponing objections by the creditors.having opted for expediency early on,the estate can not legitimately complain that wilks eventually got his day in court.thus,there was no good cause for dispensing with notice,and the trial court erred in that respect.
in sum,because the lodestar fee agreement was not a contingency fee agreement and was approved without notice,the agreement was not proper under section c.petrulis d
