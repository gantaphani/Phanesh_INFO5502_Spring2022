factual and procedural history 
we put some meat on the bare bones of the history we have summarized above.appellees filed their initial complaint on october.the complaint alleged that certain cars manufactured by chrysler between and were equipped with a defective braking system referred to as the bendix abs that in chrysler began receiving complaints and requests for brake repairs but denied that the braking systems were prone to failure and that,in response to chrysler inaction,appellees lodged complaints with the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa and the center for auto safety.appellees brought their act claim on their own behalf and their fraud and breach of express and implied warranty claims as a class action on behalf of all others similarly situated the class.they sought a declaration that this action may properly proceed as a class action an injunction effectively requiring chrysler to comply either with its obligations under the act and the common law or to rescind the sales of the affected cars payment of restitution and punitive damages and an award of attorneys fees and costs.appellees amended their complaint on march,in order to broaden the class of affected car owners to include owners of chrysler cars equipped with another,similar braking system that they alleged was also defective the bendix abs.appellees moved to certify the class on july,a motion denied by the district court by order dated september.chin chrysler.
in march,before appellees filed their initial complaint,the nhtsa had,pursuant to its authority under the motor vehicle safety act,et,initiated a preliminary evaluation of the braking systems installed on certain chrysler cars for model years through.after a investigation,the nhtsa determined that,in some instances,due to the deterioration to a part of the braking systems,the brakes function may be lost and reduced power assist may be experienced progressively during braking.id.at.on april,a little more than a month after appellees filed their first amended complaint,chrysler voluntarily recalled cars equipped with the bendix abs.in september,the nhtsa began an inquiry into chrysler cars equipped with the bendix abs and,as a result,extended the recall to include those cars as well.the recall required chrysler to notify all affected consumers of the recalls and then to inspect all affected cars replace any malfunctioning braking systems for free extend the warranty on such braking systems to years or miles,whichever came first and reimburse prior and current owners for any expenses car owners previously incurred in fixing their faulty braking systems id.
on january,appellees moved for a declaration that they could recover attorneys fees under the provision of the act,see d.they relied on a catalyst theory,although they had voluntarily dismissed their claims against chrysler,they nonetheless were a prevailing party for attorneys fees purposes because they had catalyzed chrysler to provide them at least in part the relief they recall of all cars equipped with either the bendix abs or bendix abs.the motion was denied by a magistrate judge on august,and appellees appealed the decision to the district court.three months later,the court granted appellees unopposed motion for entry of a final judgment and order of dismissal purportedly under rule a.the court stated,however,that it would determine in a separate order appellees appeal of the magistrate judge order denying their motion for a declaration of a right to attorneys fees under the act.
the district court reversed the magistrate judge august,order by opinion and order dated december,declaring as a matter of law that appellees could proceed to seek attorneys fees under the act on a catalyst theory.the court granted appellees motion for additional discovery on the factual question of whether their lawsuit had actually catalyzed chrysler to recall the faulty braking cars.after discovery,appellees moved for a declaration that chrysler was liable to them for attorneys fees because appellees had,in fact,catalyzed chrysler to act.
while this motion was pending,however,the supreme court held in buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health human resources,d,that a party may not recover attorneys fees under certain federal laws on a catalyst theory.consequently,chrysler moved for reconsideration of the december,order in light of buckhannon.appellees opposed the motion and for an award of attorneys fees under of california civil procedure code,arguing that of the more than named plaintiffs were residents of california and entitled to fees under the private attorney general doctrine because they were a catalyst in providing a benefit to a large class of persons.section provides as follows 
upon motion,a court may award attorneys fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if a a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,b the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement,or of enforcement by one public entity against another public entity,are such as to make the award appropriate,and c such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery,if any.
the district court granted chrysler motion for reconsideration on august,holding that buckhannon foreclosed an award of attorneys fees under the act on a catalyst theory.the court also held,however,that appellees could,as a general matter,seek attorneys fees under but that it would defer final determination of whether appellees could specifically proceed on a catalyst theory pending forthcoming decisions of the california supreme court that were expected to decide whether doing so would be permissible under california law in light of buckhannon.
on february,appellees advised the district court that the california supreme court had decided the pending cases in their favor buckhannon did not foreclose a party ability to recover fees under on a catalyst theory in a subsequent letter brief to the court,chrysler argued,among other things,that new jersey rules precluded application of in this case and that the court was required to apply either federal procedural law or new jersey state law.in a memorandum and order filed on july,the court held that it would apply and that appellees could proceed under that statute on a catalyst theory.after receiving evidence,the court,by opinion and order dated november,held that appellees had in fact catalyzed chrysler corrective actions for purposes of,and that,accordingly,the court would determine the amount of the attorneys fees to be awarded.on may,the court awarded appellees in fees and in expenses,for a total of.
