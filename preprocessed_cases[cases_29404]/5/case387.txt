appellants granby,llc granby and marathon development group,marathon appeal the district court denial of attorney fees under the equal access to justice act eaja,after prevailing against the united states on the issue of just compensation in a condemnation proceeding.the eaja provides that a party who prevails in litigation against the united states is entitled to an award of attorney fees and expenses unless the position of the united states was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust.u.d a.the district court determined that,although the prelitigation position of the united states was admittedly unreasonable,the united states overall position was substantially justified under the totality of the circumstances.we vacate and remand to the district court with instructions regarding how to properly weigh the government prelitigation position in determining whether its position as a whole is substantially justified,and to consider,if necessary,whether special circumstances exist in the first instance.
granby owned a acre parcel of land in norfolk,virginia,on which it planned to develop luxury condominiums,retail establishments,and office space.although the development project never materialized,granby made improvements to the land by preparing the site for construction,including excavating and installing piles to support a building.granby hired marathon to manage the development of the parcel.marathon held a lien of over million on the property because of its role in the project.the bank of the commonwealth also financed the development project and had a lien on the property.
the united states was interested in obtaining granby parcel in order to expand the federal court building in norfolk.the united states conducted two appraisals of the property.in,appraisers valued it at million.after the economic downturn,it was reappraised in at a value of million.the united states instructed the appraiser in each instance to assess the property as if it were vacant that is,to ignore any improvements to the land.
after negotiations to purchase the acre parcel failed,the united states initiated a condemnation proceeding in to acquire it by eminent domain see const.amend.v.based on the appraisal,the united states offered million as just compensation and deposited that amount with the court.granby rejected the offer and the case proceeded toward trial on the issue of just compensation under the fifth amendment takings clause.because of its lien,the united states joined marathon as a party to the action other lienholders were put on notice as interested parties but were not joined.marathon participated in the lawsuit,but relied on granby valuations of the property fair market value.
granby obtained two appraisals valuing the land at million and million,respectively.these appraisals were based,in part,on a variety of valuation techniques that the united states opposed,such as valuing the land at its best use and including the value of the developer entrepreneurial incentive.the district court ultimately granted most of the government motions to exclude certain types of valuation evidence.as a result,granby lowered its valuation to million shortly before trial.
the government ordered a new appraisal for its trial valuation of the property,this time including improvements to the land,which raised its value to million.each of the parties rejected settlement offers the government offered million and granby offered million.
the matter was tried before a jury,which heard evidence relating to granby asserted value of million and the united states asserted value of million.the jury returned a verdict of as just compensation.
granby and marathon each applied for attorney fees under the eaja,asserting that they were entitled to such fees because they prevailed in an action against the united states and the other requirements of the eaja were met.the prevailing party in an proceeding is the party whose highest trial valuation of the property is closest to the final judgment.d h.here,the jury verdict of million was closer to granby valuation of million than it was to the government valuation of million.that granby and marathon prevailed is not contested.
the united states opposed an award of attorney fees on the grounds that the government position was substantially justified and special circumstances existed that would make the award of fees unjust.the issue was referred to a magistrate judge,who recommended that both granby and marathon were eligible for fees,costs,and other expenses under the eaja because the government position was not substantially justified and there were no special circumstances.the district court rejected the magistrate judge recommendation.because it found that the government position was substantially justified,it did not reach the question of special circumstances.this appeal followed.
the arguments on appeal mirror those before the district court.appellants argue that the government position was not substantially justified because an unreasonable prelitigation position should automatically foreclose a court from finding substantial justification.they contend that the district court erred by considering their financial ability to litigate and the reasonableness of their position appellants also ask us to find,as a matter of law,that there are no special circumstances that would make an award unjust.because the district court did not reach the question of special circumstances,we do not address it here.
we review the district court denial of attorney fees under the eaja for abuse of discretion.pierce underwood.a district court abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.united states basham,cir.although this standard is deferential,it is not merely a simple,of district court decisions regarding fees under the eaja.united states paisley,cir.
as we have stated,the eaja provides that parties who prevail in litigation against the government are entitled to an award of attorney fees and other expenses unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.d a.the united states has the burden of showing that its position was substantially justified.eeoc clay printing,cir.
we have held that a position is substantially justified when it has a reasonable basis in law and fact.cody caterisano,cir quoting pierce,at.in pierce,the supreme court clarified that the eaja use of substantially justified is similar to its use in other statutes,in which it has been defined as justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person and as more than merely undeserving of sanctions for frivolousness.at.in the context,a position is substantially justified when the government refusal to offer more to the property owners as just compensation ha s a reasonable basis in fact and in law.in re lamson lamson i,wl,at cir.
while seeming relatively straightforward,determining whether the government position is substantially justified has proved to be an issue of considerable conceptual and practical difficulty.roanoke river basin ass hudson,cir quoting paisley,at.in particular,we have found little guidance on the specific question of balancing the government prelitigation and litigation postures in a case,such as ours,where they differ.
limited guidance notwithstanding,we have no difficulty concluding that the government prelitigation and litigation postures together comprise,in the words of the statute,the position of the united states.as the supreme court has elaborated,courts must undertake a single evaluation of past conduct that examines the case as an inclusive whole,rather than as atomized.comm r,ins jean.moreover,although not directed to the specific question at hand,we have noted the necessity to look beyond the issue on which the petitioner prevailed to determine,from the totality of the circumstances,whether the government acted reasonably in causing the litigation or in taking a stance during the litigation.roanoke river basin ass n,at.
