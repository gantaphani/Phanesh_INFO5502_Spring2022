the retirement income plan for employees of asarco,the plan appeals from the district court summary judgment in favor of united steelworkers of america,the union,and twenty individually named retirees the named appellees.the plan also appeals from the district court order granting attorney fees and denying its motion to stay.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we affirm the district court summary judgment and its denial of the plan motion to stay.although we agree with the district court award of attorney fees,we remand to determine what effect,if any,the automatic stay in place for asarco,asarco should have on payment of the award.
asarco owns and operates a copper smelter plant in el paso,texas.beginning in early,the company substantially reduced operations at the plant,and began laying off employees.among those laid off were the twenty named appellees.under the relevant pension plan documents,these employees were entitled to collect immediate,unreduced retirement benefits if they qualified for benefits.these benefits accrued to any claimant who could demonstrate that he was laid off due to a permanent shutdown,he was younger than years,and his age plus years of continuous service equaled at least.all of the named appellees were under the age of at the time they applied for benefits.applicants over the age of were only required to demonstrate an age plus years of continuous service equal to,hence the term benefits.
in,after intense negotiations,the union and asarco agreed that the staff reductions at asarco el paso plant would be treated as a permanent shutdown for purposes of calculating pension benefits.when the named appellees subsequently applied for benefits,however,asarco denied their claims on the ground that their combined age and years of continuous service totaled less than.
the plan documents provide that employees may continue to accrue years of continuous service for up to two years after they are laid off.this concept is known as creep,as it allows otherwise ineligible employees to creep into pension benefits.although the combined age and years of continuous service of the named appellees did not total more than at the commencement of layoff,at least some of the individuals would be entitled to benefits if an additional two years of creep were added to the calculation.
on august,the union filed a grievance on behalf of the named appellees,arguing that asarco had violated the collective bargaining agreement by failing to pay benefits to the named appellees.asarco denied the grievance on september.a year later,the union submitted a request for a panel of arbitrators to the federal mediation and conciliation service.when asarco refused to arbitrate,the union filed a complaint in the district court to compel arbitration of the benefits claims under section a of the labor management relations act lmra and section of the employee retirement income security act erisa.the complaint named both asarco and the plan as defendants.
the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the union.with respect to the union erisa claims,however,the court held that the union was not a proper party,and gave the union ten days to substitute the named appellees in an amended complaint.the court made its summary judgment expressly contingent on this substitution.
the union then filed an amended complaint adding the named appellees.four days later,asarco filed for bankruptcy,resulting in an automatic stay of proceedings with respect to asarco pursuant to a.the plan then filed a motion in the district court to stay all proceedings.meanwhile,the union filed a motion for attorney fees and costs,seeking.in an order dated march,the district court awarded in attorney fees and denied the plan motion to stay.
the plan has timely appealed from the district court summary judgment and from the order denying its motion to stay and awarding attorney fees.both appeals were consolidated.
we review the district court summary judgment de novo.see buono norton,cir.our review in this case is limited.we are not required to determine whether the named appellees were entitled to benefits,only whether they had the right to arbitrate their claims.see at t,commc ns workers of,d.both parties have presented a plausible interpretation of the relevant plan documents,and the outcome of this case ultimately turns on whether we apply a presumption of arbitrability.
in,the supreme court decided a series of cases known as the steelworkers trilogy united steelworkers of america american manufacturing,d united steelworkers of america warrior gulf navigation,d and united steelworkers of america enterprise wheel car,d.the court held that national labor policy favored arbitration,and courts should therefore apply a presumption in favor of arbitration to disputes arising from collective bargaining agreements.the court instructed 
an order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.
warrior gulf navigation,at.footnote omitted.the court reaffirmed this principle more recently in at t technologies,at.the court held that the presumption of arbitrability recognizes the greater institutional competence of arbitrators in interpreting collective bargaining agreements,furthers the national labor policy of peaceful resolution of labor disputes and thus best accords with the parties presumed objectives in pursuing collective bargaining.id.at.internal citation and quotations omitted.
the plan argues that the presumption of arbitrability is inapplicable here because the named appellees are retired.as such,they pose no risk of labor disruption,and their claims do not implicate federal labor policy.to support this argument,the plan relies on the eighth circuit case of anderson alpha portland industries,cir.
in anderson,a group of union employees worked under a collective bargaining agreement with a cement company,which provided for health insurance benefits upon retirement.after the employees retired,however,the plant closed,the local union dissolved,and the company terminated insurance benefits for retirees.id.at.when the retirees sought redress in federal court,the district court dismissed their case on the grounds that they had not exhausted the administrative remedies in their contract,which called for mandatory arbitration.id.at.the eighth circuit,en banc,reversed and held that the presumption of arbitrability did not apply to the retirees.one of the reasons the court gave for disregarding the presumption was that r etirees have no recourse to economic weapons other than a hope that active employees will strike on their behalf.id.at.
in anderson,the retirees posed little threat of economic disruption,because their union had dissolved and their plant had closed.the union was not a party in the proceedings,and the district court was effectively forcing the retirees into arbitration against their will.in contrast,other circuits have explicitly applied the presumption of arbitrability in cases where a union is actively seeking arbitration on behalf of its retirees.in cleveland electric illuminating utility workers,local,cir,a union filed a grievance on behalf of a group of retirees.the union argued that the presumption of arbitrability should apply,because it was the union not the retirees who filed the grievance and the dispute is actually between the union and cleveland electric.id.the court agreed,and held that the presumption of arbitrability applies to disputes over retirees benefits if the parties have contracted for such benefits in their collective bargaining agreement id.at.
likewise,in the recent case of united steelworkers of america cooper tire rubber,cir,the sixth circuit specifically rejected the argument that retirees pose no threat of economic disruption.the court held 
because it is the union,not a third party beneficiary,that brought the grievance there is recourse to economic weapons such as striking.moreover,even though the class consists of all member retirees and surviv
