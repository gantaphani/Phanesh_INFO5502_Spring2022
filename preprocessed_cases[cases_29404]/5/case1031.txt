background 
beginning in the summer of,mercury made a series of public disclosures revealing that an informal inquiry was being conducted into possible unreported backdating of stock options at the company.backdating stock options represented to the market as having been granted at the current market price of the company stock,when in fact they are being granted at a previous date lower stock price and are therefore already in the money,results in companies under reporting their compensation expenses and overstating their income,leading to inflated stock prices.see charles forelle james bandler,the perfect payday some ceos reap millions by landing stock options when they are most valuable.something else,wall,at.these disclosures of potential wrongdoing at mercury became more serious throughout the fall of,eventually leading to an announcement that the ceo,cfo,and general counsel would be resigning because they had been aware of,participated in,and benefitted from repeated instances of illegal stock options backdating,among other instances of wrongdoing.mercury stock price dropped significantly in reaction to these announcements.
in the class actions that followed,the district court,as is customary,appointed lead counsel for the class.lead counsel conducted an investigation into mercury backdating practices and filed a consolidated class action complaint under the securities exchange act of,as amended by the private securities litigation reform act of pslra,codified in.it opposed motions to dismiss the complaints,which the district court granted.lead counsel conducted further investigation and began drafting an amended complaint.
the parties broached the possibility of settlement in the spring of,after the motions to dismiss were argued in the district court.after the district court granted the motions to dismiss,the parties held two mediation sessions and the parties subsequently agreed on a settlement of million in cash.as part of the settlement,lead counsel conducted confirmatory discovery,which included document review,two additional depositions and an additional interview,in order to ensure that there was a factual basis for settling the case for the amount stipulated.
the district court certified a settlement class,preliminarily approved the settlement,and ordered notice to the class.the notice of the preliminary settlement informed the class of the general terms of the proposed settlement.it also informed class members that counsel would request attorneys fees in the amount of million.further,the class members were informed that they could object to the settlement or application for attorneys fees by appear ing at the settlement fairness hearing if they submit ted a written notice of objection,received or postmarked on or before september.no objections were made to the settlement itself,but two objections,including teachers,were made to the proposed attorneys fees.
teachers timely objected to counsel proposed fee request for of the million settlement fund,noted that the case was settled early,at the motion to dismiss stage,and made generalized arguments that any fee awarded by the court should be no higher than percent of the settlement fund.teachers argued that the court,serving as a fiduciary for the absent class,must critically examine class counsel application and award no more than what is absolutely required to provide reasonable compensation to class counsel.it noted that,after the passage of the pslra,federal courts today are awarding fees which are far less than of the settlement amount,yet reasonably compensate class counsel.finally,teachers argued that outstanding results can be achieved for the class at lower market rates,citing the fact that class counsel retained by public employee retirement systems serving as lead plaintiffs pursuant to the pslra have accepted fees which are significantly lower than.
thereafter,lead counsel,on september,filed its motion for award of counsel fees and reimbursement of expenses and supporting memorandum of law and declarations.this filing was two weeks after the deadline for objections had passed.the memorandum and declarations supporting the motion state that lead counsel and other law firms worked a total of hours on the case,valued at.counsel did not provide time sheets detailing how many hours were spent by each attorney on specific tasks.instead,it provided tables listing a lawyer,his or her hourly rate,and the number of hours he or she expended on the case.the declarations supporting these fee requests only broadly summarized the work done by each firm,including descriptions such as prepared for mediation,negotiating and finalizing a global settlement with all defendants for million,and prepared and filed discovery motions.
one week later,on september,the district court held a hearing on the fairness of the settlement and attorneys fees.neither teachers nor the other objector to the attorneys fee award attended.the district court approved the requested fee,ruling from the bench 
e ssentially,both of these objectors claim that the fee award can be no higher than percent.they do not object to any line item of work that was done,but rather they simply believe that the amount of the contingency fee should be percent rather than percent.
the court has read and considered those objections and it is not aware of any other objections in this matter.the court notes that this matter was litigated extensively,that it involves novel issues,that it was certainly not a situation where counsel were not required to extend significant effort in fact,the contrary is true.the accepted standard,which is sort of a starting point for the analysis in the ninth circuit,appears to be a percent award.
certainly,in this case,the court does not believe that the efforts of counsel fell below that such that below the standard would be appropriate and in fact,it could be argued that a higher award might be justified given the very beneficial outcome.
in any event,the court does see any reason to depart from the standard percentage that awarded in the ninth circuit.so i prepared to overrule the objections and approve the fee as well.
teachers timely appealed the fee award.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court award of attorneys fees in class actions for an abuse of discretion.see powers eichen,f d,cir.a district court abuses its discretion if its decision is based on an erroneous conclusion of law or if the record contains no evidence on which it rationally could have based its decision.fischel equitable life assurance soc y,cir quoting paul,johnson,alston hunt graulty,cir.the district court may exercise its discretion to choose between the lodestar and percentage method in calculating fees.see powers,at.a district court,however,abuses that discretion when it uses a mechanical or formulaic approach that results in an unreasonable reward.id.
we review the district court underlying factual determinations for clear error.id.any element of legal analysis which figures in the district court decision is reviewed de novo.fischer,cir.
iii.waiver 
we apply a general rule against entertaining arguments on appeal that were not presented or developed before the district court.peterson highland music,cir.although no bright line rule exists to determine whether a matter as been properly raised below,an issue will generally be deemed waived on appeal if the argument was not raised sufficiently for the trial court to rule on it.whittaker execuair,cir quoting se
