this appeal involves the awarding of attorney fees to shippers who successfully sue carriers of household goods under the carmack amendment.the appellants in this case are moving companies.they assert that there is no statutory basis to support the district court award of an attorney fee to shippers who brought a court action without first engaging in available arbitration.we have jurisdiction under and we affirm.
the relevant facts are not in dispute.plaintiffs edward and susan campbell contracted with defendants kachina moving and storage,mayflower transit,gates moving and storage,and allied van lines,collectively carriers to transport their household goods from arizona to florida.the goods were damaged during the move.the plaintiffs sued the carriers in state court,and the defendants removed the suit on the basis of federal question jurisdiction arising under the carmack amendment to the interstate commerce act.see,b.a jury in the district court found in favor of the plaintiffs,awarding over in compensatory and in emotional distress damages.

we are required to consider,which in part states emphasis added

d attorney fees to any court action to resolve a dispute between a shipper of household goods and a carrier providing transportation or service the shipper shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees if 
the shipper submits a claim to the carrier within days after the date the shipment is delivered or the date the delivery is scheduled,whichever is later 
the shipper prevails in such court action and 
a a decision resolving the dispute was not rendered through arbitration under this section within the period provided under subsection b of this section or an extension of such period under such subsection or 
b the court proceeding is to enforce a decision rendered through arbitration under this section and is instituted after the period for performance under such decision has elapsed.
the parties dispute centers on the meaning of the attorney fee provisions in subsection d.the carriers assert that these provisions presume participation in the arbitration program described in the rest of section.the shippers argue that the statute contains no such limitation.we agree with the shippers.
our analysis begins,as it must,with the text of the statute in question.azarte ashcroft,cir.under the plain meaning rule,w here the language of a statute is plain and admits of no more than one meaning the duty of interpretation does not arise,and the rules which are to aid doubtful meanings need no discussion.carson harbor,unocal,cir en banc quoting caminetti united states.
this principal rule of statutory construction guides our examination of section attorney fee provisions.it also leads to our ultimate conclusion simply put,nothing in d limits attorney fees to shippers who engage in arbitration.the subsection applies to any court action involving disputes between a shipper of household goods and a carrier,and entitles shippers to attorney fees if they meet the first two requirements of d and d timely submitting a claim and prevailing in court,and are not barred by d which merely excludes those claims in which a timely arbitration decision is reached and does not necessitate court enforcement.in other words,d prevents shippers from receiving attorney fees if the arbitration program works as intended by swiftly resolving the dispute.it has no effect on shippers,such as the campbells,who did not engage in arbitration.
we are mindful of the need to construe a statute as a whole.see children hosp.health ctr.belshe,cir.like the carriers,we read the attorney fee provisions in light of the arbitration program with which they share section.our interpretation recognizes that receiving a timely arbitration decision affects a shipper eligibility for an attorney fee under d,and that courts must consult the time period in b to establish whether an arbitration decision qualifies as timely.with this understanding in mind,we see no tension between our interpretation of the attorney fee provisions and the arbitration program.
the carriers read the interplay of b and d a differently.they argue that refusal to invoke arbitration prevents b time period from beginning to run,and therefore precludes d a from ever being satisfied.but nothing in the text of d a conditions eligibility upon the happening of a certain event rather,a shipper satisfies d a as long as a specific event does not occur,namely the rendering of an arbitration decision within a certain period of time.because there was no arbitration decision in the campbells dispute,d a poses no barrier to the award of an attorney fee.
the reliance of other courts on section title to support an alternative interpretation does not convince us otherwise.see yakubu atlas van lines,d,citing collins moving storage kirkell,so d.section may be entitled dispute settlement program for household goods carriers,but that does not give us free rein to ignore the plain language of subsection d.as the supreme court explained in brotherhood of railroad trainmen b o railroad.internal citations omitted 
that the heading of a section fails to refer to all the matters which the framers of that section wrote into the text is not an unusual fact t he title of a statute and the heading of a section can not limit the plain meaning of the text.for interpretive purposes,they are of use only when it sheds light on some ambiguous word or phrase.
accord ins cyr,d quoting trainmen.there is nothing ambiguous about the text in question here.section d is entitled attorney fees to shippers and expressly applies to any court action to resolve a dispute between a shipper of household goods and a carrier providing transportation or service it does not state that the subsection applies only to court actions pursued after first invoking arbitration adding such a limitation may be easy enough,but that is the province of congress,not this court.
the carriers,however,argue that our straightforward reading of the text fails to properly respect congress intent to encourage arbitration.as a remedy,the carriers urge supplementing the statute three enumerated conditions for attorney fee eligibility by reading in a fourth,unstated prerequisite that shippers first invoke arbitration.we have long held that there is a strong presumption that the plain language of a statute expresses congressional intent,rebutted only in rare and exceptional circumstances,when a contrary legislative intent is clearly expressed.united states tobeler,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.section d does not present such an exceptional circumstance.given the ease with which congress expressly listed three eligibility criteria,we see no reason why congress would bury a fourth implicitly within the statute.we decline to add a condition that is conspicuously absent from the text when we perceive no inco
