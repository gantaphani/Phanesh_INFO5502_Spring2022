penney company claims multiple errors in the trial and orders regarding the disability discrimination claims of laura blockel,a former penney employee.blockel also appeals,alleging error in the district court calculation of prejudgment interest.finding no errors,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
a reasonable jury could have found the following facts in support of its verdict in favor of blockel.
laura blockel was hired by penney as a merchandise manager trainee in.she was promoted in the following years,receiving favorable evaluations and merit pay increases,until she reached the position of senior merchandise manager at the sturbridge,massachusetts,store in.as a senior merchandise manager,blockel was responsible for purchasing and managing the merchandise in a particular area of the store,ultimately the men department,and supervising customer service in that area.she routinely received scores of on a scale of to,being the highest on her annual performance evaluations.
in,blockel was diagnosed with a seizure disorder,major depression,and stress disorder.in,she was also diagnosed with disorder,disorder,and dissociative disorder.on several occasions in and,blockel was hospitalized due to her illnesses for up to ten days at a time.her symptoms included seizures,severe depression,catatonic states,auditory and visual hallucinations,delusions,and suicidal ideation.she attempted suicide more than once.
in order to control these symptoms,blockel was treated with a variety of,and mood stabilizing drugs.her treating psychiatrist,zamir nestelbaum,testified that without these medications,blockel would not have been able to care for herself or work throughout and.blockel visited both a psychologist and nestelbaum approximately once a week after her diagnoses.
stress related to heavy work hours was adjudged by nestelbaum to exacerbate blockel symptoms.consequently,he provided blockel with notes for her employer several times in and,setting restrictions on the number of hours she should work each day or week.at times she was limited to six hours of work per day.the manager of the sturbridge store,james eltringham,consistently honored blockel accommodation requests.
with these restrictions,blockel was able to perform all the essential functions of her job.in fact,she received scores of on her performance evaluations for the years and.in and,she was invited to take part in the entity team,a group of five senior managers selected for their superior merchandising skills.
in may,lois rainero replaced eltringham as the manager of the sturbridge store.rainero had previously held the position of district personnel manager and had received training in handicap discrimination and reasonable accommodations.
in september,blockel suffered a seizure at work and was taken to the hospital by ambulance.she remained hospitalized for a week.upon returning to work,blockel told rainero that she had been admitted to the psychiatric ward,suffered from mental illnesses,and was heavily medicated.she also explained that she felt she would be able to continue fulfilling her job responsibilities as long as her work hours were limited.she provided rainero with a note from nestelbaum stating that she should not work more than forty hours per week.
the restriction was adhered to in october,but with the holiday season approaching,blockel feared that the hours expected of her would escalate.to ensure that her limitations would be taken into account,she offered to draft the holiday schedule,a task she did not customarily perform.blockel proposal limited her scheduled hours to forty per week,but it was rejected by rainero as leaving the store short on coverage.the revised schedule,drafted by another senior merchandise manager,assigned blockel between and hours per week.this schedule began october.
on november,blockel met with rainero to remind her of the restriction.rainero responded that blockel was not being a team player,that she would be a burden on the other senior merchandise managers,and that her career at penney would effectively be over if she did not work her scheduled hours during the holiday season.
the following day,blockel left a note for rainero,to which rainero never responded,stating that she loved her job and did not want to be a burden on her fellow managers.she concluded that she would try to work the schedule as posted,despite its requirement that she work more than forty hours per week.ultimately,blockel worked between fifty and sixty hours weekly during november and december.
simultaneously,blockel symptoms worsened significantly.between november and january,her condition was progressively downgraded by her doctors.nestelbaum attributed her deterioration to the high number of hours she was working and her anxiety that reducing her hours would impact her future at penney.in early january,blockel was hospitalized for ten days.she took sick leave,informed rainero that she would not be returning,and applied for disability benefits.
sometime in january,district manager phyllis seberger met with rainero to discuss the evaluations of the senior merchandise managers,which were finalized in late january.in late february,blockel was asked to come to the store for a meeting of the managers.blockel protested that she was out on sick leave and not able to attend but was informed that it was mandatory.
at that meeting,blockel was presented with her completed evaluation,in which she was rated a.in contrast with previous years,blockel was not given the chance to review the evaluation and provide feedback before it was finalized.after the evaluation was presented to blockel,seberger informed her that a reduction in force was being implemented at penney and that,because of her rating,she was being terminated.later,blockel retrieved her actual sales numbers and discovered errors in the computation of her sales and profit figures that formed the basis for the evaluation and made her performance appear less favorable.
after her termination,blockel sick pay and application for disability were denied by penney because she was no longer an employee.penney eventually reversed its decision and granted her disability benefits.blockel also was granted federal social security disability benefits.
in april,blockel filed claims before the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad alleging that penney violated the protections found in massachusetts general laws chapter.due to delays in the mcad process and the impending expiration of the statutes of limitations on her claims,blockel filed suit in state court in.penney subsequently removed the lawsuit to federal district court.
in march,a jury rendered a verdict in blockel favor,finding that penney failed to reasonably accommodate her and that it engaged in retaliatory harassment.the jury awarded blockel compensatory and punitive damages,as well as back pay,in the aggregate amount of.the district court subsequently awarded her attorney fees and costs,as well as in prejudgment interest on the compensatory damages portion of the award.
penney raises multiple issues in its appeal while blockel makes a single claim in her.
ii.notice of appeal 
preliminarily,blockel protests that this court does not have jurisdiction to hear any of penney claims due to a deficiency in penney designation of the order from which it appeals.
on march,the jury returned its verdict in favor of blockel.on march,the district court entered judgment for blockel,including prejudgment interest.on april,blockel filed a motion for attorney fees and costs as well as additional prejudgment interest.on april,penney filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to.b,which,as a recognized type of motion,extended the time for appealing the march judgment.see fed.a i.
on june,the district court issued a memorandum and order denying penney rule b motion and granting blockel motion for fees and costs,but denying her request for additional prejudgment interest.on july,the court entered a judgment that read pursuant to the memorandum and order of the court entered on june,judgment for the plaintiff with attorney fees awarded in the amount of and costs awarded in the amount of.on july,penney filed a notice of appeal,specifying the july entry as the judgment appealed from.see fed.c b requiring an appellant to designate the judgment,order,or part thereof being appealed in the notice of appeal.
blockel maintains that the july order resolved only the amount of the attorney fees and costs.blockel thus urges us to read penney notice of appeal as limited to issues concerning attorney fees and costs,exclusive of the judgment and issues raised.citing town of norwood new england power,cir,blockel notes that a notice of appeal naming only the denial of a motion generally does not bring the original judgment before an appellate court.see id.at.
nevertheless,the requirements of rule c are to be construed liberally.see kotler am.tobacco,cir citing smith barry,d foman davis,d.noncompliance with mere technicalities will not defeat appellate jurisdiction,id.quoting foman,at,so long as the litigant filing is the functional equivalent of what the rule requires,id.quoting torres oakland scavenger,d.moreover,the rule of norwood is not inflexible.leblanc great am.ins,cir see also norwood,at stating that because the failure to name the underlying judgment is usually a slip of the pen and rarely causes any prejudice to the other side,courts often rescue the technically defaulted portion of the appeal.
further,we review the notice of appeal in the context of the entire record.see chamorro puerto rican cars,cir john insulation,addison,cir.t he core purpose of a notice of appeal is to facilitate a proper decision on the merits.chamorro,at quoting foman,at.
we do not construe penney appeal to be limited to the issue of attorney fees.the district court reference,in its july judgment,to the june memorandum and order,is not limited to that portion of the order dealing with fees and costs.although the court intention is not absolutely clear,the july judgment can plausibly be read to incorporate the entirety of the june memorandum and order denying penney motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.
moreover,reviewing the record as a whole,penney consistently sought reviews during and after trial,it filed a request for a full trial transcript contemporaneously with filing its notice of appeal,and its brief to this court addressed the underlying merits.see,norwood,at considering fact that appellant presented same arguments on merits below as on appeal.thus,penney intent to appeal the merits of the underlying judgment was sufficiently clear to provide this court with jurisdiction to review the issues raised in its rule b motion 
iii.denial of motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict 
the jurisdiction issue resolved,we review the district court denial of a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict de novo.see rodowicz.mut.life ins,cir.our review is weighted toward preservation of the jury verdict w e must affirm unless the evidence was so strongly and overwhelmingly inconsistent with the verdicts that no reasonable jury could have returned them.id.at internal quotations omitted.
blockel prima facie case 
penney contends that blockel failed to make out her prima facie case in multiple respects.the company argues that blockel failed to prove first,that she was a qualified handicapped person under the massachusetts statute second,that her impairments constituted a disability and third,that penney refused to accommodate her.
blockel argues preliminarily that penney has waived all arguments regarding the sufficiency of the evidence because its initial motion for judgment as a matter of law,brought pursuant to rule a at the close of evidence,was not made with sufficient specificity.we note,however,that penney rule a motion was cut short by the judge pronouncement that the motion was considered filed and denied although generally it is incumbent upon a party to enunciate the specific basis for a motion for judgment as a matter of law,see.a,here,the district court foreclosed penney opportunity to make its arguments with any specificity.under these circumstances penney can not be faulted for failing to provide more detail.see,wilson sporting goods david geoffrey,stating that i t would be unfair to require counsel to have developed a statement of evidentiary shortcomings which the magistrate obviously did not want to hear,overruled in part on other grounds by cardinal chem.morton int l,d.
but blockel second waiver argument holds more force.blockel contends that in its subsequent rule b motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict penney enunciated only the first of the three particular sufficiency arguments it makes on appeal.
in its rule b motion,penney did contend that blockel had not made out a prima facie case.specifically,however,it argued only that blockel failed to prove her status as a qualified handicapped person.penney did not make the arguments that blockel failed to prove that she had a disability or that penney refused to accommodate her.as we have said many times before,unless an issue is raised squarely before the district court,it can be reviewed only for plain error.see,in re rauh,cir we consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal only in exceptional circumstances threatening a clear miscarriage of justice.quoting playboy,public serv.comm of puerto rico,cir.we find no such error here.
penney contends that raising the overarching issue of whether blockel had made out her prima facie case was sufficient to preserve its arguments on each aspect of blockel prima facie case.our precedent,however,indicates that more specificity is required.in pstragowski metropolitan life insurance,cir,we stated that a party who moved for a directed verdict may obtain appellate review only on the specific ground stated in the motion.id.at see also lynch city of boston,cir stating that the rule requires that grounds for a motion must be stated with sufficient certainty to apprise the court and opposing counsel of the movant position internal citation omitted.further,on the venerable principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius,penney inclusion of one particular argument regarding blockel prima facie case indicated to both blockel and the court that this was the sum total of its arguments on this front.we therefore consider only whether blockel met her burden of showing her status as a protected handicapped employee.
ii.qualified handicapped person 
the massachusetts statute defines a qualified handicapped person as a handicapped person who is capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job,or who would be capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job with reasonable accommodation to his handicap.laws ch.penney claims that blockel was not a qualified handicapped person because she did not prove that she was able to perform the essential functions of her job from october through december.penney argument rests on blockel testimony that she could not do the job of merchandise manager in forty hours a week.specifically,she testified 
and what i curious about is are you saying that by restricting your hours to only hours a week you could not do the essential functions of your job as a merchandiser 
that right.
penney relies primarily upon august offices unlimited,cir.in august,when the record was fatally bereft of indication that the disabled plaintiff could perform his job even with an accommodation,this court affirmed summary judgment for the employer on the plaintiff employment discrimination claims.see id.at.
here,blockel presented other evidence sufficient to allow the jury to conclude that working more than forty hours per week was not an essential function of blockel position.for example,rainero testified that senior merchandise managers were not required to work more than forty hours a week.in addition,a senior merchandise manager testified that it would be possible for managers to perform their duties,even during the holiday season,within a forty hour schedule.blockel also presented evidence of her past superior performance despite hourly work restrictions.
even assuming that blockel understood the question and taking her response that she could not perform the
