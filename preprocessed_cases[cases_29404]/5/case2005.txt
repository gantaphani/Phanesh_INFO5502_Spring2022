after respondent wade major voluntarily dismissed his action for injunctive relief against appellant ozzie silna,the trial court denied silna request for attorney fees under code of civil procedure section the law curtailing the filing of strategic lawsuits against public participation,often called the law.we reverse and remand for a determination of the award.
relevant factual and procedural background 
the parties do not dispute the following facts the city of malibu has enacted its own campaign finance law,codified in chapter of the malibu municipal code mmc,that regulates campaign contributions and other campaign activities.pertinent here is section b of the mmc,which provides no person shall make to any candidate for city council a contribution or contributions that would cause the total amount contributed by such person to the candidate to exceed one hundred dollars for each single election for member to the city council.
the mmc defines contribution as including a n expenditure made at the behest of a candidate unless full and adequate consideration is received for making the expenditure,but exempts any independent expenditure as defined in the political reform act of,et pra.under the pra,an independent expenditure is made by any person in connection with a communication which expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate but which is not made to or at the behest of the affected candidate.the phrase made at the behest of,as used in the pra,is defined by regulation to mean made under the control or at the direction of,in cooperation,consultation,coordination,or concert with,at the request or suggestion of,or with the express,prior consent of,tit,subd.a.
section a of the mmc provides that violations of malibu campaign finance law may be punished as misdemeanors.in addition,section b authorizes certain actions for injunctive relief.
in connection with an election on april,silna mailed a letter to a number of malibu residents supporting jay leibig,walt keller,and william winokur,who were candidates for seats on the malibu city council on march,major filed a complaint for injunctive relief,alleging that silna mailing exceeded in value and was made at the behest of these candidates,in violation of the mmc,and silna planned to engage in further violations of the mmc,namely,pay for political advertisements in a local newspaper.
shortly thereafter,major applied for a temporary restraining order.in support of his application,he submitted declarations indicating that winokur had identified silna as a member of his campaign team,silna had appeared at candidate information meetings on winokur behalf,and the cost of silna mailing exceeded.he also submitted evidence that xandra kayden,who had been retained by the city of malibu to oversee the election,had opined in a report that silna expenditures were made at the behest of the candidates in question.
in opposition,silna contended that major lacked standing to seek injunctive relief under the mmc.in addition,he submitted declarations from winokur,leibig,and himself denying that he was on a campaign team and that he had acted at any candidate request in sending out his mailing.silna also raised evidentiary objections to major showing.
at the hearing of the application for a temporary restraining order on march,the trial court sustained many of silna objections,but declined to decide whether major had standing to seek injunctive relief under the mmc.it denied the application,reasoning that major had failed to establish a probability of prevailing on the merits,the balance of equities favored silna,and major showing was insufficient to justify a prior restraint on silna rights of free expression.
on march,silna filed a motion under the law to strike major complaint.major dismissed his action against silna on march.
on april,silna requested an award of attorney fees under the law.following a hearing,the trial court denied this request on june,reasoning that major action fell within an exception to law in section,subdivision b.this appeal followed.
discussion 
silna contends that the trial court erred in denying his request for attorney fees under the law.we agree.
governing law 
under section,w hen a lawsuit arises out of the exercise of free speech or petition,a defendant may move to strike the complaint.citations.the complaint is subject to dismissal unless the plaintiff establishes a probability that he or she will prevail on the claim.citations.beilenson superior court th,d,quoting,subd.b.
in enacting section,the legislature declared there to be a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech,subd.a.the law encompasses actions arising from conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.because t he right to speak on political matters is the quintessential subject of our constitutional protections of the right of free speech,the law has been applied to actions arising from political literature discussing the qualifications of candidates during elections.matson dvorak th,d citing cases.
resolution of an motion requires the court to engage in a process.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity if the court finds such a showing has been made,it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.we review the trial court determinations on these matters de novo.governor gray davis com.american taxpayers alliance th,d.
parties that prevail on their motions are entitled to an award of attorney fees and costs,subd.c.generally,when the plaintiff in an action dismisses the action after an motion is filed,the trial court is obliged to adjudicate the motion and make an award of fees and costs if the defendant prevails on the motion.liu moore th,d.
here,the trial court did not address the merits of silna pending motion,reasoning that major action fell outside the law pursuant to section.the legislature enacted section,effective january,to address a disturbing abuse in litigants use of the statute,subd.a.mann quality old time service,th,d.
to address these abuses,section excludes certain types of claims that would otherwise have fallen under the scope of the law.mann quality old time service,supra,th at,d.subdivisions b and c of section,respectively,carve out exceptions to the law for actions taken in the public interest and actions against persons engaged in commercial speech.however,subdivision d of section imposes limitations on the scope of these exceptions.
pertinent here are subdivisions b and d of section.subdivision b provides that section does not apply to an action brought solely in the public interest or on behalf of the general public,provided that the following conditions are met the plaintiff does not seek any relief greater than or different from the relief sought for the general public or a class of which the plaintiff is a member.a claim for attorney fees,costs,or penalties does not constitute greater or different relief for purposes of this subdivision.the action,if successful,would enforce an important right affecting the public interest,and would confer a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,on the general public or a large class of persons.private enforcement is necessary and places a disproportionate financial burden on the plaintiff in relation to the plaintiff stake in the matter.
however,subdivision d of section provides that this public interest exception to the law does not apply to a ny action against any person or entity based upon the creation,dissemination,exhibition,advertisement,or other similar promotion of any dramatic,literary,musical,political,or artistic work,including,but not limited to,a motion picture or television program,or an article published in a newspaper or magazine of general circulation.
here,the trial court determined that major action fell within the public interest exception.it reasoned that the action satisfied the first two conditions for the exception because it conferred no special benefit on major,and it concerned the important public interest in fair and open campaign financing.furthermore,it found that major action was necessary under the third condition,pointing to a declaration from the malibu city attorney,who stated that her office would not have been able to act on a complaint from major prior to the election.
subdivision d,section 
the first issue before us is whether the trial court erred in concluding that the public interest exception in section bars application of the law to major action.silna contends that major action falls within the qualification to this exception in subdivision d of section subdivision d.for the reasons that we explain below,we agree with this contention 
in ingels one broadcasting services,th,d,we concluded that subdivision d encompassed an action against a radio broadcasting corporation and its employees based on allegations that the plaintiff had been improperly excluded from participating in a talk show.however,no court has squarely addressed whether it applies to actions against individuals engaged in the distribution of political literature during an election campaign 
the issue presented is therefore one of first impression,and poses a question of law,namely,the proper interpretation of a statute.r p capital resources,california state lottery th,d.our primary task in construing a statute is to determine the legislature intent.citation.where possible,we follow the legislature intent,as exhibited by the plain meaning of the actual words of the law jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th,d,quoting california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th,d.california courts have scrupulously honored this principle in interpreting the law.ibid.
precisely stated,the question before us concerns the scope of the public interest exception to the law,given the qualification on this exception in subdivision d.generally,exceptions to a statute are construed narrowly to cover only situations that are within the words and reason of the exception.hayter trucking,shell western e p,th,d.
we conclude that major action falls outside the public interest exception.subdivision d,by its plain language,exempts from this exception a ny action against a person based upon the dissemination or similar promotion of any political work here,it is undisputed that silna mailed letters supporting political candidates,and major sought an injunction to prevent silna from engaging in such mailings and paying for political advertisements.
the key question,therefore,is whether silna letters and advertisements constitute works within the meaning of subdivision d.the word work,as ordinarily understood,means something produced or accomplished by effort,exertion,or exercise of skill,or something produced by the exercise of creative talent or expenditure of creative effort.collegiate dict.ed.however,because the legislature has accompanied this word with descriptive terms and illustrative examples,our inquiry into its scope is guided by the doctrine of ejusdem generis.
meaning literally,of the same kind,the doctrine of ejusdem generis is of ancient vintage.citation.engelmann state bd.of education th,fn,d.as our supreme court explained in kraus trinity management services,cal th,d,e jusdem generis applies whether specific words follow general words in a statute or vice versa.in either event,the general term or category is restricted to those things that are similar to those which are enumerated specifically.citation.the canon presumes that if the legislature intends a general word to be used in its unrestricted sense,it does not also offer as examples peculiar things or classes of things since those descriptions then would be surplusage.citation.
in applying this doctrine,we seek an interpretation of subdivision d that respects its plain language,harmonizes the provisions of the pertinent statutes,and promotes the goals of the law,fair employment housing,supra,cal d at.in addition,b oth the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.id.at.
here,subdivision d encompasses any dramatic,literary,musical,political,or artistic work,including,but not limited to,a motion picture or television program,or an article published in a newspaper or magazine of general circulation.the phrase including,but not limited to is a term of enlargement,and signals the legislature intent that subdivision d applies to items not specifically listed in the provision,fair employment housing,supra,cal d at.
viewed in the context of the law,silna letters and advertisements are not different in kind from the illustrative examples identified in subdivision d.we do not see any material distinction between silna advocated support for the candidates on the basis of their political positions,and was distributed by mail in an article or editorial of similar length and content in a newspaper or magazine circulated generally in malibu.silna letters and advertisements are indistinguishable from the aforementioned article or editorial as conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.
our conclusion finds additional support in the legislature declaration regarding the enactment of section.the legislature states in subdivision a of section t here has been a disturbing abuse of section,the california law,which has undermined the exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,contrary to the purpose and intent of section.the legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process or section.
as we have indicated see pt,ante,political literature on candidate qualifications exemplifies t he right to speak on political matters,which is the quintessential subject of constitutional free speech rights.matson dvorak,supra,th at,d.we therefore conclude that the legislature did not intend to exclude such literature from the political works denoted in subdivision d,given the legislature goal of reaffirming the law as a protector of free speech rights through the enactment of section.
pointing to the legislative history of section,major contends that the legislature intended that subdivision d would exempt only the news media and other media defendants from the public interest exception.we are not persuaded.as we explain below,the legislative history before us corroborates our conclusions about subdivision d 
this legislative history discloses that corporations were the principal source of the disturbing abuse of the law cited in subdivision a of section.section originated as senate bill reg.sess,which was enacted in september.stats,ch.an early senate committee analysis of this bill identifies its sponsor as the consumer attorneys of california,who contended that a growing number of large corporations ha d invoked the statute to delay and discourage litigation against them by filing meritless slapp motions,using the statute as a litigation weapon.com.on judiciary,com.on bill reg.sess.as amended may.
according to this senate committee analysis,the exceptions to the law in subdivisions b and c of section were intended to end this corporate abuse.com.on judiciary,com.on bill reg.sess.as amended may.the analysis further states that p roposed subdivision d of newly added section would exempt the news media and other media defendants such as the motion picture industry from the bill when the underlying act relates to news gathering and reporting to the public with respect to the news media or to activities involving the creation or dissemination of any work of a motion picture or television studio.
however,subsequent analyses depict the scope of this subdivision in more expansive terms.an assembly committee report states that the subdivision would permit the motion to be employed against claims arising from gathering,receiving or processing information for communication to the public by a publisher,editor,reporter,or other person connected with or employed upon a newspaper,magazine,or other periodical publication,press association or wire service,or an action based upon the creation or promotion of a dramatic,literary,musical,political or artistic work.assem.com.on judiciary,com.on bill reg.sess.as amended june,italics added.it further indicates that the subdivision in question excludes specified persons and entities,such as those engaged in speech related activities,specified nonprofits,and actions against persons or entities based on the creation or promotion of constitutionally protected artistic works and the like,italics added.similar remarks are found in a later report.assembly floor analysis,reading analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended july.
the aforementioned analyses reinforce our conclusions regarding subdivision d.they disclose that the legislature goal in enacting section was to limit corporate abuse of the law,and not to exclude individuals who have distributed political literature from the scope of the law.to curb corporate abuse,the legislature enacted the public interest exception to the law in section.however,this stated in subdivision b of section not facially limited to public interest actions against corporations.accordingly,the legislature checked the reach of the public interest exception by enacting subdivision d,which preserves the application of the law to actions against individuals that implicate important forms of protected speech.
in sum,major action falls outside the public interest exception to the law.
silna motion 
the remaining issue is whether silna is entitled to a fee award because his motion should have been granted.as we have explained see pt,ante,actions arising from the distribution of political literature during an election are within the scope of the statute.accordingly,the burden fell upon major to demonstrate a probability that he would prevail on his claims for injunctive relief.we conclude that he failed to carry this burden.
major burden resembles that imposed on a plaintiff opposing a motion for summary judgment on his complaint.navellier sletten th,d.he was obliged to demonstrate that his complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by major is credited.matson dvorak,supra,th at,d accord,wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d.
generally,to determine whether the party opposing an motion has carried this burden,the trial court must consider the party pleadings and his supporting affidavits,to the extent that these contain admissible evidence.hms capital,lawyers title th,d.the trial court is also obliged to consider admissible evidence submitted in support of the motion,but only to determine whether this evidence defeats the opponent showing as a matter of law.ibid.in assessing whether the opponent has carried his or her burden,the trial court is precluded from weighing the evidence or making credibility determinations.ibid.
here,major and silna submitted evidence bearing on whether silna acted independently in mailing his letter,and they raised evidentiary objections to the respective adverse showing.because the trial court did not reach the merits of silna motion,it never ruled on these objections.nonetheless,as we explain below,it is unnecessary for us to address these objections or the showings on silna independence.
in our view,major lacked standing to seek injunctive relief,and thus his action was not legally sufficient.matson dvorak,supra,th at,d.at the outset,we observe that citizens of a municipality ordinarily have limited standing to enjoin violations of a municipal ordinance,absent authorization in the ordinance itself.civil code section provides that n either specific nor preventive relief can be granted to enforce a penal law,except in a case of nuisance or as otherwise provided by law.civil code section further provides that a private person may maintain an action for a public nuisance,if it is specially injurious to himself,but not otherwise.
in view of these provisions,courts have generally permitted a citizen to enjoin violations of local ordinances only when the violations work a special injury on the citizen,center property owners county of orange th,d injunctive relief regarding airport fuel tanks alleged to violate county ordinances is properly denied due to failure to show special injury taliaferro salyer d,in order to state a cause of action based upon a violation of the building code,plaintiff must show that he has suffered some exceptional damage other than that suffered by the public generally stegner bahr ledoyen,d,violation of zoning ordinance carrying criminal penalties does not support injunctive relief perrin mountain view mausoleum cal,violations of county ordinances alone do not support injunctive relief against operation of mausoleum but sapiro frisbie,homeowner may enjoin violation of a zoning ordinance without a showing of special injury,on theory that the zoning ordinance extends special protection to all homeowners.
here,major does not allege any special injury,and thus the key issue is whether malibu campaign finance law itself accords him standing to seek injunctive relief.because a regulatory statute does not invariably create a private right of enforcement,we examine the language of this law and its legislative history to determine whether malibu intended to authorize major action.see vikco ins.services,ohio indemnity th,d.
here,section a of the mmc provides that violations of the campaign finance law may be punished as misdemeanors,but accords the city prosecutor the discretion to charge such violations as infractions furthermore,section b states the city prosecutor may sue for injunctive relief to enjoin violations and to compel compliance with the provisions of this chapter either upon their own initiative or upon the complaint of any interested party.no civil action alleging a violation of this chapter may be filed against a person pursuant to this section if the criminal prosecutor is maintaining a criminal action against that person pursuant to subsection a of this section.
section b does not expressly authorize injunctive actions by parties other than the city prosecutor.before the trial court,major nonetheless contended that the second sentence of this section impliedly accords him standing to enjoin silna alleged violations.as we explain below,neither malibu campaign finance in its the history of this law supports this contention.
we begin by examining the second sentence of section b and its function within that section.this sentence,on its face,bars the city prosecutor from pursuing an action for injunctive relief against a violator when a criminal action is also pending against the violator.it closely tracks a portion of government code section,which permits city attorneys and other public officials to seek penalties of up to in civil actions for enumerated violations of the pra,but bars such actions when a criminal action is also pending under government code section,which authorizes criminal penalties in excess of 
in imposing the aforementioned restriction,government code section states no civil action alleging a violation of this title may be filed against a person pursuant to this section if the criminal prosecutor is maintaining a criminal action against that person pursuant to section.government code section thus limits the power of a city may act as the criminal prosecutor under pra,to obtain civil and criminal penalties for a single violation of the pra.
the similar restriction in section b is reasonably viewed as addressing a.in people lim cal d,our supreme court explained that issues of due process are raised when a public official initiates an action for injunctive relief against a party who also faces a criminal action for the same conduct.in such cases,the equitable remedy has the collateral effect of
