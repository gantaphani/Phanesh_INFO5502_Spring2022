plaintiff counsel and defendants counsel agreed to multiple extensions of plaintiff time to file a motion for attorney fees on appeal,while they were trying to settle the amount owed.under california rules of court,rule c,any stipulation to extend the time for filing a motion for attorney fees on appeal must be filed with the court before the original time has expired.plaintiff counsel,however,failed to file a written stipulation within this time.when negotiations broke down,plaintiff counsel finally filed a motion for attorney fees on appeal.defendants counsel did not deny granting several extensions of time nevertheless,he argued that the motion was.the trial court agreed,and it therefore denied the motion for attorney fees.
plaintiff counsel then filed a motion for relief from default under code of civil procedure section section.the trial court denied this motion,too,for two reasons the failure to file a written stipulation in a timely manner was inexcusable neglect and the motion for relief from default under section was an improper attempt to circumvent the requirements applicable to a motion for reconsideration under code of civil procedure section section.
the plaintiff appeals.we will reverse.
first,we will hold that plaintiff counsel reliance on his adversary agreement was excusable neglect,as a matter of law.this is true even though plaintiff counsel was at fault for failing to file a timely written stipulation.admittedly,the law frowns on an attorney neglect to comply with a clear rule.however,it positively glowers at another attorney exploitation of such neglect as an excuse to break his word.
second,we will hold that the motion under section did not have to satisfy the requirements of section.the trial court relied on gilberd ac transit th.however,more recent,more persuasive,and more analogous cases have held that i f the requirements for relief under section are met,the viability of relief under section can not be defeated because the requirements for relief under section may not also have been met.citation.wozniak lucutz th,disapproved on other grounds in le francois goel cal th,fn.
factual and procedural background 
a.the underlying proceedings.
in,plaintiff ron burns construction company burns filed this action against moore electric,david moore,and gail le moore collectively moore 
in,the trial court entered judgment in favor of burns and against moore.moore appealed.in may,we issued our opinion affirming the judgment.we also awarded burns costs on appeal.on september,we issued our remittitur.
under california rules of court,rule c,a motion for attorney fees on appeal must be filed within days after the clerk sends notice of issuance of the remittitur.see also former cal.rules of court,rule d,now cal.rules of court,rule c.accordingly,the original deadline for filing such a motion was october.
under california rules of court,rule c,however,t he parties may by stipulation filed before the expiration of the time allowed under c extend the time for filing the motion up to an additional days.italics added.
b.the stipulations to extend time.
the following facts were shown by burns eventual motion for relief from default.
after the issuance of the remittitur,burns counsel prepared a motion for attorney fees.before filing it,however,he contacted moore counsel in the hope of settling the attorney fee claim.negotiations ensued.
on october,both counsel agreed in writing to extend the deadline for filing a motion for attorney fees to october.at the time,however,this agreement was not filed with the trial court.
on october,burns counsel sent moore counsel a fax confirming that they had orally agreed to extend the deadline again to october.once again,this agreement was not filed with the trial court.
on october,burns counsel sent moore counsel another fax confirming that they had orally agreed to further extend the deadline to october.yet again,this agreement was not filed with the trial court.
meanwhile,during the last week of october,a number of wildfires broke out,including the witch creek fire and the poomacha fire.these fires threatened burns counsel ranch and law office and made it essentially impossible for him to file the motion.
on october,in a telephone conversation,moore counsel denied having extended the deadline beyond october.
subsequent proceedings.
on november,burns filed an ex parte application for an order that a motion for attorney fees was still timely.it stated counsel agreed to extend the deadline to october.as such,there should be no issue as to timeliness.if,however,this court finds that there was no agreement to extend the date,then plaintiff requests relief under ccp the trial court denied the ex parte application,ruling that the issue of timeliness m ay be addressed in a formal,noticed motion.
on november,burns filed a motion for attorney fees.it stated that the issue of the timeliness of this motion is addressed in the earlier ex parte application,which was attached and incorporated by reference.
moore filed an opposition to the motion for attorney fees.the parties have not seen fit to include this opposition in the appellate record.however,it evidently argued that the motion was untimely.on january,the trial court denied the motion as untimely.
on march,burns filed a motion for relief from default under section.moore did not deny granting the extensions of time.earlier,moore counsel had denied extending the time to file a memorandum of costs,but not the time to file a motion for attorney fees.indeed,moore did not submit any declaration or other evidence in opposition to the motion.rather,moore argued that,because the motion for attorney fees had already been denied,the motion under section effectively sought reconsideration,in violation of section.
on september,after hearing argument,the trial court denied the motion.it ruled that the motion for attorney fees had been untimely due to an inexcusable mistake of law and that the motion under section was an improper attempt to circumvent ccp.
appealability 
preliminarily,moore argues that this appeal is untimely because it was not filed within days after the denial of the motion for attorney fees.see cal.rules of court,rule a.
this argument is frivolous.burns is appealing,not from the order denying the motion for attorney fees,but from the order denying relief from default under section.the latter is a separately appealable postjudgment order.code civ,subd.a see huh wang th.
moore argues that deeming this appeal timely filed gives tacit approval to the practice of a previously denied motion in order to reset the deadline for appeal of motions.it is true that,as a general rule,an appeal will not lie from a postjudgment order unless it raises issues different from those arising from an appeal from the judgment.lakin watkins associated industries cal th.nevertheless,it is a recognized exception to this rule that an appeal lies from the denial of a statutory motion to vacate an appealable judgment or order,from denial of a motion made under citations.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.
moreover,in this case,the appeal from the order denying the motion to vacate does,in fact,raise different issues than an appeal from the order denying the motion for attorney fees.in the motion for attorney fees,burns took the position that the motion was timely because there had been a valid extension of time.the trial court disagreed and ruled that the motion was untimely.burns therefore filed the motion under section,arguing that it was entitled to relief from default based on excusable neglect.this was a different issue from whether the fee motion had been timely in the first place.see doppes bentley motors,th,motion to set aside judgment under code civ,on the ground that trial court lacked jurisdiction to award prejudgment interest raised different issue than judgment itself did.
as we will discuss below,there is at least an issue as to whether burns was entitled to seek relief by way of a motion for relief from default under section,rather than a motion for reconsideration under section.this,however,goes to the ultimate question of whether the appeal is meritorious.it has no bearing on whether the order is appealable.it is.
the motion for relief from default 
burns contends that the trial court erred by denying the motion for relief from default under section.
excusable inexcusable neglect.
under section,subdivision b,the trial court can relieve a party from any order resulting from mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.
t he policy of the law is to have every litigated case tried upon its merits,and it looks with disfavor upon a party,who,regardless of the merits of the case,attempts to take advantage of the mistake,surprise,inadvertence,or neglect of his adversary.citations.weitz yankosky cal d.hence,t he provisions of section of the code of civil procedure are to be liberally construed citation.citation.a ny doubts in applying section must be resolved in favor of the party seeking relief from default.citation.maynard brandon cal th.section is often applied liberally where the party in default moves promptly to seek relief,and the party opposing the motion will not suffer prejudice if relief is granted.citations.in such situations very slight evidence will be required to justify a court in setting aside the default.citations.elston city of turlock cal d.
a motion seeking such relief lies within the sound discretion of the trial court,and the trial court decision will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion.citations.however,the trial court discretion is not unlimited and must be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice.citations.elston city of turlock,supra,cal d at.a trial court order denying relief is scrutinized more carefully than an order permitting trial on the merits.citations.id.at.
here,burns counsel made two mistakes.first,he failed to file a written stipulation to extend the time for filing a motion for attorney fees by october,when the original time expired.second,he failed to file a motion for attorney fees by october,when the extended time expired.it is not seriously disputed that the second mistake was excusable,due to the southern california wildfires.the trial court,however,found that the first mistake was inexcusable neglect,in light of california rules of court,rule c.
while a mistake in law is a ground for relief under section,the issue of which mistake in law constitutes excusable neglect presents a question of fact.the determining factors are the reasonableness of the misconception and the justifiability of lack of determination of the correct law.citation.citation.i gnorance of the law coupled with negligence in ascertaining it will certainly sustain a finding denying relief.citations.citation.robbins los angeles unified school dist.th.
under controlling case law,however,burns counsel was entitled to rely on his adversary actual and undisputed agreement such reliance was not inexcusable neglect,even in the face of a rule requiring him to file a written stipulation with the court.frank beckett bobbitt d supp.is most closely in point.there,the plaintiff attorney orally granted the defendant attorney an extension of time to answer the complaint.the defendant attorney sent a confirming letter.nevertheless,while the oral extension was still in effect,the plaintiff attorney obtained a default judgment.id.at.the trial court denied the defendant motion to vacate the default judgment under section.frank beckett,at.
the appellate court held that this was an abuse of discretion.frank beckett bobbitt,supra,d supp.at.it acknowledged that s ection,code of civil procedure,provides,that stipulations between attorneys must either a be in writing filed with the clerk,or b be entered on the minutes of the court.it is commonly known,however,that notwithstanding this section,it is a matter of common practice among attorneys to honor oral stipulations relating to actions pending in our courts.certainly,it is not the purpose of the section to encourage a disrespect for such oral stipulations.its underlying purpose is to avoid misunderstandings which may arise where there is a dispute as to the precise meaning of such oral stipulations.this court is not divested,in a case of the character here involved,of its broad discretionary power to relieve a party from a default which he suffered in reliance on an oral stipulation with his adversary.id.at.
the court concluded that the defendant counsel was justified in relying on the oral agreement having acquiesced in and accepted the oral stipulation,the plaintiff was thereafter bound to honor that stipulation to the fullest degree,and plaintiff attorney could not,in good conscience,enter judgment by default.his act in so doing constituted a violation of his agreement and furnishes ample grounds for vacating the default judgment entered by him.frank beckett bobbitt,supra,d supp.at.
similarly,in johnson sweeney cal,the plaintiff attorney orally granted the defendant attorney an extension of time to file a demurrer.nevertheless,before the extension expired,the plaintiff attorney obtained the entry of a default judgment.the trial court denied a motion to set aside the default judgment.id.at.
the supreme court reversed.it explained it is a general rule that a stipulation of counsel can not be enforced unless put in writing,or entered in the minutes of the court but where an oral agreement for an extension of time to answer or demur is admitted,and has been relied on by the defendant,a judgment by default,taken against him in violation of the terms of the stipulation,will be set aside.if the party against whom a verbal stipulation is invoked denies that such a stipulation was made,the court will not hear the parties for the purpose of settling the dispute but where the facts relied upon by the moving party are not controverted,there is no reason for the application of the rule,and it is too late to repudiate the stipulation after it has been executed.johnson sweeney,supra,cal.at see also waybright anderson cal,trial court could find that counsel reliance on adversary oral stipulation was excusable neglect.
here,moore counsel has never denied granting at least two extensions of time.apparently he did,in one conversation,deny granting the third extension however,he did not deny it in opposition to the motion under section,nor does he deny it in this appeal.he granted these extensions even though the first one had not been timely filed with the court.his client benefited from the extensions,because it gained the opportunity to try to settle burns claim for attorney fees.under these circumstances,he is taking advantage of burns counsel mistake in precisely the manner that is disfavored by law,to say nothing of common decency.the failure of burns counsel to file a written stipulation by october is therefore excusable neglect as a matter of law.
b.the applicability of section.
the trial court also reasoned,in part,that burns was trying to use section as an end run around section this motion,in effect,is a motion for reconsideration of the motion for attorney fees and costs,and burns has presented no new or different facts,circumstances or law that could not have been presented at the original hearing that would warrant such reconsideration.
in support of this conclusion,the trial court cited gilberd ac transit,supra,th first,div.two.as we will show,however,gilberd conflicts with more recent cases,which we find to be better reasoned.
in gilberd,the lower court granted the plaintiff petition for relief from the requirements of the government claims act.the defendant then filed a motion for reconsideration under section.the motion also sought,in the alternative,relief under section,on the ground that the defendant counsel failure to request a hearing after the trial court had already issued a tentative ruling in favor of the plaintiff constituted an excusable mistake.the trial court granted reconsideration,denied the plaintiff petition,and sustained a demurrer to the complaint,without leave to amend.gilberd ac transit,supra,th at 
the appellate court reversed,holding that the defendant had failed to show any new or different facts,circumstances,or law,as section w
