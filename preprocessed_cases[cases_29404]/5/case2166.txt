plaintiff national technical systems nts seeks a writ of mandate directing respondent superior court to vacate its order granting certain motions in limine filed by defendant and real party in interest united pacific insurance company upic or the surety and to enter a new order denying the motions.
in this action,nts,a subcontractor,seeks to enforce a stop notice release bond against upic,the bond surety.the trial court rulings preclude nts from presenting evidence of the prior trial or judgment it obtained against the general contractor,and from presenting evidence regarding its attorney fees and statutory interest penalties.the issues presented are whether the surety is bound by the judgment in the prior action against its principal to which the surety was not a party,and whether the surety liability on the stop notice release bond extends to attorney fees and statutory penalties.
we conclude the surety is not bound by the earlier judgment against its principal and therefore upic is not bound by the provisions in that judgment awarding attorney fees and statutory penalties to nts.however,a surety liability on the bond is commensurate with that of its principal.therefore,upon an appropriate showing,nts may recover attorney fees and statutory penalties against upic.the petition is granted with directions.
factual and procedural background 
the prior action.
on april,commercial contractors,the general contractor entered into a contract with the city of long beach the city,a public entity,to perform remediation and excavation work in the port of long beach on april,the general contractor hired nts as a subcontractor on the project.
nts claimed it was only partially paid for services rendered to the general contractor,and on march,nts filed a stop notice with the city in the amount of 
on april,the general contractor obtained a stop notice release bond from upic,the surety,in the sum of to release money withheld on the stop notice.on april,upic notified nts that the general contractor had filed a bond to release money withheld on the stop notice.
although nts was aware of upic issuance of the bond,on may,nts filed suit against the general contractor the nts cci action,super.county,no,seeking damages on the contract,enforcement of the stop notice,and recovery on the bond,without naming the surety.
on or about january,on the eve of trial,nts moved for leave to file a second amended complaint to add upic as a party and to add a new cause of action for recovery on the bond so that it may avail itself of the summary proceeding provided by section of the california bond and undertaking law code civ,et otherwise,plaintiff will be required to file a separate civil action against the general contractor and the surety to recover on the bond.
the general contractor opposed the motion to amend,arguing upic had not participated in any manner during the course of the litigation and that it would be unduly prejudicial to upic to force it to defend itself on the eve of trial.the trial court denied leave to amend because trial was imminent and upic had not been involved in any of the discovery or other trial preparation in the action.the matter came on for a jury trial,the amount due and owing from the general contractor to nts was litigated,and the trial court entered judgment in favor of nts.neither party appealed.
on october,nts made demand upon upic for payment of,including the damages award of,prejudgment interest,in attorney fees,and statutory interest penalties pursuant to business and professions code section of two percent per month.
upic refused to pay.it advised nts by letter that it was never served with the lawsuit or made a party to the lawsuit.the first notice of claim was the subcontractor letter of october.the verdict does not mention either the stop notice,the city or the surety.the subcontractor judgment is only against the general contractor.while we do not require that you file an action to enforce your rights,the surety is not bound by the judgment there is no basis at this time to make payment to your client.if your client seeks to enforce its rights on the stop notice release bond,the surety will have the opportunity to assert all the relevant defenses on the claim 
on march,nts filed a motion for summary enforcement of the judgment against upic pursuant to section.nts asserted that having obtained a judgment against the general contractor,and the judgment having become final,nts was now entitled to enforce the judgment against the surety.
on april,the trial court denied nts motion for summary enforcement against upic of the judgment nts had obtained against the general contractor.nts appealed.
in national technical systems commercial contractors,th,d,this court affirmed the order denying nts motion for summary enforcement of the judgment.because the issuance of the stop notice release bond preceded the filing of the lawsuit,the bond was not given in an action or proceeding,and hence,the summary enforcement procedure of section was inapplicable.instead,because the bond preceded the lawsuit,the surety had a right to be joined as a party and to defend the action.nts failure to join upic as a party to the action barred nts from summarily enforcing the judgment against upic.therefore,nts would have to litigate the liability on the bond as against upic.national technical systems,supra,th at,d.
the instant action.
on march,during the pendency of nts prior action against the general contractor,nts filed the instant action against the surety the nts upic action,super.county,no.nts alleged causes of action for recovery on the stop notice release bond and breach of the written bond contract between the general contractor and upic,which had been issued for nts benefit.
on or about january,upic filed two motions in limine.the first motion sought to preclude evidence of the previous trial and judgment against the general contractor on the ground that upic was not named as a party to the prior action and therefore upic was not bound by nts judgment against the general contractor.in the second motion,upic sought to preclude evidence of nonrecoverable damages,contending that certain elements of damage asserted by nts,specifically,attorney fees,statutory penalties,delay or other damages,were not recoverable under the stop notice release bond,and upic liability was limited to the value of labor,services,equipment or materials actually furnished to the project.
the trial court granted both motions in limine.it ruled upic was not bound by nts judgment against the general contractor,that the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply,and upic may relitigate the issue of damages.further,upic was not liable to nts for the attorney fee award which was entered against the general contractor or for statutory penalties,and upic liability on the bond was limited to the value of labor,services,equipment or materials actually furnished to the project.
nts filed the instant petition for writ of mandate,seeking review of the trial court ruling on the motions in limine.this court issued an order to show cause.
contentions 
nts contends the trial court erred in granting upic motions in limine because upic is bound by the judgment against the general contractor,and upic liability on the bond extends to the attorney fees and penalties awarded against the general contractor as part of the judgment obtained by nts 
discussion 
trial court properly granted motion in limine to the extent it precluded evidence of the judgment against the general contractor because the surety is not bound by the subcontractor judgment against the general contractor.
upic is not bound by nts judgment against the general contractor because i t is well established that a judgment against a principal is not binding in a separate action against a surety.mahana alexander,kane mendenhall cal d,jew pacific employers ins.d.all bay mill lumber surety d.
all bay mill lumber is illustrative.there,a building material supplier brought an action against a general contractor and the contractor license bond surety to recover for unpaid materials it had supplied.all bay mill lumber surety,supra,d at.the contractor did not answer the complaint and a default judgment was entered against it.id.at.the action against the surety went to trial and the surety prevailed.id.at.the reviewing court rejected the plaintiff contention the default judgment against the contractor was binding on the surety.id.at.
in concluding the judgment against the principal was not binding on the surety,all bay mill lumber explained in the case of official bonds,the surety undertakes in general terms that the principal will perform his official duty.they do not agree to be absolutely bound by any judgment obtained against the principal for official misconduct nor to pay any such judgment.they are only held for a breach of their own obligations.it is a general principle that no party can be so held without an opportunity to be heard in defense.this right is not divested by the fact that another party has defended on the cause of action and has been unsuccessful.as the surety did not stipulate that it would be absolutely bound by the judgment against the principal or permit it to conduct the defense and be themselves responsible for the result of it,the fact that the principal has unsuccessfully defended has no effect on their rights.mahana alexander,supra.at,quoting pico webster cal.all bay mill lumber,supra,d at,italics added.
guided by the above authorities,we conclude upic is not bound by the judgment nts obtained against the general contractor.
an additional rationale for holding upic is not bound by nts judgment against the general contractor is found in national technical systems,supra,th,d.as we explained,the reason for distinguishing between a bond given before an action is commenced and a bond given afterwards pertains to the surety right to notice.where the stop notice release bond is issued after the filing of the lawsuit,is given in an action or proceeding,the surety is deemed to have notice of the action.at that juncture,the surety may move to intervene in the action,or it may simply elect to await the final judgment in the action and the plaintiff enforcement of the liability on the bond through the summary procedure of section.that decision is left to the surety.however,where the stop notice release bond is issued before the lawsuit is filed,the bond is not given in an action or proceeding,and consequently the plaintiff is required to join both the principal and surety pursuant to section,thereby giving the surety notice of the action so as to enable the surety to protect its rights.national technical systems,supra,th at,d.
accordingly,the trial court properly granted upic motion in limine to exclude any reference to the judgment which nts obtained against the general contractor.
however,to the extent the trial court precluded nts from referring in any way to the previous trial,that ruling was overbroad.for example,there may be testimony in the previous trial which may be admissible for impeachment purposes.upic rights are sufficiently protected by precluding nts from presenting any evidence of the verdict or judgment against the general contractor.the ruling shall be modified accordingly.
trial court erred in granting motion in limine to exclude evidence of nts attorney fees and statutory penalties.
as explained,upic is not bound by the prior judgment and therefore upic is not bound by the provisions in the judgment awarding attorney fees and statutory penalties to nts.however,the issue remains whether,upon a proper showing,nts may recover attorney fees and statutory penalties against the surety.we address the issue to guide the parties on remand.see code civ.
civil code section does not limit the scope of the surety liability on the bond.
upic contends,and the trial court found,the surety liability on a stop notice release bond is limited to the value of labor,services,equipment or materials furnished to the project.upic argument rests on civil code section,which requires a claimant to set forth in a stop notice,inter alia,the kind of labor,services,equipment,or materials furnished or agreed to be furnished by such claimant,subd.a and the amount in value,as near as may be,of that already done or furnished and of the whole agreed to be done or furnished,subd.c.based on the above,upic contends a surety issuing a stop notice release bond can not be liable for attorney fees or any other types of damage.
upic reads too much into civil code section.that statute simply dictates what information a claimant must provide in a stop notice.however,the statute does not purport to govern the nature of the surety liability on a stop notice release bond and does not resolve the issue of a surety liability for attorney fees or statutory penalties.
surety liability for attorney fees.
the issue presented is whether nts,as the claimant on the stop notice release bond,is entitled to recover attorney fees from the surety based on the attorney fees clause in the subcontract.
here,the subcontract between the general contractor and nts included the following attorney fees clause in the event either contractor or subcontractor institutes suit in court against the other party,or against the surety of such party,in connection with any dispute or matter arising under this agreement,the party which prevails in that suit shall be entitled to recover from the other its attorney fees in reasonable amount,which shall be determined by the court and included in the judgment in said suit.
civil code section broadly provides where one assumes liability as surety upon a conditional obligation,his liability is commensurate with that of the principal the purpose of the bond is to serve as security for the covenants of the underlying contract.citations.t r painting construction,paul fire marine ins.hereafter t r painting th,d.it reasonably follows that upic liability on the stop notice release bond extends to the attorney fees to which nts is entitled under the subcontract.
