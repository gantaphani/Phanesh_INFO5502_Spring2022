richard adams petitions for review of the denial of his application for attorneys fees under the equal access to justice act eaja.the securities and exchange commission ruled that adams application was untimely because it was not filed within days of the final disposition of his adversary adjudication as required by a.the commission reasoned that although its eaja regulations define final to mean final and unappealable,b,because adams was not aggrieved by the order of dismissal in his favor,the order was unappealable at its issuance hence,there was no basis on which to conclude that the filing deadline commenced only after the statutory period for appeal had expired rather than immediately upon the issuance of the order of dismissal.adams contends that the commission has confused the issue of appealability in the context of eaja,with the underlying merits of an appeal.in other words,regardless of whether the disposition giving rise to the eaja fee is specifically appealable,the eaja filing deadline should not expire in any case until days after the time for appeal under the relevant law of appealability,here a,has expired or the appeal has been completed.we agree,for the commission position involves the awkward practice of requiring a examination of appealability contrary to the purposes of eaja.accordingly,we grant the petition to the extent of reversing the denial of adams eaja application we remand the case to the commission to determine adams eligibility for fees.
the division of enforcement of the commission has pursued both judicial and administrative proceedings against adams.beginning september,the division filed a civil injunctive action in the united states district court for the district of new jersey alleging that adams and others engaged in the fraudulent offer and sale at artificial prices of securities in initial public offerings and manipulated the in those securities from january,to december,in violation of a,b,c,and a of the securities act of,b and c of the securities exchange act of,and rules,and thereunder.sec graystone nash,rev,cir.based on a record limited by an order precluding adams from presenting certain evidence because of his initial invocation of the fifth amendment,the district court granted summary judgment to the division and ordered both injunctive relief and disgorgement in the amount of.id.at.the third circuit reversed on the ground that the district court failed to consider the relevant factors in concluding that preclusion was appropriate.sec graystone nash,cir.on remand,the district court stayed the litigation pending resolution of the division administrative proceeding,which was commenced prior to the decision of the third circuit.
on april,the commission instituted administrative proceedings against adams,pursuant to b and of the exchange act.in re graystone nash,admin.proc.file,wl,sec lexis.the commission denied adams motion to dismiss the administrative claims as time barred,but dismissed the proceedings based on the district court entry of an injunction.in re graystone nash,exchange act release,admin.proc.file,wl,at,sec lexis,at june.an administrative law judge alj thereafter held an evidentiary hearing on the remaining,independently alleged violations by the division.in re graystone nash,sec docket,admin.proc.file,wl,at,sec lexis,at june.the alj dismissed the proceedings on two grounds first,as time barred in light of an intervening decision by this court in johnson sec,holding that the statute of limitations set forth in applied to such proceedings,and second,on the alternate ground that the division failed to prove that adams violated the securities laws.in re graystone nash,wl,at,sec lexis,at.the division appealed and the commission,on february,dismissed the administrative proceeding.the full main text of the commission opinion stated 
on june,an administrative law judge dismissed proceedings that had been brought by our division of enforcement against richard adams.the law judge based her dismissal on the decision in johnson sec,which held that section prohibited this commission from imposing a censure and a supervisory suspension in an administrative proceeding because the proceeding had been initiated more than five years after the conduct at issue.it is undisputed that all of the conduct at issue here occurred more than five years before the institution of proceedings.the law judge further found that the division had not proved that adams violated any section of the securities laws,and used that finding as an alternative basis for her decision to dismiss.on july,we granted the division petition for review.
although the division vigorously disputes the law judge factual conclusions,it has decided not to seek reversal of her decision in light of the johnson decision and the current procedural posture of this case.in a parallel proceeding in federal district court,the division is currently seeking an injunction against adams based on the same allegations as in this proceeding.we have determined that,given the age of this case and that the division does not oppose dismissal,it is appropriate to dismiss this matter.we intimate no view on the merits.
accordingly,it is ordered that this proceeding be,and it hereby is,dismissed.
in re adams,exchange act release,wl,admin.proc.file,sec lexis,footnotes omitted.no appeal was filed.
on may,days after the commission dismissed the administrative proceedings,adams filed an application for attorneys fees pursuant to eaja.the alj rejected the division position that the fee application was untimely,and found that adams was entitled to attorneys fees because the division position at the hearing was not substantially justified.in re adams,initial decision release,admin.proc.file,wl.the division appealed and the commission reversed,denying the fee application as untimely because it was filed more than thirty days after the final disposition of the agency adjudication,citing a and the commission eaja regulations,b.in re adams,exchange act release,admin.proc.file,sec lexis,at.the commission noted that under a of the securities exchange act,a,only a person aggrieved by a final order of the commission has a right to appeal,and that adams had no standing to appeal because he was not aggrieved by the commission order of dismissal.in re adams,sec lexis,at.hence,in the commission view,the order of dismissal of february,constituted a final disposition under eaja because it was both final and unappealable,giving adams only days thereafter to file an eaja application.concluding that adams application was untimely,the commission did not reach the merits of adams entitlement to fees.id.at.
under of eaja,an agency shall award attorneys fees and costs to a prevailing party other than the united states unless the agency position was substantially justified if the requesting party submits an application within thirty days of a final disposition in the adversary adjudication.a.an adversary adjudication is defined to mean i a formal agency adjudication in which the position of the united states is represented by counsel,excluding adjudications as to rate making and licensing,ii proceedings before agency boards of contract appeals,iii agency hearings under the program fraud civil remedies act of,an administrative scheme similar to the false claims act,and iv agency hearings under the religious freedom restoration act of.id.b c.section does not define final disposition.the commission eaja regulations,however,provide that a fee application must be filed within days of the commission final disposition,which it defines as the date a decision or order becomes final and unappealable,both within the commission and to the courts.
adams counsel,presumably reading these provisions of the statute and the commission regulation together,concluded that adams had days in which he could file his application for fees days for the time for appeal to expire under a of the exchange act at which time the order of dismissal would become final and unappealable and then days from this now final and unappealable dismissal order to file his fee application as provided in a.although,in light of the commission unappealability rationale for denying adams fee application,the parties devote nearly all of their briefs on appeal to the question whether the february,order of dismissal was appealable by adams,we conclude that the case specific approach adopted by the commission is inconsistent with the purposes of eaja and unworkable in practice.first,however,we hold as a threshold matter that the meaning of final disposition in a is ambiguous,but that congress intended it to mean final and not appealable.in so doing,we readily acknowledge that the question is one of first impression,that the statutory language and the legislative history are unhelpful on the precise question,and that eaja precedent addresses only eaja applications under in connection with judicial proceedings.nevertheless,we conclude that this guidance is relevant for two reasons first,the underlying concerns that led the circuit courts of appeals and ultimately congress to conclude that the deadline should not begin to run until the appeals process is completed are also relevant in the administrative context,and second,the administrative conference of the united states,and consequently the commission,has adopted eaja regulations reflecting the clarification that congress enacted in for eaja requests in judicial proceedings.
prior to the reenactment of eaja,provided that a party filing an application for fees in the court shall,within thirty days of final judgment in the action,submit to the court an application for fees d b amended.the circuit courts of appeals differed as to whether the deadline for filing a fee application commenced upon a final but appealable order of the district court or not until the expiration of the time for appeal or the completion of any appeal taken.in mcquiston marsh,cir,the ninth circuit held that the deadline commenced with the final order of the district court,stating that final judgement should be defined by its common usage in contexts such as,fed.a,and.id.at.the seventh circuit,in mcdonald schweiker,cir,disagreed,holding that the period did not commence until after the appeals were completed.id.at accord.union of pub.hous.tenants,pierce.observing that the practical consequences of the ninth circuit approach militated against its adoption,the seventh circuit rejected the ninth circuit conclusion as short on rationale,particularly as neither nor rule a refer to a final judgment.mcdonald,at.noting that other circuits had held that the fee application could be filed after the completion of appellate proceedings,and concluding that theirs is the better approach,the seventh circuit also observed that congress could clarify the matter if it decided to reenact eaja,which was due to expire in ten months,on october,title ii,c,stat.mcdonald,at.congress responded by amending to define final judgment as a judgment that is final and not appealable,and includes an order of settlement,stat,codified at d g.the house report states that the amendment adopted the seventh circuit approach in mcdonald,at,code cong.admin.news at.
unlike,however,the eaja provision on agency proceedings is unhelpful even after congress reenactment of eaja,with amendments,in answering the question whether the deadline for filing commences with a final and appealable agency order or not until the appeal time has expired or any appeal is completed.the only possibly relevant amendment to was the addition of the sentence 
when the united states appeals the underlying merits of an adversary adjudication,no decision on an application for fees and other expenses in connection with that adversary adjudication shall be made under this section until a final and unreviewable decision is rendered by the court on the appeal or until the underlying merits of the case have been finally determined pursuant to the appeal.
a.this sentence,however,lends itself to alternative readings it can be read as presupposing the existence of a timely filed fee application,meaning that the fee application must be filed within days of the final agency order,with the only restriction being that when the government files an appeal,the agency can not act on the application until the appeal is completed or,the language can be read as only reaffirming that no fees are appropriately awarded pursuant to until the government efforts to appeal are completed,but leaving open the question of when a disposition is final for purposes of the commencement of the deadline.indeed,the latter reading is consistent with the possibility that the filing period is a time limit and not a window for filing,so that a fee applicant could file for fees before there were either a final disposition or a final judgment.see,at,at,code cong.admin.news at,at,code cong.admin.news at.compare.union of pub.hous.tenants,at citing mcdonald,at,with melkonyan sullivan,d.
in light of congress adoption of its approach,the seventh circuit analysis of when eaja deadline begins to run is highly relevant to understanding the meaning of final disposition in a.the seventh circuit made four salient observations,all of which are applicable in agency as well as judicial proceedings.first,the court stated that it could not imagine that the government would be willing to pay fees before the time after completion of all appeals or the expiration of the time limitations for appeals.mcdonald,at.this would appear to be no less true in administrative proceedings.certainly,if the instant case is representative,it is clear that the government would strongly urge that its position was substantially justified,a position consistent with the government appealing when it can.second,the seventh circuit noted the cost to the applicant of having to file multiple fee following the judgment in the district court and another following the judgment from the court of appeals.id.at.it is no less true in cases arising in the administrative context that it makes more sense,at least from the claimant viewpoint,to be able to file a single application at the conclusion of all the proceedings.id.even if eaja may still allow the filing of two applications by reading eaja period as not a window for filing,but rather merely as a deadline for filing,allowing the applicant to choose when to file does not disadvantage the government g iving the claimant a choice whether to ask for fees after he wins in the district court or after the appeal maximizes his welfare,at some cost perhaps to the courts but none we can think of to the executive branch.id.at.third,the seventh circuit rejected as insignificant any judicial economy at the appellate level that would result from requiring the fee application to be filed within days of the district court final judgment,and thereby allowing the fee award to be acted on in time to allow an appeal from the fee award to be consolidated with the appeal from the judgment.id.at.the court noted,in part,that the judicial economy may be largely illusory if the claimant is entitled in suitable cases to reimbursement of appellate fees.id.here,too,the situation would be analogous in agency proceedings we find no evidence that appellate economy warrants an earlier application deadline in light of the lost economy from multiple fee applications.further,appellate economy is built into the statutory scheme for fees in administrative proceedings c and d work in tandem so that the appeals court can award fees for both the agency and court proceedings.see c d.fourth,the seventh circuit took account of the fact that forcing a claimant to file a fee application within days of the final judgment of the district court delivers into the hands of the government a potent,acknowledged,and from the standpoint of the policy of eaja perverse weapon for discouraging meritorious fee applications.mcdonald,at.in mcdonald,the fee applicant had recovered only a wretched pittance in social security benefits.id.her attorney thus faced the dilemma of choosing between jeopardizing her reward by filing a fee request to recover reasonable attorneys fees,which raises the stakes for the government and hence makes the government more likely to appeal,or foregoing a fee application altogether.id.although adam
