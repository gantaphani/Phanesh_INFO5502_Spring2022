appellant diskeeper corporation diskeeper challenges the trial court denial of a award of attorney fees following the confirmation of an arbitration award.diskeeper contends the court improperly denied the award on the ground that diskeeper filed no memorandum of costs in seeking the award.we conclude that diskeeper contention is correct.specifically,we hold that a party seeking attorney fees pursuant to civil code section need not,in addition to filing a noticed motion,file a memorandum of costs.we therefore reverse the court ruling and remand for further proceedings.
relevant factual and procedural background 
this is the second time this case has come before us on appeal.diskeeper is a software company located in burbank.in,diskeeper hired respondent alexander godelman as its chief information officer,and also hired marc leshay,who worked as godelman subordinate.after leshay resigned from his position,diskeeper terminated godelman.
in,godelman and leshay initiated a lawsuit against diskeeper in which godelman asserted claims for wrongful termination.respondent barry kaufman,an attorney,represented godelman and leshay in the action.later,in,godelman and leshay entered into a settlement of their action against diskeeper.the settlement agreement required godelman and leshay to return diskeeper property,including enumerated records,and imposed nondisclosure obligations on them and kaufman.other terms of the agreement obliged the parties to submit disputes to binding arbitration.the agreement also contained an attorney fee provision,which provided for a fee award to the prevailing party in any litigation,arbitration,or other proceeding brought for the interpretation or enforcement of the agreement.
in january,diskeeper commenced an arbitration,alleging that respondents godelman and kaufman had failed to comply with their obligations under the settlement agreement to return some documents and not to disclose their contents.diskeeper asserted claims against respondents for breach of the settlement agreement,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,unjust enrichment,misrepresentation,and civil conspiracy.the matter was submitted to arbitration.on april,the arbitrator issued his final award,concluding,inter alia,that godelman had breached his duty to return diskeeper property,and that kaufman had breached his nondisclosure obligations.the arbitrator further determined that diskeeper was entitled to in damages,in attorney fees,and in costs and expenses 
in may,appellants filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award.they later filed an amended petition and motions to vacate the award.diskeeper opposed the petitions and motions,and filed a motion to confirm the award.following a hearing,the trial court confirmed the arbitration award.on december,the court entered a judgment in favor of diskeeper,from which respondents noticed an appeal.in an unpublished opinion,we affirmed the judgment kaufman diskeeper.
on january,diskeeper filed a motion for an award of attorney fees and costs as the prevailing party in the arbitration confirmation proceeding.relying on civil code section and code of civil procedure section,diskeeper requested attorney fees totaling,plus for other costs and expenses.in opposing the motion,respondents contended that diskeeper had filed no memorandum of costs,as specified in rule of the california rules of court rule.diskeeper reply maintained that rule of the california rules of court rule,which regulates the recovery of contractual attorney fees,imposes no requirement of a memorandum of costs.on march,the trial court denied diskeeper motion,concluding that under the controlling statutes and rules of court,a memorandum of costs must be filed in order to establish an entitlement to costs,including attorney fees.this appeal followed.
discussion 
diskeeper contention on appeal focuses exclusively on the denial of its request for an award of attorney fees.that contention raises an issue of first impression,as our research has disclosed no published decision examining whether a party seeking contractual attorney fees subject to civil code section must file a memorandum of costs regarding the fees.as explained below,we conclude that the applicable statutes and court rules imposed no such requirement on diskeeper

applicable statutes 
as statutes control over court rules california court reporters judicial council of california th,we begin by examining the statutory scheme applicable to diskeeper fee request.because diskeeper incurred its fees in confirming an arbitration award arising from a mandatory arbitration provision in the settlement agreement,and its attorney fee request was based on the fee provision in that agreement,the request was subject to civil code section.mbna america bank,gorman th supp,supp.subdivision a of that statute provides reasonable attorney fees shall be fixed by the court,and shall be an element of the costs of suit.subdivision b of the statute further provides that t he court,upon notice and motion by a party,shall determine who is the party prevailing on the contract for purposes of this section.
the principal statutes governing the recovery of costs are found in the code of civil procedure et.witkin,cal.procedure ed.judgment.pertinent here is code of civil procedure section,which addresses the recovery of attorney fees under civil code section.section,subdivision a,permits an award of attorney fees as an item of costs when authorized by a contract.subdivision c of that statute further provides that attorney fees awarded under civil code section fall within the scope of subdivision a a,and thus must be fixed either upon a noticed motion or upon entry of a default judgment,unless otherwise provided by stipulation of the parties.the legislature enacted the relevant portions of code of civil procedure section,subdivision c to clarify that the proper method to recover contractual attorney fees is as an item of costs awarded upon noticed motion,rather than as an element of damages pleaded in the complaint.chinn kmr property management th.as noted in bankes lucas th,in amending subdivision c of the statute to contain those provisions,the legislature stated that its intent was to confirm that attorney fees under civil code section are costs which are to be awarded only upon noticed motion,except where the parties stipulate otherwise or judgment is entered by default.quoting stats,ch.
also pertinent here is code of civil procedure section,which authorizes the judicial council to propound rules regulating the recovery of allowable costs incurred before the trial court or on appeal although code of civil procedure section obliges a party seeking attorney fees under civil code section to do so by a noticed motion,neither statute expressly mandates that the party also file a memorandum of costs to secure such fees.for that reason,resolution of the issue before us ultimately hinges on the key rules adopted by the judicial council.these are the rules found in division of the rules of court under the title,attorney fees and costs,namely,rules and.
