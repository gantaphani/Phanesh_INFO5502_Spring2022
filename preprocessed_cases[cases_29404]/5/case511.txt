background 
factual history 
the two individual,larry bridges bridges and joyce riley riley,began working for mississippi power light company before it was acquired by entergy,entergy during their employment with,bridges and riley were also members of the international brotherhood of electrical workers.local unions and of the international brotherhood of electrical workers collectively,ibew are the other two after several years of service,bridges and riley,both african americans,were laid off in due to a general reduction across workforce the circumstances surrounding these layoffs gave rise to the plaintiffs lawsuit.
at the time of these layoffs,ibew and had reached a collective bargaining agreement which permitted employees with a certain measure of seniority to bump into positions held by more junior employees,provided the senior employees could qualify for the new positions.after they were laid off,both bridges and riley attempted to bump into storekeeper and plant storekeeper positions which were covered by the relevant provisions of the collective bargaining agreement to qualify for the positions,however,bridges and riley had to pass a validated aptitude test known as the clerical aptitude battery cab,test,or cab test after taking the test,both bridges and riley failed to meet the cutoff score set by,and neither was allowed to bump into the storekeeper positions.
this case is somewhat unusual because the validity of the cab test itself was never directly questioned rather,the plaintiffs argued that method of setting the cutoff scores for the storekeeper positions at issue was the unlawful cause of the disparate impact.testing policy can be broken into three separate time periods from to from to and from to the time of the trial in.from to used a cutoff score of for the storekeeper positions,based on eei recommendation.from to used a cutoff score of.by admission,this shift was also based on eei recommendation,after reported significant amounts of turnover in the storekeeper positions and the difficulty encountered by its applicant pool in passing the cab.in,following its acquisition by entergy,raised its cutoff score to for the storekeeper positions,motivated in part by the desire to create uniformity with entergy other divisions.therefore,at the time bridges and riley attempted to bump into the storekeeper positions,the cutoff score was set at.the circumstances surrounding this shift shaped the core issues of the underlying suit and this appeal.
procedural posture 
the plaintiffs filed suit pursuant to which proscribes,inter alia,those employment practices with a disparate and adverse impact upon protected classes which can not be justified by an employer legitimate business needs.at trial,the plaintiffs contended that the increase in the cutoff score from to had a significant adverse and disparate impact on applicants for the storekeeper positions.responded by arguing that its decision to raise the cutoff score was justified by business necessity.the parties presented evidence and arguments during the course of a bench trial on may,and the district court rendered its judgment for the plaintiffs on september,directing to amend its employment practices,awarding the individual plaintiffs lost wages,and awarding the plaintiffs attorneys fees appeals from this judgment.
ii.discussion 
ordinarily,this court reviews a district court legal conclusions de novo and its findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard.see,davis city of dallas,cir.however,when,as here,this court finds that a district court findings were based upon a mistaken impression of applicable legal principles,the reviewing court is not bound by the clearly erroneous standard.walker city of mesquite,cir quoting inwood,ives,d.
we begin our inquiry,of course,with the plain language of the governing statute.moore cain,cir.an unlawful employment practice based on disparate impact is established under k a only when 
i a complaining party demonstrates that a respondent uses a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race,color,religion,sex,or national origin and the respondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related and consistent with business necessity or ii the complaining party makes a demonstration of an acceptable alternative employment practice and the respondent refuses to adopt such alternative employment practice.
k a i,ii emphasis added.the plain language of the statute shows that the burden of demonstrating acceptable alternative employment practices,set forth in k a ii,is one that rests upon title vii plaintiffs,not defendants.id.
this direct and unambiguous statutory language reflects the clear intent of congress.congress set forth this framework for disparate impact suits as part of the civil rights act of.see,stat,adding k a to title vii.in the civil rights act statement of formal purposes,congress stated its intent to provide statutory guidelines for the adjudication of disparate impact suits under title vii and to codify the concepts of business necessity and job related enunciated by the supreme court in griggs duke power,d,and in the other supreme court decisions prior to wards cove packing atonio,d.id,stat.at.
an examination of the supreme court disparate impact decisions before wards cove reveals that congress succeeded in its intent to codify their framework for disparate impact suits in k a i and ii again,this framework plainly establishes that the burden of demonstrating acceptable alternative business practice evidence is one that rests upon title vii plaintiffs,not defendants.shortly after griggs,the supreme court clarified the structure and allocation of burdens in title vii cases thusly 
a business necessity burden arises,of course,only after the complaining party or class has made out a prima facie case of discrimination if an employer does then meet the burden of proving that its tests are job related,it remains open to the complaining party to show that other tests or selection devices,without a similarly undesirable racial effect,would also serve the employer legitimate interest 
albemarle paper moody,d citing mcdonnell douglas green,d internal citations omitted emphasis added the same structure and allocation of burdens were consistently reiterated by the supreme court during the time period between griggs and wards cove.in dothard rawlinson,d,the court held that 
o nce it is thus shown that the employment standards are discriminatory in effect,the employer must meet the burden of showing that any given requirement has a manifest relationship to the employment in question.if the employer proves that the challenged requirements are job related,the plaintiff may then show that other selection devices without a similar discriminatory effect would also serve the employer legitimate interest 
id.at.quoting griggs,at,and albemarle,at.internal citations omitted emphasis added see also connecticut teal,d stating that a title vii plaintiff may still prevail after an showing of business necessity if he shows that the employer was using the practice as a mere pretext for discrimination.this plain and repeated direction from the supreme court,which congress expressly intended to revive,is echoed in the plain language of the governing statute the bu
