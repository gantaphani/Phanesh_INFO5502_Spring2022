in buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health and human resources,d,the supreme court considered the attorney fees provisions of the fair housing amendments act,et,and the americans with disabilities act,et,which permit courts to award fees only to a prevailing party.id.c.the court rejected the plaintiffs contention,which it characterized as the catalyst theory,that a plaintiff is a prevailing party if it achieves the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct.buckhannon,at.rather,the court ruled,for a litigant to be a prevailing party,there must have been a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.id.at.e nforceable judgments on the merits and consent decrees,the court said,suffice to create such a change.id.at.
