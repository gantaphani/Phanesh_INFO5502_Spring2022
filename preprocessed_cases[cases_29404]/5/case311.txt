the estate of antonio palumbo the estate prevailed in its suit against the united states when the district court ruled it was entitled to a tax refund.the estate then sought recovery of all of its attorneys fees and costs under,and alternatively the fees and costs it incurred after december,under the theory that the government rejected its qualified offer made pursuant to g.finding the position of the united states to be substantially justified,the district court denied the estate its fees and costs.on appeal,the estate argues that the position of the united states was not substantially justified and that the net worth requirements of did not prevent it from recovering its fees and costs.we will affirm.
factual and procedural history 
creation of the charitable trust and will contest 
in,antonio palumbo created the and sigismunda palumbo charitable trust the charitable trust.palumbo died in.during his life,he executed various wills and trust instruments his last will was executed on july,the will.the parties agree there was no express residuary provision in the will,despite the fact that each of palumbo previous wills devised the residue to the charitable trust.palumbo attorney admitted that this omission was a scrivener error.
the lack of a residuary clause led to a dispute over who was entitled to the residue.palumbo son claimed he,as palumbo sole intestate heir,was entitled to the residue,while the charitable trust claimed it was entitled to the residue because of the scrivener error.the two sides reached a settlement wherein palumbo son received along with real property in wheeling,west virginia,and the charitable trust received the settlement agreement was approved by an order of the orphans court division of the court of common pleas of elk county,pennsylvania.
federal estate tax refund and fees and costs under 
after the settlement,the estate filed a claim for a federal estate tax charitable deduction in the amount payable to the charitable trust.the commissioner of internal revenue disallowed the charitable deduction,finding that the charitable contribution was made by palumbo son via a settlement agreement,not by palumbo through his will.the estate thereupon brought an action against the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania seeking a refund of the federal estate tax paid on the that was donated to the charitable trust.the district court granted the estate motion for summary judgment the estate then sought its attorneys fees and costs under both as a prevailing party,which would entitle it to full recovery,and as a party who made a qualified offer pursuant to g,which would entitle it to fees incurred after december.
because the district court found the government position in the litigation to be substantially justified,it did not award the estate fees or costs.the district court did not address the net worth requirements imposed by,whether those requirements should apply to the estate or the charitable trust,or the validity of the estate alternative claim that it was entitled to certain costs because it made a qualified offer under g.the estate filed a timely notice of appeal.

iii.analysis 
fee provision statute 
in court proceedings brought by or against the united states in connection with the determination,collection,or refund of any tax,a prevailing party may recover fees and costs incurred in the litigation.a.prevailing party is defined in c 
a in general.the term prevailing party means any party in any proceeding to which subsection a applies other than the united states or any creditor of the taxpayer involved 
i has substantially prevailed with respect to the amount in controversy,or 
ii has substantially prevailed with respect to the most significant issue or set of issues presented,and 
ii which meets the requirements of the sentence of section d b of title,united states code as in effect on october,except to the extent differing procedures are established by rule of court and meets the requirements of section d b of such title as so in effect.
in referencing d b,the statute incorporates the net worth restrictions set forth in the equal access to justice act eaja under the eaja,the recovery of fees and costs is barred if a party net worth exceeds the statutory amount.moreover,the party seeking fees has the burden of proving that it meets the net worth requirements under.tax.e estate of woll commissioner,cir.
congress included a special rule in that applied the net worth requirement to estates.section c d states that the net worth requirement imposed on individuals in d b i shall apply to an estate but shall be determined as of the date of the decedent death.the rule appears to codify estate of hubberd comm r,at the time hubberd was decided,did not contain a special rule subjecting an estate to the net worth requirement.the hubberd court decided that an estate was subject to the net worth requirement set forth in.id.at.the court rejected the estate argument that when applying the net worth requirement a court should consider the net worth of the estate beneficiaries,not the net worth of the estate.id.at.the court explained its reasoning as follows 
the commissioner determined a deficiency against the estate.this case is brought in the name of and on behalf of the estate by its executor.this action is for a redetermination of the estate tax deficiency.an estate is generally responsible for bearing the costs of its own litigation.it follows that we look to the net worth of the estate,and not of the beneficiaries or the executor.
id.at citations omitted 
unlike estates,charitable organizations exempt from taxation under section c of the internal revenue code need not satisfy any net worth requirement to recover fees and costs.such an organization,however,can not recover fees and costs if it had more than employees at the time the civil action was filed.d b ii.
the appellant cites legislative history in the form of the conference report to the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of,the bill that enacted.the applicable senate amendment,which was adopted by the conference,stated costs.a taxpayer may recover costs for a third party incurred by that party on behalf of the taxpayer,cong d sess.
here,in addition to seeking fees and costs as a prevailing party under,the estate seeks to recover under the qualified offer provision of g.a qualified offer under g is made by the taxpayer to the united states within the qualified offer period which starts on the date that the first letter of proposed deficiency is sent to the taxpayer,and ends days before the date the case is first set for trial specifies the offered amount of the taxpayer liability is designated at the time it is made as a qualified offer and remains open during the period beginning on the date it is made,and ending at the earliest of the date the offer is rejected,the date of trial,or the ninetieth day after the offer is made.if the offer fails to meet the requirements,a party can not receive litigation fees and costs.mcgowan comm r,memo,wl at.
parties seeking to recover under either the prevailing party provision or the qualified offer provision must satisfy the net worth requirements discussed above because the resolution of the net worth issue disposes of both issues,we will resolve this case on that ground despite the fact that the district court did not address it.see blum bacon,it is well accepted an appellee may rely upon any matter appearing in the record in support of the judgment below.
application of requirements 
it is undisputed that the estate net worth at the time of the decedent death was greater than,and that,as a result,the estate can not qualify for fees and costs under either of its claims.the charitable trust,however,satisfies the net worth requirements because it is a charitable organization with fewer than employees.the estate has thus argued that the charitable trust is the real party in interest and that the charitable trust,not the estate,qualifies as a prevailing party who incurred fees.
the crux of the estate argument is that because the charitable trust was the sole residuary beneficiary under the settlement agreement,it bore all the expenses incurred to obtain the tax refund,reaped all the benefits of the tax refund,and will reap the benefit of any attorneys fees and costs recovered.in support of its argument,the estate cites a number of cases that looked beyond the named plaintiff and aimed to determine whether the real party in interest could be awarded fees,see,young commissioner,memo,wl,as well as legislative history,see,cong d sess.the estate asserts that these arguments show the charitable trust was the prevailing party for the purposes of fee recovery under.we disagree.the fact that the charitable trust stood to benefit from the estate obtaining a tax refund,as well as any award of fees,does not mean that it was a prevailing party that incurred fees as is required under.
if the terms of a statute are unambiguous,the plain meaning of the statute will govern.see reves ernst young,if the statutory language is unambiguous,in the absence of a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary,that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.citations omitted rubin united states,when we find the terms of a statute unambiguous,judicial inquiry is complete,except in rare and exceptional circumstances.citations omitted.
the definition section of sets forth the criteria for determining a prevailing party.first,an individual or entity must be a party in any proceeding covered by a.see a stating it applies to any administrative or court proceeding which is brought by or against the united states in connection with the determination,collection,or refund of any tax.second,the party must substantially prevail with respect to the amount in controversy or substantially prevail with respect to the most significant issue or set of issues presented.c a i i ii.finally,as previously mentioned,the definition of prevailing party excludes any party that fails to satisfy the net worth requirements of d b.c a ii.
in this case the estate was the party in the underlying proceeding.the executor of the estate was responsible for paying the appropriate amount of federal estate tax,see the tax imposed by this chapter shall be paid by the executor.the party with the legal right to seek a refund of taxes paid and the party that conducted the litigation.the settlement agreement between the charitable trust and palumbo son explicitly states that the residuary estate will be solely responsible for the payment of all inheritance and estate taxes payable as a result of the decedent death.app.ii at.further,the estate was the only party to the proceedings,and it was the only party that prevailed in connection with the proceedings.
in addition to satisfying the prevailing party requirements,a party seeking fees under must incur the litigation expenses attendant to that proceeding.section c b iii states only reasonable fees paid or incurred for the services of an attorney are reimbursable.in order to recover fees under a prevailing party must actually incur the costs.marre united states,cir litigant entitled only to the amount owed under the contingency fee agreement plus costs young,wl at unlike certain other statutes,section generally allows the recovery of attorney fees only to the extent such amounts have been paid or incurred.unlike the term prevailing party,incur is not defined by so we must assume the legislature intended the ordinary meaning of the word to apply.smith united states,when a word is not defined by statute,we normally construe it in accord with its ordinary or natural meaning.black law dictionary defines incur as to suffer or bring on oneself a liability or expense.black law dictionary at ed.
this definition is consistent with the tax court statement f or purposes of section,fees are incurred when there is a legal obligation to pay them.young,wl at.here,the estate suffered or brought on itself the fees it had the legal obligation to pay.the estate paid the attorneys fees and expenses and was the party in the underlying litigation represented by those attorneys.it is thus clear that the estate was the prevailing party who incurred the expenses related to the litigation.
the estate argument that we should look at the sole residuary beneficiary,the charitable trust,can not be reconciled with the plain language of the statute and the ordinary meaning of its terms,and therefore must be rejected.since the charitable trust was not a party to the underlying suit,it can not be a prevailing party nor can it incur expenses as contemplated by the statute the fact that it stands to benefit from the estate victory,and that it hired an attorney to help in the litigation,can not change the result that it does not qualify under.
by their nature,decedents estates deal with resources that will be passed along to other individuals or entities.see black law dictionary at ed defining a decedent estate as the real and personal property that a person possesses at the time of death and that passes to the heirs or testamentary beneficiaries.if an individual or entity is the residual beneficiary of an estate,that separate individual or entity will indirectly bear the estate fees.yet,requires courts to analyze an estate,not its beneficiary,net worth,and courts must make such a determination as of the date of the decedent death.the mere existence of an indirect consequence on the residual beneficiary does not alter the application of the plain meaning of the statute.
the conference report cited by the estate does not provide persuasive evidence that congress intended a different result.although the senate amendment,officially adopted by the conference report,stated a taxpayer may recover costs for a third party incurred by that party on behalf of the taxpayer,a number of hurdles were inserted into.taxpayers must clear those hurdles before recovering fees.to that end,we do not read the senate amendment in the conference report as negating,or casting aside,the different barriers to recovery placed in.the taxpayer,here the estate,must still qualify as a prevailing party under before it can recover any costs for third parties that those parties incurred on its behalf.
the application of the statutory language to this case is clear we are to look at the estate net worth since it was the taxpayer that pursued its substantive legal rights in the underlying action.see also hubberd,at examining estate net worth because the estate must pay taxes,the case was brought in name of estate by executor,and estate is generally responsible for bearing the costs of its own litigation.the relevant point in time for determining the value of the estate is its value at the time of palumbo death.it is undisputed that the estate net worth exceeded.as a result,the estate is not eligible to recover fees and costs under.
decisions focusing on the real party of interest 
the estate discussion of case law regarding the doctrine does not dissuade us from our conclusion.we now examine this case law and explain why we believe it does not dictate a different result.
one of the first decisions to apply the doctrine to the eaja was unification church.the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit held that courts should determine the real party in interest in the fee litigation and decide whether that party is eligible to recover fees.in the underlying litigation,the unification church agreed to pay the attorn
