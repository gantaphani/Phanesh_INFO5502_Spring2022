in the event of a default,the relief granted to the plaintiff may not exceed the dollar amount demanded in the complaint or,in cases of personal injury or wrongful death,the dollar amount set forth in a statement of damages.code civ.this rule applies not only to routine defaults,where the defendant fails to file an answer,but also to defaults entered as a sanction for misusing the discovery process.greenup rodman cal d,greenup.the question presented here is whether a plaintiff may recover attorney fees incurred in a case terminated in his or her favor as a discovery sanction where the complaint contains a request for an unspecified amount of attorney fees.put another way,does a complaint have to specify by dollar amount the attorney fees that will be incurred and sought in a case ultimately resolved by a default judgment entered as a discovery sanction 
we answer that question in the negative because the attorney fees awarded in this case do not constitute the type of relief that must be stated by amount in the complaint to be recovered in a default judgment entered as a terminating sanction.
background 
the facts on this appeal are taken from the declarations and exhibits filed in connection with defendants motion to vacate a default judgment containing an award of attorney fees and from our prior opinion in this case athans simke,chodos,silberfeld anteau,july,nonpub.opn.athans.
as we previously explained in,jerry athans,died.he was survived by his wife,eva athans and four adult children,jerry,george,olga,and catherine.eva was the executor of jerry estate.
in her capacity as executor,eva retained goldsmith burns goldsmith to file a civil action against jerry and george,alleging that they had improperly acquired various family properties and companies athans athans,no.the contingency fee agreement between eva,as executor,and goldsmith was not submitted to the probate court for approval.in,the case settled for roughly million.according to the settlement agreement,eva was to receive individually,and the balance of the assets was to go to jerry estate.
after the settlement,goldsmith demanded,pursuant to the parties contingency fee agreement,that eva pay approximately,plus shares of stock in one of the athans family companies.eva refused to pay.
on may,goldsmith filed a civil action for breach of the contingency fee agreement,naming as defendants eva,individually and as executor of the estate,and the four athans children goldsmith athans,no.goldsmith.the complaint contained purported causes of action.the athanses retained david chodos,esq,of simke,chodos,silberfeld anteau,collectively chodos,to defend them.chodos filed an answer to the complaint and filed a against goldsmith,alleging legal malpractice.the simke firm is now known as simke,chodos sasaki.
the case proceeded to trial by jury.on november,the jury returned a verdict against eva on the claim for breach of the contingency fee agreement and awarded goldsmith,plus stock in one of the athans companies.on eva for legal malpractice,the jury returned a defense verdict.none of the athans children were found liable.goldsmith was awarded attorneys fees,costs,and prejudgment interest.shortly after the verdict,eva filed for bankruptcy.
in october,jerry replaced chodos with boyd lemon.lemon moved for a new trial in goldsmith,arguing that goldsmith entitlement to attorneys fees should have been determined in probate court under the probate code,not in a civil action based on the contingency fee agreement.the trial court agreed and ordered that the case be retried in probate court.on appeal,division four of this district affirmed,explaining that r epresenting an estate in civil litigation is an extraordinary service for which an attorney must apply to the probate court for such amount of fees as the court may deem just and reasonable.see,former,now,subds.a,c goldsmith athans july,nonpub.opn.after remand,the superior court dismissed goldsmith complaint as improper and found the contingency fee agreement to be unenforceable.
on december,eva,jerry,and george filed this action against chodos in los angeles county superior court,alleging legal malpractice arising out of the goldsmith representation no.later,chodos filed a,seeking to recover unpaid attorneys fees and costs.the sought in unpaid attorneys fees and costs,plus interest related to the goldsmith case,and requested attorney fees incurred by chodos in defending against the athanses complaint and in pursuing the,as authorized by a prevailing party provision in the retainer agreement,but did not specify an amount of fees.the athanses filed an answer to the.on january,chodos filed a separate action in los angeles county superior court against the athans brothers,alleging that they owed the firm in attorneys fees and costs,plus interest,for work performed on the goldsmith matter no.the complaint also alleged that chodos was entitled to attorney fees and costs,plus interest,incurred in bringing the action,as authorized by a prevailing party provision in the retainer agreement,but did not state an amount of fees.the athans brothers filed an answer to the complaint.the two actions were consolidated in the trial court for all purposes,and chodos was represented by wasserman,comden casselman now known as wasserman,comden,casselman esensten in both suits.
on february,eva died.on april,the trial court,judge william huss presiding,dismissed eva from the athanses malpractice complaint because a proper representative had not appeared on her behalf.the special administrator of eva estate,frumeh labow,promptly moved for reconsideration of the dismissal.the trial court vacated the order of dismissal,upon the condition that counsel for plaintiffs stipulate that the discovery responses of plaintiffs george athans and jerry athans be deemed the discovery responses of plaintiff frumeh labow as special administrator of the estate of eva athans 
through a series of transactions,the athans brothers became the sole beneficiaries of eva estate.at some point,frumeh labow and jerry became of the estate.
on august,chodos served the athans brothers with discovery,specifically,one form interrogatory,one supplemental interrogatory,a set of special interrogatories eight in number,a set of requests for admissions in number,and a document demand containing five requests.another document demand containing requests was served on october.
together,the discovery requests went to the heart of the malpractice claim.for example,one of the requests for admissions stated chodos did not commit any act of legal malpractice in connection with the prosecution of the complaint for legal malpractice against goldsmith burns.the form interrogatory sought the facts,names of witnesses,and documents supporting the answer to each request for admission.the supplemental interrogatory stated,please review all of the answers previously made by you in response to interrogatories and identify all later acquired information bearing on all answers previously made.one of the document demands requested documents supporting the contention that chodos had committed malpractice.
the athans brothers did not respond to any of the discovery.as a result,chodos filed five motions four to compel answers to the interrogatories and document demands and one to deem the requests for admissions to be admitted.chodos also sought monetary sanctions.the notice of each motion to compel stated that chodos was seeking answers without objection.the athans brothers did not file an opposition to any of the motions.
on december,the trial court,judge fumiko wasserman presiding,heard argument on the motions and issued a minute order,stating that a ll motions are granted and all responses are to be compelled within ten days.judge wasserman also ordered the athans brothers to pay in sanctions within days.on the same day as the hearing,chodos served a notice of ruling,stating that the athans brothers had to answer the discovery requests without objection.
on or about december,the athans brothers served discovery responses.they objected to,and did not answer,the form interrogatory,contending that form interrogatories were not permitted in this type of action.see code civ,former,subd.a now.they objected to,and did not answer,the supplemental interrogatory,arguing that it was impermissible.as for the special interrogatories,the athans brothers provided some answers but prefaced most of them with boilerplate objections based on the privilege,invasion of privacy,and relevancy.on the document demands,the athans brothers objected to two requests based on the privilege.they did not produce any of the requested documents on the date set for production or at any time thereafter.
on january,the athans brothers filed a motion for reconsideration of judge wasserman ruling on the discovery motions.they argued that all of the motions should have been denied because their attorney had been ill,which prevented him from making timely responses,the requests for admissions should not have been deemed admitted because responses were served the day before the hearing see code civ,former,subd.k now,some of the requests in the document demand sought documents that were irrelevant or protected by the privilege,and the form interrogatory was not permitted in this type of litigation.chodos filed opposition to the motion.
by order dated march,judge wasserman granted the motion for reconsideration with respect to the requests for admissions and set aside that portion of her order deeming them to be admitted.she denied the motion in all other respects.notwithstanding the ruling,the athans brothers did not serve supplemental discovery responses to comply with the partial denial of their motion,they did not produce the allegedly privileged documents,nor did they answer the form interrogatory.
on march,chodos filed a motion for terminating issue,evidence monetary sanctions based upon the athans brothers failure to comply with judge wasserman orders.the brothers filed opposition,arguing the motion was frivolous,and chodos had obstructed discovery all along.the motion was heard on april.the trial court,judge ralph dau presiding,issued a tentative ruling to grant the motion.the athans brothers requested additional time to file a supplemental memorandum.judge dau allowed them one additional day until april to file papers addressing whether a motion to compel further responses was a prerequisite to the imposition of the requested sanctions.chodos was ordered to file a response on april.
things did not go as planned.on april,the athans brothers filed a statement of disqualification,seeking to remove judge dau from the case.the proceedings were stayed.the chairman of the judicial council assigned judge harold bradford,a judge of the superior court of alpine county,to rule on the matter.
on june,judge bradford issued a order,finding that judge dau was not disqualified.in the order,judge bradford stated p laintiffs actions to attempt to disqualify judge dau appear to be nothing more than an attempt to get rid of the judge who had tentatively ruled against them such abuse of the judicial process and the judiciary can not be tolerated.the procedures for disqualifying clearly biased or prejudiced judicial officers are not intended to be used frivolously to attempt to avoid an adverse decision by a qualified,unbiased jurist.
on july,judge dau issued a page order imposing terminating sanctions on jerry and george the order directed that their malpractice complaint be stricken.judge dau also ordered that the athans brothers answers be stricken and that their defaults be entered on chodos to recover attorneys fees and costs case no.and on chodos complaint in the separate action to collect attorneys fees and costs case no.athans,supra.
on november,the athans brothers filed what they captioned a brief re hearing,arguing that chodos was entitled to nothing.on or about december,chodos filed a hearing brief,asserting it was entitled to in unpaid attorney fees and costs,plus interest,related to the goldsmith representation as well as attorney fees in the amount of,which was owed to wasserman,comden casselman for providing a defense to the athanses legal malpractice complaint and for pursuing the unpaid fees and costs sought in chodos and its complaint in the separate suit.
on december,judge robert letteau held a hearing against the athans brothers based on the terminating sanctions and the resulting defaults.on the same day,judge letteau entered a default judgment against the brothers in the amount of.athans,supra.the judgment consisted of in attorney fees and costs owed to chodos for its work in the goldsmith representation in accrued interest through may,in prejudgment interest from may,to december,and in attorney fees that chodos found to be the prevailing party owed wasserman,comden casselman for representing chodos in all of the litigation.the case continued with respect to eva estate,which is not a party to this appeal.
the athans brothers appealed,raising several challenges to the judgment but did not include the argument presently before us.in an unpublished opinion filed on july,we affirmed athans,supra.
around ten years later,in october,chodos renewed the judgment and served notice thereof on the athans brothers.on november,the athans brothers filed a motion to vacate the renewed judgment on the ground that chodos and its complaint in the separate action had not requested a specific amount of attorney fees.see code civ,governing motions to vacate renewed judgments undesignated statutory references are to that code.
on january,the motion came on for hearing.the trial court,judge gerald rosenberg presiding,announced a tentative ruling to deny the motion,stating on the record that the athans brothers contention would require a plaintiff to specify an amount of attorney fees in the complaint n ot knowing how many hoops you would have to jump through in order to get to the end of the case i t would be very difficult to plead and we want to be awarded in attorney fees without knowing what you in for in terms of the course and scope of litigation.h ow could you possibly predict how much the attorney fees would be t he case could go by default with not a single motion,without hearing a word from the other side,and incur a very small amount of attorney fees.after argument by both sides,the trial court adopted its oral tentative as its final ruling and issued an order denying the motion to vacate.the athans brothers appealed.
discussion 
in construing a statute,we follow t he fundamental rule that the court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law in determining that intent,we first examine the words of the statute itself under the plain meaning rule,courts seek to give the words employed by the legislature their usual and ordinary meaning if the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for construction however,the plain meaning rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose if the terms of the statute provide no definitive answer,then courts may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.the legislative purpose will not be sacrificed to a literal construction of any part of the statute paleski state of health services th.
the athans brothers argue that,under california statutes and the due process clause,cal,art.i,attorney fees can not be awarded in a default judgment entered as a discovery sanction unless the complaint requested a specific amount of fees.we conclude otherwise because california statutes require only that the amount of relief be stated in the complaint,and relief,as interpreted by the courts,does not include the attorney fees awarded in this case.further,the due process clause does not require that a plaintiff include in the complaint an unknowable amount of future attorney fees imposed in connection with a terminating sanction.
by statute,a complaint or shall contain both of the following a statement of the facts constituting the cause of action,in ordinary and concise language.a demand for judgment for the relief to which the pleader claims to be entitled.if the recovery of money or damages is demanded,the amount demanded shall be stated.notwithstanding the foregoing,where an action is brought to recover actual or punitive damages for personal injury or wrongful death,the amount demanded shall not be stated,italics added.in addition,n o claim for exemplary damages shall state an amount or amounts,subd.e regardless of the type of lawsuit.
section provides when a complaint is filed in an action to recover damages for personal injury or wrongful death,the defendant may at any time request a statement setting forth the nature and amount of damages being sought.the request shall be served upon the plaintiff,who shall serve a responsive statement as to the damages within days.in the event that a response is not served,the defendant,on notice to the plaintiff,may petition the court in which the action is pending to order the plaintiff to serve a responsive statement.if no request is made for the statement of damages,the plaintiff shall serve the statement on the defendant before a default may be taken,subds.b,c,italics added.
section states the plaintiff preserves the right to seek punitive damages on a default judgment by serving upon the defendant the following statement,or its substantial equivalent notice to insert name of defendant or insert name of plaintiff or reserves the right to seek insert dollar amount in punitive damages when insert name of plaintiff or seeks a judgment in the suit filed against you.

the statute of critical importance here,section,states the relief granted to the plaintiff,if there is no answer,can not exceed that demanded in the complaint,in the statement of damages required by section,or in the statement of punitive damages provided for by section,italics added.this rule applies to defaults entered as a terminating sanction for misuse of the discovery process the situation here as well as to routine defaults,where a defendant fails to file an answer.greenup,supra,cal d at.a default judgment that violates section is void it can be challenged and set aside at any time.heidary yadollahi th,janssen luu th,fn.david karton,a law dougherty th.
there is no universal definition or plain meaning of relief.see,black law dict.ed,defining relief as t he redress or benefit,esp.equitable in nature such as an injunction or specific performance,that a party asks of a court id.at,defining prayer for relief as a request addressed to the court and appearing at the end of a pleading,a request for specific relief or damages webster new internat.dict.ed,defining relief as a legal remedy or redress,subd.b requiring trial court to determine which party recovered a greater relief on contract claim as prerequisite to awarding attorney fees.in interpreting code of civil procedure section,we must therefore examine its legislative purpose and avoid an interpretation that would result in absurd consequences.see paleski state of health services,supra,th at.
initially,we look to other related statutes and rules.in personal injury and wrongful death actions,a statement of damages,not the complaint,is used to demand relief.see code civ.for that purpose,a plaintiff must use a judicial council form,specifically,form civ.see cal.rules of court,rule a c,pt.west,court rules ed.appen.a,the form may be found online at as of may.the statement of damages lists three categories of relief general damages,consisting of four subcategories for example,pain and suffering,emotional distress,and loss of consortium plus other special damages,consisting of eight subcategories for example,medical expenses,loss of earnings,and property damage plus other and punitive damages.
the statement of damages does not mention attorney fees even though fees are recoverable by statute in several types of personal injury and wrongful death actions.see code civ,attorney fees awardable only where authorized by statute or parties agreement see,welf,subd.a attorney fees shall be awarded to plaintiff in elder abuse case if clear and convincing evidence proves that defendant is liable for physical abuse,neglect,or fiduciary abuse,and defendant acted with recklessness,oppression,fraud,or malice in committing wrongful conduct delaney baker cal th,discussing availability of attorney fees in elder abuse cases where liability is based on professional negligence code civ,court may award attorney fees to plaintiff in action seeking to recover for injuries sustained as result of defendant commission of felony where conviction obtained sommers erb th,plaintiff injured by defendant commission of felony may recover attorney fees notwithstanding that plaintiff also committed criminal act,where employer fails to comply with coverage provisions of workers compensation act,employee who prevails against employer in suit to recover for injuries is entitled to award of attorney fees.thus,if a statement of damages,as mandated by sections and of the code of civil procedure,and as referenced in section of the same code,does not require a plaintiff to state an amount of attorney fees to recover them in a default judgment,then neither should a complaint in cases not for personal injury or wrongful death.
further,if the plaintiff seeks a default judgment where an answer is not timely filed,he or she must first submit a request for entry of default,a judicial council form,specifically,form civ.the use of that form is mandatory.see cal.rules of court,rule a c,pt.west,court rules ed.appen.a,the form may be found online at as of may.section of the form,entitled judgment to be entered,lists five categories,with corresponding blank lines,from which the judgment will be calculated,namely demand of complaint statement of damages,with a citation to code of civil procedure section,which governs cases for personal injury and wrongful death interest costs and attorney fees.italics added.because code of civil procedure section prevents a default judgment from exceeding the amount demanded in the complaint or,in personal injury or wrongful death cases,the amount set forth in the statement of damages,the judicial council request for entry of default form recognizes that attorney fees do not constitute relief for purposes of the statute.the form distinguishes between the relief permitted by section demand of complaint or statement of damages on the one hand,and items not governed by section interest,costs,and attorney fees on the other hand,indicating that relief,as used in section,means damages.generally,damages do not include attorney fees incurred and sought in the present litigation,although fees incurred in a prior action and sought by a client in a subsequent legal malpractice case are considered damages and must be stated by amount in the complaint.see huckell matranga d,attorney fees are not ordinarily damages lynch warwick th,fn.attorney fees incurred in prior representation and sought in subsequent legal malpractice case are damages akin,gump,strauss,hauer feld ndr,same john kohl.dearborn ewing,same sorenson fio rito d,malpractice permitted client to recover as damages the attorney fees paid to second attorney to correct defendant mistake.
similarly,in a suit by an attorney against a client to recover unpaid attorney fees involving a prior representation,the fees would constitute damages and would have to be stated in the complaint.here,chodos included the amount of unpaid attorney fees related to the goldsmith litigation in the and its complaint in the separate action.
section,which governs the procedure for obtaining a default judgment,provides judgment may be had,if the defendant fails to answer the complaint,as follows a in an action arising upon contract or judgment for the recovery of money or damages only,if the defendan
