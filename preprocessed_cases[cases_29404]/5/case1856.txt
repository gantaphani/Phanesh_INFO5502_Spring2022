introduction 
daniel villanueva was employed by the city of colton the city as a lead operator in its wastewater division.after being demoted to operator ii,he sued the city under the fair employment and housing act feha et,alleging discriminatory and retaliatory employment practices.the city filed a motion for summary judgment,which was granted,as was its motion for attorney fees.on appeal,villanueva maintains that he produced substantial direct and circumstantial evidence sufficient to withstand summary judgment.further,he contends that in awarding nearly in attorney fees,the court failed to take into account his inability to pay such a sizable sum.we disagree with both contentions and affirm.
factual and procedural background 
between and,villanueva was employed by the city,first in its sanitation division,and later in its street maintenance division.in june,when the city outsourced its refuse operation to a private contractor,villanueva was laid off.the following month he was rehired by the city on a probationary basis as an in its wastewater division.prior to his rehire,he purportedly negotiated an agreement with a manager in human resources whereby he was assured that his break in service would not affect his seniority and benefits.thereafter,he worked his way up the ladder and in was promoted to lead operator.
in september,villanueva was at work at the wastewater plant when he heard an alarm relating to the return pump station.as lead operator,he reviewed the computer readouts and the pumps control panel.after attempting without success to silence the distress signal,he concluded it was a false alarm.without notifying the plant manager,he left the treatment plant in an alarm condition overnight.as a result,the city was required to report a violation of its national pollutant discharge elimination system permit to the california regional water quality control board.as it turned out,had he conducted a proper investigation,he would have immediately known that it was not a false alarm.for his role in the incident,villanueva was suspended,without pay,for a period of five working days.
in,faced with an anticipated budget shortfall,the city implemented a reduction in force,which resulted in the elimination of approximately positions.as part of the plan,the director of the wastewater division selected several positions to be eliminated,including one of two lead operator positions.pursuant to a memorandum of understanding mou with the employees bargaining group,it was determined that the lead operator with less upon continuous service in a position would be laid off,subject to any bumping rights he might have.the director of human resources determined that martin guerrero,who in had been hired into what is now the wastewater division,was the lead operator having more seniority.noting that villanueva had a break in service in when he was laid off from one department and rehired into a different department as a new probationary employee,the director rejected villanueva position that his private understanding with a prior director of human resources ensured that his rehire would not affect his seniority.in any event,the director found that even if such an agreement had been made,it was unenforceable and would be trumped by the mou thereafter,villanueva exercised his bumping rights and moved into a position as operator ii,paying less per hour.
on april,villanueva filed his complaint against the city.as a first cause of action,he alleged that the city had engaged in discriminatory conduct in failing to promote him,and in falsely and unjustifiably reprimanding,demoting,suspending and evaluating him,after which he voiced objections to a manager of the city.he further alleged that in taking this action,he was engaging in protected activity,and that the city,in engaging in the aforementioned conduct,violated section in that it discriminated against him on the basis of his race,national origin,ethnicity or skin color.as a second cause of action,he alleged that on several occasions he had informed the city that he believed he was the victim of discrimination,and that as a result of that action the city had retaliated against him by demoting,suspending,and unjustly reprimanding him.
in august,the city filed an answer to the complaint,offering a general denial as to all allegations and affirmative defenses.a year later,the city filed its motion for summary judgment.the essence of the city position was that,in light of the negligent manner in which villanueva handled the alarm incident,and the elimination of villanueva position due to the city anticipated budget shortfall and resulting reduction in force,it had legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions in suspending villaneuva and for removing a lead operator position,and villanueva lacked evidence of pretext necessary to survive summary judgment.
in opposing summary judgment,villanueva submitted declarations purporting to demonstrate both direct and indirect evidence of racial bias and retaliatory intent.in addition to his own declaration,he offered a declaration of his former manager,lawrence perales,who had also sued the city alleging discriminatory employment practices the perales case.further,he offered deposition testimony from his division manager,william roth,and his department director,eric fraser,as well as his deposition testimony and that of three former city employees given in the perales case.
the city filed objections to numerous paragraphs in the two proffered declarations on various grounds,including hearsay,lack of foundation,and relevancy.the city also objected to the deposition transcripts submitted on behalf of villanueva,asserting that they were neither the original nor certified copies,but rather,were generated from some sort of computer program.further,the city objected to the deposition transcripts in the perales case,contending they were impermissible pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b.moreover,the city argued there was no evidence of racial discrimination,noting that villanueva conceded at his deposition that he had never heard roth make any derogatory remarks about hispanics,and it also presented evidence that grievances lodged by villanueva in and said nothing about race discrimination or harassment based on race.
after sustaining all but one of the city objections,the court granted the motion.it found that the city offered legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons for both villanueva suspension and the elimination of his position,and that villanueva failed to present any substantial evidence that the city reasons were pretextual.said the court villanueva makes unsupported charges of race discrimination against a number of people.however,the proffered information offered in support of that is significantly hearsay and the court has dealt with that by way of ruling on the objections.the following month,the court granted the city motion for attorney fees,finding no evidence of racial animus or other impermissible employment activity,and ordered villanueva to pay to the city the sum of.
discussion 
summary judgment was proper.
on appeal from a summary judgment,we review the record de novo,considering all the evidence set forth in the moving and opposition papers except that to which objections have been made and sustained.citation.under california traditional rules,we determine with respect to each cause of action whether the defendant seeking summary judgment has conclusively negated a necessary element of the plaintiff case,or has demonstrated that under no hypothesis is there a material issue of fact that requires the process of trial,such that the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citations.guz bechtel national,cal th,d,guz,italics added.
where,as here,the plaintiff alleges employment discrimination and bases his claim on circumstantial evidence,we apply what has come to be known as the mcdonnell test to determine whether the evidence supports an inference of discrimination or whether the employer,as the moving party,is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.guz,supra,cal th at,d.an employer moving for summary judgment may do so by setting forth competent,admissible evidence to show legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons for its action.id.at,d.it is then the employee burden to rebut the employer showing by pointing to evidence which raises an inference that intentional discrimination did occur.a plaintiff showing of pretext,combined with sufficient prima facie evidence of an act motivated by discrimination,may permit a finding of discriminatory intent,and may thus preclude judgment as a matter of law for the employer.citation.id.at,d,italics omitted.
thus,to warrant summary judgment,the city was required to provide competent,admissible evidence that it had legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions in suspending villanueva after the alarm incident and,as a result of its anticipated multimillion dollar budget shortfall,in eliminating villanueva position as lead operator as part of its reduction in force.this it did.the evidence is uncontroverted that villanueva was negligent in addressing the issues presented by the alarm incident,thereby justifying his brief suspension.moreover,the law is settled that an employer depressed economic condition can be good cause for discharging an employee.martin lockheed th,d.accordingly,the city having done its part,it was villanueva burden to rebut the city showing by demonstrating that the reasons for the city actions were pretextual.
pretext may be demonstrated by showing that the proffered reason had no basis in fact,the proffered reason did not actually motivate the discharge,or,the proffered reason was insufficient to motivate the discharge.citation.citation.hanson lucky stores,th,d,fn.omitted.an employee in this situation can not simply show the employer decision was wrong,mistaken,or unwise.rather,the employee must demonstrate such weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence,citation,and hence infer that the employer did not act for the asserted reasons.citations.citations.citation.citation.morgan regents of university of california th,d.
in an effort to show that the city reasons were pretextual,villanueva relies exclusively upon evidence excluded by the trial court.that is,pointing to statements contained in the various declarations and depositions submitted in opposition to the city motion,that fraser blamed mexicans for throwing grease down the drains causing the city sewer lines to become clogged,and refused to acknowledge hispanic employees,and that roth often used racial epithets in describing hispanics,villanueva maintains that he presented the court with both direct and indirect evidence of racial bias,and substantial evidence of retaliation.he does not dispute that the events surrounding the alarm incident played out the way the city contends.rather,his sole contention is that there was no established protocol for responding to alarms and that his former manager,perales,believed that his suspension was a joke.nor does he contest the fact a reduction in force was implemented by the city.rather,he argues the city position that the demotion was driven by dire economic conditions is belied by his proof that he had an agreement with the city of colton that his seniority and his benefits would not in any way be lessened due to his break in service.
we need not belabor villanueva efforts to establish that the city reasons were pretextual.suffice it to say,our task in undertaking a de novo review in this case has been simplified in that virtually every piece of evidence submitted by villanueva in opposing summary judgment was excluded in response to the city objections.stripped of the excluded evidence,there is absolutely nothing to support his theory.moreover,evidence was presented that the city would not have entered into such an agreement,as it would have potentially impacted a large number of other employees,including guerrero,the other lead operator whose job was unaffected by the reduction in force.additionally,because guerrero is also hispanic,there is simply no reason to believe that the decision to bump villanueva rather than guerrero was based on race.
more importantly,villanueva does not now challenge the propriety of those evidentiary rulings.as the city puts it,the trial court rulings effectively gutted villanueva arguments of any evidentiary support.indeed,w here a plaintiff does not challenge the superior court ruling sustaining a moving defendant objections to evidence offered in opposition to the summary judgment motion,any issues concerning the correctness of the trial court evidentiary rulings have been waived.citations.we therefore consider all such evidence to have been properly excluded.citation.citation.alexander codemasters group limited th,d,fn.omitted.
the only evidentiary ruling which villanueva does challenge is the one pertaining to his declaration in which he alleged that he personally heard roth refer to african americans as fucking niggers,hispanics as fucking mexicans or fucking hispanics and women as fucking cunts.the city objected to that portion of the declaration on the ground it was inconsistent with villanueva deposition testimony wherein he said he had never heard roth make derogatory comments of this nature.in his opening brief,villanueva contests that ruling,contending that the remarks were not hearsay because they were not offered for the truth.however,he ignores the basis of the court ruling.as the city explains,the trial court saw that for what it was,and properly excluded it,based on case law that a plaintiff can not create a triable issue of fact and thereby escape summary judgment by contradicting his own prior testimony.quoting from guthrey state of california th,d guthrey,the city reminds us that a dmissions or concessions made during the course of discovery govern and control over contrary declarations lodged at a hearing on a motion for summary judgment.
the city cites roe mcdonald corporation th,d as being particularly noteworthy,as it highlights precisely what is wrong with villanueva opening brief.in that case,the plaintiff appealed a summary judgment,but failed to affirmatively challenge the trial court evidentiary ruling,and demonstrate the court error.id.at,d.moreover,in an effort to demonstrate triable issues of fact,she continued to rely on the stricken evidence in her opening brief,as if the appellate court were required to give that evidence a de novo review.id.at,d.citing johnson v,city of loma linda cal th,d,the reviewing court pointed we have indicated in conducting a de novo review,the appellate court may consider all of the evidence presented in the moving and opposing papers except that to which objections were made and sustained.moreover,where the plaintiff does not challenge the ruling sustaining the evidentiary objections,any issue with regard to the correctness of that ruling is deemed waived.roe,at,d.the court explained the reason for this rule is that t rial courts have a duty to rule on evidentiary objections.citation.r uling on such evidentiary objections can involve a number of considerations more suited to the trial court than the appellate courts,including an exercise of discretion in establishing the record to be reviewed de novo.citation.ibid.
in his reply brief,villanueva acknowledges the position taken by the city,but argues nonetheless,it is well established that the trial court is not in the business of making credibility determinations,several key pieces of evidence ignored by the trial court were either classic discriminatory comments,and were thus not hearsay,or were admissions under the law as coming from the mouth of colton managers.he then essentially rehashes his position as asserted in his opening brief,while attempting to explain away his failure to challenge the trial court evidentiary rulings.he asserts while the city below and the trial judge chose to pass these things off as irrelevancies this evidence might have convinced a trier of fact that the reasons for his discipline was not legitimate business,but discrimination or retaliation.the evidence of racial bias should not have been dismissed,or stricken,or ignored.these statements are not hearsay,since they were certainly not offered for the truth of the matters asserted in the statements.nevertheless the trial court excluded the evidence.now,the city argues he had no such evidence.he insists that he made strong objection to these particular key rulings in the opening brief by pointing out that the key evidence was either direct evidence of bias,or that it came from the city own manager,perales this is enough to object to the rulings for the purposes of this appeal on the specific areas discussed in the opening brief.it is not.simply put,villanueva has done nothing to challenge the trial court various rulings excluding his proffered evidence.
also in his reply brief,villanueva cites and then attempts to distinguish the decision in carnes superior court th,d in carnes,the trial judge granted summary judgment without any specification of the reasons for doing so,then directing counsel for the prevailing party to prepare an order includ ing and sic all findings necessary to support th e order,without telling the prevailing party what any of those findings should be.the impropriety of the judge action in this case is highlighted by the fact that the judge granted the motion for summary judgment without having made any rulings on the parties evidentiary objections,even though the parties requested such rulings at the hearing.id.at,d.the court continued certainly it is not improper for a judge to adopt as his or her own the reasoning a defendant proposes for granting a motion for summary judgment,provided that reasoning is sound and the judge critically evaluates the reasoning before adopting it.where,as here,however,a judge simply grants the motion,then asks the prevailing party to provide the court with the reasoning that will support that result,confidence in the court integrity is seriously and legitimately undermined.id.at,d.
relying on language from carnes,villanueva contends the trial court simply adopted the city suggested wholesale exclusion of entire paragraphs of evidence at once.to the contrary,the trial court the court in ruled on the city as well as villanueva objections.moreover,villanueva does either his opening or reply argument as to why the trial court evidentiary rulings were improper.rather,he contends only that,unlike carnes,he does object to specific evidentiary rulings as stated in the opening brief.the trial court simply ignored substantial evidence of bias,and differential mistreatment,and retaliatory intent which had a profoundly prejudicial effect on the outcome of the case.villanueva argument misses the mark.in short,he has utterly failed to present proper argument and citations to authority as to why the trial court evidentiary rulings were wrong.accordingly,in reviewing the propriety of summary judgment,we consider none of the evidence offered by him in the trial court.
in any event,and notwithstanding the foregoing,villanueva claim of retaliation fails because there is no evidence that he ever engaged in a protected activity related to an employment practice proscribed by the feha.in order to make a prima facie showing of retaliation,the plaintiff must show that he engaged in a protected activity,that the employer subjected him to an adverse employment action,and that a causal link exists between the protected activity and the employer action.akers county of san diego th,d.in his complaint,villanueva alleged he had informed the city of his belief that he was the victim of racial discrimination and that the city retaliated against him by demoting him.however,the record is devoid of evidence that he ever complained to anyone about alleged racial discrimination or did anything to imply that racial discrimination was an issue.standing alone,an employee unarticulated belief that an employer is engaging in discrimination will not suffice to establish protected conduct for the purposes of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation,where there is no evidence the employer knew that the employee opposition was based upon a reasonable belief that the employer was engaging in discrimination.yanowitz usa,cal th,d.
villanueva contends his failure to use the phrase racial discrimination in his grievances does not preclude him from concluding it was race discrimination as a basis for filing his lawsuit.his position is unfounded.two formal grievances were lodged in and through his association representative,neither of which alleged racial discrimination or harassment based on race.when asked at his deposition if his grievance which challenged the manner in which overtime was being allocated was based on race,he replied at the time i do know.now possibly.
nonetheless,insisting that the fact he failed to mention race discrimination in either of his grievances is not controlling,he cites gifford atchison,topeka santa fe railway cir.there,the trial court concluded that the plaintiff initial failure to label an offensive employment practice as indicated that her opposition to it was actually based on other grounds.id.at.finding that the trial court analyzed the opposition issue incorrectly,ibid.the court of appeal stated it requires a certain sophistication for an employee to recognize that an offensive employment practice may represent sex or race discrimination that is against the law.here,plaintiff argued from the outset that the collective bargaining agreement had a harsher impact on some of the women than it had on men a n employee who complains of a practice that has a disproportionate impact on a protected group complains of unlawful discrimination id.at.villanueva reliance in this case is inapt,as his failure to use the term race discrimination is irrelevant.rather,what is controlling is the fact that the substance of his grievances was not conduct which had anything at all to do with discrimination of this nature.
b.the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees to the city,nor are we able to discern,on this record,any error in determining the amount of the award.
section,subdivision b,authorizes an award of reasonable attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party in an action brought under the feha.a trial court award of attorney fees and costs under this section is subject to an abuse of discretion standard.citations.cummings benco building services th,d cummings.
in requesting attorney fees,the city asked the court to find that villanueva lawsuit was not brought and maintained with objective reasonable cause,and that it was unreasonable,frivolous,meritless,groundless and vexatious.in opposing the request,and insisting that his lawsuit was brought in good faith,villanueva argued that the city failed to demonstrate that he is financially able to withstand a fee award typically,no one would expect a wage earner at a public employer to be able to withstand such an award.however,villanueva offered neither a declaration nor evidence of any kind to support his position.
in reply to villanueva inability to pay argument,the city said,i t simply is so.citing various personnel records,the city argued that villanueva earns considerably more than the average american and that repaying the city attorney fees will hardly subject him to financial ruin.further,the city indicated that,if the court had any concern with the amount of the award,it would gladly accept whatever amount the court deemed appropriate.
in granting the request,the court found that the action was in fact unreasonable,frivolous and meritless while villanueva submitted his own and other declarations in opposition to the motion,those declarations,and the exhibits appended thereto,once stripped of argument,conjecture and other inadmissible content left a dearth of information upon which a reasonable person could possibly advance a colorable claim for employment discrimination.villanueva deposition testimony speaks volumes in this regard.while it appears that villanueva is apparently a disgruntled employee,this court finds there is no evidence,substantial or otherwise to support the claims advanced.villanueva botched the september alarm
