is the autistic child of two loving parents,samuel and mariette collectively parents,who have spared no expense to obtain private treatment for their developmentally disabled son.the local capistrano unified school district district balked at the idea of continuing the educational plan at public expense and offered an alternative plan.the matter ended up before an administrative law judge in california who conducted a evidentiary hearing to resolve the dispute,ultimately ruling in favor of the district.
we must decide whether the district court clearly erred by reversing the state administrative agency finding that a procedural violation of the individuals with disabilities education act idea,amounted to harmless error.the answer depends on whether the district significantly restricted parents right to participate in their disabled child individual educational program iep by limiting parents classroom observational opportunities to twenty minutes,when the district observed the child in his private education program for up to three hours.the district court had jurisdiction under and i.we have appellate jurisdiction under.
in reversing the administrative agency,the district court failed to properly consider whether parents right to participate was significantly affected.in other words,the district court failed to consider whether the district policy of limiting parents classroom observational opportunities to twenty minutes was harmless because parents nevertheless had a full opportunity to participate in the process to fashion an appropriate educational plan for with help from an informed and knowledgeable expert.there is no evidence to support a finding that parents right to participate was significantly affected.we therefore reverse the district court order requiring the district to reimburse parents for the cost of services and vacate its subsequent award of attorneys fees to parents as the prevailing party.we also affirm the district court denial of a stay put order requiring the district to reimburse parents for continuing education expenses beyond that covered in its original order.
in july,a pediatric neurologist diagnosed,then two and years old,with autism.began receiving early intervention services from the regional center of orange county in late august.through the early intervention services,received therapy,occupational therapy,and started a behavioral program.autism comprehensive educational services aces,a agency,administered private behavioral program.in december,parents began paying aces for a few additional hours of services per week,eventually increasing his services to hours per week.
in november,parents met with the district school psychologist luisa martinez to begin discussing transition to the district on his third birthday.in december and january,the district conducted several observations of during his education services.on january,iep team met to discuss assessment results and initial placement in the district the district offered to place in the palisades elementary school,provide individual intensive behavior instruction for four hours per week,therapy for two sessions per week,occupational therapy for thirty minutes per week,and extended school year services.parents attended the meeting,asked questions,but did not indicate whether they approved of the district proposed program.
turned on january,but did not begin attending school in the district.parents continued to fund the services provided from aces.after the initial iep meeting,parents twice visited the proposed school,once with the principal and once with melanie lenington,a licensed psychologist.lenington asked to observe the proposed program for a continuous period,but was limited to increments because of a policy lenington never returned to conduct further observations after her initial visit.
in february and march,district psychologist martinez attempted to contact parents to discuss the iep offer.the parents did not respond,and in march,they filed a request for a due process hearing pursuant to f,alleging that the proposed iep offer denied a free appropriate public education fape in response to the due process request,on april,the district sent a letter to parents offering additional services including more tutoring in the home and a formal transition plan.
in june,the iep team met for a second iep meeting.during this meeting father,samuel,asked several pointed questions regarding the research supporting the district program.after some discussion,district staff objected to samuel questions because they felt interrogated.when district staff attempted to change the subject to topics specific to,samuel objected,and stated that the last two minutes of the meeting should be used to talk about the district topics.in september,parents enrolled in the center for autism and related disorders program.
the california due process hearing took place in february.the hearing lasted four full days and twelve witnesses were called.during the hearing and in her subsequent opinion,administrative law judge alj suzanne brown addressed four separate issues whether the district offered a fape in the least restrictive environment from january,through april,whether the district offered a fape in the least restrictive environment from april,through june,whether the district offered a fape in the least restrictive environment from june,to february and whether is entitled to reimbursement for privately funded services and prospective placement with his service providers.
the alj concluded that the district failed to offer a fape from january,to april,because the district had not clearly offered thirty minutes of weekly individual therapy and because the district proposed iep lacked a transition plan that was designed to address unique needs although the district offered parents an iep with a transition plan on april,the new iep still neglected to provide with the necessary thirty minutes of weekly individual therapy.
therefore,the alj concluded that the district also failed to offer a fape in the least restrictive environment from april,to june.as a result of these procedural violations,the alj ordered the district to reimburse parents for the cost of providing the program from january,to april.the alj also ordered the district to reimburse parents for the cost of providing one hour of therapy per week from january,to july,and from the start of the school year until the date of the alj decision filed march.
the alj also determined that the district violated california education code section c when it limited lenington classroom observation time to increments,but the alj nevertheless concluded that the procedural flaw in the development of the iep was harmless and did not amount to the denial of a fape.the alj determined that parents still had the opportunity to participate in the due process hearing with an expert witness prepared to provide a knowledgeable opinion about the proposed placement.the alj noted that lenington admitted during her testimony that she was still able to develop opinions about the palisade program,advise the parents regarding palisade,and give informed testimony at the hearing regarding the palisade program.moreover,given dores the district expert extensive knowledge about the palisade program,the alj believed that an additional minutes of lenington observations likely would not have significantly affected the weight given to her testimony regarding the appropriateness of the palisade program.
ultimately,the alj did not find a procedural or substantive violation of the idea that would allow parents to receive reimbursement of the costs of care after april.the alj also declined to find that is entitled to prospective placement with his current providers since she determined that the district proposed iep amounted to a substantively viable fape.
parents challenged the alj decision to the united states district court for the central district of california.primarily at issue in this appeal is whether the district court clearly erred in reversing the alj finding of harmlessness with regards to the district technical violation of section c.the district court concluded that the limitation amounted to more than a mere technical violation since it constitute d a procedural violation of the idea by depriving parents of the right to meaningfully participate in the iep process.by limiting lenington ability to observe the palisades program,the district frustrated the purpose of cal.by denying parents the opportunity to gather evidence regarding the appropriateness of placing at palisades.the district court ordered the district to reimburse parents for the cost of all services received between january,until the date the district properly prepared an iep.the district court remanded the case to the alj for a determination on the reimbursement amount.the district timely appealed

california education code section c provides that i f a public education agency observed the pupil in conducting its assessment an equivalent opportunity shall apply to an independent educational assessment for the parents with regards to observation of the proposed educational placement and setting.the purpose of section c is to level the playing field between the parents and a more knowledgeable school district.benjamin special educ.hearing office,th,d.idea acknowledges the fact that school districts have better access to information and more educational expertise than parents and thus provides for a due process hearing to level the playing field by permitting the parents to present all the evidence they can muster to challenge the district decision.id.to that end,idea gives the child and his parents the right to be advised by experts,to have those experts testify at their due process hearing,and to have someone other than a district employee as a hearing officer.id.
the alj concluded that the district time limitation,while a violation of california education code section c,did not so undermine the statute purpose as to deprive parents of their right to participate in the due process hearing with an independent,knowledgeable expert.indeed,as lenington testified,even with the time limitation,she was still able to develop opinions,advise parents,and give informed testimony at the hearing.having heard all of the live testimony,and having concluded that the district had extensive knowledge about the palisade more credible,the alj concluded that an additional seventy minutes of observation likely would not have significantly affected the weight she gave to lenington testimony.
despite concluding that the alj careful and thorough opinion deserved substantial deference,the district court rejected the alj assessment and held that the district procedural violation deprived parents of their right to meaningfully participate in the iep process.relying on benjamin,the district court held that the district not only technically violated section,it also frustrated the purpose of that section by denying parents the opportunity to gather evidence regarding the appropriateness of placing at palisades.according to the district court,this arose to more than a mere technical violation because some of the most important procedural safeguards are those that protect a parent right to participate.the district court also noted that the alj concluded lenington was not particularly familiar with palisades or other components of the district program,and thus her testimony regarding the district program carried less weight than that of the district expert,dores,who helped to design the program and continues to supervise it.although the district court did not disagree with the alj assessment of the knowledge and credibility of the witnesses,it disagreed with the alj conclusion that the procedural violation did not deprive parents of their right to meaningfully participate in the iep process.
the district court misconstrued the alj findings,and in doing so,it failed to properly apply the harmless error analysis required by our precedent.not all procedural flaws result in the denial of a fape.we have never adopted as precedent the structural defect approach discussed by judge alarcón in federal way school district,cir plurality.see id.at gould,concurring.our precedent is clear a procedural violation may be harmless,and we must consider whether the procedural error either resulted in a loss of educational opportunity or significantly restricted parental participation.shapiro,at amanda,at target range,at.
although the district court properly recognized that parents have a substantial right to participate in the iep process,it neglected to consider whether parents right was significantly affected by the district procedural violation.in an action for judicial review of an administrative decision,the burden of persuasion rests with the party challenging the alj decision.clyde puyallup sch,cir,superseded on other grounds as recognized in,at.parents fail to present any evidence that undermines the alj credibility findings,or proffer any evidence that they could have found had they received more classroom observation time.lenington could have gone back on other occasions for more visits.lenington also conceded that she was able to provide parents with an informed and independent opinion,and parents presented the opinion of lenington during the due process hearing.having heard all of the testimony,the alj determined that there was likely nothing lenington could have discovered during an additional seventy minutes of observation time that would have changed the alj ultimate opinion that placement in palisade was appropriate for because we conclude that there is nothing in the record to support a finding that the procedural flaw during the development of iep deprived parents of their right to meaningfully participate in the due process hearing,we conclude that the district court finding to the contrary was clearly erroneous 
in appeal,parent challenge the district court denial of a stay put order pursuant to j.the pendent placement or stay put provision requires the child to remain in his current educational placement during the course of administrative and judicial proceedings.susquenita sch.dist.raelee,cir.section j states 
except as provided in subsection k of this section,during the pendency of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this section,unless the state or local educational agency and the parents otherwise agree,the child shall remain in the educational placement of the child,or,if applying for initial admission to a public school,shall,with the consent of the parents,be placed in the public school program until all such proceedings have been completed.
the idea does not define the phrase,current educational placement.however,courts have generally interpreted the phrase to include 
typically the placement described in the child most recently implemented iep,johnson special educ.hearing office,cir the operative placement actually functioning at the time when the stay put provision of the idea was invoked,drinker colonial sch,cir and the placement at the time of the previously implemented iep,thomas cincinnati bd.of,cir.

parents may also invoke the stay put provision at the time the student is applying for initial admission to a public school.if the parents disagree with the school initial proposed placement,the parents may consent to the student being placed in a public school during the pendency of the administrative proceedings.see j.
here,there is no functioning iep.at the time this litigation commenced,was making his initial application for public school.however,rather than consenting to being placed in a public school during the duration of the litigation,parents unilaterally placed in a private program.therefore,the only viable argument parents have for a stay put order is to contend that the district court approved the private placement in its march,reimbursement order.see mackey,at once the parents challenge to a proposed iep succeeds,consent to the private placement is implied by law,and the requirements of j become the responsibility of the school district.alterations in original quoting bd.of educ.schutz,cir clovis unified sch.dist.cal.office of admin.hearings,cir per curiam discussing school committee of the town of burlington massachusetts department of education,d,and concluding that once the state educational agency decided that the parents placement was the appropriate placement,it became the then current educational placement within the meaning of section.parents argue that their private placement is current educational placement because they have prevailed before the district court in their procedural challenge to the district proposed iep.see mackey,at 
in light of our holding that the district court clearly erred in reversing the alj finding that the district procedural violation was harmless,we need not address the merits of parents argument.parents can no longer argue that they have prevailed in their procedural challenge to the iep,or that the district court had determined that privately funded educational services were appropriate.because parents have no basis to contend that their private placement is current educational placement,we affirm the district court denial of a stay put order.
the district court neglected to give the alj careful and thorough assessment of the harmlessness of the district procedural violation the substantial deference it deserved.parents participated in the due process hearing with an informed,knowledgeable,independent expert.there is nothing in the record to suggest that an additional seventy minutes of continuous observation time would have provided any information that would have undermined the alj credibility findings.because the district court failed to consider whether parents substantial rights were significantly affected,and because there is nothing in the record to support a conclusion that they were,we conclude that the district court factual findings were clearly erroneous.we reverse the district court reimbursement order and vacate its award of attorneys fees.we affirm the district court denial of a stay put order.each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.

to limit classroom disruption,the district did not allow classroom observations to extend beyond twenty minutes.however,lenington could have returned anytime for another observation period.she chose not to do so because of the time and expense involved in commuting to and from the school.
