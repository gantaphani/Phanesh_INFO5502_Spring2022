evangelina mendez mendez and members of her family brought this suit against the county of san bernardino,the city of hesperia,the san bernardino sheriff department and various individual defendants collectively,the county under and state law,alleging violations of their civil rights.this case arose from the aftermath of an shooting that resulted in the death of mendez son,ignacio,in july.although the legality of the shooting itself was not challenged,mendez and another of her sons,angel,alleged that the county falsely arrested them after the shooting,illegally searched the mendez home and was negligent in the supervision and training of its officers.some of mendez claims were resolved on summary judgment and others were voluntarily dismissed before trial the remainder were tried before a jury,which found in mendez favor on the false arrest and illegal search claims and awarded her nominal and punitive damages.in this consolidated appeal,mendez challenges the district court decisions limiting the jury consideration of her emotional damages,remitting her punitive damages award and granting summary judgment to the county on her state law negligent training claim.she also appeals the court rulings denying her all attorney fees and costs and sanctioning her attorney.she requests reassignment of the case to a different judge on remand.we affirm in part,reverse in part and remand without reassignment.
background 
mendez son ignacio was shot and killed by a police officer on the evening of july,during an armed standoff with police on the driveway of the mendez neighbor home.neither mendez nor angel was considered a suspect in any crime,but both were witnesses to the event.shortly after the shooting,mendez was placed in the back of a police car on the scene.the officer who first placed her in the car testified that he opened the door and asked her to have a seat.after about minutes,mendez began to hit the windows,asking to be released.an officer then transferred mendez to a different police car parked nearby.she again beat on the windows in an attempt to ask for air an officer eventually cracked open a window for her.after about two hours,mendez and angel were driven to the police station in separate cars for questioning.mendez was not asked whether she consented to being brought to the station and the officer who brought her there never told her that she was free to leave.
at the station,mendez was placed in a room with a closed door and questioned by two police officers,one of whom was deputy cesar reyes.reyes translated in spanish for mendez,who does not speak or read english and has minimal education.reyes admitted that he did not tell mendez that she was free to leave the station.when mendez told reyes that she wanted to see ignacio,whom she did not yet know had been shot fatally,reyes told her that she could not see him.while mendez was being questioned,she was told to sign a form written in english,giving the police consent to search her home.reyes did not translate the consent form for her,including a statement that would have informed her that her consent was voluntary and that she had a right to refuse.when mendez questioned whether searching her home was necessary,reyes put the paper in front of her and told her,this is a paper you need to sign.mendez then signed the form.relying on mendez signed consent,police officers conducted a search of the mendez residence without a warrant.
mendez and angel were released from the police station at around five or six in the morning on july.when mendez returned home,she was at first blocked from entering because police were still investigating the shooting scene.when she was allowed to reenter later that morning,she saw that the house had been searched and noted that the closets were all out of order,and there were clothes thrown around and papers thrown around.mendez husband testified that mendez was crying uncontrollably when she returned home and was having difficulty speaking.one of the officers who questioned mendez admitted that she was upset during some points of the interview and that at times it was difficult for her to speak,although he attributed her anguish to her son shooting.mendez later explained to the jury that she felt l ike a prisoner while at the police station,because she did not know what had happened to ignacio and was afraid for angel life.
mendez and four family members brought this suit against the county of san bernardino,the city of hesperia,the san bernardino sheriff department and five individual defendants,including deputy reyes,the two police officers who drove angel and mendez to the police station,the supervisor in charge of the shooting scene and an officer who responded to an incident at the mendez home on october,three months after the shooting.the plaintiffs later voluntarily dismissed their claims as to the october incident,which removed this latter defendant and three mendez family but mendez and the case.the remaining claims alleged false arrest of mendez and angel under state law and the fourth amendment,illegal search under the fourth amendment,negligent failure to train the police officers under state law,and alleged that the county was liable for the constitutional violations under monell dep t of soc,d,for failing to adequately train its officers.prior to trial,the district court granted summary judgment to the county on the state law negligence claim and the monell claim.the remaining claims proceeded to trial,where the jury found against reyes for mendez false arrest under state and federal law and against reyes for the illegal search of her home under federal law.the jury awarded mendez in nominal damages on each of these claims,plus in punitive damages against reyes,based on its finding that he acted recklessly in depriving her of her constitutional rights.the jury found for the county as to angel claims.
jurisdiction 
this case was brought under the district court had jurisdiction under.the district court entered final judgment in june,and mendez timely appealed.the court denied mendez request for attorney fees and costs under b in a separate order,and mendez timely appealed that order.the court also sanctioned mendez attorney in a separate order and mendez and her attorney timely appealed the sanctions order.these three appeals have been consolidated for our review and we have jurisdiction over them under.we shall consider mendez arguments concerning the trial itself first,followed by her arguments as to the court denial of attorney fees and entry of sanctions against her attorney.
discussion 
jury instruction on mendez emotional damages 
mendez first contends that the district court erred when it issued a sua sponte instruction to the jury limiting its consideration of her emotional damages.the jury initially received an instruction that mendez damages should be the amount of money which would reasonably and fairly compensate the plaintiff for any injury you find was caused by the defendant.the district court later recalled the jury in the midst of deliberations mendez it that the evidence does not support an award of damages for any period after july,the day mendez was released from the police station.it is well established that a party is entitled to an instruction about his or her theory of the case if it is supported by law and has foundation in the evidence.jones williams,cir.we review a district court formulation of jury instructions for abuse of discretion.id.mendez contends that the district court abused its discretion by limiting the jury consideration of her damages to only the two days of events at issue,contrary to mendez theory of her case.we disagree and affirm the district court.
mendez presented fairly minimal evidence of any actual damages she suffered as a result of her illegal arrest and the illegal search of her home.during trial,she testified that she felt l ike a prisoner while she was at the police station,and that she was desperate and was afraid they might kill her son,angel.she also recounted beating on the windows of the police car she was placed in after the shooting.a detective who interviewed mendez on the night of july agreed that she was upset during some points of the interview and that at times it was difficult for her to talk,although he believed that her anguish was related to ignacio shooting.mendez husband similarly testified that his wife was crying uncontrollably and unable to speak when she returned home from the police station.as to the ill effects of the illegal search,mendez testified only that she noted upon her return that the closets were all out of order,and there were clothes thrown around and papers thrown around.
although this evidence arguably showed that mendez had suffered emotionally during the false arrest and illegal search,she did not present any expert witnesses,medical evidence or even testify herself that she had suffered any ongoing ill effects from the illegal arrest and search.the only evidence she presented of any possible ongoing emotional damages at all occurred during the following exchange at trial 
counsel are you taking medication for depression now 
mendez yes.
counsel and when was that prescribed 
mendez after they killed my son.
counsel did not,however,ask mendez any questions to link her depression specifically to her emotional distress from the illegal arrest and search as opposed to any distress she felt from ignacio death.the only other evidence that mendez now suggests could support a jury finding of ongoing emotional damages was that she cried on the witness stand while recounting some of the events.
the district court first expressed concerns about the scope of the emotional damages instruction before closing arguments,when the county requested an instruction that neither mendez nor angel had suffered any damages other than nominal damages.the court was not persuaded that plaintiffs had failed to show any emotional damages from the events,but did flag its concern as to whether they had put forward any evidence of ongoing emotional damages.the court did not immediately rule on the issue,however,and counsel proceeded to make their closing arguments the next day.during a break between the defendant closing argument and the plaintiff rebuttal,the court raised the issue again,stating that it was aware of mendez testimony about depression,but i would like to see the testimony to specifically,the detention and the search as being the cause of that depression.mendez counsel willingly agreed to defer argument on the issue until after he had delivered his rebuttal the district court then ordered both sides to prepare a record of transcript excerpts supporting ongoing emotional damages.the case was then submitted to the jury.after reviewing the parties submissions,the court ruled the next morning that limitation is appropriate,especially in light of the lack of specific evidence as to damages and their time frames.the court recalled the jury and issued a new instruction limiting its consideration of damages to the two days mendez was in custody.the jury ultimately returned an award of nominal damages for the false arrest and illegal search claims.
mendez raises two principal arguments against the district court revised jury instruction.first,she contends that the court abused its discretion because there was a sufficient foundation in the evidence for the jury to have found that she incurred ongoing emotional damages,beyond the damages she suffered during the false arrest and illegal search itself.jones,at.we disagree.as mendez essentially admits,the only evidence that she suffered any ongoing emotional distress was her testimony that she had been on since the day of the shooting.she never testified,however,that this depression was related to the illegal search and arrest,as opposed to any depression she may have felt at the traumatic death of her son,an event for which the county was not liable.she was never asked,nor did she testify,that she suffered any ongoing distress,ill feelings or delayed trauma as a result of the illegal arrest or search,nor did she put forth any medical evidence about the cause of her depression.
although we agree that emotional damages may be based on humiliation and emotional distress established by testimony or inferred from the circumstances,whether or not plaintiffs submit evidence of economic loss or mental or physical symptoms,see johnson hale,cir,this does not mean that emotional damages can be inferred entirely from circumstances,without any supporting testimony from witnesses.to the contrary,in johnson the plaintiffs provided detailed and substantial testimony to support their emotional damages claim.see id.at.in that case we were merely clarifying that they did not also need to present evidence of actual mental or physical symptoms.see id.mendez also points to murphy city of long beach,cir,where we held that a trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering a new trial,when the trial court had concluded that it was erroneous to instruct a jury that a plaintiff emotional distress was necessarily attributable to one of two possibly traumatizing events,only one of which was illegally caused by defendants.murphy offers no support to mendez,however,because in that case we did not consider what evidence the plaintiffs would need to establish that they suffered ongoing emotional distress from the defendants act.we agree that it is possible that mendez suffered ongoing damages from both the illegal search and arrest as well as the death of her son.the district court did not abuse its discretion,however,because she presented no evidence to support that possibility.
second,mendez argues that the timing of the jury after closing arguments,in the midst of jury her due process.she relies on united states eisen,cir,which held that federal rule of criminal procedure requires a trial court to rule on jury instructions prior to summation,to afford the parties an opportunity to frame their closing remarks in light of the court subsequent legal instructions.even assuming the dubious proposition that this rule of federal criminal procedure is also a principle of constitutional due process applicable to civil trials,mendez can neither show that she was substantially misled in formulating her arguments nor otherwise prejudiced.id.mendez was on notice that the court had concerns about the scope of her damages instruction,but she agreed to defer the court ruling on the matter until after her counsel had given his rebuttal argument.further,her closing argument for damages was couched in very broad terms,telling the jury that there is no magical formula to assess damages and that they should just be reasonable and fair to mendez.her counsel reference to the ongoing depression during closing arguments was brief and can not show that she was substantially misled in formulating her arguments.id.we affirm.
ii.reduction of the punitive damages award 
the jury awarded mendez each in nominal damages for her false arrest and illegal search claims and in punitive damages against reyes,whom it found to have acted in reckless disregard of her constitutional rights.after trial,the county moved to remit the award,arguing that it was excessive in violation of the due process clause under bmw of north america,gore,d,and state farm mutual automobile insurance campbell,d.the district court agreed and reduced the punitive damages award to,finding the punitive damages award excessive in light of the nominal compensatory damages awarded.we evaluate the constitutionality of a punitive damages award by following the guideposts provided by the supreme court,assessing the degree of reprehensibility,the disparity between the harm suffered and the punitive damages award,and the difference between this remedy and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.bains llc arco prods,cir citing gore,at.we review the district court application of the gore to a jury punitive damages award de novo,but defer to the district court findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.planned parenthood of the,am.coalition of life activists,cir.mendez argues that the jury award was not unconstitutionally excessive and so should be reinstated.we disagree and affirm the district court.
state farm enumerates the factors we should consider when evaluating the reprehensibility of the defendant conduct under the first guidepost.we look to whether 
the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard of the health or safety of others the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident and the harm was the result of intentional malice,trickery,or deceit,or mere accident.
state farm,at.reprehensibility falls along a scale,with acts and threats of violence at the top,followed by acts taken in reckless disregard for others health and safety,affirmative acts of trickery and deceit,and finally,acts of omission and mere negligence.swinton potomac,cir internal quotation marks omitted.although determining the degree of reprehensibility ultimately involves a legal conclusion,we must accept the underlying facts as found by the jury and the district court,because district courts have a somewhat superior vantage in assessing the defendant conduct.leatherman tool group,cooper,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
applying the supreme court guidance in state farm,the district court found that reyes conduct in failing to translate the form and illegally detaining mendez at the police station was not so reprehensible as to justify the jury award of punitive damages.the court noted,among other things,that although the jury found that reyes acted with reckless disregard for mendez rights,there was no evidence that he acted with malice.accordingly,on the range of reprehensible conduct identified by the supreme court,the district court found that reyes conduct was closer to mere accident than it was to malice.the court also found,and mendez now concedes,that there is no evidence that reyes had acted in the same manner on any other occasion,thus making this the kind of isolated incident the court found less reprehensible than repeated conduct.state farm,at.reyes conduct lastly did not pose any risk to mendez bodily health or safety.although the injury here was physical and emotional rather than economic,the district court noted that the jury award of nominal damages ultimately indicated that the harm caused by reyes conduct was minimal.
although mendez concedes that not all the reprehensibility factors point in her favor,she argues that reyes conduct was nonetheless reprehensible because of its recklessness and because mendez,while not financially vulnerable,was particularly vulnerable to the kind of constitutional deprivation she suffered here.we agree with other courts that abuses of police power not involving actual violence are still reprehensible,insofar as they involve an illegal exercise of authority backed by the weight and force of state power.lee edwards,cir.we certainly do not approve of reyes having deliberately and illegally withheld relevant information from mendez and pressuring her to sign the form,knowing that she was reluctant to agree and was not fully aware of her rights.nonetheless,the district court findings of fact as to the reprehensibility of reyes conduct were not clearly erroneous.the degree of reprehensibility therefore weighs against the jury substantial punitive damages award here.
under the second gore guidepost,we look to the ratio between the punitive damages and the actual harm inflicted on the plaintiff.at.in this case,because mendez was awarded only nominal damages,the award of in punitive represents a ratio of to obviously considerably in excess of the ratios the court has deemed more likely to comport with due process than higher ratios.see state farm,at.the court,however,has carved out an exception relevant to this case,which is that ratios greater than those we have previously upheld may comport with due process where a particularly egregious act has resulted in only a small amount of economic damages.id.internal quotation marks omitted.constitutional torts such as mendez are far more likely to present such scenarios.ratios in excess of single digits in suits therefore will not generally violate due process when the victim suffers no compensable injury.if we were to hold otherwise,then any appreciable exemplary award would produce a ratio that would appear excessive by this measure.lee,at.this would conflict with the court clear guidance that punitive damages should remain available under even in the absence of a compensable injury,and that in such situations punitive damages may be the only significant remedy available.smith wade,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court did not rule otherwise,however,and awarded mendez in punitive ratio of to one,which is also significantly in excess of single digits.the district court firmly rejected the county suggestion that the only punitive damages award that would comport with due process would be an award,noting that such a small award would not be sufficient to deter other law enforcement officers from engaging in similar conduct in the future.although we agree that the second gore guidepost may have reduced relevance in suits involving only nominal damages,we do not agree with mendez contrary suggestion that this factor has no relevance.in this case,the jury awarded a staggering in punitive damages,even though the jury found that mendez suffered no compensable injury from reyes actions.while the second gore guidepost may not be dispositive of the excessiveness of the award in this case,the great disparity between the actual and punitive damages does not cut in mendez favor.
under the final gore guidepost,we compare the punitive damages award in this case to any civil or criminal penalties authorized or imposed in comparable cases.at.see also state farm,at.other circuits have placed greater emphasis on this factor when a civil penalty was readily available as a yardstick of reasonableness and actual damages in the case were nominal or small.in cases involving illegal discrimination under the fair housing act,for example,courts of appeals have upheld punitive damage awards of approximately despite small actual damage awards,in part because this amount roughly equaled the civil penalty available for these violations.see,lincoln case,cir united states big d,cir.mendez,however,identifies no civil penalty available under law for violations of constitutional rights,nor has she identified any comparable cases in which a civil penalty of was imposed for the kind of conduct reyes engaged in here.accordingly,this factor provides no guidance in assessing the constitutionality of the award.
considering all of the gore guideposts,we conclude that the jury award was unconstitutionally excessive in violation of due process and therefore properly remitted by the district court.because the punitive damages award was excessive under the due process clause,we need not decide whether it was also excessive as a matter of federal common law.see exxon shipping baker,d.constitutional torts are governed by the federal common law,subject to the authority of congress to legislate otherwise.see smith,at.holding that damage remedies in suits are determined by looking first to the common law of torts both modern and as of.in exxon shipping,the court held that the federal common law of maritime torts should contain more rigorous standards than the constitutional limit on punitive damage awards,and concluded that a ratio,which is above the median award,is a fair upper limit.id.at.any attempt to fashion a federal common law rule of reasonableness for punitive damage awards for constitutional torts,however,would have to make such modification or adaptation to the common law as might be necessary to carry out the purpose and policy of.smith,at.we decline to make any such rules here,when we agree that the award was excessive as a matter of due process.we therefore affirm the district court remittur.
iii.summary judgment on the state law negligent training claim 
mendez contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the county on her state law negligence claim for failing to train police officers on how to legitimately obtain the consent of individuals brought to the police station.under california law,a public entity generally is immune from suit for injuries arising from acts or omissions of the entity or its employees.see cal.gov t code a.california law creates an exception,however,in cases where the public entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect against the risk of a particular kind of injury,and the public entity is liable for causing that kind of injury while failing to exercise reasonable diligence in discharging its duty.see cal.gov t code.the district court granted summary judgment to the county,concluding that the plaintiffs had present ed virtually no evidence regarding the county training of its deputies.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo.davis city of las vegas,cir.we affirm.
the county first argues that it is immune from suit under california government code a,because no statute creates a mandatory duty of care as to the training of its employees.as the county admits,however,it makes this argument for this first time on appeal,after having conceded before the district court that it was under a duty to train its employees adequately,and arguing instead that it satisfied that duty.we decline to address the county new theory of defense because it was not presented to the district court.see wagner prof l eng rs in cal.gov t,cir generally,before an argument will be considered on appeal,the argument must be raised sufficiently for the trial court to rule on it.internal quotation marks omitted see also in re bliemeister,cir sovereign immunity may be forfeited where the state fails to assert it.
although we reject the county immunity defense,we nonetheless affirm the district court because we agree that mendez did not create a triable issue of fact as to whether the county failed to satisfy its statutory duty of care.mendez argues that the guidelines and regulations that create the county duty to train its employees are california peace officer standards and training post regulations,which are promulgated under california penal code.these rules establish minimum standards for training of city police officers and other peace officers in california.see code a.mendez presented no evidence,however,that the county negligently failed to comply with the post regulations on training.instead,she focused on showing that the county did not train its employees on how to obtain implied consent from a witness and offered the testimony of an expert witness from the detroit police department,who asserted that an adequate training program should include training on obtaining implied consent.none of this evidence established that the post regulations or any other statute create a duty to train employees on implied consent or that the county negligently failed to fulfill that duty.we affirm.
iv.mendez request for attorney fees and costs 
after the jury verdict in her favor,mendez moved for attorney fees and costs under.section b authorizes the district court to award the prevailing party a reasonable attorney fee in any suit to enforce the provisions of.as the supreme court has noted,t he purpose of is to ensure effective access to the judicial process for persons with civil rights grievances.hensley eckerhart,d quoting.therefore,a prevailing plaintiff should ordinarily recover an attorney fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.id.internal quotation marks omitted.although a district court award of attorney fees is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion,we only arrive at discretionary review if we are satisfied that the correct legal standard was applied and that none of the district court findings of fact were clearly erroneous.thomas city of tacoma,cir.the district court acknowledged that mendez was a prevailing plaintiff and therefore was ordinarily entitled to a reasonable attorney fee,but nonetheless denied her request for costs and fees in its entirety,finding that her request was so excessive that it warrant s a denial of fees altogether.mendez argues that the district court erred by denying her all costs and fees.we agree,and so we reverse and remand for a determination of reasonable costs and fees.
following the jury verdict,mendez moved the district court for an award of fees in the amount of,attaching supporting affidavits and other documentation to her motion.mendez was represented by attorneys from the law firm morrison foerster,llp.an affidavit from her lead counsel explained that counsel had spent hours preparing for and trying her case,excluding hours that were spent pursuing her unsuccessful monell claim against the county and the claims mendez voluntarily dismissed.mendez requested that the two partners who worked on her case be compensated at between and per hour,which was the typical rate at which they billed their clients at that time.mendez asked that the two associates who primarily worked on the case be compensated at rates between and per hour,which was somewhat below their usual market rate.mendez counsel stated that the final fee request was calculated after voluntarily discounting the partners hours by percent and the associates and paralegals hours by percent,in order to address any concerns that the court or the defendants may have that on any given day or task,any person may have devoted too much time to any particular project,or to alleviate any concerns that the rates sought are too high.lastly,mendez stated that she had incurred more than in costs,but was requesting only,again in an attempt to avoid disputes over the propriety of particular costs.
the county did not contest mendez entitlement to attorney fees and costs under,but did object to certain hours it deemed excessive and certain costs it found objectionable.in calculating an appropriate fee award for mendez,the county proposed that hours of work were reasonably expended on the case.after reducing the partners and associates billing rates to and per hour the county considered more reasonable rates for civil rights county suggested that in fees were reasonably incurred.the county asked the court to reduce this figure by percent,however,based on what it argued was the limited degree of success the plaintiffs had achieved,resulting in a final proposed fee award of.the county similarly proposed an reduction of mendez costs by percent,suggesting that the court award no more than.in reply,mendez agreed to further reduce certain hours and costs to accommodate the county specific objections and agreed to a slight reduction in the partners billing rates,but refused to accept any percentage reduction to the overall costs or fees based on the alleged poor degree of success.mendez final request,after adding in additional hours spent working on the case since the motion for attorney fees was filed,was for in fees and in costs.
despite mendez success on the merits and the county acknowledgment that she was entitled to recover what it considered reasonable attorney fees and costs,the district court denied her request for fees and costs entirely.during a hearing on the motion for attorney fees,the district court called mendez request the most excessive fee request i have ever seen and told the parties that it believed there was case law that would support simply denying the request.the court noted that it did not think mendez case was particularly complicated,because it involved no novel issues of constitutional law and the events in question occurred over a relatively short time span.the court also observed that the suit had not achieved any significant success,because the jury awarded mendez only nominal and punitive damages on two of her claims.the court requested supplemental briefing from the parties to address the possible applicability of scham district courts trying criminal cases,cir,abrogated on other grounds by bailey mississippi,cir,and brown stackler,cir,two cases where courts of appeals held that a court may deny a request for attorney fees if it was so excessive as to shock the conscience.after reviewing the parties supplemental briefing,the district court entered a minute order denying costs and fees,finding that the amount requested satisf ies the shocks the conscience test.the district court later entered a final written order denying costs and fees,again emphasizing the overall excessiveness of mendez request.this appeal followed.
the county does not dispute that mendez was a prevailing plaintiff and,as such,would ordinarily be entitled to a reasonable attorney fee.the jury found in mendez favor on three claims against five parties her two constitutional claims of unreasonable search and false arrest against reyes,and her state law claim of false arrest against reyes,the county of san bernardino,the san bernardino sheriff department and the city of hesperia.even a plaintiff who wins only nominal damages is considered a prevailing plaintiff under mendez won both nominal and punitive damages.see farrar hobby,d.although she did not prevail against all defendants or on all of her claims,it is well established that fail ure to recover on all theories of liability is not a bar to recovery of attorney fees.thomas,at.a plaintiff is entitled to recover attorney fees even for claims on which she did not prevail,if they involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories.id.internal quotation marks omitted.nonetheless,the district court dispensed with the practice courts are generally required to follow when calculating attorney fees in civil rights,computing a lodestar figure and then,if necessary,making adjustments to that figure based upon reasonableness factors,instead denying all costs and fees as excessive.morales city of san rafael,cir.
congress intent in enacting was to attract competent counsel to prosecute civil rights cases,where victims ordinarily can not afford to purchase legal services at the rates set by the private market.city of riverside rivera,d plurality opinion.therefore,a court discretion to deny fees under is very narrow and fee awards should be the rule rather than the exception.herrington county of sonoma,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court and we have thus denied a prevailing plaintiff an attorney fee in only certain limited situations,none of which is applicable here.in farrar,the court held that a plaintiff who seeks a large damages award but wins only nominal damages,thus failing to prove an essential element of the relief sought,may reasonably be awarded no fees.at.we have explained,however,that such a denial is appropriate only where the plaintiff success is purely technical or de minimis.morales,at internal quotation marks omitted.when,as here,the plaintiff wins punitive damages,the award of punitive damages alone is sufficient to take it out of the nominal category.thomas,at.the county does not contend that mendez victory falls within the de minimis exception recognized in farrar.
a court may also deny an attorney fee to the prevailing plaintiff under when special circumstances exist sufficient to render an award unjust.thomas,at.we evaluate whether special circumstances exist by asking whether allowing attorney fees would further the purposes of and whether the balance of equities favors or disfavors the denial of fees.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we have stressed that this exception applies only in unusual cases,however,such as when there is both a strong likelihood of success on the merits and a strong likelihood of a substantial judgment at the outset of the litigation,such that the purpose behind that litigants with similar claims would not be dissuaded from bringing suit by the lack of availability of a fee award is not implicated.herrington,at.we have firmly rejected the district court authority to refuse a reasonable fee under the special circumstances exception simply because it believes it would result in a windfall to a plaintiff.thomas,at.granting a windfall to plaintiffs was a concern echoed by congress in enacting,but congress balanced that concern against the need to attract competent counsel to prosecute civil rights cases.id.
the district court did not identify any special circumstances present here,and we see none.mendez suit involved precisely the kind of,constitutional claims that motivated congress to enact.even the district court remarked that it was unlikely that anyone was beating down the doors to take on mendez case.the district court itself did not purport to rely on the special circumstances exception,but instead denied mendez request for costs and fees solely on a legal standard that originates from outside this circuit that a request for fees under may be denied if it is outrageously excessive or inflated to an intolerable degree,see brown,at,or so excessive it shock s the conscience of the court,see scham,at quoting fair housing council landow,cir alterations in scham.as the district court acknowledged,this circuit has never held that a court has the discretion to deny an attorney fee to a prevailing plaintiff under solely because the court finds the fee request to be so excessive as to shock its conscience.
we need not decide whether it would ever be appropriate for a court entirely to deny fees and costs under purely on the excessiveness of the request,however,because those circumstances are not present here.those courts of appeals that have upheld a denial of fees under the shocks the conscience test have done so only where the fee request appeared to have been made in bad faith,such as billing outrageous numbers of hours on simple matters,or where the plaintiff made no effort to eliminate hours spent on unsuccessful,unrelated claims.in the first category are cases such as brown,where the seventh circuit denied all fees to an attorney who submitted a request for hours of billable time,even though his work consisted of filing a complaint and then simply awaiting the outcome of pending litigation in the supreme court that almost automatically disposed of the case.at.similarly,in scham,the fifth circuit upheld a total denial of fees where an attorney billed hours for a case where discovery was limited,and there were no meetings of the parties or attorneys,no settlement negotiations,no mediation,no court appearances,and no trial.at.the counsel in scham was also a solo practitioner with one year of experience,who nonetheless requested per hour for his time.id.therefore,in both of these cases,it was altogether improbable that any attorney could have reasonably expended such hours in good faith on matters so simple.
falling into the second category are cases such as fair housing council,where the fourth circuit upheld a denial of fees to a prevailing plaintiff who made no effort to eliminate large numbers of hours spent on unsuccessful,unrelated claims.in that case,plaintiffs brought separate claims for housing discrimination and breach of contract,succeeding only on their breach of contract claim.see at.although the housing discrimination and contract claims were not the discrimination claim was by far the more complex of the two to plaintiffs nonetheless submitted a request for in fees for the entire litigation,with billing entries that failed to allocate the fees attributable to each claim.id.the first circuit similarly upheld the denial of fees in lewis kendrick,cir,where plaintiffs achieved only minor success and yet made no reduction for claims that had no relation to the victorious claim.the lewis case also appears to have fallen into and thus anticipated the farrar exception to granting a fee award,because the first circuit concluded that plaintiffs compensatory award for prevailing on a single having requested in compensatory and punitive damages on multiple only a de minimis victory.id.at.as explained above,mendez case does not come within the farrar exception.
although the district court characterized mendez fee request as unreasonable,excessive,egregious,staggering and indefensible,there is no evidence that her fee request was either made in bad faith or contained excessive hours spent on unrelated claims.the county own proposed lodestar calculation included almost the same number of billable hours as mendez request,an acknowledgment that this case involved considerable discovery and proceeded to a full trial the county suggested that mendez attorneys should be compensated at a significantly lower half of what mendez the county did not deny that mendez attorneys typically charge their clients such amounts.instead,the county simply argued that her attorneys should be compensated in line with civil rights attorneys and not their own usual hourly rate.camacho bridgeport,cir explaining that appropriate hourly rate is the prevailing hourly rate in the court district for work that is similar to that performed in the case,by attorneys with the skill,experience and reputation comparable to the party attorneys.finally,mendez attorneys represented that they had eliminated hours spent on mendez unsuccessful,unrelated claims.although the county identified a few hours that it believed were nonetheless related to these claims,there is nothing to suggest that mendez failed to make a effort to eliminate unrelated hours.in her reply,mendez also agreed to write off additional time and costs so as to reduce or eliminate any remaining disputes over the number of hours.thus we see nothing in this request for fees and costs that would shock the conscience of the court,such as was present in cases like scham,brown,lewis and landow.
the other reasons the district court offered in support of its decision likewise can not justify denying fees entirely.the court emphasized first that the fee request was staggering in light of the issues prevailed upon at trial and the actual amount of damages recovered by plaintiff.we give due weight to the court assessment of the case and its dynamics,both legal and factual.nonetheless,we have cautioned that the significance of civil rights suits should not be evaluated solely on the amount of damages obtained,because successful suits act as a deterrent to law enforcement and serve the public purpose of helping to protect the plaintiff and persons like him from being subjected to similar unlawful treatment in the future.morales,at.even in a case where the p laintiff succeeded on only one of his many claims against defendants,we held that the district court must nonetheless calculate a reasonable fee.thomas,at.the district court certainly has discretion to reduce an award to a plaintiff who achieved only partial or limited success.but t o deny an award of attorney fees notwithstanding plaintiff clear victory on one of his claims for relief is an abuse of discretion a reasonable fee is not no fee at all.id.at.
the district court also suggested that the denial of fees could be justified because of certain excessive hour and cost entries and because mendez counsel their time,thereby frustrating the court efforts to determine whether the fees were,in fact,reasonable.again,such billing practices are legitimate grounds for reducing or eliminating certain claimed hours,but not for denying all fees.see,welch met.life ins,cir courts have discretion to reduce hours herrington,at courts have discretion to eliminate hours attributable to duplication of effort.even duplicative work,however,is not a justification for cutting a fee,unless the lawyer does unnecessarily duplicative work.moreno city of sacramento,cir.as noted above,mendez and the county essentially agreed on the number of hours reasonably expended on the case.nonetheless,the district court often emphasized the excessiveness of mendez fees and costs as initially recorded in the firm billing showed approximately million in fees and in though mendez never actually requested these amounts but instead voluntarily reduced both fees and costs,ostensibly to account for inefficient work or disputable cost entries the district court thus appears to have penalized mendez for alleged inefficiency,notwithstanding her attempt to write down hours and costs to account for those very inefficiencies.as for the time entries,it was fully appropriate for the court to reduce those claimed hours.see welch,at affirming court discounting of hours because they may overstate the hours incurred and make it more difficult to determine how much time was spent on particular activities.as we have clarified since the district court was confronted with the fee request here,however,the use of block billing does not justify an reduction or rejection of all hours.see id.
on remand,the district court should determine a reasonable attorney fee for mendez utilizing the customary lodestar method.see,morales,at.the lodestar is the presumptively reasonable rate,which is reached by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended by the prevailing party with a reasonable hourly rate,then making any adjustments as necessary to account for factors not already subsumed within the initial lodestar calculation.see see also kerr screen extras guild,cir explaining factors that bear on the reasonableness of the fee.in so doing,the court may make the adjustments it finds are warranted based on the record before it.for example,the court must consider what constitutes a reasonable hourly rate for work performed in the relevant community by attorneys of similar skill,experience and reputation.see camacho,at see also herrington,at noting that a reasonable hourly rate should reflect the cost of competent counsel in the field.the court may also reduce an award for attorney fees for unnecessarily duplicative work,if the court provides a clear explanation that we can review as to why these hours were truly unnecessary.see moreno.at the same time,the district court is not only free but obligated to consider the results obtained by mendez,or the extent of her success.morales,at quoting hensley,at.we therefore vacate the district court order denying mendez all fees and costs and remand for a determination of a reasonable award,consistent with the principles we have explained.
sanctioning mendez counsel for failure to appear 
after trial,the district court imposed a sanction personally on one of mendez attorneys,arturo gonzalez,for failure to appear at an order to show cause hearing.the local rules for the central district of california expressly reserve the district court inherent power to maintain control over the proceedings conducted before said judge,and state that m isconduct of any attorney in the presence of a court or in any manner in respect to any matter pending in a court may be dealt with directly by the judge in charge of the matter.cal.although the district court did not specify the authority for its order,we can deduce the source of its power for purposes of our review,and in this case it is clear that the court sanctioned gonzalez in an exercise of its inherent power to protect the due and orderly administration of justice and maintain the authority and dignity of the court.primus auto.fin,batarse,cir internal quotation marks omitted alterations in original.we review the district court entry of sanctions for abuse of discretion.see id.with respect,we must conclude that the district court abused its discretion by imposing the sanction without making an express finding of bad faith,and by sanctioning gonzalez for failing to appear at a hearing when he did not have notice that his personal appearance was required.we therefore reverse and vacate the sanction order.
the genesis of the sanctions came during trial,when the district court admonished gonzalez for seeming to repeat a question during his examination of a hostile witness,after the court had ruled the question argumentative once the jury was dismissed,the court said it was inclined to cite gonzalez for contempt for having disobeyed its ruling sustaining the objection.the court asked gonzalez to respond in papers by the following monday,but told him that a t this point there an order to show cause re sanctions for contempt set for the end of trial.in his declaration,gonzalez explained that he is a partner at morrison foerster and chair of his firm trial practice group,with years of litigation experience before federal and state courts.he explained that when a trial objection is sustained,it is his practice to make a quick and good faith judgment call on how to rephrase the question so as to elicit the desired information in a way that is not objectionable.in this case,he believed he had done so by
