discussion 
california follows the american rule,under which each party to a lawsuit ordinarily must pay his or her own attorney fees.trope,supra,cal th at,d,gray don miller associates,cal d.code of civil procedure section codifies the rule,providing that the measure and mode of attorney compensation is left to the agreement of the parties e xcept as attorney fees are specifically provided for by statute.
section is such a statute.subdivision b requires that parties and their attorneys certify that pleadings or other written matters presented to the courts have merit,to the best of the person knowledge,information,and belief,formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances.subdivision c authorizes sanctions for a violation of subdivision b.subdivision d provides a sanction imposed for violation of subdivision b shall be limited to what is sufficient to deter repetition of this conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated t he sanction may consist of,or include,directives of a nonmonetary nature,an order to pay a penalty into court,or,if imposed on motion and warranted for effective deterrence,an order directing payment to the movant of some or all of the reasonable attorney fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation,subd.d,italics added.
when construing statutes,our goal is to ascertain the intent of the enacting legislative body so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.city of santa monica gonzalez cal th,d.we first examine the words of the statute,giving them their ordinary and usual meaning and viewing them in their statutory context,because the statutory language is usually the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.ibid.
in trope,supra,cal th,d,we examined the words incur and attorney fees,finding their ordinary and usual meaning implies an agency relationship inconsistent with.we were concerned there with civil code section,which provides in subdivision a where the contract specifically provides that attorney fees and costs,which are incurred to enforce the contract,shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party,then the party who is determined to be the prevailing party on the contract shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs.italics added.we found the ordinary and usual meaning of the word incur is to become liable.trope,at,d.the ordinary and usual meaning of attorney fees,in both legal and general usage,is the consideration a litigant actually pays or becomes liable to pay in exchange for legal representation.an attorney litigating in propria persona pays no such compensation.ibid.
as section was adopted before our decision in trope,that decision could have had no influence on the legislature intent when it drafted and enacted section.nevertheless,the usual and ordinary meaning of the words did not change between,when civil code section was enacted,and,when section was added to the code of civil procedure we find,therefore,that the inclusion of the words incur and attorney fees in section implies an agency relationship under which the client and the party are not one and the same,and out of which the attorney expects remuneration.section also identifies attorney fees as an expense,authorizing a court to impose sanctions in the form of reasonable attorney fees and other expenses incurred.italics added.the word expense is associated with an obligation to pay something that is expended in order to secure a benefit or bring about a result.webster new internat,supra.a party who acts on his or her own behalf does not thereby generate an expense that the party has become obligated to pay.and although such a party may lose earnings he or she might have obtained but for devoting time to the litigation,the loss of time from other employment is a loss,not an expense.
adams acknowledges the similarity in language between civil code section and code of civil procedure section.he contends,however,that the construction of words in a statute awarding contractual attorney fees as an item of costs should not control their construction in a statute authorizing an award of attorney fees as a sanction.but unless there is evidence the legislature had a contrary intent,logic and consistency suggest the same language in analogous statutes should be construed the same way.adams contention,moreover,is inconsistent with federal court decisions denying attorney fees as sanctions to att
