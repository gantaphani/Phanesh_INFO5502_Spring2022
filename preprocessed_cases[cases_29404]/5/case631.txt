the defendants,moses freeman and the city of chattanooga,appeal from a jury verdict awarding the plaintiff,charles moore,back pay and damages for emotional and mental distress,based on his claim of retaliation under the fair labor standards act,flsa.the defendants claim that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury finding that they retaliated against moore,that damages for emotional and mental distress are not recoverable under the applicable provision of the flsa,and that the verdict was excessive.because we conclude that the evidence of retaliation was sufficient to support the verdict and that damages for emotional and mental distress were properly recovered under the act,we affirm the district court judgment sustaining the jury verdict in the plaintiff favor.
on,the plaintiff contends that the district court erred in reducing his request for attorney fees by on the theory that he had prevailed on only one of his six claims.this use of a mathematical formula constituted an abuse of discretion under existing sixth circuit precedent and will require a remand for correction.the plaintiff also contends that the damages should be doubled as liquidated damages,but we conclude that this issue is not properly before us on appeal.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff charles moore was hired by the city of chattanooga in october as a code inspector in the city housing division.his initial annual salary,and that of joseph sheats,who started in the same position on the same day as moore,was.also hired as a code inspector on that day was mary hutson,at a starting salary of.hutson is a white woman moore and sheats are both black men.the defendant,moses freemen,who was the department administrator at the time the three new hires began,claimed that hutson was paid more because of her prior work experience and training and because she had turned down the job at the original salary.on the other hand,plaintiff moore later testified that when he asked whether the salary was negotiable,he was told it was not.
several months later,when moore learned of the disparity between his and hutson salaries,he raised the issue with freeman at a february staff meeting and was told by freeman that he would work to get moore salary raised.before that meeting,hutson had complained to freeman that she was being mistreated by some of her.she complained again after the meeting and also reported to her direct supervisor,dan thomas,that she felt that other people in the office resented her and that she was caught in a hostile work environment.in particular,she complained of some interactions she had had with some of her black,including both moore and sheats,that she felt were negative.thomas reported the latter conversation to freeman,who directed thomas to conduct an investigation into hutson allegations.thomas did so but concluded to his own satisfaction that the work environment was not hostile.
according to freeman,by april the office was in such turmoil that he felt compelled to take some action to regain control.concluding that the problems had begun about the time that moore,hutson,and sheats had started working in the housing department,freeman decided to fire all three of them.before he could carry out this plan,however,hutson told freeman she was quitting,and freeman placed her on two weeks paid administrative leave.he later testified that he took this action because he wanted to terminate all three employees collectively and because he was worried hutson was building a case against the city.around the same time,freeman directed thomas to extend the probationary periods for moore,sheats,and hutson an additional days beyond the normal period imposed on new employees.freeman apparently accepted hutson resignation on april.two days later,he fired moore,who then remained unemployed for approximately four months before securing a new,job.
at trial,moore testified that the experience of being fired was demoralizing,like being slapped in the face.he said that he had worried about paying the family bills and that he lost his health insurance and had to pull his children out of their soccer league because he feared that they might get injured at a time when he had no insurance coverage.he also testified that the stress of having lost his job affected his relationship with his of whom drew a picture of him as a with his wife.moore wife testified that moore had trouble sleeping during the period he was between jobs,and a friend of his testified that moore became,lost his appetite,and began having neck pains.
moore and sheats had originally filed a joint complaint in federal court against the city of chattanooga and several city officials under the flsa,the equal pay act,d,title vii of the civil rights act of,and the tennessee human rights act,ann.however,sheats entered a voluntary dismissal,and moore proceeded to trial alone.at its conclusion,the district court granted the defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law in part,and the only claims that went to the jury were moore claims against freeman in his official capacity and against the city under the flsa,the equal pay act,and the tennessee human rights act for sex discrimination.the jury found that defendants did not violate the equal pay act or discriminate against moore based on sex.it did find,however,that the defendants violated the flsa by discharging moore in retaliation for his complaints about unequal pay and awarded him in back pay and for mental and emotional distress.
the city then filed a motion for remittitur on the back pay award and asked that the remainder of the award be set aside,contending that mental and emotional damages are not authorized by the flsa.moore filed a request for attorney fees and costs and moved to alter or amend judgment by doubling the compensatory damages as liquidated damages.the district court reduced the award to but denied the rest of the defendants motion,holding that damages for mental and emotional distress due to retaliation can be recovered under the flsa and finding that the damage award of was not excessive.the court also denied moore motion to alter or amend the judgment,noting that an award of damages to employees who suffered from retaliation was compensatory in nature and that liquidated damages would not further this purpose.finally,the court reserved ruling on the plaintiff motion for attorney fees and asked for further documentation,specifically on the amount of time spent on legal issues and whether the work was expended on behalf of moore or sheats.moore submitted more information,but the district court found that it was still not sufficiently specific.the district judge therefore awarded moore of the attorney fees and costs he had requested,on the theory that he had prevailed on only one of the six claims he brought in the original complaint.the defendants have appealed the jury verdict and the damage award approved by the district court.the plaintiff has the calculation of attorney fees and costs.
ii.discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
the defendants assert that the plaintiff did not sufficiently prove that he engaged in activity,that his dismissal was related to the protected activity,or that the defendants proffered reason why the plaintiff was dismissed was pretextual,addressing each of these contentions under the analysis set out in mcdonnell douglas green,d,and urging that we find that the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation.we have held,however,that after a trial on the merits,a reviewing court should not focus on the elements of the prima facie case but should assess the ultimate question of discrimination.kovacevich kent state,cir citing eeoc avery dennison,cir.we have,nevertheless,recognized that whether the plaintiff made out a prima facie case may be relevant to our review of that ultimate question.gray toshiba am.consumer,cir.
moore was clearly engaged in activity,given the fact that the provisions of the flsa can be triggered by informal complaints,see eeoc romeo cmty,cir,and that the defendants do not dispute that moore protested to freeman about his unequal pay.although the defendants con
