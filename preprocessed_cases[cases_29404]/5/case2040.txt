appellant,the law firm of daar newman,previously represented respondent,vrl international,in a personal injury action.because respondent had insufficient contacts with california for this state to assert jurisdiction over it,appellant successfully moved to quash service of process and obtained respondent dismissal from the action.appellant also successfully defended the trial court ruling on appeal to this court.
contending that it was not paid in full for the services it rendered on behalf of respondent in the prior action,appellant has filed this action for recovery of fees.respondent filed a motion to quash contending it has no sufficient contacts with this state upon which jurisdiction may be based.the trial court granted the motion to quash,referencing our prior opinion and the doctrine of judicial estoppel.it then dismissed respondent from the action.
we conclude the trial court erred.the operative facts and law relating to this action are different from the prior action.the plaintiff in the prior action attempted to assert jurisdiction over respondent for injuries which occurred in connection with a personal watercraft accident in nassau,the bahamas.here,appellant asserts jurisdiction to recover fees directly related to appellant retention and representation of respondent in california.because the claim arises directly from services rendered by appellant for respondent in california,limited jurisdiction exists for resolution of the claim.
factual background 
the facts are undisputed.in the prior action,los angeles county superior court case no,david cuenllas sued respondent and others for personal injury resulting from injuries he sustained in a jet ski accident in the ocean off the bahamas the cuenllas action.he alleged he had been a guest at the breezes hotel in nassau,operated by respondent,and that he had been injured while riding a jet ski he rented from an operator adjacent to the hotel.
after process was served on respondent agents in the bahamas,appellant,a california law firm,was retained to represent respondent in the cuenllas action.on behalf of respondent,appellant filed a motion to quash,which was supported by the declaration of cameron burnet,respondent senior vice president.essentially,burnet declared that respondent owns the registered trademark breezes is incorporated in the cayman islands with its principal place of business in the bahamas is not licensed or registered to conduct business in california has never entered into any contract in california does not pay taxes in the state has no business or office or employees in california has never owned or leased property in california has never maintained a telephone or telefax number or address in california has never designated an agent for service of process in california has no officers or directors residing in california has never maintained business records in california has never initiated litigation in california and did not consent to personal jurisdiction in california.
cuenllas opposed the motion.he asserted that he was on a business trip arranged by his company through an organization called value marketing.he learned about various recreational activities at the hotel through brochures and literature sent to him and others before they departed on the trip.another declaration identified international lifestyles,a florida corporation,which solicited business on behalf of various breezes resorts and superclubs resorts.marketing occurred in california and other jurisdictions.
the trial court granted the motion to quash in the cuenllas action based on the facts and circumstances of this case,this court lacks general or specific jurisdiction over respondent,a cayman island corporation.any purported advertising by respondent international lifestyles is insufficient as a matter of law and does not constitute sufficient minimum contacts.there is no substantial nexus between plaintiff injuries and the purported advertising.the advertising does not operate to confer jurisdiction over respondent for the injuries suffered by plaintiff in the course of recreational activities occurring wholly outside the united states.in an unpublished portion of our opinion,we affirmed the trial court ruling.cuenllas vrl international,nonpub.opn.
this action was filed by appellant on february,naming respondent and international lifestyles as defendants causes of action for breach of contract and common counts are alleged.the fifth cause of action for breach of contract,alleged against respondent,states that defendant authorized,permitted,allowed and accepted plaintiff law firm to be its attorney of record and to represent and defend defendant in a civil action on file in the superior court of the state of california,county of los angeles,case no.bc.plaintiff law firm continuously defended said defendant in said civil action and defendant agreed to pay the reasonable value of such services as were necessary to defend said defendant.on or about december,and continuing thereafter,defendant breached the agreement by f ailing to pay for the legal services necessarily performed as attorney of record in the defense of the civil action,case no.bc,los angeles superior court plaintiff suffered damages legally proximately caused by defendant breach of the agreement as follows legal services performed for respondent,as client,in the amount of thousand seven hundred dollars.
respondent filed a motion to quash service of process in this action along with a request that the court take judicial notice of the minute order granting its motion to quash in cuenllas and our opinion affirming the trial court in that same action.the motion was also supported by the declaration of respondent senior vice president,cameron burnet,addressing the same factors relevant to the issue of general jurisdiction he addressed in the cuenllas motion to quash.
appellant opposition to the motion to quash conceded there are insufficient contacts between respondent and california to establish general jurisdiction.it argued that specific jurisdiction existed for the claims being made as to the second defendant,respondent,california courts have specific jurisdiction as to that defendant for purposes of this lawsuit.that company respondent utilized the services of plaintiff,california lawyers,to enable it to defend its position that it should not have to litigate the multimillion dollar cuenllas case here.the personal injury subject of the cuenllas lawsuit occurred in the bahamas at respondent breezes hotel.respondent spent years fighting before the superior court of california and then before the california court of appeal to avoid the exposure of litigating that case here.
after argument,the trial court ruled.the motion of respondent,is granted on the basis of the finding and holding of the court of appeal in the underlying cue n llas action,as well as the doctrine of judicial estoppel and respondent opposing brief.a notice of appeal was timely filed by appellant.
discussion 
at the outset,we conclude that the trial court was wrong in relying upon our prior opinion as a basis for granting the motion to quash in this case.whether the court terse language was meant to refer to the doctrines of law of the case or res judicata,or each of them,neither apply here.
if a case is first tried,and the judgment rendered is reversed on appeal,it will ordinarily be tried again citation.and after retrial,another appeal may be taken.the doctrine of law of the case deals with the effect of the first appellate decision on the subsequent retrial or appeal the decision of an appellate court,stating a rule of law necessary to the decision of the case,conclusively establishes that rule and makes it determinative of the rights of the same parties in any subsequent retrial or appeal in the same case.the doctrine applies only to a decision of an appellate court in the same case.final decisions or rulings of a trial court in a separate case,or in various independent stages of a proceeding,are governed by the distinct principle of res judicata.citations.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.because this is a separate and distinct case from cuenllas,the doct
