gary starr sued his former employer,metro systems,and deborah masanz,the administrator of metro plan under the employee retirement income security act erisa,for their failure to provide starr with notification of his right to continue his health and dental insurance coverage,as required by the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act cobra.following a bench trial,the district court found in favor of starr.however,the court denied starr requests for attorney fees and statutory damages,which starr appeals.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
starr refurbished office furniture for metro systems,a minnesota corporation.during his employment,starr received an employee welfare benefit plan as required by erisa.the plan,administered by metro vice president deborah masanz,provided starr and his daughter,gabrielle cotton,with medical and dental coverage.
on february,metro terminated starr employment.upon termination,starr was entitled to receive from metro notice of his rights under cobra.the plan required metro to provide starr a form enabling him to elect to continue his and cotton medical and dental insurance coverage.the plan states 
when a qualifying event occurs,your employer metro must give you the necessary cobra election form within the time period specified by law.you must complete and return this form to your employer within days of the later of 
the date you or your dependent would lose coverage or 
the date you or your dependent receives the cobra election forms.
metro compliance with this provision or rather its failure to comply is the focus of this case.
under metro customary processes,only masanz sends cobra notices,which she normally does according to a standard procedure.however,masanz did not follow her standard procedure with starr.on march,masanz routinely drafted a notification and election form to send to starr.william meyers,metro chief financial officer,interrupted masanz normal procedure for creating and sending cobra notices before the march notice was mailed to starr in her deposition and testimony at trial,masanz had difficulty precisely recollecting events surrounding the handling of starr notification and election form masanz equivocated in her explanation of the creation and sending of starr march notice,offering conflicting accounts in her deposition and trial testimony.
ultimately,masanz admitted that she had no recollection of sending the march notice to starr.there is no record that the march notice was actually sent to starr.the district court found that the march notice was never sent to starr.consequently,metro did not handle the termination of starr coverage in accordance with the plan.
according to the plan,starr coverage would terminate on march,without an election to continue his benefits and payment of the monthly premium.nonetheless,metro extended starr coverage until july,in an effort to discourage starr from pursuing a discrimination claim against the company.the company did not inform starr of its decision to continue coverage,but starr submitted claims and received benefits for medical expenses incurred in march,april,and may of.from august to october of,starr incurred in medical expenses for treatment provided to his daughter that undisputedly would have been covered under the policy,if in effect.
by letter dated august,starr informed metro that he had not received information regarding his rights under cobra.masanz responded by letter dated september,stating that metro records indicate that it provided starr with notice of his cobra rights on march,and that she was enclosing a duplicate copy of the notification.however,as previously stated,masanz later acknowledged there actually were no records indicating that the march notice was sent to starr the district court found that when masanz said records,she meant her recollection.curiously,the district court also found that masanz had no recollection of sending the march notice to starr.
starr brought the instant action,individually and on behalf of his daughter cotton,against metro and masanz.starr alleged that the defendants violated cobra by failing to provide adequate notice of his rights regarding a continuation of coverage after his termination.following a bench trial,the district court found in favor of starr.specifically,the court found that h aving failed to give starr timely notice of his right to continue coverage for himself and cotton and denied starr the ability to elect to continue coverage,defendants are bound to provide coverage to starr and cotton.the court awarded starr,which is the amount of medical expenses incurred from august to october of less and premiums from march through october of.the court refused to award statutory damages,finding that defendants failure to maintain records sufficient to establish,by a preponderance of the evidence,that timely notice was sent to starr did not arise from a disregard of cobra requirements.
in his motion to amend the verdict,starr argued that he was entitled to prejudgment interest and statutory damages.the district court granted the motion in part,ordering metro to pay in prejudgment interest.the court denied the motion with respect to statutory damages,reiterating its earlier findings and finding further than masanz did not act in bad faith,noting the extension of coverage provided to starr without payment of premium.
starr filed a motion for attorney fees,but the district court denied the motion,applying the five factors set forth in lawrence westerhaus,cir.the court found that metro had the ability to pay and that an award of attorney fees would have a deterrent effect however,the court held these factors were outweighed by the absence of bad faith,the fact that starr did not bring the suit as a class action,and the fact that the defendants position was not without merit because they survived summary judgment.starr appeals the district court denial of statutory damages and attorney fees.

here,the district court declined to impose the statutory penalty.based on the record,we can not say the district court abused its discretion.in its order,the district court found that the plan administrator,masanz,did not act in bad faith by failing to give timely notice to starr.specifically,the district court found masanz timely created a cobra notice addressed to starr.the court acknowledged that the notice was not sent to starr but found no willful failure on masanz part to send the notice.the district court further surmised that had masanz acted in bad faith,starr coverage would not have been extended for four months after his scheduled termination under the plan.interestingly,meyers,metro chief financial officer who apparently handled the notice at some point,was neither deposed nor called to testify.based upon its assessment of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses,the district court found that although starr established that metro system failed,the evidence did not show the plan administrator conduct constituted disregard of cobra notice requirements.if this were a de novo review,we might reach a different conclusion,but the imposition of the statutory penalty is discretionary,and the denial of statutory damages on these facts does not amount to an abuse of discretion.
