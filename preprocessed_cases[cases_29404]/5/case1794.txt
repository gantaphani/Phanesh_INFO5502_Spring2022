cyrus sanai appeals from the judgment entered after the trial court granted motions for judgment on the pleadings filed by harvey saltz,the former president of the registry,udr,a company acquired during the pendency of these proceedings by first advantage corporation,and by first advantage corporation,as to udr,terminating sanai action for violations of the federal fair credit reporting act fcra and the california consumer credit reporting agencies act and related state common law claims based on udr negative reports about sanai credit following a dispute between sanai and his landlord over the amount of rent due for an apartment sanai had leased in newport beach.sanai also appeals from several trial court orders relating to a stay of discovery,denial of leave to amend his complaint and awards of attorney fees and costs.we reverse in part.
factual and procedural background 
we described at length the largely undisputed factual background and the procedural history of the first five years of this litigation in our nonpublished decision in sanai saltz june,wl,from which we now liberally borrow.
the rent dispute and the negative credit report 
sanai rented an apartment in a newport beach apartment complex known as promontory point from august,through january.after the expiration of the original,lease,sanai continued to occupy the apartment on a basis at a rent of.in september sanai received a letter dated august,from a representative of the owner of the apartment complex stating a new monthly rent of was being established for his apartment and offering him the option to renew for a minimum of a up to a lease,at the monthly rent of effective october.a second copy of this letter was taped to sanai door a few days after he had received the original by mail.sanai responded on october,with a letter of acceptance for a lease,enclosing a rent check of for october.
within a day of sanai acceptance of the offer set forth in the august,letter,a representative of the owner informed sanai the monthly rental amount was a misprint and advised him the offer was rescinded.sanai a transactional lawyer responded that he had accepted the offer and the contract was binding further discussions between sanai and representatives of the owner did not resolve the dispute.in december a notice to quit was posted on sanai door.sanai moved out of the promontory point apartment complex in january.
from october,through the time he left his newport beach apartment,sanai paid rent at the rate of per month.in february,after sanai had moved,a representative of the owner contacted sanai and demanded he pay back rent in the amount of sanai refused.each party threatened the other with legal action.
the owner of the apartment complex filed no legal action to enforce its claim for unpaid rent against sanai and apparently did not assign the debt to a collection agency.however,it did retain udr and saltz in april to inform consumer credit reporting agencies of the claim for unpaid rent against sanai.
in january sanai applied for and was denied a credit card from american express due to information from a agency that a debt had been sent to collection.citibank subsequently declined sanai request to increase his limit for the same reason.sanai obtained a copy of his credit report,which listed an item from udr stating a collection account was past due for unpaid rent at promontory point.sanai then requested that udr and saltz insert in its reports additional information about sanai dispute with the owner of promontory point pursuant to civil code section.sanai has subsequently alleged udr did not include in its reports sent to third parties the text he had requested.
sanai complaint and udr special motion to strike 
in september sanai filed a complaint against udr and saltz alleging causes of action for slander,libel,intentional and negligent interference with prospective economic advantage,intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress,violations of the consumer credit reporting agencies act,et and violation of the fcra.the complaint sought in excess of million in damages.
after answering the complaint,udr filed a special motion to strike under code of civil procedure section,asserting sanai lawsuit was brought in retaliation for udr exercise of its constitutional right to petition or engage in speech related to a matter in litigation.udr argued that,because sanai debt was detailed in the notice to pay rent or quit that had been served on him as a prerequisite to eviction proceedings,its actions in reporting that alleged debt to the major credit bureaus was speech made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body within the meaning of code of civil procedure section,subdivision e.on december,the trial court denied the motion,concluding udr had failed to make the required threshold showing that the challenged causes of action arose from protected activity within the meaning of section,subdivision e at the same time the trial court denied sanai motion for preliminary injunction,which sought to enjoin udr from threatening to make or making false statements about him to consumer credit reporting agencies,finding sanai had not demonstrated he was likely to prevail on the merits of his lawsuit.
udr and saltz appealed the trial court order denying the special motion to strike,filing notices of appeal on january,code civ,subd.j,subd.a sanai from the trial court denial of his motion for a preliminary injunction code civ,subd.a.on february,two months after the trial court ruling denying its special motion to strike,udr also filed a petition for writ of mandate to vacate the trial court order and requested this court immediately stay all trial court proceedings,arguing its right to appeal the trial court order was not an adequate remedy.sanai opposed the writ petition,noting udr had exercised its right to appeal from the trial court denial of the special motion to strike and asserting that none of the public interest considerations the legislature sought to protect through code of civil procedure section expedited procedures was implicated by this case.
we summarily denied the petition for writ of mandate and request for stay of proceedings on february.the registry,superior court,nonpub.opn,review den.udr did not seek a stay of the trial court proceedings by petition for a writ of supersedeas ancillary to its appeal,either before or after our summary denial of its petition for writ of mandate.see reed superior court th,d.
in an opinion filed march,we affirmed the trial court denial of udr special motion to strike,holding that for the official proceeding in code of civil procedure section,subdivision e,clauses and,to be equated with a public issue,there must be an actual official proceeding to which the conduct at issue can be connected.if there was no actual official proceeding,there was no public issue to which the conduct can be connected,and the conduct should not fall within the protection of section,subdivision e,clauses and.sanai v.the registry,wl,nonpub.opn.sanai from the denial of his motion for a preliminary injunction was dismissed as moot.id.at.the remittitur issued may.
further proceedings in the trial court 
while the appeal from the denial of udr special motion to strike was pending in this court from january,to may,the litigation proceeded in the trial court,which issued a number of orders,at least at the outset without any formal objection by either party,determining pleading issues and discovery disputes including orders for sanctions and ultimately resolving against sanai all of the substantive issues raised by his lawsuit.
initially,the trial court held sanai landlord was a necessary and indispensable party to the action.as a result,sanai filed a first amended complaint and thereafter a second amended complaint adding the owners of the apartment sanai had leased irvine apartment communities,irvine apartment communities,llc,and the irvine company,collectively irvine entities as defendants and asserting a cause of action against irvine apartment communities,and irvine apartment communities,llc for breach of a written lease agreement the purported agreement to lease the apartment for months at a monthly rental of beginning october,udr,as assignee of the irvine entities,then filed a to collect the disputed unpaid rent.
on october,the trial court sustained udr demurrer to the first seven causes of action in the second amended complaint without leave to amend.the court ruled that the second amended complaint did not allege udr had wrongfully reported a false debt indeed,according to sanai allegations,udr had fully complied with civil code section,subdivision c,which requires that,if a debt is subject to a continuing dispute,any information about that debt submitted to a credit reporting agency must include a notice that the information is disputed by the consumer.judgment on the pleadings in favor of saltz and the irvine entities on those same seven causes of action was granted by the trial court on december,based on the court earlier ruling on udr demurrer to the second amended complaint.a final judgment of dismissal was thereafter entered as to the irvine company and saltz on march,shortly before we filed our opinion affirming the trial court denial of udr special motion to strike.
the eighth cause of action in the second amended complaint,the only remaining claim against udr,was resolved against sanai on february,when the trial court granted udr motion for summary adjudication,concluding udr had not published sanai consumer credit report during the time periods alleged in the second amended complaint,an element of the claim for violation of civil code section.on march,the trial court granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by irvine apartment communities,and irvine apartment communities,llc on the last claim in sanai lawsuit,the ninth cause of action for breach of contract.the trial court ruled sanai attempt to accept the offer for a lease at a monthly rental was ineffective because the written offer even assuming no mistake in the price term required acceptance no later than september,while sanai letter of acceptance was dated october.the trial court entered a final order of dismissal as to irvine apartment communities,and irvine apartment communities,llc on april.sanai served a combined written notice of entry of final judgment and final orders of dismissal as to all the irvine entities and saltz on april.
after all of the causes of action in sanai second amended complaint had been dismissed and a trial date set for udr to collect unpaid rent,sanai made a statutory tender of the full amount sought by udr whether this offer was prompted by the trial court statement it would entertain a motion for terminating sanctions as a result of sanai failure to comply with discovery orders or was independently prompted by tactical considerations is disputed by the parties.udr accepted the offer and dismissed its on may,week prior to issuance of the remittitur in sanai v.the registry,supra,wl.a final judgment was entered in the case on september.
sanai postjudgment motion to set aside void orders and our decision directing the trial court to vacate all orders entered after january,
following entry of the final judgment,udr and the irvine entities filed both a joint memorandum of costs and a consolidated motion for attorney fees on november.sanai moved to strike the costs memorandum as to all parties as untimely he opposed the attorney fee motion on the merits and also argued as to the irvine entities the motion was untimely.after hearing argument the trial court granted udr and the irvine entities request for leave to file the costs memorandum late and awarded in costs.the court denied the request for attorney fees under the attorney fee provision in the lease agreement,but found udr was entitled to attorney fees under civil code section,subdivision e,which authorizes the award of fees to a limited class of successful defendants in actions under the consumer credit reporting agencies act actions against debt collectors related to the collection of a debt if the lawsuit was not brought in good faith.the court awarded udr in fees,percent of the total fees sought by all defendants in their consolidated attorney fee motion.
while appealing from those cost and fee orders,sanai also moved in the trial court,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision d,to set aside void orders and judgment,asserting the trial court lacked jurisdiction to make any orders denying him relief or granting relief to the defendants during the pendency of the appeal from the denial of udr special motion to strike.the trial court denied the motion,and sanai appealed from that order as well.
in sanai saltz,supra,wl decided june,on rehearing following the supreme court decision in varian medical systems,delfino cal th,d,varian,we reversed the trial court order denying sanai motion to set aside void judgment and orders,vacated the judgment entered against sanai and reversed all postjudgment orders awarding and denying costs and attorney fees.as we explained,in varian the supreme court held,by virtue of code of civil procedure section,the perfecting of an appeal from the denial of a special motion to strike pursuant to code of civil procedure section automatically stays all further trial court proceedings on the merits as to those causes of action affected by the motion varian,at,d,and also held any subsequent trial court proceedings on matters embraced in or affected by the appeal are void,not merely voidable s ection,as a matter of logic and policy,divests the trial court of jurisdiction over the subject matter on,jurisdiction in the fundamental sense.id.at,d.
we remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to vacate all orders entered after january,the date on which udr and saltz filed notices of appeal from the denial of udr special motion to strike sanai complaint,and to conduct further proceedings based on the state of the pleadings on january.in addition,to return the parties so far as practicable to the positions they occupied on january,we directed the trial court to consider sanai request for made to us in connection with his appeals from the postjudgment to order reimbursements to the extent appropriate.finally,we awarded sanai his costs on appeal 
proceedings in the trial court 
a.sanai pursuit of his costs on appeal 
on september,sanai filed a memorandum of costs on appeal apparently served by mail the previous day,seeking in costs jointly and severally from saltz,first advantage corporation,which had been substituted for udr as a party in the proceedings during the appeal,and the irvine entities.the defendants motion to tax costs,filed october,was ruled untimely one day late.no motion for relief was filed,and on march,the trial court signed an order submitted by sanai instructing the clerk to prepare a judgment in the amount of,plus interest from september,in favor of sanai.the order also recited sanai may enforce such judgment from and after march.
on april,sanai obtained an abstract of judgment based on the march,order,which he then had recorded in los angeles and orange counties.no actual judgment was signed until may.on april,sanai served on saltz,first advantage corporation and the irvine entities that is,he served the corporate defendants but not their counsel a memorandum of costs after judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section,seeking recovery of the costs incurred preparing and recording the abstracts of judgment,other cost items totaling just under and in attorney fees the memorandum of costs after judgment was filed april.the clerk judgment dated may,includes a stamp,apparently dated may,indicating costs after judgment in the amount of handwritten insert claimed by handwritten insert plaintiff.
michael saltz,counsel for first advantage corporation,gave sanai telephonic notice of his intention to apply to the court ex parte for an order shortening time to move to strike the memorandum of costs after judgment.the next day,may,michael saltz and sanai appeared before the court,and michael saltz moved to strike the memorandum of costs.according to sanai,he objected that he had only been given notice of a request to shorten time,not that a substantive motion would be presented to the court.the trial court granted the motion to strike,but subsequently vacated that order after sanai presented evidence confirming michael saltz had not given proper notice of the ex parte hearing,stating only that he would be seeking an order to shorten time.a minute order dated may,recites,the may,order striking the memorandum of costs and the judgment is stricken.counsel for defendant shall bring a properly noticed motion to strike the memorandum of costs.
first advantage corporation and saltz collectively saltz parties filed a motion to strike sanai memorandum of costs after judgment on june.sanai filed various opposition papers.the trial court granted the motion on july,concluding sanai service of his memorandum of costs after judgment was faulty as to the various corporate defendants although not as to saltz because he had failed to identify any individual to receive service at any of the corporate entities purportedly served.the court expressly found sanai thereafter intentionally altered court documents to show that certain individuals were served on behalf of corporate defendants.the court also ruled the memorandum should have been filed as a noticed motion because the attorney fees sought by sanai were not incurred in enforcing a judgment that included an award of attorney fees to the judgment creditor.the court expressly deferred ruling on the merits of any request for attorney fees by sanai,reserving decision until the question was presented as part of a properly noticed motion.
prior to resolution of the dispute regarding sanai memorandum of costs after judgment,counsel for the saltz parties sent sanai a check for the amount of costs requested in the original memorandum of costs and then an additional check for interest claimed on that sum.a new dispute arose between sanai and the saltz parties regarding filing of acknowledgements of satisfaction of judgment,which prompted a series of ex parte applications and court intervention.ultimately the saltz parties filed a motion for an order requiring judgment creditor to execute,file and record acknowledgments of satisfaction of judgment in full the court granted the motion on march,ordered sanai to execute acknowledgments of satisfaction of judgment and imposed statutory of against sanai.following further briefing,on may,the court awarded the saltz parties attorney fees in the amount of pursuant to code of civil procedure section.
b.the motions for leave to amend,stay of discovery and judgment on the pleadings 
as discussed,when we reversed the orders before us in sanai saltz,supra,wl on june,we remanded with directions to the trial court to conduct further proceedings based on the state of the pleadings as of january.at that time sanai original complaint,the operative pleading,alleged three statutory causes of of the fcra the eighth cause of action and portions of the state consumer credit reporting agencies act,subd.f,the seventh and ninth causes of action and six common law tort actions based on udr negative reports to a credit bureau concerning sanai credit status relating to the dispute over his rent.
sanai filed several motions to amend his complaint on october,february,march,and may.in general,sanai sought leave to allege new different facts underlying his claims to delete four of the common law claims and to replace them with a more general negligence claim,to delete the consumer credit reporting agencies act claims as initially pleaded and reallege one such claim in somewhat different form and to add a new cause of action for violating business and professions code section.the motions were denied by the trial court.in denying the second such motion the court explained its reasoning in language repeated in substantially the same form in subsequent orders,the contradiction of key harmful facts originally pleaded and admitted by sanai makes this court suspicious of plaintiff proposed amendment and makes it appear to be a sham.in denying the previous motion for leave to amend,this court admonished plaintiff that a new motion would not be granted unless plaintiff presents evidence that the earlier pleading is the result of mistake or inadvertence.citations.plaintiff failed to present any evidence that the court instructed him to present.denying the fourth motion the court stated,plaintiff three prior motions to amend his complaint have been denied because the proposed amendments attempted to plead around defects in the original complaint,and were thus sham pleadings.his latest motion is not different.
on april,the saltz parties moved for judgment on the pleadings,directed to the original complaint,contending sanai federal claim should be dismissed because the statute at issue,does not provide for a private cause of action his claim for violation of civil code section section is preempted by federal law and his state tort causes of action are similarly preempted by federal law.the saltz parties also argued sanai claims were barred,as a matter of law,by the common interest privilege and asserted his various pleadings and declarations in the trial court established as a matter of law that none of the common law claims had merit.
prior to filing its motion for judgment on the pleadings,confronting outstanding discovery demands,which it had not answered and asserted it had never received,and a motion to compel responses,first advantage corporation moved for a protective order to stay all discovery pending the court determination of the jurisdictional issues to be raised by its dispositive motion.sanai opposed the motion,arguing first advantage corporation had waived its objections to his discovery demands by failing to respond in a timely fashion and asserting the motion itself was untimely because not filed promptly after the discovery had been served.noting the motion was filed within the extended time agreed to by the parties for discovery responses,the court found the motion was both a timely and promptly filed response.the court granted the motion and ordered all discovery stayed pending resolution of potential termination motions.the court ordered all such motions be brought within the next days or the stay will be lifted.
c.the court order granting judgment on the pleadings 
following extensive briefing and several hearings,the trial court granted the saltz parties motion for judgment on the pleadings.as to sanai federal claim the eighth cause of action,the court held there was no private right of action for violating a a point sanai sanai had failed to state a cause of action under b.the court gave sanai leave to amend the subdivision b claim,but required,as a condition to allowing the amendment,that sanai produce admissible evidence to support any new factual allegations in his pleading.when sanai failed to present such evidence,the court granted the motion as to the federal claim without leave to amend.
as to his state statutory claim the seventh cause of action,notwithstanding language in the fcra expressly excepting from preemption section,subdivision a,the trial court concluded allowing a private cause of action for the conduct alleged by sanai would be inconsistent with the federal scheme and ruled the claim preempted by federal law.the court similarly found sanai common law causes of action preempted 
d.the postjudgment award of costs and attorney fees 
after the trial court order granting the saltz parties motions for judgment on the pleadings,sanai filed a request for entry of dismissal with prejudice to create an immediately appealable order.following entry of judgment the saltz parties moved for attorney fees as the prevailing parties pursuant to c and b sanai opposed the motion,arguing the provisions cited by the saltz parties were inapplicable to his lawsuit or,alternatively,at most authorized recovery of attorney fees only for that small portion of the litigation involving his federal claim.
the court rejected those arguments and awarded in attorney fees.in its order the court explained,this court specifically finds that this entire action has been prosecuted and maintained in bad faith and for the purpose of harassment.further,plaintiff prosecution of this matter has been malicious,as evidenced by,among other things,the altering of documents presented to the clerk office and the recording of illegal judgment liens with malice,and then refusing to remove them despite being ordered by the court to do so.several other courts have bluntly noted and condemned plaintiff litigation tactics.it is now this court turn.this court specifically finds that all unsuccessful pleadings,motions,and papers filed by plaintiff in this lawsuit were done so in connection with an action under usc section,and further that these pleadings,motions and papers were filed in bad faith and with the purpose of harassment.
contentions 
in his appeal in sanai contends the trial court erred in granting the motions for judgment on the pleadings,denying him permission to amend his complaint,staying discovery pending decision of the saltz parties dispositive motions and striking his memorandum of costs after judgment in connection with our award of costs relating to the appeal in sanai saltz,supra,wl.in sanai contends the court erred in awarding attorney fees to the saltz parties pursuant to code of civil procedure section in connection with the appellate costs proceedings and awarding them costs and attorney fees as the prevailing parties in the underlying lawsuit pursuant to c and b.
discussion 
the trial court erred in denying leave to amend the eighth cause of action for violation of b a.as currently pleaded the complaint fails to state a cause of action for violation of b 
as originally pleaded in september,sanai eighth cause of action alleged he sent udr a letter dated february,notifying it he owed no money for rent at promontory point and no collection activities had been initiated against him.nonetheless,udr and saltz informed experian formerly trw,a national consumer credit reporting agency,that sanai owed promontory point in violation of the fcra.
in a proposed first amended,supplemental verified complaint submitted on september,as an exhibit to his opposition to the pending motions for judgment on the pleadings,sanai alleged,as a violation of and b,after he had informed udr of the inaccuracies of the information it had reported to the consumer credit reporting agencies,udr,as well as saltz and first advantage corporation,failed to properly investigate the complaint to ensure all reported information was complete,accurate and not misleading,and failed to correct information that was not complete,accurate and not misleading.in particular and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,saltz,udr and fac first advantage corporation failed to correct the information they had reported to inform the consumer credit reporting agencies that promontory point had not as of conducted any collection activities and had no intention of doing so.
the fair credit reporting act et was adopted by congress to ensure accuracy and fairness in credit reporting and to protect the rights of individual consumers.see b jones federated financial reserve cir,pinner schmidt cir.with respect to furnishers of information to consumer credit reporting agencies,like udr and first advantage corporation,section of the fcra imposes two general requirements the duty to provide accurate information a and the duty to investigate the accuracy of reported information upon receiving notice of a dispute b to trigger the latter set of duties,however,notice to the furnisher of information must be given pursuant to section a of the fcra a,which requires a consumer credit reporting agency to reinvestigate the current accuracy of information in its files after being notified by the consumer of a dispute and to notify the person who furnished it with the information about the dispute.that is,to activate the duties imposed by section b of the fcra,notice of the dispute must come to the furnisher of the information udr from the credit reporting agency experian,not directly from the consumer sanai himself.young equifax credit information services,cir.this means that a furnisher of credit information has no responsibility to investigate a credit dispute until after it receives notice from a consumer reporting agency.under the statutory language notification from a consumer is not enough.stafford cross country bank d,accord,rollins peoples gas light coke d,elmore north fork bancorporation,d.
sanai complaint plainly alleges udr violated a by reporting inaccurate information concerning his credit status and by failing to correct the inaccuracies when notified by sanai.however,enforcement of the duties enumerated in that section of the fcra is expressly reserved to federal agencies and specified state officials.d see nelson chase manhattan mortg.cir.the trial court so ruled,and sanai does contend otherwise.
although violations of section a of the fcra may not be privately enforced,a private cause of action for consumers is generally recognized under section b of the fcra b against furnishers of credit information who fail to comply with the requirements of that provision.see,nelson chase manhattan mortgage,supra,at nelson equifax information services,llc d,pirouzian slm d,gordon greenpoint credit d,but see carney experian info.solutions,d,consumer credit reporting agency,but not consumer,may sue to enforce obligations imposed by b.in opposition to the saltz parties motion for judgment on the pleadings,sanai argued he had standing to assert such a claim.the trial court accepted sanai standing,but concluded he had not stated a cause of action because his complaint plainly reveals that the only notice provided to udr in connection with that cause of action for violation of the fcra came from plaintiff himself,not from experian or any other consumer reporting agency.
sanai suggests,since the affected consumer will inevitably be the original source of any inquiry about the accuracy of credit information furnished to the credit reporting agency,notice of the dispute to the furnisher of the credit information from the consumer credit reporting agency ought not be a condition precedent for private enforcement of the duties of investigation imposed by b.whatever merit sanai argument might have as a matter of policy,the language of the statute,as held,for example,by the ninth circuit in nelson chase manhattan mortgage,supra,at,could not be clearer.absent notice from experian,udr had no enforceable duty to reinvestigate the information about sanai it had previously provided.
b.the trial court abused its discretion in imposing overly restrictive requirements when granting conditional leave to amend the complaint 
as an alternative to his argument that notice of his dispute need not have been given by him to experian and then by experian to udr,sanai insists he was and is capable of alleging these facts and argues he was entitled to leave to amend his complaint to plead this required element.
i.the conditional grant of leave to amend 
in its amended ruling granting the motions for judgment on the pleadings,filed december,the court made the following observation with respect to a possible amendment to allege sanai gave notice to experian and experian gave notice to udr sufficient to state a private cause of action under first,there has been no shortage of amendments and attempted amendments in this case and none,so far,has come remotely close to alleging facts that might satisfy section b.indeed,the proposed amendment,filed with sanai opposition to this motion and already rejected by this court,alleges a cause of action for section b,yet does not allege these facts.the current state of the pleading is quite to the contrary of these facts.plaintiff alleges that he contacted defendants and they informed experian,thereby violating section.see of september complaint.however,if plaintiff can produce admissible evidence that shows,for the purposes of section b,that he contacted experian and that experian contacted defendant,plaintiffs,will be allowed to amend this court remains very sensitive to sham pleadings,where factual theories are changed or abandoned to fit tentative rulings.
in a declaration under penalty of perjury filed as part of a supplemental response to the court december,order,sanai stated he made two separate written complaints to experian challenging the information udr had provided experian.these letters informed experian that the information provided by udr was false.the response s i got back from experi a n in both cases were updated credit reports with no changes made,from which i conclude that udr did not change the information that it reported based on the investigation requests.sanai also asserted in his declaration that at the hearing on the motions for judgment on the pleadings michael saltz,counsel for udr and first advantage corporation and a former director of udr,stated sanai had made two separate written complaints to experian and that udr had received two letters from experian requesting that udr initiate a reinvestigation.in an accompanying memorandum of points and authorities,sanai argued michael saltz statements were admissible evidence.he also argued the court stay of all discovery precluded him from producing additional admissible evidence.
in an opposition memorandum the saltz parties argued earlier filings by sanai established he had complained to experian only on one prior occasion,not two,and then only to contend the debt reported was not his.experian contacted udr,which properly investigated the complaint and reported back to experian the information was correct.counsel disputed he had admitted at the prior hearing that experian contacted udr twice and attached a copy of the transcript of the november,hearing and insisted sanai sworn testimony is not enough,especially in light of his propensity to lie to this court finally,counsel argued sanai should have copies of his correspondence with experian,so his inability to conduct discovery was immaterial.
in an addendum to its amended ruling on the motions for judgment on the pleadings,filed february,the court concluded sanai showing was insufficient to permit an amendment to his complaint.the court stated sanai had offered nothing by way of documents or transcripts to support his claim or to give the court reason to disbelieve the saltz parties representations concerning the extent of their communications with experian.plaintiff would presumably be in possession of the evidence that might trigger a need to further test defendants representations through second set of communications between himself and experian.although acknowledging the testimony of a single witness is sufficient to prove any fact referring to the statements under penalty of perjury in sanai declaration,the court noted at least two problems with this offer.first,if plaintiff made written complaints to experian,there would be no need to rely on his oral testimony.second,given the history of this litigation,this court is extremely sensitive to the manufacturing of facts and the threat of sham pleading.accordingly,the court granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the federal claim without leave to amend.
ii.notwithstanding the trial court past unsatisfactory experiences with sanai efforts to amend his complaint,sanai should have been granted leave to amend his fcra claim 
the allegation of notice sufficient to state a private cause of action under b has two aspects.first,sanai must allege he informed experian of his dispute.in his sworn declaration in response to the order conditionally granting leave to amend,sanai insisted he did so in writing on two separate occasions.second,he must allege experian contacted udr,as required by a,and requested udr reinvestigate the credit information it had provided.although explaining he had no access to experian correspondence with udr and emphasizing the trial court had stayed discovery,sanai asserted he could and would make the required allegation based on statements made in court by michael saltz,counsel for udr.
if we were to consider sanai proposed amendments and the proffered bases for them in the is,without considering the trial court experience with the parties and the manner in which the litigation has been conducted,which spawned its sensitiv ity to sham pleadings,where factual theories are changed or abandoned to fit tentative rulings we would have little doubt leave to amend should have been granted.great liberality should be exercised in permitting a plaintiff to amend.lemoge electric county of san mateo cal d,accord,okun superior court cal d.if there is any reasonable possibility that the plaintiff can state a good cause of action,it is error to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.youngman nevada irrigation dist.cal d,see schifando city of los angeles cal th,d,leave to amend should be granted when the plaintiff has demonstrated a reasonable possibility that he or she can amend any of her claims to state viable causes of action.
but this case does have an extensive history,and the trial court has every right to guard against sham pleadings and to prevent abuse of the litigation process.for example,the trial court has discretion to deny leave to amend when the proposed amendment omits or contradicts harmful facts pleaded in a prior pleading unless a showing is made of mistake or other sufficient excuse for changing the facts.absent such a showing,the proposed pleading may be treated as a sham.vallejo development beck development th,d amid hawthorne community medical group,d.the rule is that a proposed amendment which contradicts allegations in an earlier pleading will not be allowed in the absence of very satisfactory evidence upon which it is clearly shown that the earlier pleading is the result of mistake or inadvertence.american advertising sales transport d.see reichert general ins.cal d,where a verified complaint contains allegations destructive of a cause of action,the defect can not be cured in subsequently filed pleadings by simply omitting such allegations without explanation.citations.in such a case the original defect infects the subsequent pleading so as to render it vulnerable to a demurrer.citation.however,we have also made it clear that a party should be allowed to correct a pleading by omitting an allegation which,it appears,was made as the result of mistake or inadvertence.ordinarily a court will permit an amendment to cure a mistake or inadvertent allegation,but it is not required to accept an amended complaint that is not filed in good faith,is frivolous or sham.american advertising sales,at.
the trial court appears to have had good reason to be hesitant to accept new factual allegations from sanai,at least to the extent they were inconsistent with prior allegations as,for example,seems to have been the case with respect to allegations regarding the timing of sanai purported acceptance of the offer for a lease at per month but it went too far when it demanded the production of admissible evidence,specifically excluding sanai own testimony,to support the proposed amendment to the complaint while at the same time preventing sanai from conducting any discovery significantly,none of sanai prior filed or proposed pleadings contained any inconsistent allegations.paragraph of the original complaint,identified by the trial court at the november,hearing on the motion for judgment on the pleadings as diametrically opposed to what you saying now,alleged sanai notified udr of errors in the credit report and udr nonetheless falsely informed experian that sanai owed promontory point in excess of.that allegation does not contradict sanai subsequent allegation he also notified experian directly of the errors and experian,in turn,reported the dispute to udr and requested reinvestigation.
to be sure,sanai did not offer his more refined version of events until the required pleading elements for a private cause of action under b were articulated by the court and we are aware,as the saltz parties argued in the trial court,evidence adduced in connection with the special motion to strike under code of civil procedure section and sanai motion for a preliminary injunction suggests sanai may be unlikely to prove his claim.but the question before us is not whether sanai evidence will be sufficient to prevail at trial or even to survive summary judgment but whether his allegations of notice are adequate to state a cause of action.see brehm century ins.th,d although we may entertain some skepticism as to the nature of the competent and credible proof brehm will be able to offer in support of these allegations,the issue before us is not whether his evidence will be sufficient but whether his allegations of intentional misconduct and bad faith are.
in concluding the trial court erred in imposing unduly restrictive conditions on sanai right to amend his complaint,however,we certainly do not intend to suggest the trial court is without powerful tools to shield other parties,as well as nonparties,from abusive litigation tactics.for example,the trial court could issue orders initially limiting any discovery to the issue of notice and imposing strict controls on the order,timing and scope of that discovery.then,if appropriate,the court could schedule an early hearing on a motion for summary adjudication regarding the b claim.in addition,if there is reason to believe the amendments to the complaint are being presented for an improper purpose,sanctions may be available under code of civil procedure section see generally day collingwood th,d banks hathaway th,d,as well as code of civil procedure section see generally palm valley homeowners,design mtc th,d.but the trial court is simply without power to demand,as the condition for leave to amend,that a party present admissible evidence sufficient to withstand summary judgment 
the trial court erred in granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings as to sanai cause of action for violation of section but properly granted the motion as to the state common law causes of action

general principles of preemption 
the united states supreme court has traditionally recognized preemption of state law by federal enactments pursuant to the supremacy clause,art.vi,cl in three circumstances express preemption implied or field preemption and conflict preemption.english general electric,d.first,congress can define explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law.citation.fundamentally is a question of congressional intent,citation and when congress has made its intent known through explicit statutory language,the courts task is an easy one.second,in the absence of explicit statutory language,state law is where it regulates conduct in a field that congress intended the federal government to occupy exclusively.such an intent may be inferred from a scheme of federal regulation so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it,or where an act of congress touch es a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.citation.although the supreme court has not hesitated to draw an inference of field where it is supported by the federal statutory and regulatory schemes,it has emphasized where the field which congress is said to have includes areas that have been traditionally occupied by the states,congressional intent to supersede state laws must be clear and manifest.citations.finally,state law is to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.thus,the court has found where it is impossible for a private party to comply with both state and federal requirements,citation or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.jevne superior court cal th,d,accord,in re tobacco cases ii cal th,d.

preemption under the fcra 
the fcra contains two preemption sections affecting state law claims that apply to persons who furnish information under the fcra.first,a provides only state law claims inconsistent with the express provisions of the fcra are preempted.except as provided in subsections b and c of this section,this subchapter does not annul,alter,affect,or exempt any person subject to the provisions of this subchapter from complying with the laws of any state with respect to the collection,distribution,or use of any information on consumers,or for the prevention or mitigation of identity theft,except to the extent that those laws are inconsistent with any provision of this subchapter,and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.a.thus,there is no implied or field preemption congress did not enact the fcra with the goal of vitiating all state laws,but only those that are inconsistent with the federal law.lin universal card services d,lin.
notwithstanding this general language preserving state laws that do not conflict with the fcra,however,in congress amended the fcra to strictly limit the availability of consumer state remedies against furnishers of credit information.as amended,b provides,no requirement or prohibition may be imposed under the laws of any state with respect to any subject matter regulated under f section,relating to the responsibilities of persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies,except that this paragraph shall not apply i with respect to section a of chapter of the massachusetts annotated laws as in effect on september,ii with respect to section a of the california civil code as in effect on september.
i.sanai common law claims 
the united states supreme court in medtronic,supra,at.at held,a bsent other indication,reference to a state requirements includes its duties.there is nothing in the present case to contradict this normal meaning.accordingly,b f totally preempts all state common law tort claims against furnishers of credit information arising from conduct regulated by,including sanai common law tort claims against udr and saltz.see roybal equifax d,the fcra precludes all common law causes of action that would impose any requirement or prohibition on the furnishers of credit information hasvold first usa bank,d,dismissing as preempted state common law claims for libel,interference with prospective advantage and invasion of privacy t he plain language of section b f clearly eliminated all state causes of action against furnishers of information,not just ones that stem from statutes that relate specifically to credit reporting riley general motors acceptance d,dismissing as preempted state law claims for defamation,invasion of privacy and negligence.
we acknowledge some federal district cases decided before medtronic,supra.have held the fcra preempts only claims against credit information furnishers brought under state statutes,not common law,based on language in e,which limits consumer actions for defamation,invasion of privacy or negligence against consumer reporting agencies relating to information disclosed pursuant to the fcra except as to false information furnished with malice or willful intent to injure such consumer.see,beuster equifax information services d,gorman wolpoff abramson,llp d,revd.on other grounds.unlike,however,which expressly deals with the fcra preemption of state law,e is not a preemption provision at all.rather,it is a general grant of protection to furnishers of credit information for certain disclosures mandated under the fcra.moreover,section e was part of the fcra when congress added the specific preemption language found in section in.accordingly,even if there were a conflict between the two sections of the fcra,the subsequently enacted statutory provision would control.see governing board mann cal d,board of supervisors superior court d.
ii.sanai claim under section,subdivision a 
as discussed,b f ii expressly excepts section,subdivision a,from preemption.indeed,as the district court recognized in lin,supra,d at page,r etaining section a is consistent with congress stated intention in section a because both provisions prohibit knowingly providing false or inaccurate information to a consumer credit reporting agency.on what possible basis,then,could the trial court here find sanai section claim preempted 
like several other federal district courts in california,the district court in lin,after acknowledging section,subdivision a,was outside the reach of fcra preemption,nonetheless held permitting a private cause of action under that section would conflict with the congressional enforcement scheme.lin,supra,d at.the court explained section,subdivision a,itself does not provide for a private cause of action for aggrieved consumers.rather,such actions are authorized by civil code section,which applies generally to any violation of the consumer credit reporting agencies act.yet congress did not except that provision from the preemptive effect of the fcra according to the lin court,congress did not do so because that statute is inconsistent with the enforcement scheme of congress under fcra d,in matters relating to furnishers of consumer credit information.congress intended to have exclusive authority to enforce such claims through the federal agencies and officials and the state officials identified in that section.lin,at roybal equifax,supra,d at,fn.t here is no private right of action under section a.california civil code section a does not itself provide for a private right of action.rather,the language which affords consumers a private right of action is found in california civil code sections g and.since only section a is excepted from preemption but not sections g or,the court finds that no private right of action exists under section a.see also gorman wolpoff abramson,llp,supra,d at,revd.
similar reasoning was recently embraced by the court of appeal in liceaga debt recovery solutions,llc th,d,which was decided the week before oral argument in the case at bar w e conclude that the exemption as to the ccraa must be limited to the first subdivision,a,of civil code section.we can find nothing in the writing of section of the reform act or its legislative history that shows that the inclusion in the legislation of subdivision a of civil code section was the result of error.had congress intended the entire ccraa to be exempt,it would have certainly omitted the reference to subdivision a,or,in the least,listed some if not all of the other subdivisions as being a part of the exemption.id.at,d.
in a case decided several days after oral argument in this case,however,the ninth circuit rejected the preemption analysis in these cases.in gorman wolpoff abramson,llp,the court of appeals reversed the district court holding that the plaintiff section,subdivision a,claim against the furnisher of credit information was preempted because the private right of action to enforce that statutory provision is found in sections not specifically exempted from the federal preemption provision.first,the court rejected the district court suggestion section,subdivision a,could be enforced by state officials,explaining that the authorization for such enforcement,if it exists at all,almost surely lies in provisions also not specifically excluded by the fcra preemption provision.the district court analysis would thus lead to the conclusion that congress explicitly retained the portions of the california statutory scheme that create obligations,without leaving in place any enforcement mechanism.id.at,wl.more significantly,the court emphasized the affirmative preemption language referred only to imposition of a requirement or prohibition with respect to subjects regulated by.civil code sections,subdivision g,and,however merely provide a vehicle for private parties to enforce other sections,which do impose requirements and prohibitions.in other words,congress had no need to include these enforcement provisions in the b f exception to save the california statutory scheme from preemption by the affirmative language of the preemption provision.by the plain language of the statute,therefore,these sections are not preempted by b f.id.at,wl.
the trial court found the lin court analysis perfectly persuasive.like the ninth circuit,we do not.first,the enforcement scheme of congress under d,upon which the lin court relied,concerns only violations of a the duty to provide accurate all possible claims against furnishers of consumer credit information.d,as it read when lin was decided,provided,subsection a of this section shall be enforced exclusively under section of this title by the federal agencies and officials and the state officials identified in that section.italics added.as discussed,b,which imposes a duty to investigate the accuracy of reported information upon receiving notice of a dispute,expressly allows for private causes of action against furnishers of credit information if the requirements of that section are otherwise met.accordingly,it is simply incorrect to conclude congress intended to limit to federal and state officials the enforcement of all obligations imposed by the fcra on the furnishers of credit information.although amended in and now phrased in somewhat different language,d continues to restrict enforcement of a to certain federal agencies and officials and designated state officials,but imposes no similar limitation on the enforcement of b.
the court of appeal in liceaga debt recovery solutions,llc,supra,th at page,similarly suggested congress intended the exception to preemption for actions under section,subdivision a,to be enforced only by california chief law enforcement officer or by an official or agency designated by the state,not by private actions,citing as support for this conclusion c.but that section simply authorizes state officials to enforce the provisions of the fcra itself,with certain conditions and limitations,in federal or state court.the sole reference to state law remedies is a savings clause,in addition to such other remedies as are provided under state law,which in no way precludes the continued viability of a private right of action when recognized by state law.
second,as the ninth circuit explained in gorman,civil code section itself does not impose any requirement or prohibition it merely authorizes a consumer who has been injured as a result of a violation of the consumer credit reporting agencies act to bring an action in a court of appropriate jurisdiction against the person responsible for the injury.stated slightly differently,unlike section substantive law code section is procedural only and therefore is not covered by the preemption language of b f.gorman wolpoff abramson,llp,supra.accordingly,there was no need and no reason for congress to specify it was not preempted.see a e xcept as otherwise provided in subsection b and c of this section,this subchapter does not annul,alter,affect,or exempt any person subject to the provisions of this title from complying with the laws of any states with respect to the collection,distribution or use of any information on consumers.
to be sure,as the trial court observed,a preempts not only state law requirements and prohibitions,but also laws that are inconsistent with any provision of this subchapter.see also liceaga debt recovery solutions,llc,supra,th at,d subdivision a of section of the reform act unequivocally provides that any state law that is not consistent with the fcra is preempted.since the fcra has certain preconditions to proceeding with an action against a furnisher of credit information,and the california statute does not,a clear inconsistency would exist.but the trial court failed to complete the quotation from a,which continues,and then only to the extent of the inconsistency.this express statutory command to limit the scope of preemption,combined with the general presumption against preemption repeatedly articulated by the united states supreme court,particularly where federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d,belies the trial court conclusion recognizing a private cause of action under section would be inconsistent with the fcra purported prohibition of a private right of action.indeed,in medtronic,supra,at.at the supreme court recognized that federal law preempting state statutory or common law requirements different from,or in addition to,the requirements imposed by federal law does not prevent a state from providing a damages remedy for claims premised on a violation of federal regulations the state duties in such a case parallel,rather than add to,federal requirements.similarly,because congress itself has recognized that the requirements of section,subdivision a,are fully consistent with the obligations imposed by federal law,nothing in the fcra prevents california from providing a damages remedy for sanai claims based on a violation of that statute.see gorman wolpoff abramson llp,supra,at,wl e xempting specific state statutes from preemption is very unusual in federal statutes.to suppose congress would do so for little or no would be the case if the private cause of action under california law were simply not plausible.
the trial court did not commit reversible error in striking sanai memorandum of costs after judgment and awarding attorney fees under code of civil procedure section 
finding that sanai had failed to properly serve the various corporate defendants because he had not identified any individual to receive service and that his request for nearly in attorney fees should have been made by noticed motion,not claimed in a memorandum of costs,the trial court granted the saltz parties motion to strike the memorandum of costs after judgment filed by sanai based on his purported efforts to enforce this court award of costs on appeal in sanai saltz,supra,wl.thereafter,the court granted the saltz parties motion for an order requiring judgment creditor to execute,file and record acknowledgments of satisfaction of judgment in full,based on their payment of the costs on appeal,and imposed statutory of against sanai pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision e.following further briefing,the court awarded the saltz parties in attorney fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section.
on appeal sanai contends the trial court order striking his april,memorandum of costs after judgment was void and,as a result,all subsequent orders predicated on that initial void order,including the award of attorney fees to the saltz parties,are also invalid.sanai argument,in substance,is that the saltz parties had only until april,to file a motion to tax costs under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c.because no motion to tax costs was made within that time,the costs he claimed including in attorney fees were allowed code civ,subd.d and added by operation of law to the judgment for costs on appeal previously obtained from the court code civ,subd.a.according to sanai,the motion to strike the memorandum of costs after judgment,initially filed by the saltz parties on may,was untimely the renewed motion filed on june,was not only untimely but also an improper motion for reconsideration under code of civil procedure section.in addition,sanai asserts the trial court had no authority to strike the memorandum of costs after judgment once it had been added by operation of law to the judgment.finally,as to the award of attorney fees to the saltz parties in connection with their successful motion for an order requiring judgment creditor to execute,file and record acknowledgments of satisfaction of judgment,sanai argues that motion,too,constituted an improper motion for reconsideration under code of civil procedure section.
a.the memorandum of costs after judgment improperly sought to recover attorney fees as restitution 
in connection with his two appeals decided in sanai saltz,supra,wl on june,sanai filed motions requesting restitution under code of civil procedure section to restore him to the position he occupied on january,when the notices of appeal from the trial court denial of the special motion to strike were filed specifically,sanai requested this court to order udr to restore all funds it had obtained from him directly or by execution or garnishment,plus interest at the legal rate,and to order the trial court to hold a hearing to determine the reasonable value of the time sanai has spent in the litigation and award him the value of this lost time,as well as recovery of all costs and expenses.in declining to order restitution in the first instance on appeal,we held an appropriate order of restitution requires proper findings based on an adequate record on remand the trial court is to consider sanai request for restitution and,if necessary,to conduct an accounting of all sums paid by any of the parties subsequent to january,as a result of sanctions orders,fee or costs awards whether in the trial court or on appeal or otherwise,to the extent those payments were based in part on orders entered after january,and to order reimbursement of those sums as appropriate.
notwithstanding our instructions that any restitution award be based on an adequate record and supported by findings,in his memorandum of costs after judgment sanai claimed entitlement to in attorney fees sanai attempt to avoid a hearing on the merits of his restitution request not only contravened our express directions but also violated code of civil procedure sections and,which govern the items properly recoverable by a judgment creditor as costs of enforcing a judgment.section,subdivision a,permits recovery of attorney fees as part of a memorandum of costs after judgment only to the extent permitted by section.that section,in turn,authorizes attorney fees as a cost of enforcing a judgment only if the underlying judgment includes an award of attorney fees to the judgment creditor the judgment in this case was the cost award to sanai following his successful appeal in sanai saltz,supra,wl.no attorney fees were awarded.moreover,the fees sanai claimed in his memorandum of costs after judgment did not even purport to relate to his efforts to enforce that costs simply reflected his unresolved demand for restitution.
because the memorandum of costs after judgment was essentially an improper attempt to recover attorney fees not authorized by code of civil procedure section only in other enforcement costs were included in the memorandum,the saltz parties argue the memorandum was invalid and their motion to strike the memorandum was a permissible procedural vehicle to attack the defective filing.although this argument appears to be well taken,we need not resolve this particular dispute between the parties because,even if the saltz parties should have denominated their motion as one to tax costs rather than a motion to strike,any error in this regard did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to consider the issue on the merits see people american contractors indemnity cal th,d,w hen a statute authorizes a prescribed procedure,and the court acts contrary to the authority thus conferred,it has exceeded its jurisdiction.citation.when a court has fundamental jurisdiction,but acts in excess of its jurisdiction,its act or judgment is merely voidable,nor does it require reversal of the orders actually entered.see cal,art.vi,n o judgment shall be set aside,or new trial granted,in any cause,for any error as to any matter of procedure,unless after an examination of the entire cause,including the evidence,the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice code civ,n o judgment,decision,or decree shall be reversed or affected by reason of any error,ruling,instruction,or defect,unless it shall appear from the record that such error,ruling,instruction,or defect was prejudicial,and also by reason that such error,ruling,instruction,or defect,the said party complaining or appealing sustained and suffered substantial injury,and that a different result would have been probable if such error,ruling,instruction,or defect had not occurred or existed.
we also reject sanai challenge to the timing of the saltz parties motion to strike.the trial court ruled sanai service of his memorandum of costs after judgment was defective as to the various corporate defendants although not as to saltz personally and expressly found sanai intentionally altered court documents to show that certain individuals were served on behalf of corporate defendants.against a background of repeated accusations by both sides of improper service and deceptive behavior,the court directed the saltz parties to file a properly noticed motion to strike the memorandum to bring the issues before the court.the saltz parties did just that.under these circumstances,no reversible error occurred.sanai does not raise any substantive challenge to the trial court ruling on the merits of the motion to strike the memorandum of costs after judgment.
no violation of code of civil procedure section occurred 
sanai arguments concerning code of civil procedure section similarly lack merit.as to the saltz parties motion to strike the memorandum of costs after judgment,the trial court initially granted the motion,then vacated its order following sanai objection to the manner and timing of notice.however,as discussed,in doing so the court expressly invited the saltz parties to file a noticed motion to strike the memorandum of costs.the subsequent filing of such a motion at the direction of the court and with its explicit authorization does not constitute an impermissible motion for reconsideration.see le francois goel cal th,d,see also farber bay view terrace homeowners th,d here,the trial court indicated it wanted to reconsider the fee issue when it denied the first motion without prejudice,so code of civil procedure section is inapplicable.denial of a motion without prejudice impliedly invites the moving party to renew the motion at a later date,when he can correct the deficiency that led to the denial.
as to the saltz parties motion for attorney fees in connection with their motion to execute satisfaction of judgments,sanai objected to the initial motion papers because they failed to correctly identify the statutory basis for the attorney fee request referring only to code of civil procedure section,subdivision e,allowing an award of damages if the judgment creditor refuses to execute a satisfaction of judgment without just cause,rather than also citing to section,which authorizes an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in an action concerning satisfaction of judgment.the trial court,after granting the saltz parties the substantive relief they requested,ordering sanai to execute acknowledgements of satisfaction of judgment and awarding statutory of,continued the matter for further briefing on the issue of attorney fees,including the amount properly awarded to the saltz parties.further briefing at the request of the court,even if it included a renewed motion correcting the statutory basis for the application for attorney fees also filed at the suggestion of the court,does not implicate code of civil procedure section.because sanai has advanced no substantive challenge to the court award of fees or to the amount of the award,that order is affirmed.
disposition 
the orders granting judgment on the pleadings with respect to cyrus sanai cause of action under civil code section and granting judgment on the pleadings without leave to amend as to his cause of action under b,as well as the judgment in favor of harvey saltz and first advantage corporation,are reversed.the order granting judgment on the pleadings with respect to sanai state common law causes of action is affirmed 
the orders striking sanai memorandum of costs after judgment and awarding attorney fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section are affirmed.the order awarding attorney fees to saltz and first advantage corporation as the prevailing parties on the fair credit reporting act claim is reversed in light of our decision reversing the judgment in this matter.sanai request for attorney fees is denied.
the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion all parties are to bear their own costs on appeal.
in papers filed in support of his motion for a preliminary injunction,sanai acknowledged that he initially believed the august,letter contained a typographical error,but declared that,after he received the second letter taped to his apartment door and considered news reports regarding the worldwide financial crisis that was then occurring,he concluded the rental rate stated in the letters was correct and the apartment owners were seeking to retain their better tenants by unilaterally offering to lower the rent.
although the trial court held udr had failed to make the required showing that the challenged causes of action arose from protected activity,the court also expressed the view that sanai had not demonstrated a probability of prevailing on his claims.see code civ,subd.b.
although udr did not file a petition for writ of supersedeas to stay proceedings in the trial court pending resolution of its appeal from denial of the special motion to strike,on january,months after from the trial court denial of his motion for a preliminary injunction and after both the appeal and had been fully briefed,sanai filed his own petition for writ of supersedeas and request for immediate temporary stay,arguing that proceedings in the trial court could moot the issues raised by his.that petition was summarily denied on january.
sanai second amended complaint alleged nine causes of action for slander,libel,intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,negligent interference with prospective economic advantage,intentional infliction of emotional distress,negligent infliction of emotional distress,violation of civil code section et reports made to a consumer credit reporting agency,violation of civil code section reports made by a consumer credit reporting agency and breach of written contract.the first seven causes of action named udr,saltz and the irvine entities as defendants only udr was named as a defendant in the eighth cause of action irvine apartment communities,and irvine apartment communities,llc were the only defendants named in the ninth cause of action for breach of written contract.
in the interests of justice we also ordered all further proceedings to be heard before a trial judge other than the judges whose orders were affected by our decision.code civ,subd.c.
sanai subsequently explained his inclusion of an award of attorney fees in the memorandum of costs after judgment by noting this court had directed the trial court in sanai saltz,supra,wl to consider on remand his request for restitution,which had initially been presented to us.
yet another clash erupted over sanai procurement of an abstract of judgment in october for the full amount refl
