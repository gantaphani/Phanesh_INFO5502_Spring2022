in,congress enacted the financial institutions reform,recovery,and enforcement act of,which is often referred to by the acronym firrea,and is codified at title united states code section d neman commercial capital bank th.firrea was designed to provide for takeovers of failed federally insured banking institutions and to provide a smooth mechanism for the rehabilitation of such institutions and for the disposal of claims against them.ibid.firrea is a public program that adjusts the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.citations.resolution trust ford motor credit cir.it alters contractual rights in order to stem the disruption of banking services within communities,lessen the costs of bank liquidation,and restore public confidence in the nation banking system.ibid.so,on the one hand,a landlord who leases premises to a bank takes the risk that the bank may fail and firrea may limit his or her remedies with respect to any damages suffered due to the bank failure,but on the other hand,the blow to the community is softened because the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic as receiver of the failed bank has the tools to find a successor bank to take over the deposits of the failed bank and continue providing banking services to the depositors.
firrea gives the fdic broad powers in resolving the affairs of a failed bank.this includes the express power to repudiate,or disaffirm,contracts to which the failed bank is a party,including the lease pursuant to which the failed bank occupies its premises.firrea also expressly provides that,once the lease is disaffirmed,the landlord has no claim against the fdic for future rent,even if the lease contains an acceleration clause.e b qi fdic d,accord,resolution trust ford motor credit,supra,at.this means that the landlord can not claim an asset of the failed bank,which has become an asset of the fdic as receiver of the failed bank,to satisfy a claim for future rent,even if the asset has been pledged as security for the performance of the lease.resolution trust ford motor credit,supra,at.
boiled to its essence,this case presents two questions if the fdic has transferred assets and liabilities of the failed bank to another bank,can the landlord then seize the pledged asset because the fdic no longer holds it is the answer any different if the asset in question is a bank deposit serving as collateral for a letter of credit,which in turn secures the performance of the lease here,we answer each of these questions in the negative.to permit a landlord to effectively seize the collateral underlying a letter of credit after the fdic has disaffirmed the lease and transferred the collateral to a successor bank would be to hamstring the fdic in its efforts to wind up the affairs of a failed bank and promote stability in the banking system.see resolution trust ford motor credit,supra,at.
in the matter before us,after the lease was disaffirmed,landlord piedmont operating partnership,piedmont had no right to effectively seize a deposit belonging to california bank trust california bank,the transferee of the assets of the failed bank,by drawing down on the letter of credit which was secured by that deposit.piedmont had no claim against california bank,which had not assumed the lease,and it had no claim for future rent against the fdic as receiver.we reverse the judgment in favor of piedmont.
in addition,we hold that,based on the undisputed facts,california bank was entitled to a judgment in its favor on its california uniform commercial code section,subdivision a breach of warranty claim against piedmont,as a matter of law.therefore,pursuant to california uniform commercial code section,subdivision e,california bank is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees and other expenses of litigation.the trial court shall determine the amount of the award on remand.
piedmont leased certain office space to alliance bank.alliance bank provided piedmont with a standby letter of credit as security for the lease.union bank of california,union bank was the issuer of the letter of credit and alliance bank put on deposit at union bank as collateral for the letter of credit.
in february,the commissioner of financial institutions of the state of california closed alliance bank and appointed the fdic as receiver.pursuant to a purchase and asset assumption agreement,the fdic sold the assets of alliance bank,as is,to california bank.alliance bank deposit at union bank was among the assets sold to california bank.
by letter of may,the fdic as receiver of alliance bank notified union bank that,pursuant to title united states code section e,it was disaffirming the agreement between union bank and alliance bank concerning the letter of credit.the fdic demanded that the collateral for the letter of credit be released to it immediately.however,union bank did not deliver the funds to the fdic.
on may,the fdic disaffirmed the lease.at the time the lease was disaffirmed,the monthly rent of was current.nonetheless,the fdic informed piedmont of its right to submit a proof of claim with respect to any damages suffered due to the disaffirmance.piedmont thereafter filed a claim for for future rent for the period following the lease disaffirmance.
in addition to filing the claim,piedmont presented a sight draft to union bank,to draw down the letter of credit.union bank paid the proceeds of the letter of credit to piedmont and debited california bank account accordingly.
california bank later commenced litigation against both piedmont and union bank,alleging that piedmont did not have the right to draw upon the letter of credit after the fdic had disaffirmed the lease and that union bank did not have the right to honor presentation of the sight draft after it had received a disaffirmance notice from the fdic.california bank represents that it settled with union bank before trial.union bank was dismissed from the case.
the court entered judgment in favor of piedmont and awarded piedmont nearly in attorney fees and costs.california bank appeals.
discussiona.trial and judgment 
in its first amended complaint,california bank asserted four causes of action.it sought declaratory relief in the form of an order stating that,after the disaffirmance of the lease and the letter of credit,piedmont did not have a right to draw down the letter of credit and union bank did not have a right to honor the presentation of the sight draft,and that california bank was entitled to recover the.california bank also asserted a cause of action for violation of business professions code section,contending that the draw upon the letter of credit despite the disaffirmance of the lease was an unlawful,fraudulent unfair business practice,and a cause of action for violation of commercial code sections,subdivision e and,subdivision a.finally california bank asserted a cause of action for unjust enrichment.
the matter was tried without a jury.the court observed that each of california bank causes of action was predicated on the assertion that title united states code section e b applied to the facts of the case so as to limit piedmont damages.it quoted from title united states code section e,pertaining to leases under which the failed bank was the lessee.
title united states code section e a provides in pertinent part if the receiver disaffirms or repudiates a lease under which the insured depository institution was the lessee,the receiver shall not be liable for any damages other than damages determined pursuant to subparagraph b for the disaffirmance or repudiation of such lease.section e b provides in pertinent part notwithstanding subparagraph a,the lessor under a lease to which such subparagraph applies shall i be entitled to the contractual rent accruing before the later of the date i the notice of disaffirmance or repudiation is mailed or ii the disaffirmance or repudiation becomes effective ii have no claim for damages under any acceleration clause or other penalty provision in the lease and iii have a claim for any unpaid rent,subject to all appropriate offsets and defenses,due as of the date of the appointment 
the court held that title united states code section e b was not designed to protect third parties such as california bank and that california bank could not use the statute to claim the proceeds of the letter of credit for itself.it further held that piedmont had been within its rights in making a call on the letter of credit.consequently,the court held,each of california bank causes of action failed.
preliminary matter 
the trial court was correct that the cornerstone of california bank case,upon which all causes of action are built,is the assertion that piedmont was precluded by title united states code section e from collecting the after the fdic disaffirmed the lease.as noted above,california bank sought declaratory relief in the form of a determination that after the fdic sent out disaffirmance notices with respect to the lease and the letter of credit,piedmont had no right to draw down the letter of credit and union bank had no right to honor the presentation of the sight draft,and that california bank was entitled to recover the.in the parties joint list of controverted issues,california bank identified the effect of title united states code section e upon various rights of piedmont as among the central issues at trial.in addition,california bank addressed the effects of title united states code section e extensively in its trial brief.piedmont did the same.and,as we have observed,the trial court ruled upon the effects of title united states code section e.
on appeal,piedmont says california bank has failed to present argument about the declaratory relief cause of action in its opening brief and thus has waived the right to argue the court erred in its ruling on that cause of action.however,we observe that california bank first substantive argument,comprising pages,falls under the topic heading piedmont has no right to the proceeds of the letter of credit because it was not entitled to any damages after the fdic disaffirmed the lease.its second substantive argument,comprising seven pages,is found under the topic heading the trial court incorrectly found that california bank could not recover the because it is not the fdic.the arguments are based on title united states code section e and cases interpreting the statute.california bank clearly attacked the court interpretation of that statute and the related cases,even though it did not choose to utilize a topic heading stating the court erred in denying california bank request for declaratory relief in its favor.california bank has not failed to challenge to the court ruling on the issues framed by declaratory relief cause of action.
furthermore,piedmont has had every opportunity to respond to california bank arguments about title united states code section e and related case law,and indeed has done so.there is no reason to conclude either that california bank has waived a challenge to the ruling on the issues framed by the declaratory relief cause of action or that piedmont has been prejudiced by the manner in which california bank presented its argument in its opening brief.reichardt hoffman th.in short,the court determined the issues of law framed by the declaratory relief cause of action adversely to california bank and those determinations of law are properly challenged on appeal.
title united states code section e 
introduction 
firrea grants the fdic as receiver the discretion and power to dispose of assets and liabilities of failed financial institutions.citations.specifically,the firrea grants the the authority to disaffirm or repudiate any contract or lease to which the failed institution on whose behalf it acts is a party if it determines,in its discretion,that performance of the lease would be burdensome and that such a disaffirmance or repudiation would promote the orderly administration of the institution affairs.citations.qi fdic,supra,d at,fn.omitted accord,resolution trust ford motor credit,supra,at.title united states code section s ubsection e b governs the receiver overall liability for damages when it repudiates a lease.citation.qi fdic,supra,d at.i t is quite clear that the firrea does not permit a lessor recovery for future rents or penalties.citations.ibid.put another way,the firrea clearly prohibits recovery based on penalties stemming from the repudiation of leases.e b ii providing that the lessor has no claim for damages under any acceleration clause or other penalty provision for disaffirmance or repudiation of the lease.qi fdic,supra,d at.
title united states code section e notwithstanding,piedmont claims it is entitled to damages for future rent.piedmont further contends it was entitled to draw down the letter of credit and effectively seize california bank deposit at union bank,because it had a right to the collateral securing the performance of the lease.in assessing these claims,we first look to cases addressing the effect of lease disaffirmance upon pledged assets.
effect on pledged assets 
resolution trust ford motor credit,supra,upon which california bank relies,is instructive.there,the resolution trust corporation rtc as receiver repudiated certain leases pursuant to which the failed savings and loan association had leased equipment from ford motor credit corporation ford.the savings and loan association obligations under the leases were secured by certain pledged assets.ford claimed that it had a right to utilize the pledged assets to satisfy its damages claim in an amount greater than the accrued rent.id.at.in the receiver declaratory judgment action,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the receiver.ibid.
the eleventh circuit affirmed.resolution trust ford motor credit,supra,at.it rejected the proposition that title united states code section e b only limited the liability of the receiver,but did not block recovery against property in which the lessor has a perfected security interest.resolution trust ford motor credit,supra,at.it stated that the proposition was clearly contrary to the plain language of the statute.ibid.the court continued section e b states that a lessor shall have no claim under any acceleration or penalty clause.it does not state that a lessor has no claim against the receiver under an acceleration clause,but may have such a claim against any pledged collateral.ford simply can not recover future rents from any party or against any property.ibid,original italics.
the court acknowledged that the lease disaffirmance had caused an economic impact on ford.resolution trust ford motor credit,supra,at.however,it stated that the impact was not one of constitutional dimension and that the receiver lease disaffirmance had simply deprived ford of future rent.ibid.the court observed that firrea is a public program that adjusts the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.citations.id.at.it noted that firrea alters contractual rights in order to stem the disruption of banking services within communities,lessen the costs of bank liquidation,and restore public confidence in the nation banking system.ibid.
according to california bank,resolution trust ford motor credit,supra,shows that once the fdic disaffirmed the alliance bank lease,piedmont had no claim for future rent or for any damages arising out of an acceleration clause in the lease,and lost any claim to the proceeds of the letter of credit.piedmont,on the other hand,states that california bank reliance on resolution trust ford motor credit,supra,is misplaced.it contends that the case is wholly inapposite because it involved pledged assets,rather than a letter of credit.it ignores the language of the case stating that,after lease disaffirmance,a landlord has no claim for future rents,or sums owing based on an acceleration clause,and simply can not recover future rents from any party or against any property.id.at.
california bank also cites unisys finance resolution trust cir.in unisys,the rtc as receiver disaffirmed an equipment lease under which the failed financial institution was the lessee.the lessor of the equipment conceded that it could not sue the receiver for the loss of future rents.however,it claimed that it could nonetheless satisfy its claim for future rents out of the securities that had been pledged as collateral for the lease.id.at.the court rejected the argument.it stated that under e,the lessor damages claim was completely extinguished except for back rent and that w ith the claim gone,any basis for enforcing a security interest was gone with it.unisys finance resolution trust,supra,at.it further stated you must have a claim before you can look to the collateral for its repayment.ibid.in other words,a lien is a parasitic on a claim.if the claim disappears poof the lien is gone.ibid.as the court aptly pointed out,the lessor real gripe was not the loss of its security interest it was the loss of the claim that the security interest secured.id.at.
well put.here,piedmont real gripe is the fuss over whether it was proper to proceed against the letter of credit,but the fact that the fdic disaffirmed the lease and piedmont thereupon lost its right either to collect future rents or to make a claim for the same.but this is a point of law set forth in a federal statutory scheme that adjusts the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good.citations.resolution trust ford motor credit,supra,at.it is not a matter we could control even if our view of the equities were different from that of congress.
as we see it,unisys finance resolution trust,supra,just as resolution trust ford motor credit,supra,makes clear that a lessor whose lease is disaffirmed does not have the right to proceed against the collateral securing the performance of the lease,in order to satisfy a claim for future rents.but piedmont insists that unisys is distinguishable.
piedmont emphasizes that in unisys finance resolution trust,supra,the pledged collateral belonged to the receivership estate,not a successor bank.piedmont argues the holding in unisys protected the interests of the taxpayers,but there is no taxpayer asset at stake in the matter before us.this argument is unconvincing.
piedmont cites no authority supporting either the proposition that the taxpayers are the owners of failed bank assets or the proposition that they are responsible for paying off creditor claims if the assets of the failed bank are insufficient to cover them.rather,a failed bank receivership is akin to a bankruptcy proceeding and the receiver functions much like a trustee in bankruptcy.unisys finance resolution trust,supra,at.the receiver has an obligation to conduct the operations of the receivership in a manner which maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of failed bank assets that come into its hands.citation.tsemetzin coast federal savings loan th.piedmont has not shown that the taxpayers are disadvantaged if the fdic determines that the best way to maximize the return is to sell certain assets and liabilities to another bank.however,it is apparent that if a landlord who was not permitted to seize a pledged asset in the hands of the fdic as receiver were permitted to seize that asset as soon as the fdic transferred it to a healthy bank,the fdic options would be limited and it would be hamstrung in its efforts to maximize the return on the failed bank assets.this would not be consistent with the goals of firrea.
effect on letters of credit 
piedmont also says there is a fundamental difference between what it calls ordinary security and letters of credit.it contends that the independence principle applicable to letters of credit compels a different outcome in this case than in unisys finance resolution trust,supra.piedmont cites san diego gas electric bank leumi th and federal deposit ins.united states trust.in support of its position.
as explained in san diego gas electric bank leumi,supra,th,three contractual relationships exist in a letter of credit transaction.citations.underlying the letter of credit transaction is the contract between the bank customer and the beneficiary of the letter of credit,which consists of the business agreement between these parties.then there is the contractual arrangement between the bank and its customer whereby the bank agrees to issue the letter of credit,and the customer agrees to repay the bank for the amounts paid under the letter of credit finally,there is the contractual relationship between the bank and the beneficiary of the letter of credit created by the letter of credit itself.the bank agrees to honor the beneficiary drafts or demands for payment which conform to the terms of the letter of credit.citations.citation.although the relationship between the issuer and beneficiary of a letter of credit is often loosely described as contractual,this is an inaccurate characterization.id.at.it is better to characterize the letter of credit as an undertaking and so avoid the implication that contract principles might apply to it.citations.ibid.
under the independence principle,the letter of credit is independent from the underlying contract between the issuing bank customer here alliance bank and the beneficiary of the letter of credit here piedmont.san diego gas electric bank leumi,supra,th at.absent fraud,the issuer must pay upon proper presentment regardless of any defenses the applicant for the letter of credit may have against the beneficiary arising from the underlying transaction.citation.thus,the issuer of a letter of credit is never entitled to defend against payment based on extraneous defenses which might have been available to the primary obligor.id.at.the rule of independence is based on two policy considerations.first,the issuing bank can assume no liability for the performance of the underlying contract because it has no control over making the underlying contract or over selection of the beneficiary citation.second,the letter of credit would lose its commercial vitality if,before honoring drafts,the issuing bank were obliged to look beyond the terms of the letter of credit to the underlying contractual controversy between its customer and the beneficiary citation.citation.ibid.
piedmont says the principles enunciated in unisys finance resolution trust,supra,which did not involve a letter of credit,have no application here because,in a letter of credit context such as the one before us,the liability of the issuer is independent of the obligations between the issuer customer,on the one hand,and the beneficiary of the letter of credit,on the other.however,the question of union bank liability under the letter of credit based on the independence principle is not before us.rather,our inquiry pertains to the rights of piedmont,not the obligations of union bank.simply put,whether an issuer is bound to honor a draw upon a letter of credit is a different issue from whether the beneficiary of the letter of credit is legally entitled to retain the proceeds of the draw.furthermore,san diego gas electric bank leumi,supra,th at was not a bank receivership case and did not address the effect of the fdic disaffirmance of either a lease or an agreement between a failed bank and an issuer of a letter of credit.here,as we recall,the fdic disaffirmed both.
so,we turn to piedmont next authority,federal deposit ins.united states trust,supra.in that case,the fdic became the receiver of a failed bank that had leased certain equipment.a letter of credit secured the performance of the lease and the failed bank deposit at the issuing bank served as collateral for the letter of credit.after the failed bank was placed in receivership,the equipment lessor presented a sight draft to the issuing bank,seeking to draw upon the letter of credit.nine days later,the fdic disaffirmed the equipment lease,the letter of credit,and the pledge agreement between the failed bank and the issuing bank.it also filed an action seeking to enjoin the lessor from receiving payment under the letter of credit.id.at.
the court addressed the independence principle in the receivership context by analogy to bankruptcy proceedings.it stated if the customer goes into bankruptcy after the letter has been issued,but before it has been drawn upon,the issuer must pay despite the fact that the customer will not be able to pay the issuer.the same would be true if the customer had repudiated the contract of reimbursement.since these are the very risks customer insolvency or unwillingness to pay which the beneficiary sought to avoid by demanding the issuance of the letter of credit,it should not be surprising that the issuer can not assert them as defenses against the beneficiary.citations.federal deposit ins.united states trust,supra.at.the court continued given these considerations,courts have consistently recognized that,in the absence of fraud,a court should not enjoin payment of a letter of credit.citations.id.at,fn.omitted.
consistent with this general rule,the court declined to enjoin payment under the letter of credit.federal deposit ins.united states trust,supra.at.in so doing,it rejected the fdic argument that the issuing bank should be enjoined from making payment because title united states code section e b precluded the lessor claim for future rents.the court stated that the lessor was not seeking to enforce its rights under the lease,but was seeking to enforce its rights against the issuing bank under the letter of credit.federal deposit ins.united states trust,supra.at.
however,in the matter before us,neither the obligations of union bank as the issuer of the letter of credit nor the rights of piedmont against union bank are at issue.the question is not whether the independence principle would preclude the issuance of an injunction to stop union bank from making payment under the letter of credit.the only question before us is whether piedmont is entitled to keep the it effectively seized already.federal deposit ins.united states trust,supra.is inapposite.
we look instead at resolution trust united trust fund,cir,which is more nearly on point.in that case,pioneer federal savings bank old pioneer provided a million letter of credit to secure its obligations under its lease,and pledged million in performing mortgages as collateral in support of the letter of credit.the landlord,in turn,applied for a loan from financial federal savings and loan association of dade county financial federal and assigned the letter of credit to financial federal as collateral for the loan.id.at.a few months later,the landlord assigned its rights to both the lease and the letter of credit to liberty bell realty associates liberty bell.id.at.
the rtc was appointed receiver of old pioneer and substantially all of the assets and liabilities of old pioneer were transferred to a newly created financial institution also called pioneer federal savings bank new pioneer.the rtc,as conservator of new pioneer,did not disaffirm the lease.about a year after old pioneer was placed into receivership,new pioneer also was placed into receivership.the rtc then entered into a purchase and assumption agreement whereby great western bank purchased some of the assets and assumed some of the liabilities of new pioneer.however,great western bank did not assume the lease.the rtc,as receiver of new pioneer,ultimately disaffirmed the lease.resolution trust united trust fund,supra,at.
the district court denied the rtc request to enjoin a draw upon the letter of credit.however,the proceeds of the letter of credit were deposited into an escrow account pending court proceedings.resolution trust united trust fund,supra,at.that being the case,the eleventh circuit observed whether the draw was proper or not is moot at this point.rather,the right to the proceeds of that letter,not the right to draw on the letter,is the issue now before the court.id.at,fn.omitted.the court continued once the proceeds of a letter of credit have been drawn down,the underlying contracts become pertinent in determining which parties have a right to those proceeds.id.at.
the eleventh circuit did not resolve which party was entitled to the proceeds of the letter of credit,inasmuch as the proper interpretation of the contractual obligations underlying the letter of credit had to be determined by the district court in the first instance.resolution trust united trust fund,supra,at.it stated that one significant issue for determination on remand was whether the letter of credit only served as security for the performance of the lease obligations or whether it also served as security for repayment of the financial federal loan,independent of any default in the lease ibid.at fn.
however,the eleventh circuit was specific as to one thing.there was no claim to the proceeds of the letter of credit to the extent that the letter of credit served as security for the performance of lease obligations.the court concluded that because the rtc had the statutory right to disaffirm the lease,the disaffirmance did not constitute a breach of the lease.it also observed that the rtc had paid all rent through the date of disaffirmance.resolution trust united trust fund,supra,at.it further stated a secured creditor only has rights in the collateral equal to the amount of the creditor claim.once that claim is satisfied,the lien is of no further consequence.citation.section e limits damages under the lease to rents accrued before a valid repudiation.citation.thus,liberty bell and financial federal have no remaining claim pursuant to the lease.citation.the district court on remand will have to construe the underlying contractual obligations to determine whether either liberty bell or financial federal has a claim to the proceeds of the letter of credit independent of and absent a default under the lease.resolution trust united trust fund,supra,at,fn.omitted.
important to the resolution of the matters before us,the court in resolution trust united trust fund,supra,stated to the extent that the proceeds of the letter of credit were to serve as damages under the lease,future rents,financial federal is not entitled to any of the proceeds of the letter of credit because the lease was properly repudiated and there are no remaining damages under the lease.id.at.it stated that the district court on remand would have to construe the underlying contracts to determine whether financial federal had any claim to the letter of credit proceeds independent of and absent a default under the lease.ibid.
applying resolution trust united trust fund,supra,to the facts before us,we see that the disaffirmance of the alliance bank lease did not constitute a breach of the lease and did not give rise to a claim of damages for future rent,and that piedmont did not have a claim to the proceeds of the letter of credit.that being the case,piedmont is wrongfully in possession of the that lawfully belongs to california bank,which acquired the deposit from the fdic.
piedmont heartily disagrees with this analysis.it focuses on the portion of resolution trust united trust fund,supra,stating that the district court would have to interpret the underlying contracts to determine who should keep the proceeds of the letter of credit.piedmont contends that california bank can not be entitled to the proceeds of the letter of credit because it is not a party to any of the underlying contracts and thus has no claim under any of those contracts.however,piedmont overlooks the fact that alliance bank was a party to the underlying contracts,the fdic as receiver stepped into the shoes of alliance bank d a,and the fdic transferred its rights in the deposit to california bank,which thereupon acquired a claim of rights to the funds.piedmont also ignores the fact that the court in resolution trust united trust fund,supra,made perfectly clear there was no entitlement to the letter of credit proceeds based upon the lease disaffirmance.id.at.consequently,piedmont has no claim to the letter of credit proceeds based on the disaffirmance of the alliance bank lease.
effect of transfer of assets 
piedmont also emphasizes that in the matter before us it is california bank,not the fdic,that is challenging piedmont rights under the letter of credit.it notes that neither resolution trust united trust fund,supra,nor any of the other cases california bank cites holds that title united states code section e limits the rights of a landlord a bank that acquires assets from the fdic.it is equally true,however,that none of the cases piedmont cites holds that a landlord,who would have no right to the proceeds of a letter of credit if the fdic remained in possession of the security therefor,nonetheless could claim the security once the fdic transferred it to another financial institution.as we have already stated,that would be contrary to all the aforementioned principles flowing from the application of title united states code section e and the goals of firrea.
piedmont,however,maintains that those principles and goals do not apply where the security in question has been transferred to a bank other than the lessee.it relies on city suburban mgmt.first bank.and tsemetzin coast federal savings loan,supra,th in support of its position.however,those cases are inapposite,as we shall show.
in city suburban mgmt.first bank,supra,first american capital bank,first american had certain servicing obligations under various loan participation and servicing agreements.the fdic was appointed receiver of first american and transferred to first bank of richmond first richmond all of first american right,title and interest in and to the mortgage loans subject to the participation agreements.id.at.under the loan sale agreement with the fdic,first richmond assumed the obligations of first american under the loan participation and servicing agreements.id.at.city and suburban management corporation city and suburban filed a lawsuit against first richmond arising out of the purported failure to properly perform the loan servicing obligations.id.at.in its defense,first richmond asserted that under the loan sale agreement,there was never any intention for first richmond to assume the particular servicing obligations giving rise to the lawsuit.id.at.
the parties stipulated that california law governed the contract claims and the court determined that the loan sale agreement unambiguously required first richmond to perform the loan servicing obligations in question.it further held that city and suburban,as a third party beneficiary of the loan sale agreement,had the right to enforce the agreement against first richmond.city suburban mgmt.first bank,supra.at.
first richmond argued that its contractual obligation was preempted by title united states code section i,which provides in pertinent part the maximum liability of the fdic,acting as a receiver,to any person having a claim against the receiver or the insured depository institution for which such receiver is appointed shall equal the amount such claimant would have received if the fdic had liquidated the assets and liabilities of such institution city suburban mgmt.first bank,supra.at.the court rejected the argument that this statute relieved first richmond of performing its servicing obligations.id.at.it stated that the statute was inapplicable and that firrea did not preempt state law in the matter.id.at.
the court observed that the fdic could have disaffirmed the participation agreements,but chose not to do so.having chosen to transfer rights and obligations to first richmond under the loan sale agreement,the only question was the scope of the rights and obligations transferred.the court reiterated that the language of the loan sale agreement was unambiguous and that all servicing obligations were transferred to first richmond.consequently,partial summary judgment in favor of city and suburban was appropriate and only the question of damages remained for trial.city suburban mgmt.first bank,supra.at.
city suburban mgmt.first bank,supra.is distinguishable from the matter before us.in city suburban,the fdic did not disaffirm the participation agreements,but rather transferred them to first richmond,which bound itself to undertake the servicing obligations.the court held that title united states code section i did not absolve first richmond from the performance of those obligations and that a third party beneficiary was entitled to enforce them.in the matter before us,in contrast,the fdic disaffirmed the lease,bringing title united states code section e into play,and california bank did not obligate itself to undertake any lease obligations.city suburban simply does not dictate the result in this case.
we turn now to tsemetzin coast federal savings loan,supra,th.in that case,coast federal savings and loan association coast federal leased certain premises beginning in.id.at.the lease provided that if coast federal ever assigned its interest in the lease to another financial institution,coast federal would remain primarily liable for all obligations under the lease.id.at.coast federal assigned its interest in the lease to home federal savings and loan association home federal in.ibid.in,the rtc as receiver of home federal disaffirmed the lease.id.at.
the landlord commenced an action against coast federal,seeking unpaid rent as far back as.tsemetzin coast federal savings loan,supra,th at.coast federal argued,inter alia,that the landlord claim was barred by the lease disaffirmance.id.at.the court rejected this argument.id.at.
it stated first,it is clear that under the provisions of firrea,which authorize the rtc to terminate the obligation of a failed institution,the only governmental interest is in concluding the obligation of that institution.the goal of firrea was to stem the financial hemorrhaging from the large number of failures in the savings and loan or thrift industry.citation.to reach that goal,congress required that rtc conduct its operations in a manner which maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of thrift assets that come into its hands.citation.in order to discharge this critical function,congress armed rtc with the power to disaffirm or repudiate contracts or leases that rtc in its discretion determines to be burdensome.citations.as another court emphasized,firrea grants authority to alter contracts in order to serve three critical public policy goals to stem the disruption of banking services within communities,lessen the costs of bank liquidation,and restore public confidence in the nation banking system.citation.in addition to such public policy considerations,the statutory rationale under firrea for permitting the termination of a contractual obligation is that performance under the lease,has become burdensome to the failed institution and termination of the lease will promote the orderly administration of the failed institution affairs.neither the public policy concerns underlying firrea nor either of these goals is advanced by extending the effect of the home federal lease termination to coast federal obligation under that lease.tsemetzin coast federal savings loan,supra,th at.
the court also stated that under the lease coast federal expressly promised that it would remain primarily liable under the lease even if it assigned its interests therein to another financial institution.tsemetzin coast federal savings loan,supra,th at.coast federal could not avoid its continuing obligations under the lease just because its assignee went into receivership.id.at.the court stated the rtc repudiation of the home federal lease,affected only obligations which could be asserted against that institution.it did not impact the landlord right to pursue coast federal for any and all unpaid rentals coming due after the date of lease disaffirmance.coast federal remains liable on its express contractual commitments.id.at.
piedmont says tsemetzin coast federal savings loan,supra,th shows that firrea only protects the failed bank that was placed in receivership,not any other financial institution.it says that just as the lease disaffirmance in tsemetzin did not cut off claims against coast federal,the lease disaffirmance in the matter before us does not cut off the claims against california bank.we disagree.in tsemetzin,coast federal was not the transferee of the receiver.rather,it was the assignor of a lease and specifically agreed to remain primarily liable under the lease even after the assignment took place.in the matter before us,however,california bank was the fdic transferee and did not assume the lease.tsemetzin is plainly inapplicable.
piedmont contends the broad policy considerations expressed in tsemetzin coast federal savings loan,supra,th show that it should not be precluded from retaining the proceeds of the letter of credit.it says that firrea goal of stemming the financial hemorrhaging from the large number of financial institution failures by maximizing the net present value return from the sale or disposition of assets tsemetzin coast federal savings loan,supra,th at has no application where the assets of the failed bank are transferred to another bank.again,we do not agree.one way to curtail the damage from bank failures and to maximize the return from the disposition of failed bank assets,is to find a healthy bank willing to acquire some or all of the assets and liabilities of a failed bank,rather than to simply shut the doors of every failed bank and perform a straight liquidation of assets on hand.finding a healthy bank to acquire assets and absorb liabilities also promotes the goals of reducing the disruption of banking services within the community and restoring public confidence in the banking system.those goals would be contravened if the fdic ability to locate a transferee bank were hampered either because limited assets could be transferred or because those assets were of dubious value,being subject to claims that would be cut off if the fdic made no transfer.rather than supporting piedmont position,tsemetzin coast federal savings loan,supra,th undermines it.
simply put,once the alliance bank lease was disaffirmed,leaving no unpaid rent,piedmont had no claim for breach of lease and no claim for damages.it therefore was not entitled to claim the proceeds of the letter of credit,which served as security in case of breach of the lease.the securing the letter of credit belonged to california bank and piedmont,in essence,wrongfully acquired it 
effect of financial code former section 
there is one final point for consideration,a point piedmont argued in the trial court but has omitted to address on appeal.it has to do with the effect on this matter of financial code former section.repealed by stats,ch.
the fdic,as we recall,was appointed receiver by the commissioner of financial institutions of the state of california.financial code former section repealed by stats,ch,empowered the commissioner to tender the appointment to the fdic.financial code former section repealed by stats,ch,provided if the fdic accepts the appointment as such receiver,the rights of depositors and other creditors of the insured bank shall be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of the laws of this state.
in the trial court,piedmont argued that financial code former section permitted it to claim one year future rent as damages and that,inasmuch as the at issue was far less than the amount of one year future rent,it was entitled to keep the.financial code former section provided in pertinent part within six months after taking possession of the property and business of any bank the commissioner may terminate or adopt any executory contract to which the bank may be a party including leases of real or personal property.claims for damages resulting from the termination of any such contract or lease may be filed and allowed,but no claim of a landlord for damages resulting from the rejection of an unexpired lease of real property shall be allowed in an amount exceeding the rent reserved by the lease,without acceleration,for the year succeeding the date of the surrender of the premises plus the amount of any unpaid accrued rent without acceleration,former,italics added.
according to california bank,case law makes clear that federal law,not state statute,governs the issue of whether a landlord can claim any future rent after lease disaffirmance.it says bayshore executive plaza partnership fdic cir is on point.in that case,a landlord sued the fdic,as receiver of a bank in florida,for one year rent following disaffirmance of the failed bank lease.id.at.it argued that the fdic was acting as an agent of the state and that its application of title united states code section e in lease disaffirmance violated the contracts clause of the united states constitution.bayshore executive plaza partnership fdic,supra,at.summary judgment in favor of the fdic was affirmed.id.at.
the eleventh circuit observed the landlord misconstrues the role of the fdic as liquidator of a bank.as we have stated before,when the fdic is appointed receiver by a state banking authority,that agency acts in two separate capacities as receiver and as corporate insurer of deposits in the failed bank.citation.in neither role does the fdic act as an agent of the state comptroller responsible for its appointment as liquidator.most importantly,it is settled beyond question that federal law governs cases involving the rights of the fdic when that agency acts as liquidator for a failed bank.citations.in addition,when a federal statute addresses the issue of law in contention,the federal statute governs the dispute,despite any federal or state common law that might suggest another result.citation.bayshore executive plaza partnership fdic,supra,at.
as california bank points out,bayshore executive plaza partnership fdic,supra,was cited with approval in monrad cir.monrad had to do with employee severance payment rights,not landlord claims.id.at.there,the ninth circuit observed that the assertion that the recoverable damages are to be determined under california law is misplaced.w hen a federal statute addresses the issue of law in contention,the federal statute governs the dispute,despite any federal or state common law that might suggest another result.bayshore,at.monrad,supra,at.
although this language is nearly dispositive,we observe that the court in bayshore executive plaza partnership fdic,supra,did not state that the federal statute governs even when the state statutes as opposed to state common law pursuant to which the fdic was appointed receiver may provide a different result.we also note that the case was based on an argument over the contracts clause and there is no indication whether the claim for one year future rent was based on a florida statute.id.at.
although neither california bank nor piedmont makes the observation,it appears that the question whether federal statute governs,even when the state statutory body of law pursuant to which the fdic accepted the appointment as receiver provides a contrary result,is a matter resolved by the state statutes themselves.financial code former section provided the fdic as such receiver shall possess with respect to such closed insured bank all the powers,rights,and privileges given the commissioner under article of this chapter with respect to the liquidation of a bank the property and assets of which he or she has taken possession,except insofar as the same may be in conflict with the provisions of the federal deposit insurance act,as amended,former,italics added.the federal deposit insurance act is found in title united states code section et.
here,we have title united states code section e,which provides that the landlord under a disaffirmed lease has no claim for future rent,versus financial code former section,permitting a landlord to make a claim for one year future rent.given the statutory conflict,section must yield.this result is dictated by both financial code former section and federal preemption.see parks mbna america bank,cal th.
california bank says that financial code former section is inapplicable to banks that have federal deposit insurance.in support of this assertion,it cites current financial code section,which is substantially similar to financial code former section,but applies only when the commissioner takes over an uninsured financial institution.california bank cites no legislative history or other authority to show that financial code section is intended to be a continuation of financial code former section,without change.moreover,we note that at least one case has applied financial code former section to constrain the actions of the fdic as receiver,although not in the context of a dispute over the entitlement to future rent after lease disaffirmance.see in re valley state bank d.
in any event,we need not resolve whether financial code former section was intended to apply i
