judy gettings filed a complaint alleging that her employer,the building laborers local fringe benefits fund the fund,violated title vii,erisa,and the national labor relations act by discriminating against her on the basis of her gender.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment for the fund as to all claims.in addition,we vacate the district court denial of attorney fees to the fund and remand with instructions that the court reconsider the request and provide a reasoned explanation for its decision.
background 
factual background 
gettings was hired by the fund as a in.the fund administers health,welfare,pension,and other benefit plans for the members of the building and construction laborers local union the union.a board of trustees,comprised of equal numbers of union and employer representatives,governs the fund.in addition to gettings,five other people were employed in the fund office three clerks,a field auditor,and the fund administrator.gettings and the three other clerks were members of the office and professional employees international union opeiu,which negotiated their wages and benefits in a collective bargaining agreement with the fund.compensation for the field auditor and the fund administrator was set by the fund board of trustees.
in,the fund hired robert mickshaw,the of the union business manager,to be the field auditor.gettings claims that mickshaw was incompetent and unqualified for this position.because mickshaw was purportedly unable to fulfill his duties as the field auditor,gettings alleges that she and the other clerks trained him to perform their clerical duties.as a consequence,gettings complains that she and mickshaw were doing the same kind of work,but that mickshaw was being paid more per year than she was by virtue of his formally holding the position of field auditor.mickshaw also enjoyed more favorable retirement benefits than gettings and had access to a car.
procedural background 
in november of,gettings filed charges with the ohio civil rights commission ocrc and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,alleging that the fund was discriminating against her because of her gender.gettings claims that mickshaw received a substantially more lucrative compensation package for performing essentially the same work that she did.
on october,the ocrc issued gettings a letter,making a preliminary determination that the fund had probably engaged in unlawful discriminatory practices.depositions of gettings,the fund administrator,and the opeiu union steward were subsequently taken by an assistant state attorney general on behalf of the ocrc.in her deposition,gettings admitted that there were significant differences between the duties of a field auditor and the duties of a clerk,and that mickshaw was performing some field auditor tasks,although,in gettings opinion,not very well.gettings also conceded that she did not perform any field auditor duties.she further acknowledged that mickshaw duties required that he have access to a car,while her duties did not.finally,gettings admitted that her union,opeiu,had attempted to negotiate retirement benefits similar to those received by mickshaw,but was unsuccessful.according to gettings,she withdrew her complaint before the ocrc made any final determination on the merits so that she could proceed in federal court.
the eeoc,meanwhile,had declined to investigate gettings charge because the fund employed less than employees,which is the minimum number for an entity to be considered an employer under title vii.b.on august,the eeoc sent gettings a letter confirming that her charge of employment discrimination had been withdrawn in accordance with her request.the eeoc letter did not,however,indicate that she had only days within which to bring a civil action pursuant to f.gettings filed a complaint in federal district court over eight months later,alleging sex discrimination,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,and ohio revised code,discrimination under the employee retirement income security act erisa,and discrimination based on union membership,in violation of the national labor relations act nlra.
at the initial case management conference called by the district court,the fund indicated that it would soon be filing a motion for summary judgment.the parties also agreed to limit discovery in light of the prior proceedings before the ocrc.after the fund filed its motion for summary judgment,gettings requested an additional days in order to conduct discovery before submitting her response.the fund opposed gettings motion because she had failed to comply with the requirement of rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure that such a motion include an affidavit containing a specification of facts to be discovered and an explanation of how the discovered facts would rebut the fund motion for summary judgment.gettings counsel confirmed at oral argument that he did not file a rule f affidavit.at the second pretrial conference,the district court granted gettings request for additional time to respond,but stayed discovery pending its ruling on the fund motion for summary judgment.
in response,gettings not only opposed the fund summary judgment motion,but also sought leave to amend her complaint to add the union as a defendant,arguing that the fund and the union were in fact a single entity.the district court subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of the fund and denied gettings motion to amend her complaint.following this ruling,the fund filed a motion for attorney fees and costs,which the district court denied by a marginal entry without any explanation.gettings appeals the former decision,and the fund appeals the latter.
ii.analysis 
a.the district court stay of discovery 
the fund filed a motion to stay discovery pending the district court ruling on the fund motion for summary judgment.discovery was stayed by the district court without opinion.gettings claims that the denial of discovery was manifestly unjust and violated her right to the due process of law.we review a district court decision to limit discovery under an abuse of discretion standard.hahn star bank,cir.
trial courts have broad discretion and inherent power to stay discovery until preliminary questions that may dispose of the case are determined.id.limitations on pretrial discovery are appropriate where claims may be dismissed based on legal determinations that could not have been altered by any further discovery.muzquiz foote memorial,cir.in the present case,the fund motion for summary judgment contained the following issues that could be decided as a matter of law whether the fund,as a single entity,was an employer as defined under title vii,whether gettings stated a claim under erisa,and whether the nlrb had exclusive jurisdiction over gettings claim.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in making these legal determinations without discovery.
there are,however,two issues that could have been fleshed out in more detail if discovery had gone forward.first,gettings might have obtained evidence to support her theory that the fund and the union were acting as a single employer.second,gettings might have unearthed facts to prop up her claim that mickshaw position as the field auditor was a sham.the problem is that gettings did not comply with rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure,which provides as follows 
should it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the summary judgment motion that the party can not for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to justify the party opposition,the court may refuse the application for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is just.
this court has interpreted rule f as requiring a party opposing a summary judgment motion to file an affidavit that indicate s to the district court its need for discovery,what material facts it hopes to uncover,and why it has not previously discovered the information.cacevic city of hazel park,cir see also,wallin norman,cir summarizing sixth circuit precedent that the nonmoving party must file an affidavit that details the discovery needed,and explain how it will help rebut the movant showing of the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.gettings filed no such affidavit.
this court has pointed out that t he importance of complying with rule f can not be overemphasized.cacevic,at.where a party opposing summary judgment and seeking a continuance pending completion of discovery fails to take advantage of the shelter provided by rule f by filing an affidavit,there is no abuse of discretion in granting summary judgment if it is otherwise appropriate.id.internal citation omitted.because gettings failed to file such an affidavit,the district court did not abuse its discretion in staying discovery pending resolution of the fund motion for summary judgment.
b.the fund motion for summary judgment 
standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.logan denny,cir.summary judgment is proper where there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c.in considering a motion for summary judgment,the district court must construe all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.the central issue is whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so that one party must prevail as a matter of law.anderson liberty lobby,d.
prima facie case of gender discrimination under title vii and ohio state law 
in order to establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination under title vii,gettings must show that she was a member of a protected class she suffered an adverse employment action she was qualified for the position and that she was treated differently from similarly situated members of the unprotected class.alexander local,laborers int l union,cir.because the prima facie case requirements are essentially the same under ohio revised code,see ohio civil rights comm ingram,ohio,gettings federal and claims of gender discrimination may be disposed of together.
the district court properly determined that gettings failed to establish a prima facie case for several reasons.first,gettings did not specifically allege that she suffered an adverse employment action.she was not terminated,disciplined,or demoted.nor was she rejected for the field auditor position,since she never applied for it.second,gettings does not allege that she was qualified to be a field auditor.third,gettings and mickshaw were not similarly situated.under title vii,the plaintiff and the employee with whom the plaintiff seeks to compare herself must be similar in all of the relevant aspects.ercegovich goodyear tire rubber,cir emphasis in original internal citation omitted.
the district court correctly observed that gettings was comparing apples to oranges.gettings and mickshaw each held different jobs,with different qualification requirements and duties,and thus had different compensation packages.gettings admitted as much in her deposition.she acknowledged that she and mickshaw had different jobs and responsibilities and conceded that mickshaw did perform some of his field auditor tasks.gettings opinion that mickshaw performed was handsomely the field auditor does not mean that gettings was being discriminated against with regard to her own employment as a clerk.in sum,she and mickshaw did not hold positions that were similar in all relevant aspects.we thus find no error in the district court conclusion that gettings failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under either federal or state law.
gettings employer for the purposes of the title vii 
the district court also properly granted summary judgment on gettings title vii claim because the fund does not satisfy the statutory definition of an employer.an employer,for purposes of title vii,is a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has fifteen or more employees for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year b.the district court found that,from to the present,the fund has never had or more employees.only persons are employed by the fund.accordingly,as a matter of law,the fund was entitled to summary judgment on gettings title vii claim.
gettings attempted to overcome title vii definition of an employer by filing a motion to amend her complaint to add the union as a defendant.she argued that the union and the fund were acting as a single employer.because the union has employees and the fund has employees,their combined workforce would clear the statutory hurdle if they were considered a single employer.the district court found that gettings motion was moot because,even if the union and the fund were indeed a single employer for the purposes of title vii,gettings nonetheless failed to establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination.because we agree with the district court adjudication on the merits of gettings gender discrimination claim,we conclude that the district court properly dismissed as moot gettings motion to add the union as a defendant.
we also note that there is nothing in the record before us to indicate that the fund and the union were acting as a single employer.the ocrc examined the operations and management of the fund and the union and concluded that the entities were completely separate and could not be merged to satisfy the eeoc jurisdictional prerequisites.after considering the appropriate test in this circuit,the district court also concluded that fund and the union were separate entities.see distillery,wine allied workers int l union national distillers chem,cir examining the interrelation of operations,common management,centralized control of labor relations,and common ownership as the key factors in a analysis.
because gettings failure to file an affidavit under rule f ended further development of the record on this point,we decline to hold that the district court was clearly erroneous in deciding that the fund and the union were separate entities.see michigan bell.engler,cir stating that this court does not disturb findings of fact unless the district court was clearly erroneous in reaching its conclusion.gettings motion to amend her complaint was therefore not only moot,but meritless.
the district court alternative basis for dismissing the title vii claim 
an alternative basis for dismissing gettings title vii claim,the district court held,was her failure to meet certain procedural requirements for filing suit in federal court.usually a person who files a charge with the eeoc that is subsequently dismissed receives notice that she has a right to pursue her claim in federal court.f.this typically takes the form of a letter,stating that the individual has days from the date of the letter to file a civil complaint in court.gettings argues that her letter from the eeoc failed to explain this procedural requirement and was not captioned as a letter.she thus contends that she should not be penalized for filing her lawsuit over eight months after receiving the eeoc letter.
the district court pointed out that gettings was in a situation.if the eeoc letter confirming gettings withdrawal of her charge met the statute requirement that she be given notice of her rights,then she filed her complaint too late.on the other hand,if the eeoc letter was not a letter,then gettings filed her case without receiving clearance to do so.in either case,the district court held that gettings failed to meet the procedural prerequisites of title vii.because the district court other reasons for granting the fund summary judgment are sound,we decline to address this alternative basis for disposing of gettings title vii claim.
the erisa claim 
gettings complaint also failed to articulate a claim under erisa.the district court assumed that gettings was attempting to argue that she was being discriminated against because she received less favorable retirement benefits or contributions than mickshaw.but erisa does not provide a remedy for gender discrimination.erisa prohibits discriminati
