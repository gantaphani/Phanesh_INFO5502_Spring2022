the plaintiffs are prevailing parties in this case,and for that reason they are entitled to reasonable fees and expenses under b.pursuant to cir,they have filed a timely application for fees and expenses in connection with their successful defense in this court of the judgment they obtained in the district court.see glassroth moore,cir.they request a total of in fees and in expenses.
the amount of the plaintiffs request is not opposed by the defendant,chief justice moore.he has not filed anything in this court in response to their application,even though our rule c gave him an absolute right to do so within ten days after service of the plaintiffs application on him,which occurred on august.ordinarily,we grant in full applications for fees and expenses to which no objection has been filed,the assumption being that in our adversary system of justice opposing parties can be counted on to look out for their own fiscal and to complain if the requested fees and expenses are out of line.but this is not an ordinary case in that respect.
chief justice moore was sued in his official capacity,which means that the state of alabama is responsible for paying any attorney fees and expenses that are imposed against him.he is not,however,being represented by the office of the attorney general but instead by counsel of his own choosing,who at the beginning of this litigation were designated as deputy attorneys general,see last para,solely for the purpose of defending him in this litigation.as a result,this is not the usual case where the defense of a lawsuit against an official of the state of alabama is being handled by its attorney general or by attorneys chosen by him.
nor is this a case where the state official being sued seems very mindful of the state interest in its funds,an interest which is directly implicated by the application for fees and expenses that is before us.the chief justice earlier failure to request in a timely fashion a stay of our judgment affirming the district court,followed by his publicly announced intention to defy that court order with full knowledge that doing so could cost the state of alabama hundreds of millions of dollars,raises doubts about his dedication to the of the public fisc.if any more evidence is needed on the matter,it is here in the form of the chief justice inexplicable failure to object to any part of the plaintiffs application for fees and expenses,although at least one part and perhaps more is objectionable.given these unusual circumstances,and because we are reluctant to risk having public funds used to pay more fees and expenses than the law requires,we think that the proper course of action is to remand this application to the district court with directions.
on remand,the attorney general should be given an opportunity to appear regarding this application and to make any objections he deems appropriate,and be allowed to participate in any proceedings to determine reasonable amounts that should be paid.the district court may also deem it advisable to give the attorney general the same opportunity in regard to any application for fees and expenses that is filed in connection with the litigation of this case in the district court,but that matter is not now before us.
while we leave to the district court initially the decision about the exact amount to be awarded plaintiffs for their appellate level attorney fees and expenses,some of the hours for which they seek compensation should be disallowed.the district court ought not allow the plaintiffs any compensation for time their counsel spent in connection with amicus briefs supporting their position.the plaintiffs fee application includes a request for reimbursement for work that lead counsel for the plaintiffs,ayesha khan,did in relation to a number of amicus briefs filed in support of plaintiffs position her time records indicate that she spent that time enlisting various organizations to appear as amici suggesting potential signatories for the briefs working on,supervising,and reviewing the amicus briefs and seeing that they were mailed on time.
it comes as no surprise to us that attorneys for parties solicit amicus briefs in support of their position,nor are we shocked that counsel for a party would have a hand in writing an amicus brief.in fact,we suspect that amicus briefs are often used as a means of evading the page limitations on a party briefs.see voices for choices illinois bell,cir posner,in chambers a micus briefs,often solicited by parties,may be used to make an end run around limitations on the length of parties briefs.even where such efforts are successful,however,they should not be underwritten by the other party.an organization or group that files an amicus brief on the winning side is not entitled to attorney fees and expenses as a prevailing party,because it is not a party.we will not allow that result to be changed by the simple expedient of having counsel for a party do some or all of the amicus work.to pay a party for such work would encourage the practice,which we are loathe to do.the district court should not award plaintiffs any attorney fees or expenses for work done in connection with supporting amicus briefs.a reasonable amount of time spent reading and responding to opposing amicus briefs is,of course,compensable.
while we have the case before us,we also add some observations about two factors the district court ought to consider in determining whether the total number of appellate level hours for which plaintiffs seek attorney fees is reasonable or unreasonably high.they seek payment from the state for approximately hours on the brief,nearly hours related to oral argument,and about hours in connection with the fee application 
one of those factors is that khan,who served as lead counsel for plaintiffs in the appeal,is an expert in this area,and we mean this area with particularity.she is an expert not only as to the establishment clause in general,but also as to ten commandments displays in particular.the declaration she has filed in support of the fee application tells us that kahn has specialized in civil rights and civil liberties litigation for more than a decade,serving as counsel in complex litigation in state and federal court.for the past five years she has focused her work exclusively on litigation,serving as counsel in establishment clause cases around the country,including seven cases involving ten commandments displays.with that kind of experience comes knowledge,efficiency,and,which should reduce the number of hours necessary for the task.a legal team headed by kahn should have taken fewer hours to handle this case on appeal than one without the benefit of her expertise.
beyond the expertise of lead counsel,there is another factor the district court should consider in determining whether the number of hours for which compensation is requested may be too high.the time that should be devoted to a case varies directly with the difficulty of the case.it takes more time and effort to stalk beasts in the backwoods than it does to shoot fish in a barrel.whatever may have been the situation when this lawsuit was filed,by the time it reached the appellate chief justice moore had testified and the district court had made detailed much stalking by plaintiffs counsel was required.given the lemon test,which is binding on us,and the settled facts,this case was not a hard one,and it was not difficult for plaintiffs to defend their judgment at this level.
apparently anticipating that we might have some concerns that the claimed hours exceeded the difficulty of the task,kahn tells us in her declaration that this case was well out of the ordinary for ten commandments displays.that is so,she explains,because some of the contentions that chief justice moore and his attorneys raised were ones she had never encountered before.we do not doubt that.nonetheless,it should not have taken much time to find controlling precedent foreclosing those unusual contentions,such as chief justice moore argument that the establishment clause applies only to legislation,see glassroth,at,his argument that the ten commandments are not religious in nature
