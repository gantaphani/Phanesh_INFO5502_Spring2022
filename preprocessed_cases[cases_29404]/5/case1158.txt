the government appeals the district court award of attorneys fees to the free speech coalition under the equal access to justice act eaja because the court held the government was not substantially justified in defending the child pornography prevention act cppa.we reverse.multiple objective indicia support the reasonableness of the government position,including the novelty of the issue involved and the government string of successes in defending the cppa against constitutional attack.we conclude that reasonable minds could have differed over the cppa constitutionality,especially where four sister circuits,the district court below,one member of the ninth circuit panel,and three ninth circuit judges dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc all determined the cppa to be constitutional before the supreme court ultimately struck two sections as unconstitutional.
background 
before,congress defined child pornography as a visual depiction that involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.see,a.congress enacted the cppa,et,to address the issue of virtual child pornography.the cppa extended the definition of child pornography to include a visual depiction that is,or appears to be,of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,b,or is advertised,promoted,presented,described,or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression that the material is or contains a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.d.
between and,four courts of appeals sustained the validity of the cppa.see united states fox,cir we hold that the cppa is not unconstitutionally overbroad.united states mento,cir we hold that the cppa does not impermissibly regulate protected speech and does not,therefore,offend the first amendment.united states acheson,cir given the lack of any substantial overbreadth in light of the statute legitimate sweep,the cppa withstands this constitutional challenge.united states hilton,cir,cert.denied,d we conclude,therefore,that the cppa is not unconstitutionally overbroad.see also ashcroft free speech coalition,d while the ninth circuit found the cppa invalid on its face,four other courts of appeals have sustained it.
the free speech coalition coalition,a california trade association for the industry,challenged the validity of the cppa in the united states district court for the northern district of california.the coalition contended that the cppa was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague under the first amendment because it defined child pornography as including visual depictions of adults that appear to be minors.
the district court granted summary judgment to the government,holding that the cppa was not overbroad.it specifies that only materials that do not use adults and that appear to be child pornography,even if they are digitally produced,are prohibited.thus,the court found the cppa prohibits only those works necessary to prevent the secondary pernicious effects of child pornography from reaching minors.
the ninth circuit reversed.free speech coalition reno,cir.the court held that the phrases appears to be a minor,and conveys the impression that the depiction portrays a minor,violated the first amendment for being vague and overbroad.id.at.judge ferguson dissented on the grounds that congress has provided compelling evidence that virtual child pornography causes real harm to real children and a s a result,virtual child pornography should join the ranks of real child pornography as a class of speech outside the protection of the first amendment,and the statutory terms of the cppa were not substantially overbroad or void for vagueness.id.at ferguson,dissenting.
the ninth circuit denied a petition for rehearing en banc.free speech coalition reno,cir.three judges dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc,pointing out that the panel opinion struck down provisions of the cppa that had been upheld by the first and eleventh circuits.id.at wardlaw,dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc.the dissent also argued that several supreme court cases cast doubt on the panel decision,and that the supreme court had yet to address virtual as opposed to actual child pornographic images.id.at.finally,the dissent made the practical argument that,especially in the digital age,the distinction between what is actual and what is virtual,may,as suggested by judge ferguson dissent to the panel opinion,be difficult to discern.id.at.
the supreme court granted certiorari,and held that b and d were overbroad and unconstitutional.free speech coalition,at.the court determined that the cppa extends to images that appear to depict a minor engaging in sexually explicit activity without regard to the requirements of miller california,d at,and that the cppa went beyond the definition of child pornography in new york ferber,d.at.the court pointed out that ferber relied on the distinction between actual and virtual child pornography,citing virtual images as an alternative and permissible means of expression.id.at.thus,the court concluded that the cppa is inconsistent with miller and finds no support in ferber.id.the supreme court also rejected the government other arguments to justify the prohibitions.id.at.
justice thomas concurred in the judgment,stating that the government most persuasive asserted interest in support of the cppa is the prosecution rationale.id.at.thomas,concurring in the judgment.justice thomas acknowledged that technology may evolve to the point where it becomes impossible to enforce actual child pornography laws in the event this occurs,the government should not be foreclosed from enacting a regulation of virtual child pornography addressing this problem.id.
chief justice rehnquist,joined in part by justice scalia,dissented,stating that while potentially impermissible applications of the cppa may exist,i doubt that they would be substantial in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.id.at.rehnquist,dissenting omission in original citation omitted.justice authored a concurrence in part,and dissent in part,in which the chief justice and justice scalia joined in part ii,finding that the ban on virtual child pornography is not overbroad.id.at,concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.
after the supreme court decision,the coalition filed a petition for attorneys fees under the eaja in the district court.the district court awarded attorneys fees to the coalition,finding that the government was not substantially justified in defending the cppa because the constitutional flaw in the cppa was recognizable from the start.after the parties agreed on the amount of attorneys fees to be awarded,the district court entered a final judgment awarding to the coalition.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court conclusion that the government position was not substantially justified,thus warranting an award of attorneys fees under the eaja,for an abuse of discretion.pierce underwood,d bay area peace navy united states,cir.an abuse of discretion occurs if the district court based its decision on an erroneous legal conclusion or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.oregon envtl.council kunzman,cir.
abuse of discretion is a highly deferential standard,under which the appellate court can not substitute its view of what constitutes substantial justification for that of the district court rather,the review is limited to assuring that the district court determination has a basis in reason.bay area peace navy,at quotation marks and citations omitted.the government bears the burden of demonstrating substantial justification.kali bowen,cir.
