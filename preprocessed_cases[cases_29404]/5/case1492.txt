janice willis willis,an attorney,appeals the decision of the personnel appeals board the board of the united states government accountability office gao declining under the provision of the civil service reform act,g,to award the full amount of attorney fees requested by willis and her former client sandra davis davis.davis has not appealed.because willis lacks standing to contest the board decision,we dismiss the appeal.
background 
willis initially represented davis,who was employed by gao,in a proceeding before the board asserting a number of claims of unlawful conduct by gao personnel.after discovery and an evidentiary hearing,davis terminated willis and retained nora kelly kelly.on july,the administrative judge issued an initial decision rejecting all but one of davis claim that davis performance appraisals had been lowered in a manner inconsistent with gao published orders in violation of b.the administrative judge ruled in davis favor on the remaining claim,ordering gao to increase davis performance appraisals and awarding davis back pay in the amount she would have received had the appraisals been conducted properly.both gao and davis appealed to the full board kelly handled davis appeal.the full board affirmed the initial decision in a final decision issued july.
after issuance of the board final decision,davis filed a request for attorney fees pursuant to g.davis requested for hours representing the portion of willis work,and kelly work during the appellate stage of the litigation.davis declined to request that willis billed davis for willis work during the evidentiary hearing because,as davis explained in her fee request,she viewed the amounts billed as excessive.the administrative judge granted willis motion to intervene in the proceedings,on the condition that willis could not request any fees beyond those requested by davis.nevertheless,willis filed a separate fee request that not only supported the amounts claimed by davis,but also sought fees for willis work during the evidentiary hearing,which davis had expressly declined to request.
the administrative judge held that davis success qualified her as a prevailing party entitled to attorney fees under the statute.with respect to the claims advanced by both davis and willis,the administrative judge rejected the contention that willis fees should be calculated at an hourly rate of,which was substantially higher than the hourly rate willis actually charged davis,and discounted a number of the hours claimed for willis work as duplicative,insufficiently documented,or unnecessary.the administrative judge reduced the total number of hours davis claimed for willis work by percent because of the inconsistent quality of willis pretrial filings and the fact that the majority of davis claims were ultimately rejected.the administrative judge also rejected willis separate request for additional amounts not requested by davis on the grounds that her additional request violated the express condition in the administrative judge order allowing willis to intervene,and that willis,who could not be characterized as a prevailing petitioner under the statute and regulations,had no right to file an independent request for attorney fees.davis general accounting office,slip op.at june.ultimately,the administrative judge awarded davis in fees.
both davis and willis appealed to the board.davis argued that that the administrative judge erred in reducing the amount that she claimed.willis argued that the administrative judge erred in rejecting her separate claim for additional compensation attributable to her work during the evidentiary hearing.in a final decision issued march,the board affirmed,rejecting davis and willis contentions and adopting the administrative judge findings of fact and conclusions of law.with respect to willis request for additional fees not claimed by davis,the board concluded that willis has no independent right to file a request for attorney fees because provides that the petitioner,if he or she is the prevailing party,may submit a request for the award of reasonable attorney fees and costs.davis general accounting office,slip op.at.
willis alone appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
the necessary threshold question in this case is whether willis has standing to appeal the board decision to this court.willis primary theory of standing is that she has a right to receive fee payments under the statute separate and apart from her client right to fees.this theory of standing is essential to willis claim for fees for the trial that were not included in davis fee request.alternatively,willis may be arguing that she has the right to assert on appeal her client right to the recovery of fees that were claimed before the board but not allowed.in either event,we conclude that willis lacks standing.
we first address willis contention that she has standing because she has an independent right to claim fees under the statute.because article iii standing implicates the court constitutional authority to adjudicate disputes,it can be neither waived,boeing comm r of patents trademarks,nor assumed,city of dallas,d thus,federal courts have an independent obligation to examine article iii standing even if the issue was not raised by the parties or addressed in the decision below,at.dowd united states.
article iii standing is required at all stages of federal litigation,including appeals.korczak sedeman,cir see,diamond charles,d boeing,at.a n intervenor right to continue a suit in the absence of the party on whose side intervention was permitted is contingent upon a showing by the intervenor that he fulfills the requirements of art.iii.diamond,at.citations omitted.
to establish article iii standing,willis must allege that she has suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a legally protected interest lujan defenders of wildlife,d plurality opinion.because t he actual or threatened injury required by art.iii may exist solely by virtue of statutes creating legal rights,the invasion of which creates standing,standing often turns on the nature and source of the claim asserted.warth seldin,d internal quotation marks omitted.under the administrative procedure act apa,et,a plaintiff seeking to set aside unlawful agency or executive action may have article iii standing even though he has no direct claim under a substantive statute.see richard fallon,et,hart and wechsler the federal courts and the federal system,ed.
however,a different rule applies where the plaintiff is independently seeking monetary relief and the apa does not apply.in such circumstances,we have held that the plaintiff must be within the class of persons legally protected by the statute under which the individual seeks relief.for example,in ortho pharmaceutical genetics institute,we held that nonexclusive patent licensees lack article iii standing to sue for infringement because economic injury alone does not provide standing to sue under the patent statute a licensee must hold some of the proprietary sticks from the bundle of patent rights,otherwise the licensee suffers no legal injury from infringement and,thus,has no standing see also intellectual prop,tci cablevision of,a nonexclusive license confers no constitutional standing on the licensee under the patent act to bring suit or even to join a suit with the patentee because a nonexclusive or bare licensee suffers no legal injury from infringement.
thus,willis lacks independent standing unless she has a right to claim fees under the statute.
there is no separate attorney fees statute applicable to proceedings before the gao board.however,congress,in e,made section g,which governs the recovery of attorney fees in actions before the merit systems protection board,applicable to actions before the gao board.section e provides that t he gao personnel appeals board shall prescribe regulations providing for officer and employee appeals consistent with sections and of title.e.the board has issued a regulation implementing section g,providing that the board will award attorneys fees consistent with the standards set forth at g.
section g,provides 
t he board may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the board determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice 
thus,the question is whether section g grants attorneys a legally protected interest independently to assert a claim for a fee award.we conclude that it does not.
in evans jeff,d,the supreme court addressed a similar question under another statute,b in a settlement agreement,a plaintiff class composed of children,through their guardians and attorney,agreed to waive attorney fees under section b provided that the waiver was approved by the district court.id.at.the district court approved the settlement,but the plaintiffs nevertheless moved for leave to file a fee request,arguing that the attorney fees waiver provision of the settlement agreement was prohibited by section b.the district court declined to invalidate the waiver provision and denied the motion.id.at.the ninth circuit reversed,holding that fee waivers in settlement agreements were only allowable on a showing of unusual circumstances.jeff evans,cir.perceiving no such unusual circumstances,the ninth circuit remanded for determination of reasonable attorney fees.id.
in addressing the permissibility of the fee waiver,the supreme court considered whether the right to claim fees belonged to the prevailing party or the attorney.the court held that the language of section b,as well as its legislative history,indicated that congress bestowed on the prevailing party generally plaintiffs a statutory eligibility for a discretionary award of attorney fees evans,at.internal footnote omitted.the court made clear that section b neither bestowed fee awards upon attorneys nor rendered them nonwaivable or nonnegotiable.id.at.see also venegas mitchell,d w e have recognized that it is the party entitlement to receive the fees under w e have rejected the argument that the entitlement to a award belongs to the attorney emphasis added.the court also concluded that district courts have discretion to approve or invalidate a waiver of attorney fees pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure e,and that the district court did not abuse its discretion in approving the waiver.id.at.
we perceive only three possible differences between evans and this case.first,evans arose under a different statute,b,rather than g,which is involved here.for present purposes,we see no meaningful difference in the language of the two statutes each provides for fee recovery by the prevailing party rather than the attorney.nor does the sparse legislative history persuade us that section g should be interpreted differently.indeed,the senate committee report concerning section g spoke of the government obligation to reimburse successful claimants who paid attorney fees out of pocket during litigation,at,as reprinted in at.the board regulations also make clear that only a prevailing party is entitled to request attorney fees under section g.under the supreme court longstanding rule that federal statutes are to be interpreted consistently we conclude that there is no meaningful difference between section b and section g for present purposes.indeed,shortly after the supreme court decision in evans,our court followed the evans approach under section g.mcalear merit.protection.
the second possible difference between this case and evans is that evans did not directly involve a claim by the attorney to assert the fee award,but rather presented a claim by the prevailing party that waivers of fee claims in settlements were not permissible under section b.but we are bound not only by the court ultimate holding,but also by its underlying reasoning.in holding that the fee could be waived,the court clearly concluded that the fee award claim belonged to the client rather than the attorney.in mcalear,we specifically addressed the question of whether an attorney could continue to claim fees pursuant to section g after the client waived the right to seek fees in a settlement agreement.at.because the client in the settlement agreement had plainly and explicitly withdrawn any request to the merit systems protection board mspb for attorney fees,we concluded that the attorney could not on his own and contrary to the expressed wishes of the prevailing party,assert a claim.id.at.
the third possible distinction between this case and evans is that in evans,the client explicitly surrendered the right to a fee award by settlement whereas here there was no settlement,only the failure by the client to pursue a larger award in the first instance and the failure by the client to appeal from the award of a lesser amount than the client originally claimed.again,we do not see how this distinction suggests a different outcome.if the client can compromise the fee award,the client can equally decline to claim it in the first instance or to pursue it on appeal.the client lack of interest does not transfer the client right to the attorney.
we conclude that evans establishes that only the prevailing party and not the attorney has the right to assert a claim for attorney fees under the statute.
nothing in our decision in jensen department of transportation,requires a different result.jensen,an adverse action claimant,paid a portion of her lawyer fees.the merit systems protection board then awarded fees under section g,withholding from the award the amount that the claimant had already paid the attorney because the attorney refused to reimburse the claimant that amount.id.at.we held that the attorney is entitled to collect the fees awarded under section g,and we remanded and instructed the board to release the entire fee award to the attorney.id.at.evans was not discussed in jensen,and we have no occasion here to consider whether evans would have required a different outcome in jensen.
in any event,jensen does not suggest that the attorney has a right to claim the fees in the first instance.under statutes in general,there is a distinction between the party entitlement to claim an award of fees and the attorney right to receipt of fees that are awarded the ninth circuit has agreed that evans established that the entitlement to request fees belongs solely to the party.pony county of,cir united states ex rel.virani jerry lewis truck parts,cir.but the ninth circuit,like our court,has also recognized the attorney right to collect the fees awarded.we agree with the ninth circuit description of this distinction 
t he attorney remains at the mercy of the client,who can either demand attorneys fees from the defendant,or not,as he chooses.if the client chooses not to ask for the fees,the attorney has no standing to request them of course,the attorney can not then look to the defendant for payment on the other hand,the client himself is not entitled to keep the fees which are measured by and paid on account of the attorneys services.
virani,at see also pony,at we therefore conclude that jensen is fully consistent with our conclusion that under the statute only the prevailing party has the right to claim fees.willis accordingly has no right under the statute to claim fees,and lacks article iii standing to directly assert a claim for attorney fees.
this leads to the second possible basis of assertion that she may pursue davis claim to the fee award.generally,a party must assert his own legal rights and interests,and can not rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.warth,at.
but there are exceptions,and the supreme court decision in caplin drysdale,chartered united states,d,is illustrative.there,a law firm challenged the application of a federal criminal forfeiture statute to assets of a criminal defendant that were needed to pay the defendant attorney fees,arguing that refusing to allow the payment of fees from the forfeited amounts violated the defendant sixth amendment right to counsel.the defendant had entered into a plea agreement in which he agreed to forfeit to the government all assets specified in the indictment.id.at.the defendant law firm sought fees from the forfeited amounts.th
