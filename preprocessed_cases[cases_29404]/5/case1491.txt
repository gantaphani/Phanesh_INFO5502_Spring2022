robert peterson peterson appeals from final orders finding that peterson willfully infringed patent the patent,and awarding golden blount damages and attorney fees.golden blount,robert peterson,final judgment golden blount,robert peterson,attorney fees order golden blount,robert peterson,wl,infringement order.because the district court did not clearly err in finding that peterson willfully infringed the patent,we affirm the district court judgment of willful infringement and the award of attorney fees based principally thereon.however,because the district court did not address certain returned units in its calculation of damages,we vacate the damages award and remand that limited aspect of the case to the district court with instructions to reexamine the number of products sold and,if necessary,damages and enter judgment thereon consistent with this opinion.
background 
on january,golden blount filed suit against peterson for infringement of the patent,which relates to fireplace burners and associated equipment.beginning on july,the district court held a bench trial.on august,the district court found willful infringement,held that the claims were not invalid,awarded damages and attorney fees,and granted an injunction.peterson appealed to this court and,in april,we construed certain claims of the patent,affirmed the validity determination,vacated the judgment as to infringement,and remanded for specific factual findings.see golden blount,robert peterson,golden blount i.because we vacated the judgment with respect to all issues of infringement,we also vacated and remanded the judgment as to willfulness,the exceptional nature of the case,and damages.id.at.
in the district court on remand,both parties filed proposed findings of fact.on june,the district court adopted peterson proposed findings of.on july,golden blount filed a motion under rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure rule to amend the judgment,and alternatively,a rule motion for a new trial.on august,the district court granted peterson petition for attorney fees.however,on august,the district court heard oral argument on golden blount rule b motion and decided that it made a mistake in adopting peterson findings.from the bench,the district court vacated peterson findings and the award of attorney fees,and requested that golden blount provide the necessary findings and necessary final judgment.
on august,golden blount submitted another set of proposed findings,which the district court adopted and entered on september.the district court found that peterson both directly and indirectly infringed the patent and that infringement was willful.the district court calculated damages to be,trebled the award to,and awarded golden blount attorney fees and interest.
on september,golden blount filed a formal application for attorney fees.on september,peterson lodged an appeal from the august,order.on november,the district court calculated the amount of attorney fees to be.on december,peterson appealed from the award of attorney fees.on december,the district court entered final judgment,and,on january,peterson appealed from that order.on february,we consolidated the appeals.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
preliminary matters 
peterson argues that the district court clearly erred in vacating all of its june,findings because golden blount rule b motion only sought amendment of some of the findings and golden blount did not file another rule b motion after august.alternatively,peterson argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter the september,findings because the august,minute order was an appealable judgment that golden blount did not seek to amend within ten days as required by rule a.peterson adds that,even if this court does not strike the september,findings,it should apply greater scrutiny than clear error review because the district court adopted golden blount findings verbatim.
golden blount counters that it need not have filed another rule b motion with its august,proposed findings because its original rule b motion was adequate and because it was complying with the district court august,order.golden blount adds that the district court had jurisdiction to enter the september,findings because the august,order was not an appealable judgment and did not start the clock.alternatively,golden blount asserts that the district court retained jurisdiction to change its judgment under rule b.golden blount maintains that even if this court reviews the findings very closely because they were adopted verbatim,the standard that the court must apply is that of clear error.we agree with golden blount.
because the issue of whether the district court properly granted a rule b motion to amend its findings is not unique to patent law,we apply regional circuit law,here,that of the fifth circuit.see panduit all states plastic,overruled on other grounds by koller,d.although we could find no fifth circuit decision setting out the standard of review that is applied in that circuit to a district court decision to amend its findings,we believe it reasonable to conclude that the fifth circuit would apply the abuse of discretion standard.james moore et,moore federal practice,at ed.moore the decision of whether to grant or deny a motion to amend or enlarge the findings is within the discretion of the trial court.see weatherchem clark,finding no abuse of discretion in the denial of a rule b motion.
rule b provides that o n a party motion filed no later than days after entry of judgment,the court may amend its make additional may amend the judgment accordingly.b.a party may move to amend the findings of fact even if the modified or additional findings in effect reverse the judgment.if the trial court has entered an erroneous judgment,it should correct it.fontenot mesa petroleum,cir internal quotations omitted accord metal finishing,cir moore,at.golden blount filed its rule b motion within days of the entry of the june,findings,and called for the court to accept its amended findings of fact and conclusions of law,which were in most respects contrary to those made by the district court.because the district court may reverse any or all of its findings in acting on a rule b motion,see fontenot,at metal,at,and because a rule b motion provides the district court discretion to amend any of its own findings,see moore,at,it matters not that peterson rule b motion did not request all of the changes effected by the september,findings.the district court did not abuse its discretion in amending its findings and modifying its judgment accordingly.the cases to which peterson cites are not germane.
peterson jurisdictional challenge also fails.the district court invited golden blount to submit additional findings and did not intend for the august,minute order to dispose of the pending rule b motion.see mclaughlin mississippi power,cir finding that a district court order was not a final judgment because the district court did not intend to end the litigation with its order and continued to issue orders in the case pandrol usa,lp airboss ry,noting that whether an order constitutes a final judgment depends upon whether the judge has or has not clearly declared his intention in this respect in his opinion internal quotations omitted.thus,the minute order was not a final,appealable order.as a result,the district court retained jurisdiction to enter the september,findings.see moore,at noting that the district court retains jurisdiction while a rule b motion is pending.the fact that the rule motion for a new trial remained pending until december,further supports this conclusion.while peterson is correct that under rule a b,a separate document is not required for an order to constitute a final judgment,that presupposes that the court,by the minute order,had disposed of the rule b motion.here,the district court did not dispose of the motion as it had requested and was awaiting golden blount additional findings before entering judgment.
we reject peterson argument that golden blount should have submitted another rule b motion after the august,hearing.because the original rule b motion was a sufficient basis on which the court could effect the changes in its findings,and because the minute order did not dispose of that motion,the submission of another rule b motion with the august,proposed findings was unnecessary 
finally,we reject peterson argument concerning the standard of review.while the district court verbatim adoption of golden blount factual findings may result in our close scrutiny,it does not affect our application of the clear error standard of review.see anderson city of bessemer city,d e ven when the trial judge adopts proposed findings verbatim,the findings are those of the court and may be reversed only if clearly erroneous.
infringement 
the patent relates to a fireplace assembly that 
is the combination of an inexpensive primary gas logs burner assembly in gas flow communication with a secondary coals and tube positioned forward and below the primary burner which operates to enhance the natural draft of the fireplace to improve efficiency of burn and aesthetic appeal of the artificial logs,coals and assembly.
patent,ll.figure,below,illustrates the assembly.
in golden blount i,we concluded that the raised level limitation in claim refers to the top of the primary burner tube and requires that the top of the primary tube be above the top of the secondary burner tube.at.likewise,we concluded that the below limitation in claim required that the top of the secondary burner tube be below the top of the primary burner tube.id.
although peterson sells its secondary burner the emb to distributors packaged separately from the primary burner,the district court found that peterson both directly infringed claims,and of the patent,by assembling the entire apparatus itself on a number of occasions,and indirectly infringed,by selling the emb with instructions leading to assemble the device into the claimed configuration.to make these findings,the district court concluded that golden blount had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the raised level limitation of claim and the below limitation of claim read on devices assembled both by peterson and the.
in support,the district court observed plaintiff exhibit,a device assembled by golden blount to be representative of the combined peterson primary burner and emb.this exhibit showed that the top of the primary burner was raised relative to the emb.the district court also referred to testimony of william mclaughlin mclaughlin,peterson outside patent counsel,and leslie bortz bortz and tod corrin corrin,peterson employees,that in view of defendant exhibits and and which together formed a device representative of peterson entire burner assembly,the top of the emb is below the top of the primary burner.the court relied on defense exhibit,an instruction sheet packaged with each emb that tells owners to tighten the ember burner so that the valve faces forward and flush with the burner pan testimony of bortz that normally the valve rests on the fireplace floor and an observation that when the valve of the rested on a table flush with the pan,the top of the primary burner was above the top of the emb.the district court also cited defense exhibit,instructions which peterson admits show the top of the primary burner to be above the top of the emb.the court explained that t here has been no reasons given why peterson did assemble these devices in accordance with its own instructions.the district court concluded that peterson assembled the claimed apparatus to show distributors,and sold several units with a primary burner substantially identical to those sold individually to distributors.the district court also concluded that assembled the device into the claimed configuration.the court reasoned that peterson supplied the emb with instructions,explaining that when instructions are provided it can be circumstantially inferred that the customer follows those instructions with respect to the accused device.
as to contributory infringement,the district court found that peterson knew that the combination for which its components were especially made was patented as of december.the court found that the emb had no uses,that the emb was not a staple article,and thus that peterson was a contributory infringer.as to inducement of infringement,the court found that because peterson knew about the patent as of december,and because peterson provided instructions to its customers on how to configure the components,peterson knew or should have known that it was inducing infringement.the court cited to demonstrations that peterson provided its distributors as evidence of inducement,and concluded that peterson was an inducer.
on appeal,peterson argues that even though it did not object at trial to the admission of,the exhibit is not entitled to weight because it is not authentic,and thus that the district court erred in relying on it.peterson also asserts that neither nor proves that either peterson or its customers made the infringing apparatus.as to the instruction sheet,peterson asserts that it does not lead to the formation of an infringing configuration.as to the additional instruction sheet,peterson argues that it was not distributed to all,and thus can not evidence infringement on the part of those who did not receive it.alternatively,peterson asserts that these instructions do not apply to the devices that it sold because the primary burner on those devices is different than the primary burner reflected in the instruction sheets.as to contributory infringement,peterson argues that golden blount admitted that the apparatus can be configured in a manner and thus that there can be no contributory infringement.as to inducement,peterson asserts that cases that have relied on instructions as evidence of third have found that following the instructions must result in infringement,and that infringement in this case is not a foregone conclusion based on the instructions.finally,peterson argues that it held a belief that neither it nor its customers were infringing,and thus that it did not have the requisite intent to induce.golden blount counters that the infringement findings were not clearly erroneous.we agree with golden blount.
infringement is a question of fact reviewed for clear error.golden blount i,at.a factual finding is clearly erroneous when,despite some supporting evidence,the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.united states gypsum.
the parties disagree on whether following the instructions would lead to the formation of an infringing configuration.instruction sheet,which was packaged with the emb,instructs the user to install the valve flush with the burner pan.bortz testified that the valve sits on the fireplace floor and the valve supports the emb.viewing the device that peterson assembled for trial the combined and,mclaughlin and bortz testified that the top of the primary burner was raised relative to the top of the emb when the valve rested on the table shown to be a flat surface moreover,corrin admitted that instruction sheet,which was offered to customers who requested it,illustrates an assembly with the top of the primary burner above the top of the emb.presented with this evidence,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that both and taught the infringing configuration.we reject peterson arguments to the contrary.
next,the parties dispute whether direct infringement by peterson can be inferred from peterson assembly of eleven units in light of both instruction sheets,and whether direct infringement by customers can be inferred from sales of the emb packaged with,and with available upon request.circumstantial evidence can support a finding of infringement.see moleculon research cbs,holding that circumstantial evidence of extensive sales and dissemination of an instruction sheet can support a finding of direct infringement by the customer alco standard.valley,although the evidence of infringement is circumstantial,that does not make it any less credible or persuasive.peterson does not dispute that it assembled eleven devices itself and that each that purchased an emb attached it to a primary burner or had an installer do it.in light of the concession that each emb was attached to a primary burner and given the evidence showing that was packaged with each emb,that both the and instruction sheets teach an infringing configuration,and that the demonstration device assembled by peterson at trial exemplified an infringing configuration,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that more likely than not,each time an emb was attached to a primary burner by either peterson or an,the combination was infringing.see moleculon,at.see also metabolite,lab,cert.granted in part,d holding that circumstantial evidence was sufficient to show that a method step was carried out by the direct infringer,even in the absence of direct evidence for each direct infringer.
we reject peterson argument that golden blount could not rely on the instruction sheets to prove acts of direct infringement by.as for instruction sheet,the argument is based on the premise that does not teach the infringing configuration.that premise is not valid,as we have concluded supra,that the finding that taught the infringing configuration was not clearly erroneous.as for instruction sheet,the degree to which was is debatable on this immaterial given the instructions set forth in and provided to each customer.moreover,contrary to the view advanced by peterson,it matters not that the assembled device can be manipulated into a configuration,because the instructions packaged with each device teach the infringing configuration and nothing in the record suggests that either peterson or any ignored the instructions or assembled the burners in a manner contrary to the instructions so as to form a configuration.see hilgraeve symantec,t ests of an accused device under unusual conditions are not necessarily relevant to an infringement analysis.high tech med.instrumentation,new image,finding that a device does not infringe if it does not infringe in its normal configuration,even if it may be altered into an infringing configuration under unusual circumstances 
the next issue before us is whether golden blount carried its burden of proving that there were no substantial uses of the emb,and thus that peterson was a contributory infringer under c.see golden blount i,at holding that the burden of persuasion is on the plaintiff.relying on peterson admission that the emb was not a staple article of commerce and was especially made or adapted for use with a primary burner,and evidence that the instruction sheets taught only the infringing configuration,the district court had ample basis to conclude that golden blount had made out a prima facie showing that peterson product was not suitable for substantial use,thus shifting the burden of production to peterson.see symbol,opticon,explaining that once the patentee makes out a prima facie showing of infringement,the defendant can counteract it by the patentee evidence or putting on its own defense.we reject peterson argument that bard,advanced cardiovascular,disposed of peterson burden to come forward with rebuttal evidence.in bard,we reversed a district court grant of a motion for summary judgment of contributory infringement,reasoning that the device at issue,in theory,could be used in a way so as not to infringe the asserted method claim and that the record did not foreclose a reasonable from concluding that the device was actually used in the way.id.in this case,which was decided not on summary judgment but after a bench trial,golden blount made out a prima facie showing that the emb had no use.the burden of production then shifted to peterson to introduce some evidence that actually assembled the burners in a way.having introduced no evidence that anyone actually made or used the assembly in a manner contrary to the instructions so as to form a assembly,peterson can not complain that the district court found that the emb was not suitable for substantial use.thus,we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that peterson acted as a contributory infringer each time it sold an emb that was ultimately assembled into an infringing device.
finally,peterson cites to moba,diamond automation,bausch lomb,and manville sales paramount systems,and argues that it held a belief that its instruction sheets would not lead to infringement based on opinions of counsel,and that,as a matter of law,it lacked the intent necessary to find inducement in both moba and,we explained that the only intent required of defendant is the intent to cause the acts that constitute infringement.moba,at citing,at.in this case,peterson intended to cause the acts that led to infringement because peterson packaged its instruction sheet with the emb and intended to have customers assemble the apparatus in accordance with the instructions.thus,the inducement finding is consistent with moba and.in manville sales,we reversed a finding of inducement because the alleged inducer did not have notice of the patent until after suit was filed and the infringing acts only continued after the alleged inducers acquired a good faith belief,based on advice of counsel,that the product did not infringe.at see supra note.although peterson argues that it acted in good faith and cites several oral opinions of counsel,we conclude for the reasons discussed infra part,that the district court did not clearly err in dismissing those opinions as incompetent and in finding that peterson assertions of good faith ring hollow.the inducement finding is not inconsistent with manville sales.moreover,peterson argument that it could not have induced the infringement of those customers who did not receive the instruction sheet is of no moment as it is based on the erroneous premise that instruction sheet,which was included with each product sold to all customers,does not lead to an infringing configuration.
for the foregoing reasons,we find no reversible error in the district court findings that claims,and of the patent were infringed.
willfulness 
the district court considered the following evidence in finding that peterson willfully infringed the patent.on december,golden blount sent a letter to peterson stating that the patent had issued,that peterson was marketing a device that is substantially similar to the burner assembly that is claimed in each of the claims of the subject patent,that golden blount would take whatever steps are reasonable and necessary to prevent infringement,and that peterson should alert golden blount of its intentions by january.on december,corrin sent mclaughlin the infringement letter and a copy of instructions and working drawings,and told him that w e have been selling this product since may.mclaughlin discussed the matter with bortz over the phone.bortz testified that he had looked at the drawings and told mclaughlin that for years or more,the whole industry has been making things like this.mclaughlin testified that he gave bortz an oral opinion that if we can prove that what the peterson company was doing with the present product,the ember flame booster for or years,then either they would not infringe any claim or that claim would be invalid.at the time,mclaughlin did not possess the accused device,the file wrapper,or any prior art.
on december,corrin sent a letter to golden blount,acknowledging receipt of the december,letter and stating that peterson would try to get back to them as soon as possible,but that january,is unreasonable.bortz testified that i t was around christmas time,and they were trying to determine what the patent meant because they did see anything in the patent that was things they had done for many years.on may,golden blount sent a letter to peterson stating that it had not received a response from peterson,that it had inspected the emb series ember flame booster and find the emb to be clearly within the scope of at least some of the claims of the subject patent,and that it will take necessary steps to stop any such infringement.on may,peterson sent a letter to golden blount in reply,which stated,in pertinent part 
y ou are correct in that we have not yet responded.
our lack of response has been due to at least in part to our inability to understand what you want.your december,letter states that your client has informed you that the robert peterson company is marketing a device that is substantially similar to the burner assembly that is claimed in each of the claims of the subject patent.we very much disagree with this statement.
your letter of may,states,we have inspected your emb series ember flame booster and find it to be clearly within the scope of at least some of the claims of the subject patent.
please explain to us,in detail,the basis upon which you believe that we are infringing on your client patent.
mclaughlin testified that he thought it reasonable under the circumstances to ask for a more detailed explanation because he would respond to such letters u sually by providing a more detailed explanation,which would be a c ross reference of the elements of the claim to the accused products.
there was no further communication by either party until january,when golden blount filed suit.mclaughlin testified that after suit was filed,bortz asked mclaughlin for another opinion of counsel,in part,because bortz had heard that an opinion could help avoid a charge of willful infringement.the following is bortz trial testimony regarding his conversation with mclaughlin 
q what was the other part of the conversation 
a well,i could understand the basis of the suit,the financial basis of the suit.and i just did see it all sic that there would be a reason to pursue.i did see any financial basis.so during the course of that conversation i did say that i have heard or have been told that in patent suits,if you lose,you may be required to pay fees of the other side.
q and your concern,then,was over what could amount to those very large patent lawyer fees that you were talking about earlier.your concern was about that rather than the fact that you might lose a rather small lawsuit is that right 
a no response 
q is that fair that what you told me,is it 
a well,i did understand the financial basis of the lawsuit.
q what do you mean by that,sir 
a what you brought up today.excuse me,yesterday.i sorry.
q you were of the opinion,were you not,sir,that the maximum that you might have to pay would be tied in to just the little ember booster item itself 
a that was my own thought process.
q and that was really much worth messing with,was it 
a on a financial basis,that is correct.
mclaughlin testified that he gave his client two additional oral opinions,one in february and another in may,both after suit had been filed.according to mclaughlin testimony,in the february opinion,he stated that based on a picture and a drawing of the accused device,he did not believe that the emb literally infringed any claim of the patent,and that at least some of the claims were invalid.in the may opinion,after reviewing the file wrapper for the first time,but still not having viewed the accused device,he concluded that none of the claims were literally infringed,that claims through were not infringed under the doctrine of equivalents,and that the remaining claims were invalid.mclaughlin testified that what he gleaned from an eventual inspection of the accused product,that he did not glean from the drawings,was insight into the relative position of the device.
in explaining its willfulness finding,the district court stated that in the two and years after peterson received notice of the patent,peterson never obtained a written opinion of counsel and that the oral opinions obtained by peterson were rendered without counsel having examined either the patent prosecution history or the accused device,and were thus incompetent.the district court criticized peterson for relying on an opinion of counsel based on the unproven representation of bortz that the invention had been around for to years.the district court found that peterson made no further efforts to determine whether it was truly infringing or not,until after suit was filed,and that peterson then sought another opinion in order to avoid a willfulness finding and liability for attorney fees.the district court also found that peterson was not concerned about paying infringement damages because,according to peterson,the suit was not a very meaningful case dollarwise.the district court found that the opinions were to be used only as an illusory shield against a later charge of willful infringement,rather than in a good faith attempt to avoid infringing another patent.the district court found that peterson continued infringement through may,and through the trial proceedings was particularly egregious.as to peterson explanation that it did not garner a more expansive opinion early on because it was awaiting additional information or further explanation of the infringement charge from blount attorney,the district court found that blount did not,after sending multiple notice of infringement letters owe peterson any obligation with regard to advising peterson how they actually were infringing.
peterson challenges the district court willfulness finding on two grounds.first,peterson argues that the district court drew an inference of the type prohibited by systeme fuer nutzfahrzeuge gmbh dana,en banc.peterson asserts that it had no duty to seek an opinion of counsel let alone a competent opinion,and that the district court could not consider whether it obtained an opinion of counsel in evaluating whether it discharged its duty of due care.peterson argues that while the lack of a competent opinion might leave it at a disadvantage in attempting to disprove willfulness,the lack of a competent opinion can not help golden blount make out its prima facie case that peterson acted willfully.peterson asserts that because the district court must disregard the evidence,the only affirmative evidence of peterson sought to avoid paying attorney not amount to reckless conduct and thus the district court clearly erred in finding willfulness.second,peterson argues that even in the absence of a formal opinion of counsel,because it held a reasonable,belief that it did not directly infringe and that its instructions did not induce its customers to infringe,it did not act in reckless disregard of the patent and thus the willfulness finding was clearly erroneous.peterson asserts that this belief was based on the facts that it was not regularly selling a apparatus to distributors and that it thought that it was recommending to customers that the emb be installed level with the primary burner,not below it.
golden blount counters that peterson understanding of the decision is wrong and that only addressed adverse inferences and merely eliminated the ability of the trier of fact to infer from the absence of an opinion letter that such an opinion,if rendered,would have been unfavorable to the potential infringer.golden blount further argues that the adverse inference holdings of do not apply to this case because peterson did not assert a privilege and offered up the opinions of counsel as a defense against the charge of willful infringement.golden blount asserts that the incompetent opinions,taken together with the other evidence presented,supports the finding of willfulness and that,based on all of the evidence,the district court willfulness determination was not clearly erroneous.
willfulness is a question of fact reviewed for clear error.slimfold kinkead.the extent to which the infringer disregarded the property rights of the patentee,the deliberateness of the tortious acts,or other manifestations of unethical or injurious commercial conduct,may provide grounds for a finding of willful infringement hoechst celanese bp chems.in this regard,there continues to be an affirmative duty of due care to avoid infringement of the known patent rights of others,at quoting gear thom mcan shoe.
the patentee bears the burden of persuasion and must prove willful infringement by clear and convincing evidence.comark commc ns,harris.there is no evidentiary presumption that every infringement is willful.norian stryker.willful infringement is not established by the simple fact of infringement,even where the accused has knowledge of the patents.accord ajinomoto.the patentee must present threshold evidence of culpable behavior before the burden of production shifts to the accused to put on evidence that it acted with due care.norian,at a bsent an initial presentation of evidence this burden of coming forward in defense does not arise.that threshold showing can not be satisfied merely by proof that the accused is asserting the privilege to withhold an opinion of counsel.as we explained in,this court precedent had until that point aided the patentee in making its case on willfulness by permitting the trier of fact to infer from an alleged infringer failure to produce an opinion letter that such an opinion,if rendered,was or would have been unfavorable to the alleged infringer.at.see also fromson litho plate supply.we overruled this precedent and held that t he adverse inference that an opinion was or would have been unfavorable,flowing from the infringer failure to obtain or produce an exculpatory opinion of counsel,is no longer warranted,at emphasis added accord imonex,munzprufer dietmar trenner gmbh,in that case,the affirmative duty of due care to avoid infringement was reiterated,but it was found no longer appropriate to draw an adverse inference with respect to willful infringement from failure to obtain legal advice.citing,at insituform,cat contracting,t he failure to obtain an exculpatory opinion of counsel shall no longer provide an adverse inference or presumption that such an opinion would have been unfavorable.quoting,at.
on the other hand,if the privilege is not asserted,the patentee in making its threshold showing of culpable conduct is free to introduce as evidence whatever opinions were obtained and to challenge the competence of those opinions in satisfaction of the patentee burden on willfulness.nothing in precludes a patentee from attempting to make such a showing.see ncube seachange int l,following jury verdict of willfulness,affirming the denial of a motion for jmol where infringer received notice of the patent when suit was filed and obtained an incompetent opinion upon which the infringer relied in continuing to infringe,at read portec,abrogated in part on other grounds by markman westview instruments,en banc,aff,d explaining that willfulness may be found in cases in which opinions are incompetent,such as where an attorney does not examine necessary facts,or where the analysis is superficial.
we reject peterson argument that the district court drew an inference of the type prohibited by from the fact that peterson failed to obtain a competent opinion of counsel.the district court did not infer that if peterson had obtained a competent opinion regarding the patent,the opinion would have been unfavorable to peterson.that would have been an improper basis upon which to rest a willfulness finding.see insituform,at vacating the district court finding of willfulness for drawing the type of negative inference prohibited by.instead,the district court considered all of the facts presented in assessing whether peterson acted in reckless disregard of golden blount patent rights after receiving notice of the patent.here,peterson did not assert the privilege and golden blount offered up as evidence in its case on willfulness,inter alia,the legal infirmities of the several oral opinions that peterson obtained.the competence of those opinions and the facts surrounding peterson obtaining of those opinions were relevant to the willfulness issue and properly were considered by the district court,along with all of the other evidence presented,both in assessing whether golden blount made out its prima facie case,see norian,at,and in deciding whether peterson infringement was willful,see insituform,at read,at.see also ncube,at.therefore,peterson first argument to overturn the willfulness finding is without merit.
we also reject peterson second argument.the district court did not clearly err in dismissing peterson asserted belief in,and thus in finding willfulness.peterson made effort to assess whether it infringed or whether the patent was invalid after receiving notice of the patent.the district court did not clearly err in according little weight to the first two oral opinions rendered by mclaughlin in light of the fact that mclaughlin did not have,and therefore could not have considered,the prosecution history or the accused device when the opinions were given.mclaughlin admission that he was able to better assess the relative position of the device when he was finally able to view the accused device illustrates the importance of possessing the accused device to the performance of an infringement analysis in this case.the district court also did not clearly err in criticizing peterson reliance on the representation of bortz that the invention had been around for to years.although the naked reliance on such a representation might have been reasonable if the accused product had been on the market for to years,the emb in this case had only been on the market a short period of time and peterson made little effort to uncover prior art until after suit was filed.furthermore,the district court did not clearly err in dismissing peterson assertions that it could not directly infringe because it sold the emb alone to distributors and that it could not induce infringement because it was recommending a level installation.as to the first argument,peterson ignores the fact that its sales of components presented questions of contributory and induced infringement.as to the second argument,peterson relies on testimony interpreting the instructions given to customers and testimony about how peterson burners ideally are positioned relative to one another.however,the district court had before it the actual instruction sheets,and,which taught the infringing configuration,and evidence that at least was contained in the package given to each.finally,the district court did not clearly err in inferring that peterson demonstrated a cavalier attitude toward golden blount patent rights from the facts that peterson did not respond substantively to golden blount notice letters and that it only sought a thorough opinion of counsel after suit was filed,and then only out of a concern to avoid a willfulness finding and a possible judgment for attorney fees.although other inferences may be drawn from these facts,we do not have a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.given all of the evidence,peterson assertions that it subjectively did not believe it was infringing are insufficient to rebut the inference of reckless conduct adequately supported by the facts presented.
the district court applied the test outlined in panduit stahlin.fibre works,cir,relied upon the largely testimony of blount and corrin,and found that there was sufficient demand for the product for the period in question,that there were no acceptable substitutes,and that golden blount had enough manufacturing and marketing capacity to promote the device.based on golden blount testimony that peterson and golden blount controlled of the market,the district court found that there was a market and that but for peterson infringing activities,blount would have made the sales it normally would have made.the district court noted that t o determine the actual damage amount in a lost profit case,it had to multiply blount per unit profit on the lost sale times the number of infringing devices that peterson sold.the district court found that golden blount had established two alternative bases from which to conclude that it would have lost the sale of the entire burner assembly,the grate,and a full set of artificial logs.the district court explained that the first basis was peterson infringement of claim,which positively claims the burner assembly positioned underneath the artificial logs and a means.the district court explained that the second basis was the rule,finding that the ember burner is the basis for the customer demand and that the elements of independent claims and,the burner assembly constitute a functional unit with the artificial logs and the grate support.the district court cited the testimony of charlie hanft hanft,a retailer,that of the time he sells an ember burner,he sells an entire
