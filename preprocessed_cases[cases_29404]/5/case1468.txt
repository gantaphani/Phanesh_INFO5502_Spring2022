this is a patent infringement case.floyd minks minks appeals from a final judgment that polaris industries polaris willfully infringed claim of patent the patent after a jury trial,the district court reduced the jury damages award from to after doubling and awarded attorney fees of,about half the requested amount.minks appeals the reduction in damages,as well as the amount of attorney fees awarded.he also asserts on appeal that the jury instruction as to the date polaris received actual notice of the alleged infringement was erroneous.polaris from the district court denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law jmol on noninfringement and from the jury finding of willfulness.because the district court reduced the jury compensatory damages award without offering minks a new trial,and because the court instruction on actual notice failed to apprise the jury of the proper legal standard,he is entitled to a new trial on damages.conversely,we affirm the award of attorney fees,but we note that the trial judge may exercise his discretion to modify the award if it warrants further consideration on remand.additionally,because the jury finding of infringement is supported by substantial evidence,we affirm the district court denial of polaris jmol motion.we also affirm the jury finding of willful infringement because polaris has failed to establish plain error in the willfulness instruction to the jury.
background 
the patent is directed to an electronic governor system for internal combustion engines.patent.in particular,the patent teaches a circuit to limit the speed of an vehicle atv when it is operated in the reverse,a reverse speed limiter.id.at.the reverse speed limiter circuit of the patent is activated by shifting the atv into reverse gear so that the circuit senses the direct current dc voltage used to illuminate a reverse indicator or back up illumination lamp on the a of figure.id.at.if the engine is coupled to a permanent magnet type alternator,the alternating current ac output will increase linearly with engine speed.id.at.accordingly,once activated,the circuit depicted in figure of the patent senses the alternator ac voltage b of figure sensing engine speed.id.at to.if the alternator ac voltage output exceeds a predetermined limit,the 
circuit emits a control signal to interrupt the ignition of the c of figure.id.at.engine ignition is restored when the engine speed decreases to the point that the alternator ac voltage output falls below the predetermined limit.id.at.
claim of patent is the only asserted claim.it states 
a system for selectively inhibiting ignition above a preselected engine speed for an internal combustion engine,said system comprising 
a means for providing an electrical input which varies in a predetermined manner with engine speed 
b control means adapted to control the ignition of said engine,said control means including means for inhibiting ignition responsive to a control signal and 
c means for providing said control signal responsive to a direct current voltage input to thereby selectively inhibit ignition responsive to the speed of said engine.
patent.the parties agree both that claim is a claim to be analyzed under and that figure is the only structure disclosed in the patent that corresponds to claim.
minks,the inventor of the patent,is an electrical engineer who designs electronic components for a variety of vehicle types including atvs.minks designs and patents the components,which are then manufactured and sold by minks engineering,the exclusive licensee of the patent.polaris is a manufacturer of atvs that has been purchasing electrical components from minks engineering since about.the reverse speed limiter of the patent stems from one of minks designs for polaris.in,polaris engaged minks in discussions regarding the patent and the ability to purchase reverse speed limiters from different manufacturers.at this point,minks informed polaris that reverse speed limiters based on engine speed and a dc input were covered by the patent.during that same time period,polaris began implementing a new speedometer in its atvs that had an integrated reverse speed limiter,which polaris described to minks as sensing ground speed rather than engine speed.in or,polaris got a quote from a new vendor for a part that included a reverse speed limiter,but on september,minks sent polaris a letter confirming that the new vendor was refusing to build the quoted part because it would infringe the patent.in,polaris and minks exchanged additional communications regarding polaris continued interest in licensing the patent.also in,minks discovered that,contrary to polaris earlier representations,polaris new integrated reverse speed limiters did sense engine speed.accordingly,minks purchased a polaris atv,confirmed that it infringed the patent,and sent polaris a letter to this effect on november.
on december,minks filed suit against polaris,alleging that polaris infringed apparatus claim of the patent.after a trial,the jury found that polaris received actual notice of alleged infringement on november,that polaris willfully infringed claim of the patent,and that minks was entitled to in royalty damages.the district court subsequently granted polaris motion for a reduction in damages or remittitur pursuant to rule e and reduced the jury damages award to.minks polaris.may,damages reduction order.the court,however,reduced the damages award as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure without offering minks a new trial on damages.id.at.based on the jury finding of willfulness,the court doubled this award to in an amended judgment entered on may.the court also awarded attorney fees plus costs however,in accordance with the reduction in damages,the court awarded in fees and half of the amount requested.final judgment was entered on june,and the court denied minks motion for reconsideration on june.
minks filed a notice of appeal on july,challenging the district court reduction of the damages award,the amount of attorney fees awarded,and the jury instruction on actual notice.on august,polaris filed a notice of from the district court denial of its jmol motion on noninfringement.on september,shortly after this court issued its decision in in re seagate technology,llc,en banc,polaris filed an amended notice of,appealing the enhancement of damages and grant of attorney fees on the grounds that the jury instruction on willfulness was plain error under seagate.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to a.
discussion 
we review issues not unique to patent law according to the law of the regional circuit where appeals from the district court would normally lie.tronzo biomet,tronzo ii.
in this case,the jury awarded over one million dollars in compensatory royalty damages to minks,but the trial court granted polaris rule motion for a reduction of damages and reduced this award to less than thirty thousand dollars without offering minks the option of a new trial.the court noted that although t he seventh amendment ordinarily requires that a plaintiff be given the option of a new trial in lieu of remitting a portion of the jury award,this mandate does not apply when the reduction in a damages award is necessitated by legal error.damages reduction order at citing johansen combustion eng g,cir.applying this rule,the court reviewed minks evidence on damages and found legal error,concluding that at most the legally competent evidence in the record supported a jury award based on a price per reverse speed limiter of,a reasonable royalty of percent,and total infringing sales during the pertinent period of,for a total compensatory damage award of.id.at.the issue before us on appeal is whether the seventh amendment required the district court to offer minks the option of a new trial in lieu of accepting the reduced damages award 
in the eleventh circuit,the district court decision to reduce the jury damages award without offering minks a new trial is a matter of law reviewed de novo.see johansen,at see also tronzo ii,at identifying issue as a matter of law.
the reexamination clause of the seventh amendment states that no fact tried by a jury,shall be otherwise in any court of the united states,than according to the rules of common law.const.amend.vii.t he reexamination clause does not inhibit the authority of a trial judge to grant new trials for any of the reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in actions at law in the courts of the united states.gasperini ctr.for humanities,d.this authority extends to overturning verdicts for excessiveness and ordering a new trial without qualification,or conditioned on the verdict winner refusal to agree to a reduction remittitur.id.citing dimick schiedt.nevertheless,the supreme court has long interpreted the seventh amendment as requiring that the exercise of a district court discretion to set aside an excessive jury award be accompanied by an offer of a new trial.for example,in kennon gilmer the court stated 
i n a case in which damages for a tort have been assessed by a jury at an entire sum,no court of law,upon a motion for a new trial for excessive damages and for insufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict,is authorized,according to its own estimate of the amount of damages which the plaintiff ought to have recovered,to enter an absolute judgment for any other sum than that assessed by the jury.
the court reaffirmed this principle in hetzel prince william county,holding that the entry of judgment for a lesser amount than that awarded by the jury,without the offer of a new trial,can not be squared with the seventh amendment when the reduction is premised on a finding that the evidence does not support the award,d.
despite its recognition of this rule,the eleventh circuit held in johansen that when a jury award is premised on legal error,a court may reduce the award and enter an absolute judgment in an amount sufficient to correct the legal error without offering the plaintiff the option of a new trial.compare johansen,at,stating that the seventh amendment prohibits reexamination of a jury determination of the facts,which includes its assessment of the extent of plaintiff injury,and analyzing hetzel,with id.at the seventh amendment is not offended by this reduction because the issue is one of law and not fact.johansen considered whether a federal court may reduce a punitive damages award by an amount required by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment without offering the plaintiff a new trial.in its analysis,the court identified two types of legal error that permit the reduction of a jury award without the offer of a new trial.first,where a portion of a verdict is for an identifiable amount that is not permitted by law,the court may simply modify the jury verdict to that extent and enter judgment for the correct amount.id.at citing,estill.second,a court may reduce a jury punitive damages award when the award enter s that zone of arbitrariness that violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.id.at,quoting bmw of,gore,d.importantly,both types of error derive from the operation of legal principles without regard to the evidence presented by the plaintiff.that is,legal errors permitting the reduction of a jury award without the offer of a new trial arise without regard to whether the jury award is or is not supportable as an evidentiary matter 
under the eleventh circuit analysis of supreme court precedent,we conclude that the district court reduction of the jury compensatory damages award in this case is governed squarely by hetzel.the jury found the patent valid and infringed,and awarded minks a reasonable royalty of.in its analysis of this award,the district court identified no legal as was present in estill state law prohibition on awarding interest or johansen due process clause of the fourteenth amendment that would limit the amount of a reasonable royalty in this case.rather,the district court examined the evidence in the record with respect to the components of a reasonable of infringing sales,royalty base,and royalty found that the evidence could not support the jury damages award.damages reduction order at.the court further found that at most the legally competent evidence in the record supported a jury award based on a price per reverse speed limiter of,a reasonable royalty of percent,and total infringing sales of,for a total compensatory damage award of.id.at.despite its effort to cast this decision as one of law rather than fact,the court necessarily engaged in an independent review of the evidence and substituted its conclusion for that of the jury on the factual issue of compensatory damages.cooper,leatherman tool group,d unlike the measure of actual damages suffered,which presents a question of historical or predictive fact,the level of punitive damages is not really a fact tried by the jury.quoting gasperini,at.scalia,dissenting see also micro,lextron,the amount of damages based on a reasonable royalty is an issue of fact.
under,minks is entitled to a compensatory award no less than a reasonable royalty.kelley,a patentee is entitled to no less than a reasonable royalty on an infringer sales for which the patentee has not established entitlement to lost profits.citing.a reasonable royalty may be based upon an established royalty,if there is one,or if not,upon the supposed result of hypothetical negotiations between the plaintiff and defendant.id.citing hanson alpine valley ski area.the hypothetical negotiation requires the court to envision the terms of a licensing agreement reached as the result of a supposed meeting between the patentee and the infringer at the time infringement began.id.a determination of the royalty stemming from a hypothetical negotiation is often made by assessing factors such as those set forth in plywood.see maxwell baker,at.a comparison of the factors and the standard of a hypothetical negotiation to the evidence of record in this case makes clear that the district court reduction of compensatory damages necessarily amounted to an assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence,and as such,the option of a new trial was required.
the first factor looks to t he royalties received by the patentee for the licensing of the patent in suit,proving or tending to prove an established royalty.at.the district court relied on the most recent agreement between minks and minks engineering,under which minks receives a four percent royalty on total gross sales of patented and unpatented items,yet minks testified that this agreement was but the latest in a series of royalty agreements.under a previous agreement,for example,minks had received a ten percent royalty based solely on the sale of patented items.as the reasonable royalty award to which minks is entitled in this case is based solely on patented reverse speed limiters,the district court was required to assess the sufficiency of minks testimony to support an established royalty of four percent,ten percent,or some other rate.
similarly,the sixth factor looks to t he effect of selling the patented specialty in promoting sales of other products of the licensee that existing value of the invention to the licensor as a generator of sales of his items and the extent of such derivative or convoyed sales.at.in this case,polaris discussed licensing the patent from minks beginning in,but minks refused.instead,the parties negotiated an agreement under which polaris ordered approximately million in both patented and unpatented merchandise over several years.during that time,minks was compensated at a rate of four percent on all these sales.accordingly,the district court must have assessed whether the evidence of these negotiations,in which minks was able to secure sales of items,was sufficient to support a reasonable royalty rate higher than four percent.
finally,the hypothetical negotiation is deemed to be an arm length transaction,at.courts should not,therefore,accept as conclusive the royalty arrangement between the patent owner and the single licensee,a close corporation owned by the inventor family cheramie orgeron,cir.indeed,the district court in employed this exact reasoning in its determination of the royalty rate that was affirmed by this court.see kelley,aff in part,rev in part,this court also places little weight upon the royalty rate that mike white paid for patents when mike white bought from his father.such an sale is too dissimilar from this hypothetical situation in which one competitor voluntarily grants a novel license to its primary competitor.see also ziggity,val watering,eldon hostetler owns part of ziggity and,therefore,has an interest in assigning his patent rights to ziggity in exchange for a low royalty rate.what is a reasonable royalty rate between an inventor and his own company is clearly not a reasonable royalty rate between two competitors in the same line of business.although the record is not wholly clear on the relationship between minks and minks engineering,they are not competitors.as such,the district court must have considered whether the evidence in this case warranted a departure from the royalty rate established between minks and minks engineering.
we need not consider the exact reasonable royalty supported by this evidence.gasperini,at.however,the district court exercise of discretion to assess the evidence and overturn the jury verdict upon a determination that it is excessive may only result in the order of a new trial,either unqualified or conditioned on minks refusal to accept a reduction.see also hetzel,at.stating that entry of judgment for a lesser amount than that determined by the jury without allowing petitioner the option of a new trial,can not be squared with the seventh amendment.
we further conclude that this court decision in tronzo ii is not to the contrary.tronzo ii affirmed the judgment of the district court,entered following this court remand order in tronzo biomet,tronzo i,which reduced a jury compensatory damages award without offering the plaintiff a new trial.to the extent that tronzo ii remains good law the facts and procedure of that case are distinguishable from the present appeal.
in tronzo i,the defendant appealed from a jury verdict of willful patent infringement,breach of a confidential relationship,and fraud.after reversing the judgment of infringement or validity as to all asserted claims of the patent,the court considered whether the compensatory damage award for the state law claims was supportable under either a constructive trust lost profits theory or a reasonable royalty.tronzo i,at.the court ruled that neither remedy was available under state law because these types of awards lack the requisite nexus between the damages claimed and the injury incurred.id.at citing rucker garlock,so d.moreover,because tort damages are awarded to place the plaintiff in the position he would have been absent the tortious conduct,the court remanded the case to the district court for a determination of whether the record contained evidence to prove any of the costs and injuries incurred by the plaintiff,such as the costs of prosecuting the patent and lost business opportunities.id.
on remand,the district court found,aside from in patent prosecution costs,a complete absence of competent substantial evidence to support the award of damages in tort.tronzo ii,at quoting district court opinion on remand.the district court further declined to the record and take new evidence on damages actually sustained by the plaintiff,reasoning that both parties had been represented by competent counsel and had made strategic decisions in this protracted litigation.id.accordingly,the district court entered a judgment for compensatory damages of on the state law claims reduced from the initial jury award of without offering the plaintiff the option of a new trial.
in its affirmance of the district court reduction of the compensatory damages award,tronzo ii ruled that the reduction was made on purely legal grounds.at citing johansen,at,for the proposition that such a reduction need not be accompanied by the option of a new trial.because the plaintiff never introduced any legally competent evidence to support an award of lost business opportunities,the plaintiff only introduced evidence of the gain realized by the defendant that the court rejected in tronzo i the district court did not reweigh any evidence,nor did it exercise its discretion in computing the damages award.id.emphases added.to reach this result,the court distinguished hetzel on the grounds that the reduction of the compensatory award in that case was an exercise of discretion based on a conclusion that the award was excessive in light of the limited evidence of harm.id.emphasis added.
comparing the holding of tronzo ii with the analysis of hetzel therein,the district court reduction of compensatory reasonable royalty damages in this case must be adjudged under the rule of hetzel.as set forth above,minks has presented at least limited evidence that the district court necessarily rejected in adopting a reasonable royalty rate of four percent.thus,even under tronzo ii,the district court decision here amounts to an exercise of discretion subject to hetzel requirement that minks be offered a new trial.
for these reasons,we vacate the district court order reducing the jury compensatory damages award to,and we remand for a new trial on damages.
ii.attorney fees 
based on the jury finding of willful infringement,the district court found the case exceptional and awarded minks enhanced damages and attorney fees under.the court determined that a reasonable fee under this section would be,after all deductions.however,the district court criticized minks damages theory as economic nonsense and only awarded half the reasonable fee to offset the great deal of time during trial that was wasted by plaintiff attempting to evade the basic laws of economics and common sense.we review an award of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion.acco brands,aba locks mfrs.although we herein vacate the district court judgment reducing the compensatory damages award without offering minks a new trial,we detect no abuse of discretion in the award of attorney fees.even on appeal,minks remains unable or unwilling to articulate a coherent damages theory.we therefore affirm the award of attorney fees,but we note that the trial judge may exercise his discretion to modify the award if it warrants further consideration on remand.
iii.notice instruction 
under a,where a patentee has failed to mark its patented product,no damages shall be recovered by the patentee in any action for infringement,except on proof that the infringer was notified of the infringement and continued to infringe thereafter,in which event damages may be recovered only for infringement occurring after such notice.neither party disputes that minks engineering did not mark its products and that the damages recoverable by minks are therefore limited by the date that polaris received notice satisfying the requirements of a.the jury found that minks november,letter to polaris,which informed polaris of minks belief that polaris integrated reverse speed limiters infringed the patent,satisfied a notice requirement.minks did not move for jmol on the issue of notice under a,but he does seek a new trial based on legal error in the court instructions to the jury.
despite the absence of a motion for jmol,minks may still challenge a jury verdict by establishing that the judge committed legal error or abused his discretion.advanced display,kent state.if a jury instruction is objected to,and a curative instruction was requested,we review the instruction de novo for legal error.united states klopf,cir a trial judge refusal to give a requested instruction will warrant a new trial only if the requested instruction was substantively correct,the court charge to the jury did not cover the gist of the instruction,and the failure to give the instruction substantially impaired the defendant ability to present an effective defense.quoting united states roberts,cir per curiam see also,plastic recovery techs,a party seeking to alter a judgment based on erroneous jury instructions must establish that it made a proper and timely objection to the jury instructions,those instructions were legally erroneous,the errors had prejudicial effect,and it requested alternative instructions that would have remedied the error.in deciding whether a defendant requested instruction was substantially covered by the actual charge delivered to the jury,we need only ascertain whether the charge,when viewed as a whole,fairly and correctly states the issues and the law.klopf,at quoting united states gonzalez,cir.
the district court gave the following instruction on actual notice 
the date notice was given is the date on which minks communicated to polaris a specific charge that one of its products may infringe claim two of the patent.
minks objected to this instruction on the grounds that it precludes a jury from finding notice prior to discovery of polaris infringement.minks thus requested the following instruction 
the date notice was given is the date on which minks communicated to polaris a specific charge that one of its products infringed or would infringe claim two of the patent.
minks argues that the proposed instruction indicates that a patentee can provide sufficiently specific notice to an accused infringer before the patentee discovers the actual infringement by the accused.we agree with minks that the given instruction does not fairly and correctly state the issues and the law the jury should have been more clearly instructed that it was permitted to find notice prior to the date minks discovered polaris infringement.
section a requires actual notice to the accused to assure that the recipient knew of the adverse patent during the period in which liability accrues,when constructive notice by marking is absent.sri int l,tech.i n sri we explained that as long as the communication from the patentee provides sufficient specificity regarding its belief that the recipient may be an infringer,the statutory requirement of actual notice is met.thus,the requirement of a specific charge of infringement set forth in amsted does not mean the patentee must make an unqualified charge of infringement.gart logitech,internal citation omitted.under this standard,general letters referring to the patent and including an admonishment not to infringe do not constitute actual notice.see amsted indus.buckeye steel castings.conversely,letters that specifically identify a product and offer a license for that product do constitute actual notice.see gart,at.
under our case law,minks made a qualified charge of infringement when he informed polaris that reverse speed limiters that sensed engine speed and a dc input infringe the patent.actual notice thus turns on the point at which this any of its various forms in the history of the relationship between minks and sufficiently specific such that polaris knew of the adverse patent and the alleged infringement.gart,at.as a long time customer of minks engineering,polaris knew of the patent.moreover,as early as,minks specifically communicated his belief that reverse speed limiters sensing engine speed and a dc input infringe the patent.similarly,on september,minks sent polaris a letter confirming that a third party vendor was refusing to build a quoted reverse speed limiter for polaris because the quoted part would infringe the patent.during this time period,polaris misrepresented the nature of its substitute reverse speed limiter,employed since,as sensing ground speed rather than engine speed.although it is not for us to determine whether,as a factual matter,any of these exchanges were sufficient actual notice under a,the court instruction to the jury should have more clearly articulated that,in the context of this ongoing relationship between the parties,knowledge of a specific infringing device is not a legal prerequisite to such a finding.
iv.infringement 
polaris from the district court denial of its jmol motion on noninfringement the denial of a jmol motion is also reviewed de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.nebula glass int l,reichhold,cir.when conducting this analysis,the jury verdict is reviewed for substantial evidence,drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant.odetics,storage tech.substantial evidence is evidence relevant to the matter at hand that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate when a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.go med.indus,inmed,quoting.a.
the parties do not dispute that claim of the patent is a means plus function claim that falls under.that paragraph states 
an element in a claim for a combination may be expressed as a means or step for performing a specified function without the recital of structure,material,or acts in support thereof,and such claim shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure,material,or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof.
the first step in construing such a limitation is to identify the function of the limitation.texas digital,telegenix.the next step is to identify the corresponding structure in the written description necessary to perform that function.id.structure disclosed in the specification is corresponding structure only if the specification or prosecution history clearly links or associates that structure to the function recited in the claim.id.quoting braun,abbott.because figure in the patent is the only structure linked or associated with the functions required by claim,the district court concluded that the limitations of claim are limited to the structures set forth in figure and their equivalents.minks polaris,d.
the parties do not dispute that the circuitry of the accused devices differs from that taught by figure of the patent.specifically,polaris atvs sense engine speed based on the frequency of the alternator ac output,while the circuit of figure is only capable of sensing the voltage of an alternator ac output as such,the parties also agree that the accused circuitry has different components than those shown in figure of the patent.nevertheless,the district court denied polaris jmol motion of noninfringement,ruling that 
the jury heard evidence that the amplitude and the frequency of the ac voltage both vary predictably with engine speed and that,to one skilled in the art of circuit engineering,they are equivalent for purposes of determining speed.as such the jury could reasonably conclude that the methods employed in the patent and in the accused devices were equivalent or interchangeable.
minks polaris,wl.may.we agree with the district court.
to determine whether a particular limitation is met,the court must compare the accused structure with the disclosed structure,and must find equivalent structure as well as identity of claimed function for that structure.chiuminatta concrete concepts,cardinal,quoting pennwalt,en banc.polaris argues that the accused devices do not have an identical function to the claimed function because the accused devices sense the frequency of the alternator ac output rather than its peak voltage.however,the function for which the accused device must be identical is the function specified in the claim.group lagard,citing pennwalt,at.here,the function of element c of claim is providing said control signal responsive to a direct current voltage input to thereby selectively inhibit ignition responsive to the speed of said engine.patent emphasis added.polaris makes no argument that the accused devices do not perform this claimed function.accordingly,the district court denial of polaris jmol motion was not improper on this basis.
in addition to identity of function,the accused device must have equivalent structure.equivalence between the accused structure and that set forth in the specification has been analyzed under a reduced version of the tripartite test for the doctrine of equivalence,whether it performs the function in substantially the same way to achieve substantially the same result.ims,haas automation.on cross appeal,polaris argues that a finding of equivalent structure requires a finding that the accused frequency sensitive devices contain components equivalent to the voltage divider and and switching transistor.polaris further posits,without citation to the record,that this combination of components is respo
