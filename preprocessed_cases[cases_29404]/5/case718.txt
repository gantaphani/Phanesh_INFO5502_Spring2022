this case is satellite litigation emanating from the legal battle over the remapping of chicago aldermanic wards following the census.though it presents only a claim for unreimbursed attorneys fees and related litigation expenses,it is dressed up in constitutional clothing.the plaintiffs are chicago aldermen who challenged the city ward map in court and then claimed that the city refusal to finance their legal expenses in that litigation violated their equal protection and free speech rights.
illinois law requires the city council to redraw chicago aldermanic ward boundaries after each national census.the city attempt to create a new ward map after the census generated more than its share of federal litigation.chicago aldermen were divided with a few exceptions into two opposing camps during the political struggle over the new ward administration aldermen,aligned with mayor richard daley,and the opposition aldermen.when the two sides could not agree,their competing ward maps were submitted to chicago voters via referendum as required by state law.the map proposed by the administration aldermen was adopted by voters and became law.
the new map was challenged in several federal lawsuits,and the two aldermanic factions lined up against each other in the consolidated litigation.as the case progressed,the city council authorized payment of the attorneys fees and expenses of the administration aldermen who intervened to defend the map but not the opposition aldermen who sued to invalidate it.this decision spawned the present lawsuit,in which the opposition aldermen argued that this unequal treatment in the payment of attorneys fees was unconstitutional.the suit remained pending while the redistricting litigation proceeded to trial,appeal,remand for limited retrial,and ultimately settlement.the opposition aldermen partially prevailed and were awarded some million in attorneys fees under the provisions of the voting rights act,and e.
about in litigation expenses,however,were not included in the fee award,and those remaining unpaid expenses are at issue in this action.the district court granted summary judgment for the city on the free speech claim.following a bench trial on the equal protection claim,the court concluded that the city decision to pay the litigation expenses of the aldermen who defended the city remap ordinance in court but not those who challenged it failed the test.the court was strongly influenced by an earlier decision of the city council to pay the litigation expenses of aldermen who sued the former mayor in an unrelated set of lawsuits stemming from the council wars of the.this,the court said,required the city live with its decisions and treat other in like fashion.the court awarded the opposition aldermen their unreimbursed legal expenses plus prejudgment interest.
we reverse.no fundamental right or suspect classification is implicated here,so the city action is reviewed only for a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest.this is a lenient standard,but the district court failed to treat it as such.defending the city ordinances against legal challenge is unquestionably a legitimate municipal interest,and it was entirely rational for the city to pay the litigation expenses of the aldermen who intervened on the city side in defense of the duly adopted ward map but not those of the aldermen who sued to invalidate it.that the city council authorized payment of legal expenses for certain other in unrelated litigation years earlier does not obligate the city to finance all subsequent aldermanic litigation against operation of the equal protection clause or any other principle.the city is thus not required to live with its prior decisions in the sense suggested by the district court.
the free speech clause of the first amendment does not provide an alternative basis upon which to uphold the judgment.the government decision not to subsidize the exercise of a constitutional right does not infringe the right.this case does not involve viewpoint discrimination within a speech forum or a generalized subsidy program for private litigation.the city decision not to underwrite the opposition aldermen legal challenge to the ward map did not violate their free speech rights.
background 
illinois law provides that if the chicago city council fails to pass a redistricting ordinance in the year that a national census is conducted,proposed ordinances supported by at least of the aldermen may be submitted to the electorate for a referendum vote.see ilcs.a referendum vote became necessary in the remapping process that followed the census when the administration aldermen and opposition aldermen could not reach consensus on a new aldermanic ward map.on march,the voters of chicago approved the ward map submitted by the administration aldermen,and this map consequently achieved the status of a city ordinance.
three lawsuits challenging the validity of the redistricting ordinance followed closely on the heels of the referendum.in the first,barnett daley,nine voters alleged that the map violated the voting rights act they named all aldermen as defendants in the suit.the aldermen were dismissed as defendants at an early stage of the barnett litigation.the second suit,also alleging violations of the voting rights act,was brought by the opposition aldermen.in this case,smith daley,no aldermen were named as defendants.the third suit,bonilla city council,was brought by latino voters and also did not name any aldermen as defendants.the administration aldermen were permitted to intervene as defendants in all three cases for purposes of defending the remap ordinance,and they retained private legal counsel to represent them.the opposition aldermen also retained private counsel for purposes of pursuing their claims as the plaintiffs in smith.the city of chicago and the mayor,also defendants in the three cases,were represented by the office of the city corporation counsel.
the three cases were consolidated for a bench trial,and the district court entered judgment for the defendants on all claims.see barnett city of.on appeal,this court affirmed the judgment in bonilla but,for reasons not relevant here,vacated the judgments in barnett and smith and remanded with directions for a limited retrial.barnett city of,cir.on remand,the district court held that the voting rights act required a modification to the ward map ordinance to incorporate an additional supermajority ward,and the parties entered into a consent decree modifying the ordinance in conformity with the district court decision.see barnett city of,d.the district court ultimately awarded more than million in attorneys fees to the plaintiffs in the barnett and smith cases as prevailing parties pursuant to the provisions applicable to successful claims under the voting rights act,and e.see barnett city of,d,aff.cir the district court award of fees did not include primarily expert witness fees that were incurred by the opposition aldermen but were not recoverable under the voting rights act or other provisions.this amount is the subject matter of the present case.
as the redistricting litigation made its way through the federal courts for nearly a decade,the city paid the attorneys fees incurred by the administration aldermen.the opposition aldermen request for payment of attorneys fees,however,was denied.specifically,on february,opposition alderman lawrence bloom wrote to administration alderman edward burke,in burke capacity as chairman of the city council committee on finance,requesting payment of legal fees on behalf of the opposition aldermen.alderman burke denied the request,citing a provision in the chicago municipal code governing payment of city officials attorneys fees 
in my opinion there is no basis in the municipal code of the city of chicago to authorize payment of your legal fees.section of the municipal code authorizes the payment of legal fees for city officials when the action has been brought against them for activities performed in the course of their employment.this section does not authorize the payment of legal fees for those persons bringing the action if you believe that there is any legal authority pursuant to which the city of chicago may pay your legal fees i would welcome you to share this authority with me.
alderman burke reiterated his position in a second letter to alderman bloom 
s ection of the municipal ordinances authorizes the city of chicago to appoint outside counsel to defend an official or employee in an action or claim brought against the employee or official.it is clear that your lawyer is acting as the lead plaintiffs attorney in this litigation.i have not found any language in the municipal code to authorize the committee on finance to pay the fees of outside lawyers hired to sue the city of chicago,its officials and employees.
in february,the opposition aldermen filed this action against the city of chicago alleging that the city refusal to pay their attorneys fees while simultaneously paying the fees incurred by the administration aldermen violated their free speech and equal protection rights under the first and fourteenth amendments.the suit remained pending for the next eight years until the underlying redistricting litigation reached its conclusion in.in january,the city moved for summary judgment,and the district court dismissed the free speech claim but preserved the equal protection claim for trial.following an bench trial,the district court held that the opposition aldermen had been treated differently because of their membership in a group that opposed the referendum map espoused by the c ity,the city applied the attorneys fees ordinance unequally with respect to plaintiffs,and the city lacked a rational basis for this difference in treatment.the court entered judgment in favor of the opposition aldermen in the amount of their previously unreimbursed litigation expenses,plus an additional in prejudgment interest.
in reaching these conclusions,the district court relied heavily on the fact that the city had,in unrelated litigation predating the present dispute by nearly a decade,paid the legal expenses of a group of aldermen including alderman burke who sued mayor harold washington and other city officials during the turbulent council wars that followed washington election in.see roti washington,d,roti i roti washington,d,roti ii.the roti cases arose out of a power struggle for control of the city council and tested the validity of certain resolutions adopted by competing aldermanic factions regarding the organization and operation of the council.the city assumed payment of attorneys fees for both sides in the roti alderman burke group,which had initiated the suits.burke,as chairman of the finance committee,authorized the payment.
the district court held that given the city action in the roti cases,its reason for denying attorneys fees to the opposition aldermen in the redistricting it would not authorize payment of attorneys fees for officials who sued the unavailing as a rational basis.the court declared that the city must now live with its prior decisions and treat other in like fashion.
ii.discussion 
equal protection 
we note at the outset that the equal protection claim in this case suffers from a good deal of conceptual confusion the precise contours of the claim are at best fuzzy.the district court held that the city,acting through alderman burke,applied the attorneys fees ordinance in a discriminatory manner in denying the opposition aldermen request for attorneys fees.the ordinance in question,chicago municipal code,authorizes payment of attorneys fees for city officials and employees when claims or actions are brought against them for their conduct.more specifically,provides,in pertinent part 
if any claim or action is instituted against a current or former elected official,current or former appointed official or current or former employee of the city of chicago where such claim arises out of any act or omission,made in good faith,occurring within the scope of such person office or employment,the chairman of the committee on finance of the city council,with the approval and concurrence of the mayor,may at the request of such person appoint counsel to defend such person against any such claim or action.
on appeal,the opposition aldermen describe their equal protection the district court broadly than the district court apparently viewed it.they characterize their claim as a challenge to the city discriminatory application of its funding ordinances in denying their request for attorneys fees in the redistricting litigation.at oral argument,we asked counsel for the opposition aldermen to identify which other funding ordinances beyond at issue here he responded that alderman burke was limited to,but was not more specific.following argument,counsel moved to clarify or to correct statements made at oral argument and identified certain numerical line items in the city annual appropriations ordinance as the source of alderman burke authority to pay attorneys fees claims of city officials.
this broader characterization of the equal protection claim appears to be on somewhat better footing than the district court.the language of the attorneys fees ordinance plainly does not authorize payment of attorneys fees for officials who sue the city.the ordinance by its terms is limited to payment of attorneys fees for city officials or employees in claims instituted against them for their conduct.a strictly literal reading of this language also appears to exclude payment of the administration aldermen attorneys fees in the redistricting litigation,as they intervened as defendants.it plausibly could be argued that the ordinance,broadly construed,would allow payment of the administration aldermen attorneys fees as,they were aligned with the city officials against whom the redistricting claims were originally instituted.but even the most expansive interpretation of would not encompass claims instituted by elected officials against the city or its officers,and that necessarily excludes the opposition aldermen request for attorneys fees from the scope of the ordinance.
the ordinance on its face thus classifies city officials and employees in a way that discriminates against the opposition aldermen officials and employees who are sued in their official capacities get their attorneys fees paid,but officials and employees who sue the city do not.but the opposition aldermen have specifically disavowed any facial constitutional challenge to they have characterized their claim as an as applied challenge to the city unequal enforcement of its funding ordinances,presumably including.the district court treated the actual terms of as unimportant for purposes of equal protection analysis regardless of the ordinance proper interpretation,the court said,the city,which voluntarily chose to reimburse the roti aldermen notwithstanding their status as plaintiffs must now live with those decisions and treat other in like fashion.
we can not agree.first,the proper interpretation of a statute is hardly irrelevant to a determination of the statute constitutionality,either on its face or as applied.there can be little doubt that the question of whether a statute is constitutional fairly includes the question of what the statute says.rumsfeld forum for academic institutional rights,d.second,a prior misapplication of the that what occurred in the roti not estop the city from applying it correctly in a subsequent case.the equal protection clause does not entitle the opposition aldermen to a misinterpretation of the ordinance.because does not authorize payment of their attorneys fees,the district court conclusion that the city applied the ordinance unequally with respect to plaintiffs is legally untenable.so there must be some other basis for the equal protection claim apart from an as applied challenge to the attorneys fees ordinance.
the alternative conceptualization of the claim offered up by the opposition aldermen has its own deficiencies.in their brief they argued that the district court correctly found the city had no rational basis for its inconsistent application of its funding ordinances apparently not just but other,unspecified funding ordinances as well.this overstates the district court holding,at least as the court purported to limit it.in a footnote to the memorandum opinion and order filed following the bench trial,the court specifically noted that although the p laintiffs have offered some evidence that the city paid the legal expenses from sources besides,the court was confining its analysis to.at the same time,however,the district court opinion assumes the existence of authority to pay aldermen attorneys fees apart from that conferred by that much is implicit in the court holding that the city had no rational basis to deny the opposition aldermen request for fees while granting the requests of other aldermen who would arguably be excluded from the scope of the ordinance.also,the opinion variously uses the plural fee payment ordinances or generically,ordinances.given the internal confusion,we will give the district court holding the broader interpretation the opposition aldermen ascribe to it.
the opposition aldermen did not their brief other funding ordinances they claim the city inconsistently applied.as we have noted,after oral argument counsel identified the annual appropriations ordinance as the other funding ordinance at issue in the case.although the district court did not rely on it,it is in the record.the specific line items counsel identifies appear to be general funds restricted only by the following language for legal,technical,medical and professional services to be expended at the direction of the chairman of the committee on finance.it appears we are being asked to assume that the other annual appropriations ordinances covering the duration of the redistricting litigation contain similar line items and language.we note as an aside that this court has previously described the extreme protraction of the redistricting litigation as absurd.barnett,at.
as best we can understand it,then,the equal protection violation at issue in this case can be summarized as follows without regard to,the finance chairman has discretion to pay,from a generally unrestricted legal and professional services fund in the annual appropriations ordinance,the attorneys fees incurred by city officials alderman burke exercised that discretion in a discriminatory fashion in disallowing the opposition aldermen request for payment of attorneys fees while authorizing payment of the administration aldermen attorneys fees there is no rational basis for the discriminatory treatment.with that recapitulation of the claim,we proceed at last to the issues on appeal 
the purpose of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment is to secure every person within the state jurisdiction against intentional and arbitrary discrimination,whether occasioned by express terms of a statute or by its improper execution through duly constituted agents.vill.of willowbrook olech,d per curiam quoting sioux city bridge dakota county.martin sch,cir.where as here no fundamental right or suspect classification is at issue,equal protection claims are evaluated under the standard of review.discovery house,consol.city of indianapolis,cir martin,at hilton city of wheeling,cir.to prevail,a plaintiff must prove the following the defendant intentionally treated him differently from others similarly situated,the defendant intentionally treated him differently because of his membership in the class to which he belonged,and the difference in treatment was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest.schroeder hamilton sch,cir discovery house,at.
the district court held that the opposition aldermen satisfied all three elements of this test.more specifically,the court held that the city discriminated against the opposition aldermen in their request for payment of attorneys fees in the redistricting litigation because of their membership in a group that opposed the referendum map espoused by the city and that there was no rational basis for the discriminatory treatment.on appeal,the city concedes the first two elements and focuses its argument on the district court application of the test.
we pause here to note that in the district court,the parties vigorously disputed how the test should be applied where the equal protection claim is not a facial attack on a statute but,rather,an as applied challenge,or more accurately here,a challenge to a decision of a government official acting pursuant to discretionary authority.the opposition aldermen argued in favor of an approach resembling the paradigm in title vii employment discrimination litigation under mcdonnell douglas green,d.their position was that in a nonfacial equal protection challenge,evidence that the government reason for decision was pretextual can establish the claim.the district court properly rejected this argument.this court has declined previous invitations to import title vii methodology into traditional equal protection analysis,see schroeder,at,and we are not inclined to revisit the issue here.
aside from rejecting the title vii approach,however,the district court did not definitively resolve the parties dispute over the proper application of the test.instead,the court engaged in a heavily analysis of the city actions and subjected the city fees payment decision to a degree of independent judicial appraisal that is inconsistent with the deferential standard of review.
the city asserts it was error for the district court to permit any inquiry at all into the actual motivation for the city payment decision.because a governmental classification must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could supply a rational basis for the classification,heller doe,d emphasis added,the supreme court has held that the test is not subject to courtroom factfinding and may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.fcc beach commc ns,d.the city argues that the test is not an evidentiary inquiry into the government true motives at the time of the challenged action,but,rather,a post hoc legal inquiry into whether there is any conceivable rational reason for the government decision.the opposition aldermen counter that the city version of the test applies only to facial equal protection challenges,and theirs is an as applied challenge.as such,they argue,the focus is properly on evidence of the city actual discriminatory reason for the fees payment decision.
the city is mostly right.to the extent the opposition aldermen insist the focus should be on evidence of discriminatory purpose,their argument is simply misplaced.the city has conceded that it treated the opposition aldermen differently because of their membership in a group that opposed the city remap ordinance the only disputed question is whether that discriminatory treatment had a rational basis.the test is a lenient standard the government action simply can not run afoul of the equal protection clause if there is a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.discovery house,at quoting bd.of trs.of of garrett,d emphasis added.the government need not have articulated a reason for the challenged action at the time the decision was made.discovery house,at.rather,the burden is upon the challenging party to eliminate any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.id.citing heller,at.this basic formulation applies whether the plaintiff challenges a statute on its face,as applied,or as here challenges some other act or decision of government.see also bell duperrault,cir schroeder,at martin,at hilton,at olech vill.of willowbrook,cir,aff,d per curiam esmail macrane,cir.
this is not to say that evidence of the government actual reason for decision is always irrelevant in equal protection cases,however.it is the plaintiff burden to prove the government action irrational.the government may defend the rationality of its action on any ground it can muster,not just the one articulated at the time of decision if a reason was given at all.our various departments and agencies of government make thousands of decisions every day not every one will come with an explanation.the absence of an
