defendant ruben verduzco was convicted of one count of possession for sale of a controlled substance methamphetamine in violation of health and safety code section count,and one count of possession of an essential chemical sufficient to manufacture hydriodic acid or a reducing agent with intent to manufacture methamphetamine in violation of health and safety code,section,subdivision e count he contends insufficient evidence supports his conviction for possession of an essential chemical sufficient to manufacture hydriodic acid or a reducing agent with intent to manufacture methamphetamine because he only possessed one of the chemicals necessary to make a reducing agent the court erred in instructing the jury by failing to define the meaning of a reducing agent and the court erred in imposing attorney fees without notice and a hearing pursuant to penal code section.we conclude that the statutory language requires possession of all constituents of a reducing agent,and reverse defendant conviction on count.
factual background and procedural history 
the shoe store and search of defendant house 
police in pacoima received information that a shoe store on foothill boulevard with a for sign was selling narcotics out of the store.the police put the store under surveillance.
on february,police saw carlos garcia ride to the store on a bike.after a short time in the store speaking with several men,garcia came out of the store and retrieved something from the trunk of a parked honda accord,and returned to the shoe store.shortly after that,garcia left the store and rode off on his bicycle carrying a large white box.
police stopped garcia,and searched his person,a backpack he was carrying,and the box.garcia backpack contained red phosphorus the box contained a glass flask with red phosphorus residue in the bottom.
a police search of the honda accord,the men in the shoe store,and the shoe store yielded grams of cocaine and grams of methamphetamine packaged in small baggies,a scale of the type commonly used for narcotics sales,empty baggies,a sheet,and currency.
police approached garcia house on pinney street,and observed defendant and a woman seated on a bed in the master bedroom.police knocked on the front door,and defendant,wearing a and boxer shorts,answered the door.with defendant permission,police searched the house and found numerous items used to manufacture methamphetamine 
a plastic bag containing red phosphorus 
a flashlight containing white oblong tylenol pills 
a can of acetone 
a piece of material that can be used to cut methamphetamine 
a plastic bag containing grams of methamphetamine,found inside the pocket of defendant pants hanging behind the door in defendant bedroom.
in currency,found inside defendant pants 
clear plastic baggies containing a total of grams of methamphetamine found inside the pocket of a shirt hanging behind the door in defendant bedroom 
a digital scale and 
a clear glass meth pipe found in defendant bedroom between the wall and a bookcase.
the process of manufacturing methamphetamine 
detective frank lyga testified that the manufacture of methamphetamine requires five steps.the first four produce the substance the fifth step converts it to a smokable crystal form.step one involves ephedrine extraction from cold tablets containing pseudoephedrine.ephedrine is difficult to get,so methamphetamine labs purchase cold medications such as sudafed.the pseudoephedrine in cold tablets is not water soluble.denatured alcohol,acetone,and other solvents are used to break down the pseudoephedrine into ephedrine.the pill dissolves in the solvent,and the filler in the pill forms a solid at the bottom of the container.the liquid is strained off and after the solvent evaporates,pseudoephedrine remains.
step two converts the pseudoephedrine into methamphetamine by knocking off an oxygen molecule to create.this step requires an acid solution of percent or higher the preferred acid is hydriodic acid,which is heavily regulated and controlled.as a result,meth labs mix red phosphorus with iodine to produce an acid solution of percent or greater.this solution requires heating and simmering for to hours.
the third step separates the waste product from the liquid solution and reduces the acid level.soyhydroxide,ice,and caustic soda is used.the ice is necessary because this step generates its own heat.an organic solvent freon,acetone,or denatured alcohol is used to extract the methamphetamine molecules,which are suspended in the solvent.
in step four,the methamphetamine is salted out,converted from a liquid to a solid.this uses hydrogen chloride gas such gas can be manufactured from battery acid,sulphuric acid,and rock salt.the gas is infused in the solvent mixture and the methamphetamine forms a solid.this solid is dried off.
the last step converts the methamphetamine to a crystal form by dissolving it in a solvent,such as acetone,and heating it until the solvent evaporates.
expert testimony concerning the items found in defendant home 
in detective lyga opinion,the red phosphorus,which was found in defendant kitchen,was possessed for the purpose of manufacturing methamphetamine.however,not all of the other ingredients necessary for manufacturing methamphetamine were found at defendant house.police did not find iodine,a cooking vessel,or hydrogen chloride gas.nonetheless,detective lyra believed the red phosphorus defendant possessed was for the purpose of manufacturing methamphetamine because except for manufacturing or a chemistry laboratory,the only use for red phosphorus is the making of methamphetamine further,it is common for the components of methamphetamine to be kept at different locations to evade law enforcement and competitors.
detective lyra believed that defendant was the organizer and financer of the operation based on defendant use of the master bedroom and possession of the currency,and defendant delegated other duties to garcia.
defense case 
defendant denied possessing the ingredients of methamphetamine or being involved in its manufacture or sale,and denied he knew how to manufacture methamphetamine.
defendant did not know about the red phosphorus or acetone found in the house,and denied he owned any of the narcotics found.he claimed that he and garcia took turns using the larger bedroom.the currency officers found was money that he received for the sale of a lathe and a tow truck.
while police waited for defendant to answer the front door,they heard the sound of glass striking something.defendant answered the door in his underwear,and the only clothing found in the house were the shirt and pants in the master bedroom.
discussion 
sufficiency of evidence of possession of a reducing agent 
defendant contends that because he did not possess iodine,an essential component when combined with red phosphorus of the percent acid solution necessary to constitute a reducing agent within the meaning of section,subdivision e,his conviction that count must be reversed.respondent argues that the legislative history establishes that the legislature was concerned with closing the loophole that existed in prior law that permitted meth labs to use ingredients other than hydriodic acid to make methamphetamine if we adopt an interpretation that requires both constituents,we will thwart that purpose.
section,subdivision e provides in relevant part that a ny person who possesses essential chemicals sufficient to manufacture hydriodic acid or a reducing agent,with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine,is guilty of a felony italics added.defendant argues the use of the word sufficient in the phrase essential chemicals sufficient to manufacture hydriodic acid or a reducing agent means that to violate the statute,he needed to have both iodine and red phosphorus,the essential chemicals sufficient to manufacture a reducing agent for the purpose of manufacturing methamphetamine.the people contend that sufficient in the statute does not require that defendant possess both chemicals,but that he possess any chemical used in the manufacture of a reducing agent for the purposes of producing methamphetamine in a quantity sufficient for such manufacture.
principles of statutory interpretation 
the interpretation of a statute is a question of law.reno baird cal th,d.our overriding goal is to effectuate the intent of the legislature.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th,d.thus,the first step in statutory construction is to examine the statutory language and give it a plain and common sense meaning.we do not examine the language in isolation,but consider it in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine the purpose of the statute and harmonize various parts of the enactment.if the statutory language is clear,we must generally follow its plain meaning unless a literal interpretation would result in absurd consequences the legislature did not intent.ibid.
if the plain language of the statute does not resolve the inquiry,as a second step we may turn to maxims of construction,which serve as aids in the sense that they express familiar insights about conventional language usage.mejia reed cal th,d,quoting singer,statutes and statutory construction ed ailanto properties,city of half moon bay th,d.if the statutory language is ambiguous,meaning susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,coburn sievert th,d,we may consider other aids,including the statute legislative history and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment,as well as the public policy underlying the law.absher autozone,th,d.
if the meaning of the statute remains unclear after examination of both the statute plain language and its legislative history,then we proceed to the third and final step of the interpretive process.we apply reason,practicality,and common sense to the language at hand.halbert lumber,lucky stores,th,d.the words of the statute should be interpreted to make them workable and reasonable.ibid.we will also consider the consequences that will flow from a particular statutory interpretation.in determining what the legislature intended we are bound to consider not only the words used,but also other matters,such as context,the object in view,the evils to be remedied,the history of the times and of legislation upon the same subject,public policy and contemporaneous construction.citation.citation.citation.ailanto properties,city of half moon bay,supra,th at,d.
b.the statute unambiguous language requires possession of all constituent elements,not just red phosphorus or iodine alone 
to interpret the statute,we must look at the three words,essential chemicals sufficient and their relationship as a definitional phrase.we conclude this phrase requires possession of all chemicals necessary to make a reducing agent,not just one.first,the legislature could have proscribed possession of elements in the singular by specifying a chemical,but instead chose to refer to chemicals.second,the legislature use of both essential and sufficient in the statute indicates that the legislature intended to assign different meanings to those words in the context of the statute.thus,essential does not mean sufficient,because such an interpretation would create a redundancy.rather,essential means indispensable and refers to the required ingredients necessary to make a reducing agent,namely,red phosphorus and iodine.finally,sufficient has a qualitative meaning requiring possession of both chemicals in amounts adequate to manufacture a reducing agent.
c.the legislative history of section,subdivision e does not undermine this straightforward interpretation 
legislative history of section,subdivision e 
previously,section addressed components of both methamphetamine and pcp.section was added to the health and safety code in and was created by the separation of section into two parts section was added to address methamphetamine,while the pcp provisions remained in section.com.on pub,analysis of bill reg.sess.as introduced february.
the legislature recognized that hydriodic acid is a substance used by operators of methamphetamine labs and is the primary reducing agent in methamphetamine manufacture.consequently,hydriodic acid was added to the list of controlled substances in however,operators of such labs substituted iodine.as a result,the attorney general determined that controlling hydriodic acid by itself was insufficient,and the loophole in the law which permitted individuals to purchase chemicals to make hydriodic acid needed to be closed.assem.com.on pub.safety,on bill reg.sess.as amended march.
for that reason,in,senate bill added to section the provision that a ny person who,with intent to manufacture methamphetamine possesses hydriodic acid is guilty of a felony.former,subd.c.the bill also added language to section subdivision f,so that it read for purposes of this section,possession of immediate precursors sufficient for the manufacture of hydriodic acid,shall be deemed to be possession of the derivative substance.additionally,possession of essential chemicals sufficient to manufacture hydriodic acid,with intent to manufacture methamphetamine,shall be deemed to be possession of hydriodic acid.former section,subd.f.stats,ch.
in,a court of appeal held that former,subdivision f,which provided that possession of red phosphorus and iodine was equivalent to the prohibited possession of hydriodic acid,created an impermissible mandatory presumption as a reaction to the court of appeal decision,in the legislature amended section subdivision f to provide,any person who possesses immediate precursors sufficient for the manufacture of hydriodic acid,with intent to manufacture methamphetamine,is guilty of a felony section,subdivision g the predecessor to section,subdivision e,was added in and provided,any person who possesses essential chemicals sufficient to manufacture hydriodic acid or a reducing agent,with intent to manufacture methamphetamine,is guilty of a felony stats,ch.
in,the current version of section,subdivision e was enacted.stats,ch.
although the plain meaning of the statute is sufficient to guide our analysis,we observe the legislature history does not compel a different result.the legislative history evidences an intent to criminalize possession only where both chemicals red phosphorus and iodine are possessed.thus,former section,subdivision f provided that possession of immediate precursors sufficient for the manufacture of hydriodic acid,shall be deemed to be possession of the derivative substance.former section,subd.f stats,ch.further,the july,report of the assembly floor stated the amendment c larifies existing law to provide that possession of essential chemicals,such as red phosphorus and iodine,sufficient to manufacture hydriodic acid with intent to manufacture methamphetamine is a felony.off.of assem.floor analysis,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.indeed,former section,subdivision f was upheld in people mccall,supra,cal th,d,subsequent to the legislature amendments to the statute.mccall noted that former section,subdivision f,while not creating a mandatory presumption,simply expanded the scope of section,subdivision c prohibiting possession of hydriodic acid with intent to manufacture methamphetamine to prohibit possession of red phosphorus and iodine with intent to manufacture methamphetamine.id.at,d.
thus,it is of no consequence to our analysis that the legislative history also reflects that in connection with the amendments a goal on the part of some in the state senate was to provide that possession of one element,iodine,would be legally equivalent to possession of hydriodic acid,com.on crim,on bill reg.sess.in apparent contrast,the legislative history also demonstrates the view of some in the state assembly that the goal of the statute was to provide that possession of any essential chemicals,as well as any immediate precursors of such chemicals sufficient to manufacture methamphetamine,other specified substances,shall be deemed to be possession of the substance.assem.com.on pub.safety,on bill reg.sess.as amended march.in connection with the amendments,the legislative history notes that it was intended to proscribe possession of essential chemicals,including,but not limited to,red phosphorus or iodine,sufficient to manufacture hydriodic acid.com.on pub.safet
