this case involves a dispute over the proper calculation and award of attorneys fees under the national vaccine injury compensation program,to vaccine act.appellants marty and kellie avera,as parents and next friends of their son connor avera,sought an award of attorneys fees after unsuccessfully pursuing a vaccine injury claim.they appeal from a decision of the united states court of federal claims.that decision affirmed a decision by a special master,awarding the appellants fees based on the hometown rates charged in cheyenne,wyoming,rather than the rates charged in the district of columbia and denying appellants request for interim fees.avera sec y of health human.we affirm.
background 
on august,marty and kellie avera filed a petition for vaccine injury compensation in the court of federal claims on behalf of their son,connor.in the petition,the averas claimed that connor had suffered an encephalopathy in response to one of a number of vaccines that he received in,and sought damages under the vaccine act.the petition included two claims an encephalopathy table injury claim and a claim.see walther sec y of health human,describing table injury claims and claims.on august,appellants abandoned the encephalopathy table injury claim but stated that they intended to pursue the claim.on november,after a number of extensions and requests from the special master for the submission of medical reports to substantiate their claim,appellants explained that they were unable to obtain a validating medical expert opinion and requested that the special master decide the case on the merits based on the current state of the record.in response,the special master concluded in a decision dated december,that,on the record before him,appellants were not entitled to secure compensation under the vaccine act.appellants did not seek review of that decision.
on february,appellants filed an application for an award of attorneys fees pursuant to e.unlike most statutes,that provision does not include a prevailing party requirement,it does not require that a claimant prevail on the merits in order to secure fees.instead,even if a claimant does not prevail,section e allows for an award if the claim was brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis.in their fee application,appellants initially requested an award of attorneys fees that reflected the hourly billing rate prevailing in cheyenne,wyoming,where appellants counsel live and work.attached to the application,an itemized list detailed the number of hours that each attorney had worked on the case and the hourly billing rate of each attorney.appellants requested per hour for the work of their lead counsel,robert moxley,per hour for julie hernandez,a law school graduate,for the hours she spent working on the case before she was admitted to the bar,and per hour for hernandez for the hours she spent after she was admitted to the bar.appellants included in the application a sworn declaration of moxley,which stated that t he rates that my firm has charged in this case are the same as we charge all other clients for the nature of services rendered.at.
subsequently,appellants submitted an amended fee petition which in all respects was identical to the first application except that it sought higher hourly billing rates.in the amended petition,appellants argued that,given counsel long experience practicing in the vaccine act program,the special master should use the substantially higher rates in the laffey matrix,utilized by the district of columbia circuit for counsel practicing in the district of columbia in the area of complex litigation.the amended petition requested to per hour for moxley work,to per hour for hernandez work before she was admitted to the bar,and per hour for work she completed after she was admitted.
the special master awarded fees at the originally requested rates.he rejected the appellants claim for higher rates using the district of columbia laffey matrix,and held that he was bound to apply the precedent of the court of federal claims,which endorses a traditional geographic rule to define an attorney relevant community.accordingly,appellants were only entitled to an award of attorneys fees at the lower cheyenne,wyoming rate.thereafter,appellants filed a motion to vacate the special master decision.in that motion,appellants repeated their argument that the special master should award fees at the higher district of columbia rate and,for the first time,asserted that they were entitled to an award of interim fees pending appeal.the special master again rejected appellants request for an award utilizing the district of columbia rates,and also rejected their request for interim fees because,in his view,the statute did not allow him to award interim fees.
appellants sought review in the court of federal claims,which affirmed the special master award of attorneys fees and denied the appellants request for interim fees.the court explained that most parties litigating under the vaccine act have only minimal contact with the district of columbia.it found that,in this case,there were no hearings held in the district of columbia and that appellants and their counsel did not once travel to the district of columbia for any purpose.all of the legal services for the averas were performed in cheyenne.under these circumstances,the court of federal claims held that the application of the forum rule,utilizing the prevailing market rates in the district of columbia forum,could not be justified.the court concluded that the applicable market rate is the community where the attorney maintains an office and practices law.avera.at.on the issue of interim fees,the court reasoned that,a s much as the court would like to authorize interim fee payments where warranted,such relief is not authorized by the vaccine act.id.
appellants timely filed a notice of appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to f.
discussion 
under the vaccine act,we review a decision of the special master under the same standard as the court of federal claims and determine if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.e b markovich sec y of health human.here the resolution of both issues turns on the statutory interpretation of the vaccine act,a question of law,which we review without deference.markovich,at.
the first issue is whether forum rates should be applied to attorneys fee awards under the vaccine act.the special master held that it was bound by the decisions of the court of federal claims to apply a traditional geographic rule to determine which locality market rates it must apply to an award of attorneys fees.under that rule,the special master awarded the appellants attorneys fees that reflected the prevailing market rate in cheyenne,wyoming,where appellants counsel maintain their offices and performed their work.the court of federal claims upheld that decision on appeal.it stressed that a forum rule is inappropriate for vaccine act cases,in which the parties have only minimal contact with the district of columbia.
under the vaccine act,a special master who has awarded a petitioner compensation on a vaccine related claim shall also award as part of such compensation an amount to cover reasonable attorneys fees.e even if a petitioner is not awarded compensation,the special master may award an amount of compensation to cover petitioner reasonable attorneys fees if the special master or court determines that the petition was brought in good faith and there was a reasonable basis for the claim for which the petition was brought.id.
we have previously endorsed the use of the lodestar approach to determine what constitutes reasonable attorneys fees under the vaccine act.see saxton ex rel.saxton sec y of dep t of health human.using the lodestar approach,a court first determines an initial estimate of a reasonable attorneys fee by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation times a reasonable hourly rate.blum stenson,d.once a court makes that initial calculation,it may then make an upward or downward departure to the fee award based on other specific findings.id.in blum,the supreme court explained that a reasonable hourly rate is the prevailing market rate,defined as the rate prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill,experience,and reputation.id.at.as with other statutes,section e does not specify the standard for determining which hourly rate a court should apply to the lodestar is,whether the reasonable hourly rate to be used in the lodestar calculation is the prevailing market rate of the forum court,as petitioner contends,or the prevailing market rate of the geographic location where the attorney is based,as the government contends.nor does blum or any other supreme court decision answer that question.
however,the courts of appeals have uniformly concluded that,in general,forum rates should be used to calculate attorneys fee awards under other statutes.see,ex rel.city dep t of,cir applying a forum rule to the provision of the individuals with disabilities education act interfaith cmty.org.honeywell int l,cir applying the forum rule to the provision of the resource conservation and recovery act rum creek coal sales,caperton,cir the relevant market for determining the prevailing rate under the civil rights attorney fees awards act of is ordinarily the community in which the court where the action is prosecuted sits.donnell united states,applying the forum rule to the provision of the voting rights act,cert.denied,d.we recognize that similar language in the various statutes should be interpreted alike absent some indication to the contrary.see indep.fed of flight attendants zipes,d sacco united states,since all of these statutes use similar to reasonable attorneys fees that would suggest that the forum rates should generally apply.here,the forum for cases brought pursuant to the vaccine act is the district of columbia,where the court of federal claims,which has exclusive jurisdiction over cases arising under the vaccine act,is located.see a.
nonetheless,the government urges that we adopt a hometown rule,which dictates that the proper rate to apply is the market rate of the geographic location where the attorney maintains an office and practices law.under a hometown rule approach,a court need only consider the geographic location where the attorney is based,without regard to where the services are performed.the government contends that for vaccine act litigation a hometown rule would more accurately reflect each claimant actual legal costs and would prevent any particular claimant from receiving a windfall.we disagree.under the vaccine act,there is no reason to depart from the general rule that a court should apply a forum rate to determine the amount of fees to award a claimant,and the government offers no convincing reason why we should do so.we therefore find that,under the vaccine act,the same standard applies to determine an award of attorneys fees,a court in general should use the forum rate in the lodestar calculation.
but appellants view that the special master must invariably apply forum rates without exception is equally flawed.in davis county solid waste management and energy recovery special service district united states environmental protection agency,the district of columbia circuit recognized a limited exception to the forum rule where the bulk of an attorney work is done outside the jurisdiction of the court and where there is a very significant difference in compensation favoring id.at emphases in original.davis arose out of a challenge to regulations promulgated by the environmental protection agency pursuant to its authority under the clean air act.id.at.the case was heard before a court in the district of columbia,though the challengers were represented by a law firm situated in salt lake city,utah.id.the court found that the attorneys performed virtually all of their work on the case in salt lake city,a much less expensive legal market.id.at.recognizing a limited exception to the forum rule under these circumstances,the district of columbia circuit reasoned,would prevent the occasional erratic result where the successful petitioner is vastly overcompensated.id.at.the court found that the exception better reflects the purpose of fee shifting statutes since it prevents a result that would produce windfalls inconsistent with congressional intent.id.at.no other circuit has rejected davis.
we think that davis represents a sound approach to setting the reasonable rate of attorneys fees in vaccine act cases in which the bulk of the work is done outside of the district of columbia in a legal market where the prevailing attorneys rates are substantially lower.
this case is exactly like davis.there is no question that appellants attorneys performed the bulk of their work outside of the district of columbia.indeed,the record is clear that appellants attorneys performed all of their work from their law office in cheyenne,wyoming.the special master did not conduct a hearing in this case either in the district of columbia or in cheyenne,since appellants requested that the special master decide the case on the record before it.as the court of federal claims found and the parties do not dispute,during the merits phase of this case,appellants counsel never set foot in the district of columbia.
it is also clear that the market rate prevailing in the district of columbia is significantly higher than the market rate prevailing in cheyenne.in davis,the district of columbia market rate that the attorneys sought was nearly seventy percent higher than the attorneys local salt lake city rate.davis,at.in this case,the discrepancy is even more profound.that discrepancy is apparent from a comparison of the original request for attorneys fees to the amended request for attorneys fees.in the original request,moxley asked for per hour for his work,a rate which he described as being the same as we charge all other clients for the nature of services rendered.at.in the amended request,moxley asked for per three times the originally requested hourly rate in other words,if we assume from appellants own requests for attorneys fees that the prevailing market rate in the district of columbia is nearly three times the prevailing market rate in cheyenne,we have no trouble concluding that the difference in market rates is significant.
because the attorneys in this case performed the entirety of their work in cheyenne,wyoming,and the district of columbia rates that they requested are significantly higher than the rates prevailing in cheyenne,following davis we hold that the special master did not err in awarding attorneys fees at the lower cheyenne rate.we thus have no occasion to determine whether the laffey matrix should play any role in the determination of fees under the vaccine act in those cases where forum rates are utilized.
the second issue is whether the appellants are entitled to an award of interim fees pending appeal.during the pendency of this appeal,we determined that such an award was not appropriate,and we now explain the basis for that decision.
the special master summarily rejected appellants request for an award of interim fees as frivolous,since t he statute enacting the program does not accord the special master the power to award attorney fees and attorney costs on an interim basis.at.the court of federal claims similarly held without explanation that it lack ed authority under the vaccine act to grant interim fees and likewise disposed of appellants request.avera.at.
on appeal,the government agreed with the special master and with the court of federal claims,arguing that the statutory text of the vaccine act prohibits a special master or court from granting an award of interim fees.the government argued that the vaccine act makes no room for interim fees.br.of resp appellee at.the government argued that an interim award is only permissible after judgment because section f provides for compensation which the government argued includes attorneys fees only when there has been an elect ion to accept or reject compensation under section a br.of resp at.and such an election can be made only after the entry of judgment.this interpretation of subsection f,that compensatio
