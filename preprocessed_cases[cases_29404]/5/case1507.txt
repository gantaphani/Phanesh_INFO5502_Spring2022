background 
the present appeal stems from a contempt proceeding initiated by international rectifier ir brought in the united states district court for the central district of california district court.the contempt proceeding was based on alleged violations of a permanent injunction entered pursuant to a consent judgment between ir and samsung as a result of a separate litigation.the contempt proceeding was previously before this court in an appeal by samsung of the district court order holding samsung in contempt and in an appeal by ixys of the district court denial of ixys motion to clarify,vacate,or modify the permanent injunction.both appeals were heard on the same day and addressed in a single opinion of this court.int l rectifier samsung elecs.in those appeals,we reversed the district court judgment holding samsung in contempt and held that there was no evidence to support the conclusion that ixys was aiding,abetting,or otherwise acting in active concert or participation with samsung.id.this court opinion in those appeals recite in detail the underlying facts,which will not be repeated here.
the present appeals involve both samsung and ixys separate motions for attorney fees following our remand in the prior appeals.following that remand,samsung filed a motion in the district court seeking,after amendments to include attorney fees incurred in preparing the motion,in attorney fees and in costs.ir opposed samsung motion,arguing that the district court was free to deny the motion based on samsung alleged misconduct in conspiring to violate the injunction.ir also argued that samsung fee request was excessive and unreasonable.the district court awarded samsung in attorney fees and in costs,noting that the case has been terribly and that samsung took no risk in defending this matter.int l rectifier samsung semiconductor,no,samsung order.

ii.discussion 
standard of review 
initially,the parties dispute whether federal circuit law or regional circuit law applies to the issue of an attorney fee award pursuant to a provision of the consent judgment.samsung argues that the law of the regional circuit applies because interpretation of an attorney fee provision in a consent judgment is not unique to patent law,citing deprenyl animal health,of toronto innovations.ir argues that deprenyl animal health is not relevant to this case because deprenyl animal health involved interpretation of an arbitration clause rather than an attorney fee provision.ir cites,andrew jergens,for the proposition that this court applies its own law to awards of attorney fees.although deprenyl animal health was concerned with whether federal circuit law or regional circuit law applied to the scope of an arbitration clause in a patent license agreement,in,crp,this court held that regional circuit law and state law applied to a challenge to an award of arbitration fees pursuant to a settlement agreement providing for arbitration of infringement disputes.ir argument that broadly holds that all attorney fee awards are reviewed under federal circuit law is without merit because was only concerned with an award under.at.thus,we conclude that,like the arbitration fee award in,the award of attorney fees pursuant to a consent judgment provision is subject to regional circuit law and state law,if relevant.in this case,both ninth circuit and california law are applicable.

samsung appeal 
samsung argues that the district court reduced fee award was an abuse of discretion for several reasons.first,samsung contends that it met its burden of proving that the full amount of its request was reasonable but that ir failed to present any evidence to rebut its proof.second,samsung argues that ir comparison,before the district court,of its fees in the contempt proceeding to samsung fee request was inappropriate because ir was able to use a substantial amount of material from its separate infringement litigation against ixys in the contempt proceeding.finally,samsung contends both that the district court stated factual basis for reducing the award is legally insufficient and that the findings that the district court articulated for reducing the award are clearly erroneous.
ir argues that the narrow scope of the contempt proceeding before the district court and the fact that it spent less than on the contempt proceeding both indicate the reasonableness of the district court reduction.ir additionally argues that it pointed to specific entries that were unreasonable and that the district court has the inherent power to scrutinize fee requests even if no contrary evidence is presented.ir also argues that the facts cited by the district court for the reduction are legally sufficient and that those findings are not clearly erroneous.
samsung fee request was pursuant to an attorney fee provision in the consent judgment.the consent judgment expressly states that it is governed by federal law and california state law.therefore,we will apply ninth circuit law and california state law to this question.because we conclude that the district court did not adequately explain its reduction of samsung fee request,we need not reach samsung additional arguments.however,because the district court fact findings are very likely to be the basis for a decision on remand,we address samsung arguments that the district court fact findings are clearly erroneous.
the supreme court has made clear that although district courts have discretion in determining the amount of a fee award,i t remains important,however,for the district court to provide a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award.hensley eckerhart,d.the ninth circuit has explained that decisions of district courts employing percentages in cases involving large fee requests are subject to heightened scrutiny.gates deukmejian,cir.in gates,the ninth circuit held that a district court employing a reduction in a fee award based on some duplication of effort was an abuse of discretion.id.at.the court held that the district court failed to provide the concise but clear explanation of its fee reduction,despite an explanation that was more focused and clear than the district court in this case.based on gates,we conclude that without such an explanation of the district court fee reduction,we are unable to assess whether the court abused that discretion.id.thus,we vacate the fee award and remand for a concise but clear explanation of how the district court arrived at its fee reduction.
addressing samsung additional argument that the district court previous findings on the fee award are clearly erroneous,samsung first argues that the district court conclusion that it bore no risk in defending this lawsuit is clearly erroneous.ir counters that the district court simply meant that samsung had no reason to be efficient in the quantity of legal effort expended on its defense because ixys was required to reimburse it for its attorney fees in defending this action.the question the district court had to consider was whether samsung fee request was reasonable.whether samsung had an incentive to minimize costs may be probative of whether samsung fee request was reasonable,but such a general finding can not substitute for specific findings of unreasonable fees.thus,to the extent the district court meant what ir suggests that it meant,its finding is inadequate to support a fee reduction.to the extent that the district court meant that samsung bore no risk in general,the district court finding overlooks at least the fact that samsung stood to lose its business relationship with ixys.moreover it directly conflicts with the district court finding to the contrary in rejecting ixys motion for attorney fees.in rejecting ixys motion,the district court said,samsung had every incentive to minimize the sanction ixys order at.because ixys was liable to samsung for both the sanction and samsung attorney fees,the district court findings that samsung bore no risk with respect to attorney fees and yet had every incentive to minimize the sanction can not both be correct.samsung bore some risk for both the sanction and attorney fees because there was always at least some risk that ixys could not or would not pay.we vacate the district court findings to the contrary.although samsung risk may have been limited,that by itself is an insufficient basis for reducing the attorney fee award.
samsung additionally argues that the district court finding that the case was terribly is clearly erroneous.again,the district court failed to make any specific findings to support this conclusion.because the basis for this finding is unclear,we vacate this finding and remand along with the fee reduction for a concise but clear explanation of any findings that the district court relies on in reducing samsung fee request.
ixys appeal 
first,ixys argues that its motion for attorney fees was timely.ir responds that the district court october,judgment holding samsung in contempt but not mentioning ixys made ixys a prevailing party,such that ixys motion for attorney fees in april was outside the time period and thus was untimely.the district court did not explain its rationale for concluding that ixys motion for attorney fees was untimely.although ir argues that ixys was a prevailing party as of the october,judgment holding samsung in contempt,that judgment did not mention,nor did it dispose of,ir claim against ixys.it is difficult to imagine how a judgment that does not mention a party or a claim asserted against a party can be considered a final resolution of the claim against that party.ixys properly could not be considered a prevailing party prior to this court march,judgment reversing the district court holding of contempt against samsung and reversing the denial of ixys motion to clarify,vacate,or modify the injunction.int l rectifier,at r egardless of samsung activities,which we have concluded do not invoke liability in any case,ixys,as a,can not be bound by the permanent injunction.thus,ixys motion for attorney fees was not untimely.the district court denial of attorney fees on this basis was an abuse of discretion.
next,ixys challenges the district court finding that its intervention in the district court determination of an appropriate sanction against samsung was purely voluntary.ixys additionally challenges the district court finding that it did not substantially contribute to the resolution of the issues in this case and the legal effect that the district court gives that finding.ir responds that intervenors must show some special contribution to the resolution of the issues to entitle them to an award of attorney fees.as we noted supra,ixys is a prevailing party,if at all,by virtue of this court march,judgment reversing the district court judgment of contempt.thus,to the extent the district court precluded ixys from recovering attorney fees based on ixys allegedly voluntary participation in the determination of an appropriate sanction against samsung,the district court abused its discretion.the determination of an appropriate sanction for samsung was only part of the litigation and was the only part in which ixys could even arguably be said to have voluntarily participated.even if ixys participation in that portion of the litigation was voluntary,an award of attorney fees would not be precluded.the district court abused its discretion in denying ixys entire fee request on this basis.
we consider the determination of the reasonableness of a fee award pursuant to a consent judgment entered by a federal district court as a question of federal law.to the extent that ixys fee request is based on time as an intervenor,that portion of the fee request is subject to special scrutiny to ensure that hours reimbursed were not redundant or unnecessary.equal employment opportunity comm clear lake dodge,cir.however,the mere fact that a party voluntarily intervened does not preclude an award of attorney fees.see see also seattle sch.dist.washington,cir to retrospectively deny attorney fees because an issue is not considered or because a party participation proves unnecessary would have the effect of discouraging the intervention of what in future cases may be essential parties.donnell united states,if a lawsuit is successful,but the intervenor contributed little or nothing of substance in producing that outcome,then fees should not be awarded.thus,the district court conclusion that a recovery was precluded because ixys voluntarily participated was an abuse of discretion.
the district court also concluded that ixys did not substantially contribute to the resolution of the issues in this case during its participation as an intervenor.ixys order at.ixys challenges that finding,arguing that it was responsible for the district court reduction in sanctions based on the fact that ir was seeking a double recovery.ir responds that ixys is incorrect because the district court attributed the argument to samsung.that,however,does not answer the question of which party was responsible for the argument.this court is unable to find facts in the first instance on appeal.because the district court made no findings to substantiate its conclusion that ixys did not substantially contribute to the resolution of the sanctions issues,we vacate that finding and remand for the district court to make fact findings in the first instance.
ixys third argument is that the district court clearly erred in relying on its previously vacated finding that ixys and samsung agreed to subvert the injunction.we agree.the district court noted that w hile the federal circuit concluded that ixys and samsung could not be punished in contempt for that decision to maintain business as usual,such conduct is hardly to be encouraged.it would be inequitable under the circumstances to make an award of fees in favor of ixys.id.at.in the previous appeal to this court,we first held that there was no legal basis for the district court theory of infringement and then said,even if a legal basis were apparent,the district court finding of an agreement to subvert the injunction is not supported by any evidence,let alone the clear and convincing evidence required in a contempt pr
