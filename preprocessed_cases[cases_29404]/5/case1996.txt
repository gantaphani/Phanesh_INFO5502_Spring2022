american alternative insurance corporation and other insurers by petition for writ of mandate,challenge an order granting summary adjudication in favor of their insureds,aero falcons,llc aero falcons,and sands media,sands media collectively the insureds.american contends the trial court erroneously determined that the insurer has a duty under its policy to reimburse the insureds for attorney fees incurred to recover possession of an airplane after it was seized by the sheriff in bay county,florida.we resolve an ambiguity in policy language in favor of the objectively reasonable expectations of the insureds and conclude that american is required to reimburse expenses reasonably incurred by the insureds to recover possession of the seized airplane,including attorney fees.we therefore will deny the petition.
factual and procedual background 
factual background 
aero falcons is a limited liability company whose sole member is sands media.sands media is a corporation owned by one joseph francis.american issued a broad horizon aviation insurance policy to aero falcons and sands media insuring a private airplane owned by aero falcons.the policy period commenced on march.the policy included coverage parts for liability,medical expenses,and physical damage to the subject aircraft.the physical damage part included coverage l,which states,the company shall pay for physical damage to the scheduled aircraft including disappearance of the scheduled aircraft.the italicized terms in the policy are defined in the policy.the policy states,physical damage means direct and accidental physical loss of or damage to the scheduled aircraft,but does not include loss of use or any residual decrease in value after repairs have been made.
the policy states,in the physical damage part,under the heading conditions the named insured shall a protect the damaged property whether or not coverage l of this policy applies and if the named insured does not,the company shall have no obligation to pay for any further physical damage due to the named insured failure to protect the damaged property reasonable expenses incurred in affording such protection shall be deemed to be incurred at the company request.in addition,and of significance to our analysis,the policy contained an exclusionary provision that precluded any claim caused by confiscation,seizure or detention by or under the order of any government whether civil,military or defacto or public or local authority.the insureds,however,paid an extra premium for an endorsement to the policy that specifically deleted this exclusionary language.
the bay county sheriff seized the airplane and a ferrari automobile in panama city,florida on april.the sheriff commenced a civil forfeiture proceeding by filing a petition for final order of forfeiture alleging that the airplane and automobile were used in the commission of a felony and were subject to forfeiture under the florida contraband forfeiture act.the felonies allegedly committed by francis and other individuals included procuring persons under the age of for prostitution,sexual exploitation of children,and possession of and trafficking in controlled substances.aero falcons contested the sheriff forfeiture claim.the florida circuit court found probable cause to seize the automobile,but found no probable cause to seize the airplane.the sheriff released the airplane on may.the airplane had suffered minor damage.
trial court proceedings 
the insureds filed the complaint in this action in february,and filed a second amended complaint against american in august,alleging counts for breach of contract,tortious breach of contract,and declaratory relief as to the parties rights and duties under the policy.the insureds moved for summary adjudication seeking to establish that american has a duty under the policy to pay attorney fees incurred to protect the aircraft after it was seized by the bay county florida sheriff that american has a duty under the policy to pay all amounts necessary to repair damage suffered by the aircraft as a result of the seizure and that the insureds are entitled to a declaration that american has a duty under the policy to pay all expenses,including attorney fees,incurred to repair and protect the a ircraft.american also moved for summary adjudication.at the hearing on the motions,the parties stipulated that american had a contractual obligation to pay the reasonable repair costs for damage to the aircraft incurred while it was in the sheriff custody.
the court granted summary adjudication in favor of the insureds on all three issues,and denied the motion by american.the court construed damaged property in the provision requiring the insured to protect the damaged property or forego coverage for any further physical damage in a manner consistent with the defined term physical damage.the court noted that the policy defined physical damage to include physical loss of the aircraft,and concluded that the insureds had suffered a physical loss of the airplane to the sheriff and were entitled to recover the attorney fees reasonably incurred to recover the airplane.the court granted summary adjudication on issues and accordingly,and granted summary adjudication on issue as stipulated by the parties.
american petitioned for a writ of mandate,challenging only the ruling on the summary adjudication motion by the insureds.we issued an order to show cause.
contentions 
american contends the protect the damaged property condition provides for reimbursement of expenses incurred to avoid further damage to the aircraft,but does not provide for reimbursement of expenses incurred to avoid further physical loss of the aircraft and the language is unambiguous,but if there is an ambiguity,the insureds could have no reasonable expectation of reimbursement for attorney fees incurred to recover the seized aircraft,in part because there would be no direct and accidental physical loss of the airplane as required under the policy if there were a final order of forfeiture,so the insureds efforts to avoid a forfeiture were not for the benefit of american.in addition to these contentions,united states aviation underwriters,as amicus curiae on behalf of american contends the policy does not provide for reimbursement of attorney fees incurred in a forfeiture proceeding arising out of serious criminal charges against an insured and the seizure was not accidental within the meaning of the policy because the seizure arose out of numerous felony charges against the insureds and francis.
