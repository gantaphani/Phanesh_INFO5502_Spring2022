six planned parenthood organizations located in texas collectively,plaintiffs appeal from the district court denial of their request for attorney fees under.this request came at the tail end of a litigation prompted by the texas legislature passage of legislation barring the distribution of federal family planning money to entities that perform abortion procedures.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
on june,the texas legislature passed rider b to the general appropriations act biennium,rider.rider prohibited the distribution of federal family planning funds to individuals or entities that perform elective abortion procedures or that contract with or provide funds to individuals or entities for the performance of elective abortion procedures.on june,the texas department of health tdh sent each plaintiff a letter declaring that,to maintain its eligibility for receipt of family planning funds,the plaintiff must sign an affidavit pledging that it would no longer perform elective abortions,nor contract with or provide funds to any entity for the performance of elective abortions.the tdh letter requested that the affidavit be returned by june.
instead of returning the affidavit,plaintiffs filed suit against eduardo sanchez,the texas commissioner of health the defendant.plaintiffs alleged that rider violated the supremacy clause by imposing additional requirements on plaintiffs receipt of federal funds,that rider imposed an unconstitutional burden on a woman right to obtain an abortion,and that rider imposed an unconstitutional condition on plaintiffs eligibility for funds.plaintiffs characterized their suit as having been brought pursuant to.
on june,the district court granted plaintiffs request for a temporary restraining order,and on august,the district court issued a preliminary injunction barring the defendant from enforcing rider.planned parenthood of cent.sanchez,d.the district court determined that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their supremacy clause claim,though the court found that this claim was not properly characterized as a claim.id.at.the district court also concluded that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of one of their fourteenth amendment claims that rider placed an unconstitutional condition on their receipt of federal funding.id.at.in finding for the plaintiffs,the district court adopted their argument that rider could not be interpreted to allow plaintiffs to continue receiving tdh funds by creating independent legal affiliates to perform abortions.id.at.

following this court decision,the parties met and agreed that the tdh would by april,provide written guidelines setting out affiliation requirements,and that plaintiffs would have until may,to comply with these guidelines or inform the defendant that they would seek to avoid the dissolution of the district court preliminary injunction.the tdh did issue written affiliation requirements,and plaintiffs took the necessary steps to establish legally separate affiliates to provide abortion services.plaintiffs thereby maintained their eligibility for receiving tdh family planning funds.
on july,plaintiffs filed a motion with the district court for a declaratory judgment and for attorney fees.on august,the defendant filed a motion to dissolve the permanent injunction and for the entry of a final judgment dismissing plaintiffs claims with prejudice.on december,the district court entered an order and final judgment granting the defendant motion to dismiss and denying plaintiffs motion for a declaratory judgment as moot.the district court also denied plaintiffs request for attorney fees,concluding that plaintiffs were not a prevailing party within the meaning of.this appeal by the plaintiffs of the district court ruling on attorney fees followed.

preliminary injunction 
the district court granted a preliminary injunction to plaintiffs based on the perceived likelihood of success of two of their claims their supremacy clause claim,and their fourteenth amendment unconstitutional condition claim.we address initially whether either claim can support the award of attorney fees under b.
plaintiffs and claims 
the availability of attorney fees under b is expressly limited to actions or proceedings to enforce certain enumerated provisions of federal law,including.the circuit courts that have addressed the issue have held that claims brought under the supremacy clause do not support an award of attorney fees under.p reemption of state law under the supremacy grounded not on individual rights but instead on considerations of not support an action under,and will not,therefore,support a claim for attorneys fees under.segundo city of rancho mirage,cir.f ederal preemption of local ordinances pursuant to the supremacy clause is not actionable under section.therefore,there can be no award of attorney fees under section.pest control montgomery county,cir.see also boston me.town of ayer,cir gustafson city of lake angelus,cir.in this case,the district court correctly held that plaintiffs supremacy clause claim was not actionable under.it follows that their supremacy clause claim,standing alone,would not support an award of attorney fees under.
