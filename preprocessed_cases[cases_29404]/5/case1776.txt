factual and procedural background 
proposition c,approved by san diego county voters in november,amended the san diego county general plan and zoning ordinance,designating an area known as gregory canyon for use as a landfill and recycling center.san diego county sample ballot and voter information,prop.plans for the landfill project progressed slowly amid opposition.see,pala band of mission indians county of san diego th,d and pala band of mission indians board of supervisors of san diego county th,d.deh,as the lead public agency,certified a final environmental impact report in february feir,and issued the solid waste facilities permit approving the landfill project in june.riverwatch olivenhain municipal water dist.th,d.
in july,riverwatch,pala band and oceanside filed their petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in san diego superior court case no.plaintiffs filed a second,separate petition for writ of mandate in november,after deh approved a revised solid waste facilities permit.the court consolidated that case with case no.
the first cause of action for writ of mandate was the primary focus of plaintiffs legal action.it alleged numerous violations of ceqa under subheadings.the additional causes of action for writ of mandate alleged that deh approval of the solid waste facilities permit violated california code of regulations,section d,because it failed to satisfy criteria contained in the san diego county adopted siting element the project as approved by deh conflicted with san diego county general plan and zoning ordinance and the project as approved by deh violated proposition c.the fifth cause of action sought an injunction prohibiting deh and gcl from taking any further action toward development of the landfill project.the sixth and final cause of action sought a declaration that deh actions approving the solid waste facilities permit violated ceqa,solid waste regulations,the san diego county general plan and zoning ordinances,and proposition

the court also granted injunctive relief,stating respondents are further ordered to suspend all activity associated with approval of the gregory canyon landfill project that could result in any change or alteration to the physical environment until respondents have reconsidered their decisions and brought those decisions into compliance with the requirements of ceqa and proposition however,the court did not order deh to start the eir process anew.it explained that deh need only correct the deficiencies in the eir identified in the minute order before considering recertification of the eir whether the corrections require recirculation of the eir,in whole or in part,is for respondents to decide in the first instance in light of the legal standards governing recirculation of an eir prior to certification.the judgment awarded petitioners riverwatch,pala band and oceanside costs of suit and attorney fees.
riverwatch and pala band requested in costs and in attorney fees pursuant to section.deh and gcl opposed any award under the private attorney general theory on grounds the pala band had financial and personal interests in the outcome of the litigation that far exceeded any benefit to the public.as to both pala band and riverwatch,they maintained that the hourly fees were unreasonable and the work duplicative.finally,deh and gcl argued that the requested award should be reduced by percent based on plaintiffs lack of success on numerous issues.
the trial court awarded attorney fees in the sum of.in a lengthy statement of decision,the court rejected the argument of deh and gcl that riverwatch and pala band failed to satisfy the requirements of section,and that the attorney fee request be reduced by percent to reflect unsuccessful claims.it also rejected the assertion that the work performed by two attorneys on the same task was automatically duplicative,in light of riverwatch and pala band counsel representation that the work required in this litigation was divided among the attorneys representing different petitioners.the court did,however,deduct from the total amount sought those amounts which,in the court view,were somewhat excessive for the tasks performed,including time spent on preparation of the administrative record,on the opening and reply briefs,on preparation of the fee motion,and for time spent on a separate action that was ultimately dismissed.this appeal ensued.
discussion 
ithe requirements of section 
section codifies the private attorney general doctrine adopted by the california supreme court in serrano priest cal d,serrano woodland hills residents city council of cal d,woodland hills.the fundamental objective of the private attorney general doctrine is to encourage suits effectuating a strong public policy by awarding substantial attorney fees to those who successfully bring such suits and thereby bring about benefits to a broad class of citizens.citation.the doctrine rests upon the recognition that privately initiated lawsuits are often essential to the effectuation of the fundamental public policies embodied in constitutional or statutory provisions,and that,without some mechanism authorizing the award of attorney fees,private actions to enforce such important public policies will as a practical matter frequently be infeasible.ibid.
to obtain attorney fees under section,the party seeking fees must show that the litigation served to vindicate an important public right conferred a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons and was necessary and imposed a financial burden on plaintiffs which was out of proportion to their individual stake in the matter.citation.citation.punsly ho th,d punsly.because the statute states the criteria in the conjunctive,each must be satisfied to justify a fee award.id.at,d.
the decision whether to award attorney fees under section rests initially with the trial court.baggett gates cal d,baggett.utilizing its traditional equitable discretion,that court must realistically assess the litigation and determine,from a practical perspective whether or not the statutory criteria have been met,quoting woodland hills,supra,cal d at,punsly,supra,th at,d.

the cost of litigation was disproportionate to pala band individual stake in the matter 
deh and gcl argue pala band failed to show that the cost of the its legal victory transcend ed its personal interest,that is,when the necessity for pursuing the lawsuit placed a burden on the plaintiff out of proportion to his individual stake in the matter.citation.woodland hills,supra,cal d at.although cases refer to this requirement as the financial burden criterion,nothing in the language of section confines the consideration of the necessity and financial burden clause to just financial interests.hammond agran th,d.the idea is that the litigation for which fees are claimed must transcend one interests,whether pecuniary or not.id.at,d,italics in original.the critical question is whether advancement of the public interest is merely coincidental to the attainment of personal goals citation or is self serving citation.bowman city of berkeley th,d bowman.the party seeking attorney fees bears the burden of establishing that its litigation costs transcend its personal interests.save open space santa monica mountains superior court th,d.the trial court application of the financial burden criterion involves a realistic and practical comparison of the litigant personal interest with the cost of suit.future,supra,th at,d.
the written briefing on the attorney fee request focused initially on whether pala band had a financial interest in seeking the writ of mandate.pala band submitted the declaration of its tribal chairman robert smith in support of its claim that the cost of the litigation was disproportionate to pala band personal interest in the outcome.smith stated that t he pala band had no financial incentive or economic reason to bring this lawsuit either because the pala band does not foresee that,if built,the proposed landfill would economically impact the pala casino,which is the tribe main source of revenue.deh and gcl argued in response that pala band had a financial stake in protecting acres of neighboring real property and square foot resort and spa from the impacts of the landfill.their attorney declaration that pala band could lose million per year in resort and casino revenues directed the court to a travel website,which listed the number of rooms and price per room.deh and gcl also maintained that pala band personal stake was clearly evidenced by its long history of opposition to this project in every forum available to it.at the hearing on the attorney fee request,deh and gcl cited the declarations filed by smith and la jolla band tribal chairman tracy nelson that the construction and operation of the landfill would desecrate sacred sites,and argued for the first time that the tribe whole reason for fighting the landfill was its belief that it going to destroy their sacred sites,gregory mountain,and harm their ability to engage in their religion.
the court rejected deh and gcl arguments that pala band individual stake in the litigation transcended the cost of litigation.relying on smith declaration that pala band did not foresee that the proposed landfill would economically impact its casino,the court expressly found that there was no monetary value to pursuing the litigation.it also ruled that the evidence offered by deh and gcl to counter pala band claim of no financial interest was incompetent and inadmissible.with regard to the argument the pala band had a strong individual interest in protecting the sacred religious sites,the court found that pala band was protecting the interests of all luiseño people,not just pala band.the record provides a reasonable basis for the court findings.colusa,supra,th at,d.we therefore conclude that it did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the costs of litigation transcended pala band individual interests.
in reaching this conclusion,we reject the arguments of deh and gcl on appeal that the trial court applied the wrong test for determining financial burden improperly shifted the burden of proof from pala band to deh and gcl and failed to measure pala band noneconomic interest in preserving its sacred sites.
deh and gcl contend that the trial court improperly balanced the public interest against pala band personal motivation in ruling on the necessity and financial burden criterion.they cite in support of this contention the court comment during the hearing that there was some authority that bringing a ceqa action per se is considered to be in the public interest,or affecting the public interest,regardless of what the underlying motive may be.the court comments are of no consequence because the statement of decision acknowledged and applied the proper the cost of litigation was disproportionate to pala band individual stake in the matter.
deh and gcl cite the following language in the introductory section of the petition in support of their claim that the court improperly shifted the burden of proof the pala band reservation boundaries are adjacent to the boundaries of the proposed site for the gregory canyon landfill.the pala band has long opposed the gregory canyon landfill project because of its many impacts,including impacts to water quality,air quality,endangered species,traffic,traffic safety,and noise.the construction and operation of the landfill in gregory canyon will also desecrate gregory mountain and medicine rock,two religious sites of great importance considered sacred by the luiseño people,including the pala band.consequently,if allowed to proceed,the proposed landfill project will adversely affect the pala band.the relief sought in this action would redress those injuries.deh and gcl acknowledge smith declaration that the pala band did not foresee that the landfill would economically impact the casino,but argue that pala band had the burden to show economic impact on its land values as a whole and provided no evidence concerning the lack of impact on the value of its land apart from the casino.the record does not support this argument.the smith declaration also stated that the casino was the tribe main source of revenue.given this evidence of financial interest,the burden shifted to deh and gcl to offer admissible evidence to rebut pala band claim of no financial interest.the court properly rejected the only evidence they yahoo website that purportedly listed the room rates and number of rooms at the resort.there was no error.
there is also no merit in deh and gcl argument that the court failed to measure pala band noneconomic interest in its sacred sites in ruling that pala band satisfied the necessity and financial burden criterion.the court expressly stated in the statement of decision that it had considered the argument pala individual stake in the litigation transcended the cost of the litigation.the court simply rejected the for the first time at the hearing on the attorney fee protection of the sacred sites was an individual interest far transcending anything the public interest did.to the extent deh and gcl claim that the trial court failed to measure pala band noneconomic interests can be read as a claim that the court failed to give the noneconomic interests their proper weight,we reject that argument as well.
deh and gcl rely on punsly,supra,th,d,hammond,supra,th,d,and christward ministry county of san diego th,d christward,to support their argument that pala band noneconomic interests were paramount and barred recovery of attorney fees.the facts of this case are distinguishable from those in punsly,hammond and christward.as we explain,pala band efforts to enforce ceqa and proposition c were not merely coincidental to the attainment of pala band personal goals bowman,supra,th at,d,and the court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that pala band satisfied the necessity and financial burden criterion.
in punsly,defendant manwah ho sought attorney fees under the private attorney general doctrine after she prevailed in a visitation dispute with her daughter paternal grandparents.ho argued that because the appellate court upheld her position in a published opinion,she satisfied the requirements of section.this court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that the litigation had primarily been pursued for the personal benefit of ho and therefore was not the type of action contemplated by section.punsly,supra,th at,d.using rhetorical questions,we explained that ho strong,objectively ascertainable personal interests fully justified the litigation,along with any burden incurred to pursue it,and these interests act ed as a block to a fees award from the punslys w here ho parental interests in assessing and pursuing her child bests interests,as she saw them,were admittedly paramount in her mind,how can we say some other incentive was needed to pursue this litigation how can we conclude otherwise,than that her personal interest in the issues must be deemed sufficient to block any potential fee award that would have been grounded in any trial court determination that achieving a greater public good citation was the main incentive for this litigation,or grounded in any trial court determination that the burden of achieving this greater public good was proportionally greater than her individual stake in the matter ibid.the case before us is different.there is nothing in the record to show that pala band concern about the impact of the landfill project on the sacred sites was the kind of intensely personal interest present in punsly.the allegations of the petition show that pala band was concerned about the impact of the landfill project on water quality,air quality,endangered species,traffic,traffic safety and noise,as well as its impact on two religious sites.
for reasons similar to those articulated in punsly,the appellate court in hammond affirmed denial of a portion of the attorney fees requested under section.hammond involved a challenge to the accuracy of the statement candidate larry agran submitted for a city council election.hammond,supra,th at,d.the trial court reasoned that agran had a personal stake that was sufficient enough motivation to pursue the litigation without an award of attorney fees.id.at,d.the appellate court agreed,concluding that as a candidate agran had a specific,concrete and significant interest in defending the veracity of his candidate statement his personal credibility was at stake.id.at,d.at the same time,the court reversed in part,ruling that agran was entitled to the portion of attorney fees attributable to the important issue of the scope of elections code section which transcended his personal interest and resulted in the enforcement of an important public right.id.at,d.again,there is nothing in the record before us to suggest that pala band personal interest was equivalent to agran.as we explained,pala band litigation raised numerous environmental and constitutional questions and transcended any undefined personal interest pala band had in mitigating impacts to its sacred sites.
deh and gcl also suggest that christward has marked similarities to this case because the petitioner sought attorney fees for work that challenged the adequacy of a eir prepared in connection with the expansion of a landfill near property used by christward for a religious retreat.christward,supra,th at,d.however,christward objected to the project on grounds it would obstruct the panoramic view of the surrounding area,not because it interfered with religious practice.id.at,d.unlike the case before us,the litigation in christward related directly to the project impact on the operation of the retreat center.the trial court denied attorney fees under section,stating that christward private interests with reference to the use of their property was the real basis for the action id.at,d.this court agreed that christward success did not confer a public benefit and affirmed denial of attorney fees.nor did we quarrel with the reasonableness of the court assessment of christward private interest in the litigation.id.at,d.
having concluded that pala band satisfied section necessity and financial burden criterion,we need not address the question whether riverwatch public interest supported the attorney fee award.
the litigation conferred a significant benefit 
deh and gcl also contend that riverwatch and pala band failed to show that the litigation has had a beneficial impact on the public as a whole or on a group of private parties which is sufficiently large to justify a fee award.beasley wells fargo bank d,d,overruled on another ground in olson automobile club of southern california cal th,d.unlike the separate substantial benefit doctrine,
