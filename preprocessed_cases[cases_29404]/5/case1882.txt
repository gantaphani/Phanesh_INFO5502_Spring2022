an employee sues his employer for various discrimination claims under the fair employment and housing act feha.among other things,the jury found the employer liable for its failure to engage in an interactive process to determine reasonable accommodations for the employee disability.the jury found the employer not liable,however,for the claim it failed to provide a reasonable accommodation for the employee disability.here we conclude these jury findings require different proofs and are not inconsistent.
defendant automobile club of southern california acsc appeals a judgment after jury trial.guy wysinger filed a discrimination action against acsc,his former employer.we affirm because substantial evidence supports the finding that acsc unlawfully retaliated against wysinger for filing an age discrimination claim the court did not commit reversible error with instruction on retaliatory employer conduct the jury verdicts were consistent substantial evidence supports the findings that acsc conduct damaged wysinger the million punitive damages award was not excessive and the court properly apportioned the award of attorney fees to wysinger.
wysinger was a district manager for acsc santa barbara office.he had received favorable performance evaluations during the years of his employment.he suffered from lupus,a heart condition,and rheumatoid arthritis.his daily commute to santa barbara aggravated his arthritis.he wanted to be acsc ventura office manager because it would involve a less arduous commute,and would be a promotion.
in the late,acsc decided to implement a new compensation plan.acsc older office managers opposed it because they would receive a disproportionate reduction in their compensation.
robert kane,acsc vice president of district office operations,called wysinger into his office and told him,w e are going to crush those opposing the plan.kane told michael coleman,another senior manager who opposed the plan,that acsc would not tolerate opposition to it.he said,it does matter what you did for this company in the last years.none of that matters.and you can die at your desk.we replace you tomorrow.nobody cares.
in,wysinger filed a complaint with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc claiming acsc committed age discrimination.acsc did not impose the pay cuts.
wysinger work environment changed.acsc no longer invited him to be on management committees or to apply for management positions.he was treated coldly and ignored at management meetings.acsc ignored requests to accommodate his disabilities.he received unfavorable job evaluations.bill figge,his immediate supervisor,said it was not about wysinger performance,but involved one of wysinger staff members who needed improvement.acsc transferred staff from wysinger office to ventura,creating a hardship for him.
in,there was an opening for a manager in acsc ventura office,a position that wysinger wanted.figge testified that wysinger ran an elite,or extremely office,unlike the one operated by employee grant sigmund.figge recommended wysinger for the job because he was the most qualified and had formerly managed the ventura office.kane agreed.
peter mcdonald,an acsc senior vice president,met with kane.mcdonald testified,w e were trying to change the culture of the organization we were actively trying to get people from other parts of the company to apply.wysinger was not reassigned to ventura and acsc posted the position to attract other applicants.several people applied,sigmund did not.nevertheless,kane recommended sigmund for the position and mcdonald approved it.
wysinger testified that because of acsc conduct he became depressed and was unable to work.alan karbelnig,a psychotherapist,testified wysinger suffered from depression because of the way he was treated at acsc.stephanie,a forensic economist,testified that given wysinger age and inability to work he would suffer a loss in future earnings.
the jury verdict 
in its special verdict,the jury found that acsc did not fail to provide a required reasonable accommodation to wysinger for his physical disability acsc did not discriminate against him because of his physical disability acsc retaliated against wysinger because he filed a complaint of age discrimination acsc did not discriminate against him because of his age and acsc failed to engage in an interactive process regarding his disability.it found wysinger sustained economic damages of,noneconomic damages of and acsc conduct was malicious,oppressive,fraudulent.

discussion 
substantial evidence supporting the finding of retaliation 
acsc contends the evidence is not substantial to support the finding that it retaliated against wysinger because he filed an age discrimination claim.we presume there is evidence to support every finding unless the appellant demonstrates otherwise and we draw all reasonable inferences from the record to support the judgment.glendale fed.sav.loan marina view heights dev.d.
acsc contends denying wysinger a transfer to ventura is not a feha adverse employment action.plaintiff must show that he or she engaged in protected activity and was thereafter subjected to adverse employment action by his or her employer because of that protected activity.morgan regents of the university of california th,d.where an employer retaliates by denying prospects for advancement or promotions to employees because they filed age discrimination claims,the employer has engaged in an adverse employment action in violation of feha,subd.h yanowitz usa,cal th,d,yanowitz stevenson superior court cal th,d.
acsc claims that the ventura position would not have changed wysinger employment status.sandi adame,acsc human resources manager,testified however,it would have been a promotion.kane said it involved a higher classification within management,and offers higher salary.
acsc contends it is not responsible for kane retaliatory conduct.but an employer generally can be held liable for the retaliatory actions of its supervisors.reeves safeway stores,th,fn,d reeves.here kane supervised acsc managers.his threat to crush the managers opposed to acsc plan shows an intent to retaliate.jurors could reasonably infer wysinger became one of those targeted managers after he filed the eeoc claim and challenged the plan.
acsc claims that mcdonald independently decided not to promote wysinger and was not influenced by kane.but mcdonald said he followed kane final recommendation to reject wysinger and routinely relied on kane advice about managers.kane knew wysinger had more experience than sigmund,that wysinger office was classified as elite and sigmund was not.the jury could find that kane agreed with figge that wysinger was the best qualified,but selected sigmund even though he had not applied for the position.it could reasonably infer that mcdonald relied on kane in making this selection.
acsc argues that mcdonald did not know that wysinger filed an age discrimination claim and was motivated by neutral business justifications.but the jury could reasonably infer that anyone in his position would know about the eeoc complaint because of its financial impact on the company.in addition,jurors could infer the sudden decision to change the culture instead of approving wysinger transfer was a pretext to deny wysinger what should have been a routine reassignment.wysinger had previously managed the ventura office.
in any event,a decision maker ignorance does not categorically shield the employer from liability if other substantial contributors to the decision bore the requisite animus.citation.reeves,supra,th at,d.if he participated in the decision,jurors may infer animus.roebuck drexel university cir.because kane was a motivating force in the selection,his animus is imputed to acsc.reeves,supra,at,d.moreover,notwithstanding mcdonald alleged ignorance,acsc must have known wysinger made the eeoc claim.this prevented acsc from implementing its plan to reduce employee compensation.jurors could find it had a motive to retaliate.
acsc notes that wysinger filed the eeoc claim in december.the decision not to transfer him to ventura occurred between and.it claims these events are too remote to be causally connected.a long period between an employer adverse employment action and the employee earlier protected activity may lead to the inference that the two events are not causally connected.paluck gooding rubber cir.but if between these events the employer engages in a pattern of conduct consistent with a retaliatory intent,there may be a causal connection.richards hill,cal th,d,see also podkovich glazer distributors of iowa,d,employer treating employee with hostility or rudeness kim nash finch cir,excluding employee from discretionary assignments and meetings.here wysinger was not invited to serve on management committees,to apply for management positions and was treated with coldness.
acsc ignored wysinger repeated requests to discuss his health and commute problems.in,acsc upper management did not respond to wysinger letters concerning the difficulties occasioned by his heart and lupus conditions.in,his health was deteriorating.wysinger made six to twelve requests to his immediate supervisor for some accommodation because of his health problems.the acsc human resources department did not respond to any of those requests.in,wysinger doctor wrote to acsc about wysinger health conditions.this evidence supports the jury findings that acsc refused to engage in an interactive process to discuss his disabilities and that it acted with malice.in late and early,when the position was available in the ventura office,wysinger immediate supervisor told him that acsc upper management would not allow him to have it.he candidly admitted to wysinger,i ca defend it i just have to do what i have to do.in denying acsc motion for a new trial,the trial court found that wysinger had proven retaliatory animus from kane and through the chain of command up the line to mcdonald.
ii.jury instruction on retaliatory employer conduct 
acsc contends the court instructions on employer retaliation are reversible error.we disagree.
the trial court instructed jurors guy wysinger claims that the acsc retaliated against him for his complaint of age discrimination with the eeoc.to establish this claim,wysinger must prove all of the following t hat he was an employee of the acsc t hat he made a complaint to the eeoc t hat the acsc took an adverse employment action against wysinger t hat wysinger filing of an age discrimination complaint with the eeoc was a motivating reason for the acsc adverse employment action against him t hat wysinger was harmed,and t hat the acsc retaliatory conduct was a substantial factor in causing his harm.
acsc requested an instruction on adverse employment action which the trial court rejected.that proposed instruction stated,among other things in deciding whether an adverse employment action has occurred,you must bear in mind than an adverse employment action connotes particular conduct.the employment action must be both detrimental and substantial.it must also result in a material change in the terms and conditions of employment.
acsc contends the trial court instruction was inadequate under akers county of san diego th,d akers.there,the court of appeal held that instructions on employer retaliation are insufficient without the phrase,the employer retaliatory conduct must have been a substantial and material adverse effect on the terms and conditions of employment.id.at,d.it noted that without such language,jurors could believe that adverse employment action means anything that happens to an employee that is not in his or her favor.ibid.
a few years later in yanowitz,our supreme court stated t he determination of what type of adverse treatment suffices is not,by its nature,susceptible to a mathematically precise test yanowitz,supra,cal th at,d.the court should consider plaintiff allegations collectively under a totality of circumstances approach id.at,fn,d,by taking into account the legitimate interests of both the employer and the employee.minor or relatively trivial adverse actions do not suffice.id.at,d.but an adverse action that is reasonably likely to impair a reasonable employee job performance or prospects for advancement or promotion falls within the reach of feha.id.at,d.the court noted that the collective impact of a series of retaliatory acts may constitute sufficient adverse employment action even if some of the acts individually would not.id.at,d.it concluded,enforcing a requirement that each act separately constitute an adverse employment action would subvert the purpose and intent of the statute.fn.omitted.id.at,d.
acsc correctly notes that the trial court instruction omits the language suggested by akers,but this does not change the result.a court failure to properly instruct is reversible only if the appellant shows it is reasonably probable it would have obtained a more favorable result if there had been the proper instruction.citation.akers,supra,th at,d.
acsc has not met that burden.the court instruction required jurors to find that the retaliation was a substantial factor which caused harm to wysinger.the court also gave a special instruction advising jurors that they could not interfere with acsc legitimate exercise of management discretion they should not judge acsc managers reasons for their decisions based on what jurors felt they would have done and they should defer to acsc management discretion unless they found acsc was motivated by retaliation.the combined effect of these instructions required jurors to decide the retaliation issue by excluding employer conduct which would be trivial under yanowitz or insubstantial under akers.it required jurors not to include management decisions which involved ordinary discretion,even if the jurors found the conduct to be unfair.wysinger had to prove animus and retaliation.
moreover,acsc actions had a substantial and material impact on the conditions of employment.the refusal to promote wysinger is an adverse employment action under feha.yanowitz,supra,cal th at,d.there was also a pattern of conduct,the totality of which constitutes an adverse employment action.this includes undeserved negative job reviews,reductions in his staff,ignoring his health concerns and acts which caused him substantial psychological harm.kane statements are patent evidence of retaliatory intent and his threats were unlawful under feha.in addition,the jury found acsc actions were more than retaliatory,they were egregious,as shown by the findings on punitive damages.
iii.inconsistent verdicts negating interactive process liability 
acsc notes that the jury found that acsc failed to engage in an interactive process regarding wysinger disability.it also found acsc did not fail to provide a required reasonable accommodation to wysinger for his physical disability.acsc claims the jury verdict is inconsistent and must be reversed along with the award of in compensatory damages.a verdict should be interpreted so as to uphold it and give it the effect intended by the jury design,boozer d.design.where special verdicts appear inconsistent,if any conclusions could be drawn which would explain the apparent conflict,the jury will be deemed to have drawn them.wyler feuer d.
here the verdicts on the reasonable accommodations issue and the interactive process claim are not inconsistent.they involve separate causes of action and proof of different facts.under feha,an employer must engage in a good faith interactive process with the disabled employee to explore the alternatives to accommodate the disability,subd.n claudio regents of the university of california th,d claudio employer may not fail to engage in a timely,good faith interactive process to determine effective reasonable accommodations.an employee may file a civil action based on the employer failure to engage in the interactive process.claudio,supra,at,d.failure to engage in this process is a separate feha violation independent from an employer failure to provide a reasonable disability accommodation,which is also a feha violation,subd.m gelfo lockheed martin th,d gelfo claudio,supra,at,d employer may not fail to make a reasonable accommodation.an employer may claim there were no available reasonable accommodations.but if it did not engage in a good faith interactive process,it can not be known whether an alternative job would have been found.claudio,supra,at,d.the interactive process determines which accommodations are required.jensen wells fargo bank th,jensen,fn.indeed,the interactive process could reveal solutions that neither party envisioned.
here the jury could find there was no failure to provide a required accommodation because the parties never reached the stage of deciding which accommodations were required.acsc prevented this from happening by its refusal to engage in the interactive process.
relying on americans with disabilities act ada et.cases,acsc argues that to prevail on a feha interactive process claim,subd.n,wysinger had to also prove a violation of government code section,subdivision m failure to provide reasonable accommodations.we disagree.federal ada cases are generally helpful in interpreting feha.but not where they undermine provisions of california law that provide more protections to employees than the ada.gelfo,supra,th at,d.no provision in the ada imposes liability on employers who refuse to engage in the interactive process.cravens blue cross and blue shield of kansas city cir.an employee who proves such employer conduct has no remedy unless he or she also shows that his or her disability could have been reasonably accommodated.ibid.
by contrast,feha allows an independent cause of action for employees whose employers fail to engage in the interactive process.this provision does not require proof of the elements required by the ada,subd.n claudio,supra,th at,d.the federal ada cases that hold that employers are not liable for refusal to engage in an interactive process are therefore inapposite.gelfo,supra,th at,d.
acsc position would render government code section,subdivision n,superfluous.employers who violate subdivision n by withholding information that could lead to a reasonable accommodation could avoid liability for violation of subdivision m.jensen,supra,th at,d.employees do not have at their disposal the extensive information concerning possible alternative positions or possible accommodations which employers have ibid.even some federal courts in ada cases have concluded that an employer who has received proper notice can not escape its duty to engage in the interactive process simply because the employee did not come forward with a reasonable accommodation that would prevail in litigation.taylor phoenixville school dist.cir,taylor.
nor does the reasonable accommodations verdict in acsc favor mean the jurors found that it acted in good faith on the interactive process claim.gelfo,supra,th at,fn,d.it is true an employer good faith during the interactive process may support an inference that its decision not to provide accommodations was also made in good faith.but here the jury decided acsc conduct was malicious,oppressive fraudulent.the jury could find acsc liable because it obstructed the process to determine a reasonable accommodation.claudio,supra,th at,d evidence showing that no alternative jobs were available did not insulate employer from liability for not engaging in an interactive process taylor,supra,at jury is entitled to bear in mind that had the employer participated in good faith,there may have been other,unmentioned possible accommodations.
wysinger requested an accommodation involving his commute.acsc argues that the jury finding on the accommodation issue shows that it acted reasonably by not accommodating his request.but as wysinger notes,during deliberations the jury asked whether it could consider the commute in deciding reasonable workplace accommodations.the court responded the work place includes any office of the acsc where its employees do work for the company.it does not include the commute.
the jury likely rendered its verdict on the accommodation issue solely because of this instruction.see bagatti of rehab.th,d disabled employee request that employer provide motorized transportation from parking lot to office not unreasonable sargent litton systems,rejecting employer claim that it had no duty under feha to accommodate disabled employee who experienced pain in driving to work.
acsc argues that the jury had to find that acsc had no duty to engage in an interactive process after it rejected wysinger transfer because he did not request alternative accommodations.the trial court instructed jurors the employer must explore various accommodations even if the employee has not requested any an employer who rejects the other proposed accommodations and offers no effective alternative fails to engage in good faith in the mandatory interactive process.wysinger testified that acsc did not offer any specific accommodation even after his doctor wrote to the company on his behalf.taylor,supra,at.
sufficiency of the verdict on interactive process damages 
acsc contends reversal is required because the jury did not specify which damages are attributable to the interactive process claim and which are attributable to the retaliation claim.but as wysinger notes,it has waived this argument because it did not request specific findings on the damages for each successful claim.conrad ball th,d.
this was a general verdict.where several counts or issues are tried,a general verdict will not be disturbed by an appellate court if a single one of such counts or issues is supported by substantial evidence and is unaffected by error citations.bresnahan chrysler th,d.acsc has neither demonstrated that there was a lack of substantial evidence nor has it shown why or how the damages for either claim would be different.design,supra,d at.no matter how many theories of recovery were stated or proved,respondents were entitled to but one recovery.
iv.damages caused by retaliation and wysinger inability to work 
acsc contends that there is no evidence that its retaliatory conduct either prevented wysinger from working or caused economic damages.under feha,an employee who has been subjected to retaliation which prevents him or her from working may be compensated for a future loss of earnings.hope cya th,d.t he jury is entrusted with vast discretion in determining the amount of damages citation.ibid.
wysinger testified that because of acsc conduct,he became depressed,worn out and unable to return to work.karbelnig stated that wysinger suffered from dysthymia,a form of depression,caused by his feeling of betrayal by his employer,stress and his emotional reaction to acsc actions.opined that based on wysinger inability to work and his age,he would suffer a loss of future earnings of.
post trial evidence on wysinger ability to work 
acsc claims that after trial wysinger did not cease working for it and continued to be employed in the district manager position.but the record refutes this.acsc moved for a new trial attaching a form wysinger sent to acsc retirement department after trial.he checked a box stating,i do not plan to take retirement at this time.acsc claimed the judgment for future lost wages should be vacated because this form showed wysinger was able to work.
but the form was designed to calculate retirement benefits.there was no question on the form about whether wysinger could work.moreover,wysinger opposed the motion,claiming acsc misrepresented the facts.he attached the declaration of virginia keeny who said wysinger had not returned to work at acsc.he had been unable to work since trial and acsc placed him on disability leave.the trial court acted within its discretion and denied the new trial motion.miller national american life ins.of california d.
