factual and procedural history 
hale provided legal services to debtors pursuant to a signed disclosure agreement.for a fee,he agreed to analyze debtors financial situation and prepare their bankruptcy petition and required exhibits,but disclaimed representing them at the meeting of creditors required under.in addition,the agreement specified that hale representation d id not include the following services adversary proceedings,appeals,conversions,proceedings,or any other representation.hale refers to this practice as providing unbundled legal services to pro se debtors.
in,debtors filed for bankruptcy pro se.hale did not sign the petition.the bankruptcy petition listed the fee paid to hale and explained that the fee covered preparation,assistance,pro se advice and counsel,to obtain discharge order,or confirmation of plan.
shortly after debtors filed their petition,the bankruptcy court ordered sua sponte that hale account for the fee.the order stated that there is inadequate information in the record to allow the court to determine whether amount received by counsel is reasonable under the circumstances.the court requested an itemization of all services that hale had rendered to debtors,including a detailed and specific description of each individual item of service rendered the name of the individual who rendered each such service the date such service was rendered and the time expended in rendering such service.
a few days later,the united states trustee issued a notice of intent to seek sanctions against hale for his failure to sign the petition.the notice alleged that this omission violated federal rule of bankruptcy procedure a.
hale submitted an itemization,but the bankruptcy court ruled that the itemization was incomplete and not fully in compliance with its order.the court explained that the itemization use d a generic description of services with no detail.the court ordered that hale supplement his itemization within days.
about three weeks after the expiration of that period,hale submitted a supplemental itemization.for most of the pages,he took issue with the bankruptcy court inquiry into his fee.for example 
this is not the first time that i have attempted to protect the debtors and myself from the judicial tyranny that flows from the chambers of a biased judge.
judge terry myers has continued the tradition of judge pappas by ordering an accounting of more cases to determine subjectively if my legal services were worth to the debtors.to provide the necessary legal services to debtors,needed to file a no asset chapter bankruptcy,an attorney must spend hours of his time,at an hourly rate of.
hale then described each of the services rendered,but he did not provide the name of the individual who rendered each such service.
the bankruptcy court ruled that hale supplemental itemization still was incomplete the supplemental itemization contains,at,fifteen separate descriptions of services rendered,which are segregated by date and time.counsel shall identify whether he personally performed each and every such service or whether some were performed by his staff interns.the court required that hale further supplement his itemization within days.
hale did not submit any additional itemizations.instead,he filed a motion to recuse,vacate,and amended sic jury trial demand,wherein he accused bankruptcy judges jim pappas and terry myers of harboring bias against him and of casting the legal system into disrepute.he moved for recusal of judge myers and requested a jury trial on the issue of his fee.
the bankruptcy court scheduled a hearing to examine hale compliance with its itemization orders.hale then filed an motion to recuse,vacate hearing,and jury trial demand.the motion included six pages of unattributed hearsay accusations,in the form of stories and narratives,leveled at judge myers.hale repeated his motion for judge myers to recuse himself,renewed his request for a jury trial on the issue of his fee,and asked that the scheduled hearing be vacated.with regard to the latter,he argued that he was unable to attend the hearing because he was working as a professor and because judge myers should recuse himself.
the hearing remained on the docket as scheduled.hale did not attend,and the bankruptcy court continued the matter for further briefing.the court gave the trustee three weeks to respond to hale motions and gave hale days to respond to the trustee brief once filed.the trustee filed a brief,but hale did not file a reply.
thereafter,the bankruptcy court published a memorandum of decision.in re jones,wl.in it,the court denied hale motion for judicial recusal.id.at.the court ruled that hale had tendered only rumors,innuendos,and unsupported allegations in support of his motion,which are insufficient to warrant recusal under a.jones,wl,at.the court also denied hale request for a jury trial,citing in re rheuban,and in re rheuban.jones,wl,at.
the bankruptcy court then scheduled a status conference to set a briefing schedule on the reasonableness of hale fee.on the morning the conference was to take place,hale faxed the bankruptcy court a note please accept my apology for not being able to attend the status conference scheduled for,today.i left class feeling extremely disoriented and i was forced to seek medical assistance.the bankruptcy court vacated the hearing and rescheduled the status conference for a date nearly three months later all parties attended the rescheduled conference,at which the court established a discovery time line and scheduled a hearing on hale fee.
the trustee filed an amended motion for sanctions against hale,stemming from his representation of debtors.in its motion,the trustee alleged that hale failed to sign debtors bankruptcy petition in violation of federal rule of bankruptcy procedure a failed to provide debtors with legal representation covering the normal,ordinary,and fundamental aspects of their case failed to obtain debtors informed consent to limit his representation of them and failed to create accurate and complete documents for filing in debtors case.the trustee asked that the bankruptcy court disgorge all attorney fees debtors had paid to hale,that hale reimburse debtors for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with their bankruptcy case,and that the court order hale to sign all bankruptcy petitions of future and represent them in all normal,ordinary,and fundamental aspects of their cases,including attendance at the meeting of creditors.the motion argued that sanctions were authorized under a,and federal rules of bankruptcy procedure b and idaho rules of professional conduct c and b and the inherent authority of the court to sanction bad faith conduct.the bankruptcy court scheduled the hearing on the motion for sanctions concurrent with the attorney fees hearing.
next,the trustee filed a notice of intent to call witnesses at the upcoming hearing.two days before the hearing,hale filed a motion to dismiss,response to amended motions,request for sanctions,offer of proof,and renewed request for a jury trial.in his motion,hale wrote a notice to debtors in which he accused the bankruptcy court of impropriety and the debtors current counsel of incompetent and unethical behavior.he then renewed his motion for a jury trial and stated i will be in salt lake city,utah on the day of this hearing and i intend to rest on the pleadings.my presence is not mandated or necessary to the adjudication of the issues,in my opinion.
the bankruptcy court held the hearing,as scheduled,on hale attorney fees in debtors bankruptcy case.hale did not attend.
the bankruptcy court subsequently issued a second memorandum of decision.the court summarized that,at the hearing,debtor selina jones testified that hale never informed her or her husband about the meeting of creditors or his intention not to appear at the meeting.when hale sent debtors the disclosure agreement,he told them to read over the papers but did not mention the section of the disclosure that states that he would not appear at the meeting.she further 
testified that she did not and does not understand what the term pro se means,and stated that it was never explained to her.she thought hale was their attorney she unequivocally testified that the debtors would not have filed bankruptcy through hale had they understood that he would not be appearing or providing services after filing.they needed an attorney,thought they hired one,and expected to have the assistance of one.
in addition,s omewhere between the filing of the petition and the scheduled a meeting,the debtors received another telephone call from hale.he advised them that there was something wrong with the paperwork and that the debtors should dismiss their bankruptcy.debtor selina jones testified that hale was quite firm on dismissing the case,but not at all clear on why it needed to be dismissed,nor did he offer to refund the fee paid by debtors.hale drafted a motion to dismiss without any request,input or assistance from the debtors.the telephone call and draft motion scared debtors into hiring additional counsel,bart green.
green met with debtors the day before the scheduled meeting and agreed to appear with them at the meeting.he found the debtors confused over the entire process and without any material understanding of what they had signed or what awaited them.from these conversations,green also determined that numerous errors existed in the documents,and that multiple amendments were required.for example,although debtors had informed hale about a residence and two apartment buildings that they owned in pocatello,idaho,the original petition did not disclose any real property 
the bankruptcy court then proceeded to the merits of the motions because hale,a licensed lawyer,specifically represented in his motion two days before the hearing that he intended to rest on the pleadings and that his presence at the hearing was not mandated or necessary,and because he never requested that the court continue or vacate the hearing.
the court summarily denied hale renewed motions for a jury trial and for judicial recusal because he had not raised any new arguments since the court earlier decision denying the original motions.the court ruled that hale violated federal rule of bankruptcy procedure a when he failed to sign debtors bankruptcy petition,which he prepared.the court disgorged his fee because he failed to provide the debtors with competent legal representation covering the normal,ordinary and fundamental aspects of the case,failed to create adequate and complete documents for filing,and failed to obtain the informed consent of his clients to the purported limitations on representation.the court sanctioned hale to encourage him to change his conduct,serve as a deterrent to others,and reimburse the trustee for some of the fees and expenses that it incurred attempting to gain hale compliance with rule.
the court also imposed sanctions.the court noted 
hale has in the past been required to,among other things,disgorge fees in several cases.see,in re castorena,in which was ordered disgorged in each of cases,for a total of.neither the court prior decisions nor these economic consequences have had appreciable impact on subsequent conduct.
hale continues to prepare a large number of chapter petitions in this district.for example,a report generated by the court clerk shows that,in the months immediately preceding this decision,hale filed cases.
a random review of some of hale more recently filed cases indicates that his overall approach remains the same.
consequently,the bankruptcy court ruled 
unable or unwilling to conform his conduct to the requirements established by the court prior decisions and rulings,and to the standards by which all other debtors counsel in the district abide,hale has earned specific restrictions,by express order,on his practice 
hale shall not file,nor shall he prepare or cause to be prepared for filing by a debtor,any bankruptcy petition unless hale signs said petition.
further,hale shall not file,nor shall he assist a debtor as counsel in filing,any bankruptcy petition unless hale commits to such debtor to meet the ethical and professional obligations of a debtor attorney and provide the reasonable and necessary services required to properly represent a debtor in a bankruptcy case.the required professional obligations include hale appearance at a meetings.other obligations and services were described in castorena such a commitment must be reflected in a written engagement or representation agreement,which the debtor s and hale must sign.
in sanctioning hale,the bankruptcy court relied primarily on the sanction authority of federal rule of bankruptcy procedure c.but the court also stated that,t o the extent the rules are not up to the task the court may also rely on its inherent powers.internal quotation marks omitted.
finally,the bankruptcy court denied the trustee motion that hale be ordered to pay debtors damages and fees for replacement counsel.the court reasoned that green fees were not unreasonable given the nature of debtors case and that the court could not,in dissecting green bill,identify some portion that wa s so directly and proximately caused by hale conduct that it should be awarded as damages.
hale timely appealed from the bankruptcy court decision,and the case was transferred to the united states district court for the district of idaho.before the district court,hale argued that he did not violate rule a,that the bankruptcy court improperly disgorged his attorney fees and imposed sanctions,that his right to a jury trial on the reasonableness of his attorney fees was violated,and that the bankruptcy judge should have recused himself.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court on all issues,and hale timely appealed to this court.

discussion 
after six years,two bankruptcy court decisions,one district court decision,and numerous motions and filings,it is important to identify the precise issues raised in this appeal.hale does not challenge either the bankruptcy court findings of the finding that he violated federal bankruptcy rule a or its denial of his motion for judicial recusal.consequently,those issues are waived.see smith marsh,cir o n appeal,arguments not raised by a party in its opening brief are deemed waived.
instead,hale limits his appeal to three issues.he argues that he is entitled to a jury trial on the reasonableness of his attorney fees.he also asks this court to examine the reasonableness of his attorney fees,which we construe as an objection to the bankruptcy court disgorgement of his attorney fees.finally,he argues that the bankruptcy court improperly sanctioned him.

a.the seventh amendment does not include a right to a jury trial on the reasonableness of attorney fees in bankruptcy proceedings.
hale argues that the right to a jury trial under the seventh amendment of the united states constitution extends to determining the reasonableness of attorney fees in a bankruptcy proceeding notwithstanding b,which empowers a bankruptcy judge to make that determination.in granfinanciera,nordberg,d,the supreme court held that t he seventh amendment protects a litigant right to a jury trial only
