background 
exigent owns patent patent on a transaction processing system,which could be used in a variety of commercial transactions including credit card purchases and phone card services.on march,exigent brought suit against atrana,alleging infringement of the patent either literally or through the doctrine of equivalents.exigent specifically asserted independent claims and 
the district court issued a scheduling order which set the close of fact discovery for september,the deadline for summary judgment motions for september,and the close of expert discovery for december.after the case had been redistributed to united states district judge marcia cooke,exigent submitted a status report,simply stating that it expected to finish discovery by april of.the district court set a trial date of january,noting that all previously established deadlines would remain in force.
on august,the district court conducted a markman hearing.although exigent did not file a markman brief prior to the hearing,the district court permitted exigent to file a supplementary brief and claim construction chart after the hearing.
on september,atrana filed a motion for summary judgment on the issues of infringement,invalidity,and unenforceability,describing the legal issues and identifying what proof it believed was lacking.in support of,atrana stated that exigent will not be able to establish that any system of atrana infringes any claim of the patent and specifically explained that atrana systems did not contain certain claim limitations.at.atrana also attached a declaration from its chief executive officer,salah boukadoum,stating that no atrana system contained certain claim limitations.the district court granted exigent two separate extensions of time to respond to the summary judgment motion.as a result,exigent response was due on october.on october,exigent retained new counsel,and filed a motion pursuant to rule f of the federal rules of civil procedure seeking an extension of time to respond to the summary judgment motion so it could complete fact and expert discovery before responding to the summary judgment motion.exigent did not file a substantive response to the summary judgment motion.the district court denied the rule f motion on november.
on november,exigent and atrana attended a mandated mediation session where they signed an agreement in principle term sheet,including an agreement to dismiss the current case under terms to be agreed and to license the patented system to atrana in exchange for royalty the term pin was left still to be defined.the term sheet contemplated that the parties would negotiate and sign a formal agreement.it stated 
the parties agree to negotiate additional terms ordinarily in licensing agreements of this sort in good faith to within five business days execute a formal settlement agreement embodying these principles and forward it to the mediator for filing with the court,failing which the mediator will report an impasse.
at.furthermore,the parties agreed that this agreement will not affect any deadlines set by the court.at.however,that same day,the district court granted atrana motion for summary judgment with respect to,declining to reach the issues of invalidity and unenforceability.in so doing,the court construed several of the claim terms,including the terms control processor,user account,and payment authority.the court then concluded that the record is devoid of evidence demonstrating that atrana infringed the patent.at.the court then held that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether the atrana device includes a control processor nor does the accused device create accounts in response to receipt of a payment authority moreover,the accused device does not have a card assembly with promotional materials contain ed thereon.id.the court then decline d to address atrana invalidity and unenforceability arguments because it agreed with atrana on.id.the court also denied all pending motions as moot.
the parties were apparently unable to execute a final settlement agreement.on november,exigent filed a motion requesting that the district court vacate its decision granting summary judgment and enforce the alleged settlement agreement as reflected in the term sheet.on november,the mediator filed his report stating that a n agreement was reached as a result of the mediation session on november.at.on november,the mediator filed a second report stating that p er a telephone call from defendant counsel the mediator has been informed that he should report an impasse.
on november,in response to a motion by atrana,the district court amended its summary judgment order to note that the plaintiff bore the burden of proving that the accused device infringes on each and every element of the asserted claims.at.the court stated that the amended order,which again denied all other pending motions as moot,would relate back to the date of the initial november order.on march,the district court entered a final order of dismissal and awarded fees and costs to atrana.on march,exigent filed a motion for clarification of the final order,arguing that the court had not yet ruled on exigent motion to vacate the summary judgment grant and enforce the alleged settlement agreement,and therefore that the court could not issue a final order.the district court denied exigent clarification motion,stating that all pending motions had been denied as moot.exigent timely appealed.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to a 
discussion 
exigent challenges the district court grant of summary judgment of,denial of its motion to vacate the summary judgment grant and enforce the settlement agreement,and grant of attorney fees and costs 
a.the summary judgment grant 
exigent argues that we should reverse the district court grant of summary judgment because the district court claim construction was flawed and because atrana failed to sufficiently support its summary judgment motion regarding.
as to the claim construction,exigent attempts to challenge many of the district court constructions as too narrow.however,the district court judgment on rested on the failure to meet three specific claim limitations the inclusion of a control processor,the creation of accounts in response to receipt of a payment authority,and the inclusion of a card assembly with promotional materials thereon.we find no reversible error in the district court construction of the term payment authority,and thus need not reach the correctness of the district court claim construction in other respects.
the district court construed the term payment authority in the patent as d ata that is input by the consumer that represents the monetary value of the transaction and the consumer authorization for payment that is received by the transaction terminal and is also used to define the value of the user account.at.on appeal,exigent argues that this construction is erroneous because the claims contain no reference to the payment authority representing a monetary value and because there is no limitation that the payment must be received by the transaction terminal.exigent brief at.however,exigent failed to make this argument to the district court.in fact,the district court construction is not at odds with what exigent proposed below.exigent construed payment authority as the information inputted by the user of the system as a result of acknowledging payment be it by cash,credit card or independent of the purchase or system in this context the data entry facility is physically structured to accept information acknowledging payment by cash or credit card,at emphasis added.exigent also stated in its proposed construction chart payment credit card transaction or acknowledgment of cash payment from a consumer.at.thus exigent itself suggested that payment authority represented a monetary value.further,exigent stated that a data entry facility which is included in the transaction terminal is structured to accept the payment authority.thus,exigent did not make the argument to the district court that it now asserts on appeal.as a result,we will not disturb the court construction of payment authority.key pharms.hercon labs.because the construction of payment authority is sufficient to support the district court finding,we will not review the remainder of the disputed claim terms.hoffer microsoft.
exigent also argues that atrana did not properly support its motion for summary judgment of with evidence sufficient to establish.the appropriateness of a grant of summary judgment in these circumstances is governed by the supreme court decision in celotex corporation catrett,d.in celotex,the supreme court definitively explained how the burden of proof at trial affects summary judgment practice.there,catrett filed a complaint against celotex for asbestos exposure.id.at.celotex moved for summary judgment,contending that catrett failed to produce evidence that any celotex product was the proximate cause of the injuries id.quoting motion for summary judgment brackets and first ellipses in original.celotex noted that catrett had failed to identify,in response to interrogatories,any witnesses who could testify about the asbestos exposure.id.at.the district of columbia circuit held that celotex motion was fatally defective because it made no effort to adduce any evidence,in the form of affidavits or otherwise,to support its motion.id.at.quoting catrett sales,emphasis in original.the supreme court reversed,making clear that on issues in which the nonmovant bears the burden of proof,in contrast to those in which the movant bears the burden the movant need not produce evidence showing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact in order to properly support its summary judgment motion.celotex,at.instead,the court explained,the summary judgment motion may,and should,be granted so long as whatever is before the district court demonstrates that the standard for the entry of summary judgment,as set forth in rule c,is satisfied.id.at.t he burden on the moving party may be discharged by showing that is,pointing out to the district there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party case.id.at.
exigent argues that here atrana summary judgment motion was not supported by admissible evidence establishing because the boukadoum affidavit was merely conclusory and boukadoum himself lacked the necessary expert qualifications.however,even assuming that the boukadoum declaration should be given no weight,it is clear that atrana did not have to support its motion with evidence of.celotex,at.exigent nonetheless argues that,even if atrana was not required to produce evidence of,the motion was too cryptic,under regional circuit law,to shift the burden to exigent to establish evidence of infringement.
in united states four parcels,cir en banc,the eleventh circuit stated 
justice rehnquist opinion in celotex does not explain exactly how the moving party may show the court that the nonmoving party will be unable to prove its case.in this circuit,e ven after celotex,it is never enough simply to state that the party can not meet its burden at trial.clark coats clark,cir see also celotex,at.at white,concurring instead,the moving party must point to specific portions of the record in order to demonstrate that the nonmoving party can not meet its burden of proof at trial.
id.at internal citations omitted emphasis added while the supreme court in celotex did not articulate,with precision,the minimum that a movant must do in its motion to discharge its burden,the court did explain that where the nonmoving party will bear the burden of proof at trial on a dispositive issue,a summary judgment motion may properly be made in reliance solely on the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file.celotex,at.internal quotation marks omitted.the celotex court also made clear that all that is required is notice to the party with the burden of proof that she had to come forward with all of her evidence.id.at.in the light of celotex,we conclude that nothing more is required than the filing of a summary judgment motion stating that the patentee had no evidence of infringement and pointing to the specific ways in which accused systems did not meet the claim limitations.
this is precisely what was done here.in pertinent part,atrana summary judgment motion stated that 
plaintiff exigent will not be able to establish that any system of atrana infringes any claim of the patent.most importantly,no atrana system includes a control processor meeting the requirements of any of the claims of the patent.more specifically,no atrana system includes a control processor that as claimed is structured to define a user account and to issue an authorization code associated with said user account at least in response to the payment authority as required by the patent claims.no atrana system creates any account in response to receipt of a payment authority atrana systems do not infringe claim for the additional reason that they do not include any control processor that issues at least one authorization code structured to be provided to a merchant in connection with a purchase as required by claim atrana only provides consumers with access codes also known as pins to be provided to a telephone service provider to obtain a telephone connection for making calls.these access codes are not recognized by merchants for the purchase of anything at a point of sale atrana also asserts that it does not infringe claim because no atrana system includes a card assembly with promotional materials thereon atrana also lacks a transaction processor that is communicatively associated with such a control processor.
at.to the extent that the eleventh circuit has held that more is required,we do not follow it because it would be inconsistent with celotex microchip tech.philips,where regional circuit authority is contrary to governing supreme court precedent we need not,and indeed must not,follow it.
we therefore hold that the district court properly held that atrana discharged its burden as the summary judgment movant.exigent failed to set forth any argument or evidence of literal or by response to atrana motion.in fact,exigent admits that no evidence of the accused device was ever submitted as part of the summary judgment record.exigent br.at.accordingly,the district court did not err in granting atrana motion for summary judgment 
exigent rule f motion 
exigent also argues that the district court erred in denying exigent rule f motion,and in refusing to allow exigent to conduct further discovery before responding to the summary judgment motion.we apply the law of the regional circuit and review the district court ruling on the rule f motion for an abuse of discretion.carmical bell helicopter textron,cir.
under rule f,a party opposing summary judgment may request a continuance so that it can conduct any discovery needed to oppose the motion.f.a rule f motion must demonstrate,with particularity,what facts the movant hopes to obtain by discovery and how these facts will raise a genuine issue of fact.hall united ins.of,cir harbert int l,james,cir.the moving party must also have been diligent.barfield brierton,cir druid hills civic ass fed.highway,cir.
here,the district court granted exigent two extensions of time to respond to the summary judgment motion,extending the deadline from october,to october,and then until october.in its rule f motion filed on october,exigent argued that atrana had not yet responded to exigent document requests and that exigent needed to review material regarding the general composition and use of defendant allegedly infringing products,in orde
