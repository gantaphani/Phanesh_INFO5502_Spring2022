a party who chooses to litigate an issue against the government is not only representing his or her own vested interest,but is also refining and formulating public policy.ins jean,d quoting,at,cong.for this reason,our legal system has adapted to ensure that,in certain circumstances,every citizen is able to defend himself against unjustified government action,free from the financial disincentives associated with litigation.the statute here at issue,provides such assurance to taxpayers.
appellant bradley morrison successfully challenged a notice of deficiency of income tax issued against him by the internal revenue service irs.morrison applied for,but was denied,fees.the tax court held that because caspian consulting group,caspian,a separate entity and morrison former employer,paid all fees associated with the litigation,morrison did not pay or incur fees,as required by.
we hold that an individual may incur fees even if those fees are paid initially by a third party.we therefore reverse the tax court holding to the contrary and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
morrison and nariman teymourian formed an intellectual property management partnership,later reorganized as caspian,a california corporation,of which morrison owned and teymourian.morrison served as an officer and director at caspian,and was also employed in a technical capacity.in july,morrison and teymourian executed an agreement pursuant to which morrison sold his interest in caspian to teymourian and resigned from both his officer and director positions and his employment with caspian.
in november,before morrison resigned,the irs began an audit of caspian and tax returns.its examination soon expanded to include separate audits of morrison,teymourian,and teymourian wife personal tax returns for the same time period.eventually,the irs issued notices of deficiency to caspian,morrison,teymourian,and teymourian wife in connection with their and tax returns.the notices raised several issues,the most significant of which was whether loans made by caspian to its shareholders,including morrison,in and were taxable as constructive dividends.the parties tried but were unable to settle this dispute.
in october,morrison petitioned the tax court for a redetermination of the deficiencies.morrison case was consolidated for trial with caspian related petition for redetermination,and both parties retained the same law counsel for the litigation.the firm billed all of its hours to an account entitled caspian,and caspian paid all of the associated fees.both caspian and morrison prevailed on their petitions,and each filed a motion for an award of the litigation costs,including attorneys fees,under.
section provides in any administrative or court proceeding which is brought by or against the united states in connection with the determination,collection,or refund of any tax,interest,or penalty under this title,the prevailing party may be awarded a judgment or a settlement for reasonable litigation costs incurred in connection with such court proceeding.id.a.the statute further specifies that reasonable litigation costs include reasonable fees paid or incurred for the services of attorneys in connection with the court proceeding.c b iii emphasis added.
morrison supported his motion with,among other documents,an affidavit from his attorney,william taggart,who stated that he had provided legal services on behalf of both caspian and morrison.the tax court found caspian eligible to recover fees under and awarded caspian fees equal to the proportion of time taggart hawkins spent on its case.the court denied morrison motion,however,reasoning that b ecause caspian,a separate entity,paid all litigation costs in issue,petitioner did not actually pay or incur any litigation costs.morrison comm r.
morrison filed a motion for reconsideration of his request for attorneys fees,submitting additional evidence along with the motion the tax court denied the motion,finding that morrison did not introduce newly discovered evidence that could not have been introduced before the filing of the opinion,and,further,that the new evidence simply contradicted earlier filings.the court then entered its final order denying morrison recovery under.morrison timely appealed.
ii.analysis 
the tax code permits a discretionary award of litigation costs,including attorneys fees,to the prevailing party in any civil tax proceeding brought by or against the united states.a a prevailing party is a party that has substantially prevailed with respect to the amount in controversy or with respect to the most significant issue or set of issues presented.c a i.a party is not treated as a prevailing party,however,if the united states establishes that the position of the united states in the proceeding was substantially justified.c b i.the purpose of is to deter abusive actions and overreaching by the internal revenue service and to enable individual taxpayers to vindicate their rights regardless of their economic circumstances.huffman,at quoting,at.
not all prevailing part ies are eligible to receive fees under,however.to qualify for a fee award,the petitioner must be i an individual whose net worth did not exceed at the time the civil action was filed,or ii any owner of an unincorporated business,or any partnership,corporation,association,unit of local government,or organization,the net worth of which did not exceed at the time the civil action was filed,and which had not more than employees at the time the civil action was filed see c a ii referring to d b,b.in addition,the prevailing taxpayer must have exhausted the administrative remedies available to him within the internal revenue service,b,and can not have unreasonably protracted the proceedings that generated the attorneys fees.b.if each of these prerequisites is met,the taxpayer may be awarded reasonable fees paid or incurred for the services of attorneys in connection with the court proceeding.a,c b iii.
the tax court denied morrison request for fees solely on the grounds that he had not actually pa id or incur red such fees because caspian paid them on his behalf,and did not address other eligibility requirements.morrison had indisputably not paid the fees at the time he sought to recover them.thus,the question before us is whether morrison had incurred the fees.determining whether,and,if so,under what circumstances a taxpayer who has not yet paid any attorneys fees has nonetheless incurred them is an issue of first impression in this circuit.
as always,o ur analysis begins with the language of the statute.leocal ashcroft,d.because does not provide a definition for the word incur,we look to other sources to discern its ordinary or natural meaning.id.at.
black law dictionary defines incur as to become liable or subject to,to bring down upon oneself,as to incur debt,danger,displeasure and penalty,and to become through one own action liable or subject to.black law dictionary at ed.using this definition,the tax court held that morrison did not bring down upon himself any debt,and therefore did not incur fees,because caspian,not morrison,had paid all of the litigation costs at issue.the court so held despite its recognition that morrison asserted an obligation to pay caspian any fees awarded.
this interpretation of the statute,and of the black definition of incur,is too narrow to give effect to the statute as a whole.black definition does not tell us whether an obligation to pay later,either absolute or contingent,can result in incurring a debt.nor does it tell us whether an obligation to pay a third party who has undertaken to pay one debts counts.
further,the tax court emphasis on the fact that caspian had fronted the fees largely conflates paid and incurred,by effectively barring recovery to any prevailing party who can not demonstrate that he paid his attorneys fees directly.see azure morton,cir as a general rule,the use of a disjunctive in a statute indicates alternatives and requires that they be treated separately.we hold instead that a taxpayer can incur attorneys fees if he assumes either a noncontingent obligation to repay the fees advanced on his behalf at some later time or a contingent obligation to repay the fees in the event of their eventual recovery.
the first half of this definition is where a party assumes an obligation to repay fees that are advanced on his behalf regardless of whether those fees are ultimately recovered,he certainly becomes liable or subject to the lender and brings down upon himself a debt.in such a situation,therefore,the taxpayer has certainly incurred fees.that the debt is to a third party who has fronted the fees rather than to the attorneys who provided the services fully comports with the statutory language,which does not specify to whom the debt for reasonable fees must be paid or owed.see thompson comm r,cch holding that where a petitioner does not pay her attorney directly,she can still incur fees so long as she assumes an obligation to repay the party who advanced the fees on her behalf.
the more difficult question,and the one we face today,arises when a party obligation to repay fees is contingent upon the party successful recovery of fees under the statute.courts are divided on the issue.compare,ed wilson,general servs,holding that the petitioner incurred fees and expenses paid on his behalf by a third party even though the petitioner obligation to repay that third party was contingent on a recovery of those fees with sec comserv,cir holding that a contingent obligation to repay fees does not constitute incurr ing fees.we find more persuasive the reasoning of courts that have awarded fees where the repayment obligation is contingent,and so hold that a taxpayer can incur attorneys fees under even if he assumes only a contingent obligation to repay them.
although wilson involved an award of fees under eaja rather than,the federal circuit cogent explanation of the reasons for permitting recovery in the context is equally applicable to.in that case,the plaintiff,a government contractor,sought recovery of attorneys fees that had been paid by its insurance company.wilson,at.although the contractor was required to repay the insurance company only in the event it recovered fees,the court nonetheless held that the contractor had incurred those fees within the meaning of the statute and so could collect fees from the government defendant.id.at.
in reaching this holding,the court concluded that d isallowing wilson attorney fees would neither remove the financial disincentives of litigating against the government nor deter the government unreasonable denial of minor claims filed by its small businesses contracting partners.id.at.with respect to the first point,the court noted that,without the possibility of fee recovery,insurance companies would raise their premiums.id.as a result,t he small business would have to decide whether it is worth the increased premiums,which it will incur regardless of whether it prevails,to challenge the government.id.at.t he denial of attorney fees would,in other words,reintroduce the cost of litigation as a factor in the small business decision whether to contest governmental action it deems unreasonable.id.
in addition,the court was concerned that a refusal to award fees would provide the government with an incentive to deny meritorious claims,thereby requiring the small business to litigate.id.at.this incentive would arise,the court observed,because the government would know that any time a small business had insurance,it could deny the small business claim and litigate any appeal of the denial without any pecuniary risk.id.thus,t he government could act unreasonably not only in its initial denial of the small business claim but also during the litigation of the appeal,confident in the knowledge that it will be exposed to no attorney fee award.id.to avoid these adverse results,the court in wilson awarded fees to the insured petitioner who was obligated to repay the fees to the insurer,bolstered by its desire to ensure that a party never has to choose between acquiescing to an unreasonable government order and prevailing to his financial detriment.id.at quoting ins jean,d.
similar concerns have motivated this and other courts to award attorneys fees to petitioners represented by pro bono counsel in related legal contexts see,dennis chang,cir legal services organizations often must ration their limited financial and manpower resources.allowing them to recover fees enhances their capabilities to assist in the enforcement of congressionally favored individual rights.see also cornella schweiker,cir eaja if attorneys fees to pro bono organizations are not allowed in litigation against the federal government,it would more than likely discourage involvement by these organizations in such cases,effectively reducing access to the judiciary for indigent individuals.hairston r r apartments,cir awarding fees to pro bono counsel under c,the fair housing act fee shifting provisions when free legal services are provided there may be no direct barrier to the courtroom door,but if no fees are awarded,the burden of the costs is placed on the organization providing the services,and it correspondingly may decline to bring such suits and decide to concentrate its limited resources elsewhere,thereby curtailing the forceful application of the fair housing act that congress sought.thus,the denial of fees in this situation indirectly cripples the enforcement scheme designed by congress.
the logic of wilson and the pro bono cases applies with equal force in situations in which a third party has agreed to pay a taxpayer attorneys fees with the expectation that it will be reimbursed from any recovery.first,just as the denial of fees would discourage insurance companies and pro bono organizations from assisting individuals and small businesses,so too would denial discourage third parties from helping those with lesser resources.in this case,for example,caspian may have been less inclined to pay the litigation costs of its employees had it known that it could not recover those fees either directly as a or indirectly through a fee award to morrison.alternatively,it may have required morrison to pay advance consideration in exchange for the company agreement to pay his fees.either way,the denial of attorney fees would reintroduce the cost of litigation as a factor in morrison decision whether to contest governmental action he deems unreasonable.wilson,at see also comserv,at noting that the material inquiry is not whether the litigation costs were paid by someone other than the litigant,but rather,whether the burden of attorneys fees would have deterred the litigant from bringing the litigation challenging the government actions.
in addition,the denial of fees in this case,like the denial of fees in wilson,would provide an incentive for the irs to deny administratively and then unreasonably litigate meritorious claims.id.at.whenever the irs knew that an individual or small business had a backer,it could reject the petitioner claim and litigate any appeal without any pecuniary risk.id.in other words,the fact that a had chosen to help an individual taxpayer would generate a windfall for,and encourage litigation by,the irs.this outcome runs directly counter to one of the principal goals of the deter rence of abusive actions and overreaching by the internal revenue service,at.
those courts that have denied fees to litigants with backers have relied on a single rationale,the litigant problem.comserv,at focusing on deterrence sheds light on the problem of the litigant who seeks fees under eaja that,if received,would be passed on to an ineligible litigant.see also unification church ins,the possibility of one client using another to obtain fees otherwise unavailable under the act,absent in the cases involving organizations,is present here.these cases reflect a concern that awarding fees to a petitioner whose fees have been paid by a third party will encourage litigation,in which a third party that does not qualify for an award will go in search of a plaintiff who does and bring suit in that person name this fear is unfounded as applied to generally and,more specifically,to the case before us.
as a preliminary matter,the party seeking recovery of attorneys
