san francisco police department officers david goff and john conefrey officers arrested erris edgerly for trespassing within the gated area of the martin luther garvey housing cooperative cooperative.the officers transported edgerly to the local police station,where they searched him for contraband.the search did not reveal any contraband and sergeant frederick schiff,the police supervisor on duty at the time,authorized the officers to issue edgerly a citation for trespass and release him.edgerly was not prosecuted for trespass or any other offense.edgerly then filed this action against the officers,schiff,and the city and county of san francisco city,alleging that the officers unlawfully arrested and searched him in violation of the fourth amendment,and that schiff and the city were liable for the officers unconstitutional actions.he also asserted various state tort claims against the officers,schiff,and the city.
in ruling on the parties motions for summary judgment the district court dismissed edgerly claims against the city and all claims against schiff,but found that there were genuine issues of material fact with regard to edgerly constitutional and state law claims against the officers and state law claims against the city,and therefore allowed those claims to proceed to trial.
following the presentation of all evidence,the district court granted the defendants motion for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure a and dismissed edgerly remaining claims.the court also awarded attorneys fees to schiff under and imposed sanctions against edgerly and his attorney,gregory haynes,under federal rule of civil procedure b.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we reverse in part,affirm in part,and remand for further proceedings.
on edgerly arrest claims,we hold as a matter of law that the officers did not have probable cause to arrest edgerly for trespass in violation of l,now section m,of the california penal code,or any other criminal statute identified by the officers and city.we also hold that the officers are not entitled to qualified immunity for the arrest.accordingly,edgerly is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the arrest claims and we reverse and remand for a determination of damages.
on edgerly search claims,we hold that,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to edgerly,a reasonable jury could find that the officers subjected him to an unreasonable search in violation of the fourth amendment.we also hold that the officers are not entitled to qualified immunity for the search.consequently,we reverse and remand edgerly search claims for further proceedings.
finally,as to edgerly other claims,we reverse the rule a ruling dismissing his additional state law claims against the officers and the city,and the grant of summary judgment dismissing his monell claims against the city.we affirm,however,the grant of summary judgment to schiff,the award of attorneys fees to schiff under,and the award of sanctions against edgerly and his counsel.
background 
in reviewing the district court summary judgment ruling,we consider only the evidence submitted in connection with the parties motions,which consisted primarily of their depositions.conversely,in reviewing the district court rule a ruling,we consider only the evidence presented at trial.however,other than one discrepancy in edgerly testimony that is not relevant to our disposition there were no significant differences between the parties depositions and trial testimony.therefore,we do not expressly distinguish between the two in our description of the facts.
the material evidence regarding edgerly arrest is not in dispute.on august,while on daytime patrol,officers goff and conefrey drove by the cooperative and observed edgerly standing inside the fence that surrounds the property,next to a playground area.no trespassing signs were posted at the cooperative gated entrances.the officers continued on their patrol and returned about five minutes later to find edgerly standing at the same location.according to the officers,they knew that edgerly did not live at the cooperative and that he had previously been arrested for a drug offense at a nearby street corner 
the officers stopped their car,approached edgerly,and asked him what he was doing.according to the officers,edgerly responded that he was just chilling,which meant just hanging out for no reason.having determin ed that he had no specific reason to be at the cooperative,the officers arrested edgerly for trespassing in violation of california penal code section l.the officers testified that edgerly was trespassing because he was loitering on the property and the cooperative management had requested that officers enforce the no trespassing signs.
after the arrest,the officers conducted a search of edgerly and transported him to the park police station,where they performed an additional search.there is conflicting evidence regarding the station search.edgerly testified that officer goff asked him to remove his shoes and socks,pull his pants down to his ankles,and bend over and cough.he also testified that goff looked inside his boxer shorts before telling him that he could get dressed.the officers,however,testified that goff conducted only a routine clothing search.in any event,the search did not reveal any contraband.sergeant schiff was the supervisor on duty at the police station at the time,but he was not aware of the arrest or search until after they were completed,at which time he authorized the officers to cite and release edgerly.edgerly was never prosecuted for any offense.
edgerly filed a complaint against the officers,schiff,and the city in the superior court of california,seeking damages under for violations of his fourth amendment rights.edgerly also alleged state law claims for negligence,negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress,false arrest,and unlawful search.the city properly removed the case to federal court.after the parties completed discovery,the district court granted summary judgment to the city on edgerly monell claims and to schiff on all claims against him.the court found,however,that there were genuine issues of material fact with regard to edgerly and state law claims against the officers and state law claims against the city,and therefore denied summary judgment on those claims.
at trial,at the close of all the evidence,the district court granted the officers and city motion for judgment as a matter of law for the reasons stated on the record and memorandum submitted by the officers and city.the court ruled that,as a matter of law,the officers had probable cause to arrest edgerly,if not under section l,then under another state trespassing or loitering statute.as the court explained at the rule hearing 
on this record and these circumstances no jury could find otherwise than these officers had probable cause to believe a crime of some sort had been committed.that true even if it was l.it did have to be l.in addition,i want to say that counsel should have brought to my attention california penal code but i want to say that i not limiting my analysis to.i am adopting each and every other provision that the city attorney office has suggested 
the court also held that the officers search of edgerly at the police station was not a strip search and was reasonable under the fourth amendment.in the alternative,the court held that,under federal and state law,the officers were entitled to immunity from all of edgerly claims.
after entry of judgment,the district court granted schiff motion for attorneys fees,because edgerly failed to dismiss schiff after discovery revealed that the claims against him lacked merit.the court also granted schiff motion for sanctions against edgerly and his attorney,finding that they filed two frivolous motions for reconsideration of the court summary judgment ruling.
ii.discussion 
officers goff and conefrey 
we review de novo the district court order granting the officers and city motion for judgment as a matter of law under rule a.see santos gates,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate when the evidence presented at trial permits only one reasonable conclusion.id.
section unlawful arrest claim 
probable cause to arrest 
edgerly argues that the officers arrested him without probable cause,in violation of the fourth amendment.to determine whether the officers had probable cause at the time of the arrest,we consider whether at that moment the facts and circumstances within the officers knowledge were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the petitioner had committed or was committing an offense.beck ohio,d.although conclusive evidence of guilt is not necessary to establish probable cause,mere suspicion,common rumor,or even strong reason to suspect are not enough.united states lopez,cir alteration omitted.generally,officers need not have probable cause for every element of the offense,but they must have probable cause for specific intent when it is a required element.id.at.
also,shortly before the district court entered judgment for the officers and city under rule a,the supreme court decided devenpeck alford,d,reversing our decision in alford haner,cir,and overturning our precedent holding that probable cause supports an arrest only if probable cause existed for the offense invoked by the arresting officers or a closely related offense.see devenpeck,at.the court held that,because the probable cause standard is objective,probable cause supports an arrest so long as the arresting officers had probable cause to arrest the suspect for any criminal offense,regardless of their stated reason for the arrest.see id.under devenpeck,however,an arrest is still unlawful unless probable cause existed under a specific criminal statute.see id.at.remanding for the ninth circuit to address whether probable cause existed to arrest respondent for obstructing a officer or for impersonating a officer see also alford haner,cir holding,on remand from devenpeck,that probable cause existed because there was sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding of objective probable cause to arrest alford for the misdemeanor offense of criminal impersonation in the second degree.it is not enough,as the officers and city argue,that probable cause existed to arrest edgerly for some metaphysical criminal offense they must ultimately point to a particular statutory offense.
we conclude that the officers did not have probable cause to arrest edgerly for any offense identified by the officers and city.the officers cited edgerly for violating california penal code section l,now section m.under this section,a person commits a trespass if he or she willfully e nter s and occup ies real property or structures of any kind without the consent of the owner.long before edgerly arrest,however,the california supreme court had clearly established that section l requires occupation of the property,a nontransient,continuous type of possession.in re catalano,cal d,quoting people wilkinson,d supp.as wilkinson explained,section l requires the specific inten t to remain permanently,or until ousted.at see also cal.jury,ed requiring,for a conviction under section l,proof that the defendant entered and occupied the property with the specific intent to dispossess those lawfully entitled to possession.
here,the officers knew only that edgerly was not a resident of the cooperative and that he had been on the property for a matter of minutes.on the basis of these facts,a reasonable officer would not have believed that edgerly had violated or was about to violate section l.
nor did probable cause exist to arrest edgerly for any of the other criminal offenses suggested by the officers and city to the district court.first,under california penal code section h,loitering also has a specific intent requirement,for which the officers clearly had no probable cause specifically,that section requires that the alleged loiterer delay or linger on the property for the purpose of committing a crime as opportunity may be discovered.see also in re joshua,th,d,noting that the california courts first added this specific intent element to the state loitering statute in,and that t he legislature included this intent element when it redrafted the loitering statute as present section,subdivision h cal.jury,ed requiring,for a conviction under section h,proof that the defendant had a specific intent to commit a crime if he or she discovered the opportunity to do so.
second,the version of california penal code section in effect at the time of edgerly arrest,which prohibited enter ing or remain ing in any noncommercial dwelling house,apartment,or other such place,applied by its terms only to structures of the most private character,places of habitation.in re,d,holding that unauthorized entry of a shed adjacent to a house does not violate the section a reasonable officer would not have believed that edgerly,who was standing in the cooperative playground area,had entered or was about to enter a dwelling unit in the cooperative in violation of section.
finally,probable cause could not have existed to place edgerly under custodial arrest pursuant to california penal code section a.as an initial matter,it is doubtful that the section applies to residential property,as it prohibits entering,without written permission,lands under cultivation or enclosed by fence or uncultivated or unenclosed lands where signs forbidding trespass are displayed at intervals not less than three to a mile.in any event,a first offense under section a is punishable only as an infraction and,under clearly established california law,i n all cases in which a person is arrested for an infraction,a peace officer shall only require the arrestee to present satisfactory proof of identity and to sign a written promise to appear.code.only if the arrestee refuses to sign a written promise,has no satisfactory identification,or refuses to provide a thumbprint or fingerprint may the arrestee be taken into custody.id.
here,the officers did not testify that edgerly refused to provide identification,fingerprints,or a signed written promise to appear,or that they had reason to believe that he previously violated section a.thus,even if a reasonable officer might have believed that edgerly had violated section a,the officers lacked probable cause to place edgerly under custodial arrest on this basis.
in sum,the facts and circumstances within the officers knowledge were not sufficient for a reasonable officer to believe that edgerly had violated or was about to violate any california criminal statute that permitted custodial arrest and we therefore conclude that the officers did not have probable cause to arrest edgerly see beck,at.
qualified immunity for the arrest 
we must also determine,however,whether the officers are entitled to qualified immunity for the arrest.as the supreme court explained in saucier katz,d,police officers are entitled to qualified immunity from claims unless their alleged conduct violated a constitutional right,and that right was clearly established.id.at.in determining whether a right was clearly established,we do not consider the right as a general proposition.id.at.rather,t he relevant,dispositive inquiry is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.id.at.
here,the officers violated edgerly constitutional rights under the fourth amendment by arresting him without probable cause.the qualified immunity analysis therefore distills down to a single particularized inquiry whether a reasonable officer could have believed that probable cause existed for the arrest under the circumstances.hunter bryant,d.if so,the arresting officers are entitled to qualified immunity.conversely,if a reasonable officer could not have believed the arrest to be lawful,in light of clearly established law and the information the arresting officers possessed,then the arresting officers are not entitled to immunity.id.at.final alteration in original.
we conclude that the officers are not entitled to qualified immunity.at the time of the arrest,it was clear under established california law that edgerly brief and otherwise unremarkable presence within the cooperative gated,outside area did not violate any criminal statute.see id.at.
first,as we explained above with regard to l,it was clearly established well before edgerly arrest that a person committed a trespass under that section only if he or she had the specific intent to permanently dispossess the lawful owner of the property.given edgerly unremarkable presence on cooperative property for a matter of minutes,no reasonable officer could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest edgerly under section l.
similarly,no reasonable officer could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest edgerly under section h,in light of its express specific intent requirement.as we explained above,a person violates section h only if he or she lingers on private property for the purpose of committing a crime.here,edgerly was simply standing at the cooperative playground area for about five minutes,and the officers had no additional information that edgerly specifically intended to commit a crime at that time.
nor could a reasonable officer have believed that probable cause existed to arrest edgerly under the applicable version of section,since none of the facts known to the officers suggested that edgerly had entered or was about to enter any of the cooperative dwelling units.as we explained above,and the california courts had emphasized prior to edgerly arrest,the section applied by its express terms only to actual places of houses or playground areas.
finally,even assuming a reasonable officer could have believed that edgerly had violated section a,a reasonable officer could not have believed that probable cause existed to arrest edgerly for the violation.as we explained in bingham city of manhattan beach,in evaluating a custodial arrest federal courts must determine the reasonableness of the arrest in reference to state law governing the arrest.at alteration omitted.thus,because california law prohibits arresting someone solely for being an unlicensed driver,we concluded in bingham that a rresting bingham solely on that basis clearly is not an action that a reasonable officer could have believed lawful.id.alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.here,too,no reasonable officer could have believed that it was lawful to place edgerly under custodial arrest solely on the basis of section a.as we explained above,california law prohibits custodial arrests for a first offense under the circumstances of the instant case.
in sum,we conclude that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest edgerly for any offense and,because no reasonable officer could have believed otherwise,that they are not entitled to qualified immunity for the arrest.we therefore reverse and remand for the district court to enter judgment in favor of edgerly on the issues of probable cause and qualified immunity for the arrest,and for further proceedings on the issue of damages.
section unlawful search claim 
we also conclude that the district court erroneously entered judgment as a matter of law for the officers on edgerly unlawful search claim.viewing the evidence at trial in the light most favorable to edgerly,a reasonable jury could find that the officers search of edgerly at the police station was unreasonable,in violation of the fourth amendment.also,because no reasonable officer could have believed,in light of clearly established law,that the search as described by edgerly was constitutional,the officers are not entitled to qualified immunity for the search.because the evidence from trial permits more than one reasonable conclusion as to the constitutionality of the search,we remand for further proceedings 
reasonableness of the search 
to determine whether a search is reasonable under the fourth amendment,we balance the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails.way county of ventura,cir.state law is also relevant in analyzing the reasonableness of a search under the fourth amendment.see reed hoy,cir see also bingham,at.
we have held that arrestees charged with minor offenses may be subjected to a strip search only if jail officials possess a reasonable suspicion that the individual arrestee is carrying or concealing contraband.fuller jewelry,cir citing giles ackerman,cir,overruled in part on other grounds by de la vina,cir.similarly,california penal code section f prohibits strip searches of persons arrested for minor offenses except those involving,weapons,controlled substances or violence,unless the officer has a reasonable suspicion based on specific and articulable facts to believe such person is concealing a weapon or contraband.
we have also held that visually inspecting a person naked body,even without a visual examination of body cavities,constitutes a strip search see giles,at.additionally,california reasonable definition of a strip search informs our fourth amendment analysis in the instant case.see reed,at see also bingham,at.california penal code section c expressly defines a strip search as a search which requires a person to remove or arrange some or all of his or her clothing so as to permit a visual inspection of the underclothing,breasts,buttocks,or genitalia of such person.
viewing the evidence in light most favorable to edgerly,a reasonable jury could find that the officers strip searched him.according to edgerly trial testimony,officer goff required him to arrange his clothing so as to permit a visual inspection of his undergarments,by asking him to pull his pants down to his ankles.further,edgerly testimony that goff looked inside his boxer shorts permits a reasonable inference that goff visually inspected his buttocks or genitalia therefore,if the jury credits edgerly testimony,the officers search was a strip search that required reasonable suspicion.
the officers,however,did not testify that they had reasonable suspicion for the search.rather,they testified that they arrested edgerly only for trespass,a minor offense not involving contraband,weapons,or violence.also,officer conefrey testified that edgerly was not required to lower his pants at the police station because there was no reason to believe that he was concealing a weapon or contraband.
accordingly,a reasonable jury could find that the officers strip searched edgerly and,if the officers did strip search edgerly,they violated his fourth amendment rights,because they did not have reasonable suspicion for the search 
qualified immunity for the search 
because the facts alleged by edgerly show that the officers conduct violated his constitutional rights,see katz,at,the qualified immunity analysis again turns on a single particularized inquiry whether a reasonable officer could have believed,in light of clearly established law,that the search was constitutional.see id.at.see also way,at.
we conclude that the officers are not entitled to qualified immunity for their alleged conduct of strip searching edgerly either by requiring him to reveal his undergarments or by visually inspecting his genitalia or buttocks.as we explained above,it is clearly established in the ninth circuit that strip searches without reasonable suspicion are unconstitutional.see fuller,at.moreover,california law expressly defines a strip search to include the exposure of undergarments or visual inspection of buttocks or genitalia,see code c,and provides that it is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully perform such searches on misdemeanor arrestees such as edgerly without reasonable suspicion.see id.f,n.in light of this clearly established law,no reasonable officer could have believed the police station search,as described by edgerly at trial,to be lawful.see way,at see also katz,at.
state law claims 
because the analysis for edgerly state law false arrest claim is the same as for his unlawful arrest claim,we reverse and remand for the district court to enter judgment in favor of edgerly and to address the issue of damages in further proceedings.see gillan city of san marino,th,d,holding that a police officer who unlawfully arrests an individual without probable cause is liable for false arrest,and that california government code sections and do not provide immunity from such claims code b providing that officers are entitled to immunity from false arrest claims where they had reasonable cause to believe the arrest was lawful blankenhorn,at holding that the arresting officers were entitled to immunity from appellant state law false arrest claim because the officers had probable cause for the arrest.
also,although the legal basis for edgerly state law unlawful search claim is not entirely clear from his complaint or the district court orders,it appears to be california penal code section p,which provides a private right of action for persons unlawfully strip searched in violation of the section.if so,edgerly state law unlawful search claim would depend on the same disputed factual issues as his unlawful search claim,and turn on the jury resolution of these issues on remand.we therefore reverse and remand for the district court to clarify the legal basis of this claim and to proceed accordingly 
edgerly claims for negligence and negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress,however,raise substantial legal and factual questions beyond the lawfulness of edgerly arrest and search,such as whether edgerly suffered severe emotional distress and what duties the officers owed to edgerly.because the district court mistakenly concluded that edgerly arrest and search were lawful,it did not reach these questions.we therefore remand these claims so that the district court can address the necessary questions in the first instance.
b.the city 
section monell claims 
we review de novo the district court order granting summary judgment to the city for edgerly claims against it.see anderson warner,cir.viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we must determine whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the district court correctly applied the relevant substantive law.id.we conclude that the district court erred in determining that edgerly could not maintain his monell claims against the city.we therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment to the city on these claims and remand for further proceedings.
the supreme court has held that,when execution of a government policy or custom,whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy,inflicts a constitutional injury then the government as an entity is responsible under section.monell,at.a municipality is liable under monell only if a municipal policy or custom was the moving force behind the constitutional violation.city of canton harris,d.
here,discovery revealed facts that,taken in the light most favorable to edgerly,establish municipal liability under monell for the officers actions.first,with regard to edgerly arrest,sergeant schiff testified at his deposition that occupying a property for five to ten minutes would be sufficient to constitute a violation of section l.in explaining his basis for this erroneous belief,schiff testified that his initial training with the city specifically covered section l and that he received periodic updates regarding enforcement of the section.schiff also testified that 
we have had upwards of six captains in the eight years that i been in the district.each of the captains has received numerous complaints from the cooperative management and management at two other low income housing projects in the area about the trespassing,the drug dealing,and requests to abate it,and those requests generally wind up in the lap of officer s goff and conefrey.
in his deposition,officer goff confirmed that,during his tenure at the station,supervising officers had instructed him about the requirements for enforcing section l at the cooperative and two other public housing projects in the area.he believed that these instructions applied only at the housing projects.officer goff also testified that this particular problem,outsiders hanging out,selling drugs in these particular properties,had been discussed for years with numerous supervisors.
taking these facts in the light most favorable to edgerly,a jury could reasonably find that the city had a policy of training its police officers to make arrests under section l in situations where probable cause did not exist in the police department had implemented a policy of making such unconstitutional arrests at the cooperative and these city policies were the moving force behind the officers violation of edgerly constitutional rights,since police captains and supervisors directed officers goff and conefrey in particular to make such arrests.thus,the district court erred by dismissing edgerly monell claim for unlawful arrest.
for similar reasons,we conclude that the district court erroneously dismissed edgerly monell claim premised on the officers allegedly unconstitutional search.in his deposition,schiff testified that he followed department policy in requiring officers to request authorization only for full body cavity searches and not for searches that constituted strip searches under california penal code section c.further,the officers testified at their depositions that requiring an arrestee to remove his pants to reveal his underclothing does not constitute a strip search or require supervisor approval,and that they had conducted hundreds of such searches.taking these facts in the light most favorable to edgerly,a reasonable jury could find that the city had implemented a policy of permitting unreasonable searches the officers were aware of this policy and the policy was the moving force behind the officers violation of edgerly constitutional rights.
we therefore reverse the district court dismissal of edgerly monell claims against the city,and remand for further proceedings.
state law claims 
we also conclude that the district court erred by granting judgment as a matter of law for the city on edgerly state law tort claims.first,edgerly is correct that the city is vicariously liable for the officers actions under california law,which has rejected the monell rule and imposes liability on cities under the doctrine of respondeat superior for acts of city employees.see robinson solano county,cir en banc citing cal.the city is therefore liable to the same extent as the officers for edgerly state law claims against them,and edgerly may recover from the city any damages awarded on remand.see id.
second,edgerly claim that the city is directly liable for his injuries because it negligently trained and supervised the officers,raises legal and factual questions that the district court has not yet addressed,such as whether the city owed edgerly a relevant duty of care.we therefore remand this claim for the district court to address the necessary questions in the first instance.
sergeant schiff 
we affirm,however,the district court grant of summary judgment to sergeant schiff as to all claims against him.
we have found supervisorial liability under where the supervisor was personally involved in the constitutional deprivation or a sufficient causal connection exists between the supervisor unlawful conduct and the constitutional violation.lolli county of orange,cir.thus,supervisors can be held liable for their own culpable action or inaction in the training,supervision,or control of subordinates their acquiescence in the constitutional deprivation of which a complaint is made or for conduct that showed a reckless or callous indifference to the rights of others.cunningham gates,cir.
taking the facts in the light most favorable to edgerly,sergeant schiff was a police supervisor,responsible for the operations at the station when he was on duty,who provided only informal training to schiff testified at his deposition,when officers asked him questions,he would try to answer them.schiff also testified,incorrectly,that section l can involve a very brief trespass,and that he had been involved in making such,likely unconstitutional,arrests with other officers.schiff further testified that,contrary to the requirements of section,he requires officers to request authorization from him only for full body cavity searches,not for strip searches.
these facts,however,do not establish supervisorial liability for schiff.no reasonable trier of fact could
