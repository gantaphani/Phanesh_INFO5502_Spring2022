a jury held that bolduc was liable for close to in attorneys fees and costs incurred by byron crowe in a lawsuit arising out of bolduc acquisition of the assets of crowe business,the crowe rope company,and some other property.
two basic arguments are urged on appeal.the first issue is whether the trial judge erred by excluding evidence and whether bolduc is entitled to a new trial.two rationales used to exclude the amount to the proposition that witnesses who are lawyers are not to be subjected to for bias as other witnesses plainly erroneous,and we specifically disapprove of them.but there was another rationale for exclusion which withstands review,so bolduc is not entitled to a new trial on that ground.the second issue,actually a series of,concerns the interpretation of the agreement.we sustain the jury verdict.this case contains cautionary tales and lessons about trial practice.
the case grew out of an earlier litigation in which crowe successfully defended a suit by a trade creditor of crowe rope seeking to seize certain annuity payments due to crowe under the agreements with bolduc.achille bayart cie crowe,cir.after his successful defense,crowe sought to recover his costs and legal fees from bolduc pursuant to the agreements.bolduc refused,and crowe brought suit.crowe bolduc,d.
the magistrate judge who heard the case made two rulings challenged here.first,on a motion in limine,he ruled that the two attorneys called as witnesses by crowe to testify to the intent of the agreements could not be for bias arising out of their firm contingent fee agreement in the litigation.second,he ruled on a motion for summary judgment that the agreements were ambiguous,and so the question of their interpretation should go to the jury,and then he upheld the jury verdict on a subsequent motion for judgment as a matter of law.
crowe was the president and sole shareholder of andrew crowe sons,crowe rope company.it had been one of the major american manufacturers of rope,but had fallen on hard times.as of december,crowe rope owed over eight million dollars to fleet national bank of massachusetts crowe himself owed an additional to fleet bank,and one other company of which he was the sole shareholder,portco,owed another.crowe rope was the guarantor of the debts of both crowe and portco,either directly or indirectly.
bolduc had been the president and ceo of grace and now had a number of business interests.in december,through several holding companies,bolduc acquired the debt owed by crowe rope,crowe and portco to fleet bank.bolduc paid fleet bank million.subsequently crowe rope transferred all of its assets to a bolduc entity,and bolduc foreclosed on the real estate,machinery and equipment of crowe rope.achille bayart,at.all of crowe personal guarantees were paid by bolduc,at a cost of over million.bolduc also agreed to pay a annuity to crowe and his wife ruth in exchange for title to several parcels of real estate owned by the crowes,some of which had been rented to crowe rope.
the crowes entered into several written agreements with bolduc,including an agreement dated december,the agreement,and a letter from bolduc to the crowes,also dated december,the letter agreement.the letter agreement provided that bolduc and a new corporation to be formed by him would pay the crowes the sum of annually,as long as either of them lived,in exchange for the real estate.the agreement established that bolduc would pay crowe in twelve equal payments over the first year for consulting services and an agreement not to compete with the new corporation for five years.the pertinent text of the two agreements is set forth later.
the specter of possible litigation by creditors against either crowe rope or the crowes was a dominant concern of the parties.should the crowes annuity be taken in judgment by any court,bolduc promised to provide an equivalent substitute payment.bolduc also acknowledged that several such creditor suits were already pending at the time of the agreement.the letter agreement required the crowes to immediately notify bolduc,in writing,of any such claim.bolduc thereupon shall be entitled to defend such claim,to compromise it or settle it,in his sole judgment,as he may deem appropriate,and at his sole cost and expense.paragraph of the agreement described crowe obligation to cooperate with any defense mounted by bolduc.
the transaction,however,made no provision for the payment of any trade creditors of crowe rope,and left no assets in crowe rope,now an insolvent shell company.these debts amounted to over million.one of these creditors,achille bayart cie,filed a complaint in federal district court on may,against the crowes,seeking to collect a debt of plus double damages the achille bayart action.achille bayart,at.achille bayart brought suit pursuant to the maine uniform fraudulent transfer act.ann.tit,west,arguing that there remained equity in crowe rope over and above the amount paid by bolduc to fleet bank,while unsecured creditors such as achille bayart received nothing.achille bayart,at.achille bayart sought to avoid the annuity to the crowes as a fraudulent transfer.crowe defended the case.crowe,d at.the case went to trial in january.at the conclusion of achille bayart case,crowe moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to.a.the court found that there was insufficient evidence to permit a jury to conclude that there was such excess value,and the motion was granted.achille bayart,at.achille bayart then appealed to this court,which affirmed.id.at.
crowe then sought to collect from bolduc,the legal fees and costs he incurred in defending the achille bayart action.crowe,d at.crowe counsel had notified bolduc of the achille bayart action in a letter dated october,five months after crowe received notice.at that time,crowe sought to tender defense of the action to bolduc,but bolduc refused.bolduc counsel cited the provision as the reason for their refusal.counsel for crowe had responded to achille bayart complaint,filed interrogatories,and submitted motions to dismiss and stay discovery.the legal fees at that time amounted to approximately.during the course of the achille bayart action,bolduc counsel did not make any complaints,criticisms or suggestions about the handling of the case.id.at.crowe forwarded at least one settlement offer made by achille bayart to bolduc,and achille bayart independently approached bolduc with another settlement offer.bolduc refused both.
crowe brought suit against bolduc in maine superior court,alleging breach of contract and promissory estoppel.bolduc,a citizen of maryland,then removed the case to the district court for the district of maine,under,a.after discovery,bolduc moved for summary judgment on both of crowe claims,asserting that the contract unambiguously gave bolduc a right to refuse to defend a suit against crowe,and that crowe promissory estoppel claim was barred by the parol evidence rule.the magistrate judge issued a decision on may,recommending that summary judgment be denied with regard to the breach of contract claim and granted with regard to the promissory estoppel claim.the magistrate judge recommendations were adopted,after de novo review,by the district judge.crowe,d at.the case then went to a jury trial,which was heard by consent before the magistrate judge.
before trial,both sides indicated their intention to call as witnesses the lawyers from each of their respective firms who had participated in drafting the agreements.crowe planned to call gregory tselikis and robert keach,both of whom are members of bernstein,shur,sawyer nelson,the firm which represented crowe in the bolduc acquisition,the achille bayart action and the instant suit against bolduc.bolduc intended to call george marcus and jennie clegg,both of whom are members of the same firm as bolduc trial counsel,marcus,clegg mistretta at a conference,crowe requested that the trial court prohibit of tselikis and keach regarding fee arrangement with crowe.was representing crowe in this case on a contingent fee basis.the magistrate judge granted crowe request in an oral in limine order issued on september.

ii.motion in limine 
the appeal from the exclusion of evidence by motion in limine raises a number of issues of practical significance to the bar and trial courts.
bolduc argues that the magistrate judge,as the trial judge,committed errors of law and abused his discretion in limiting bolduc counsel in their opening argument and in their of attorneys keach and tselikis,both witnesses and shareholders of.specifically,the judge ordered bolduc counsel to refrain from mentioning that keach and tselikis had a financial interest in the outcome of the action as a result of contingent fee agreement with crowe in this case.part of bolduc intended concerned the failure of the lawyers at to give timely notice of the achille bayart action to bolduc,and their agreement to represent crowe on a contingent basis to atone for their error.bolduc also argued that the information tended to show that might be sued by crowe over the failure to give notice if the suit turned out badly for crowe,thus maximizing the financial incentives involved for the two witnesses.
at trial,the two attorneys both testified as fact witnesses and gave their opinions as to the intent and meaning of the disputed language in the key agreement documents.since the court had found the contract to be ambiguous,the jury heard parol evidence as to the intent and meaning of the pertinent language.see villas by the sea owners ass garrity,me.attorney keach described himself as a specialist in the area of corporate bankruptcy law and related commercial litigation,had practiced for over twenty years in that field,was chair of the business reorganization committee of the american bankruptcy institute and was one of four maine attorneys admitted to the american college of bankruptcy lawyers.certainly,the subject matter of his of a not a subject commonly addressed by lay witnesses keach interpreted the meaning and intent of the language at issue,sentence by sentence.attorney tselikis has a similar background and credentials,and he testified to the intent and meaning,section by section,of the key language.
specifically,keach and tselikis testified that the shall be entitled to defend such claim,to compromise it or settle it language contained on page two of the letter agreement meant that bolduc was required to defend,compromise or settle the claims asserted in the achille bayart action.they also testified that paragraph of the agreement required bolduc to reimburse crowe for the legal fees,costs and expenses he incurred in defending the achille bayart action.
there was contrary testimony from bolduc and his transaction attorney witness.the attorney witness who handled the transaction for bolduc was george marcus,originally at pierce atwood at the time of the agreement and then at the same firm as bolduc trial counsel.marcus did not have a contingent fee agreement.the record is silent as to whether he charged for the time spent on his testimony,although trial counsel did inform the court that his firm had an hourly fee arrangement.bolduc argues that his inability to examine the two attorney witnesses for bias,or even to argue bias,was harmful to him and undermined confidence in the verdict.he notes that crowe testimony was far weaker than the testimony of his counsel on the intent and meaning of the contract language.
the trial court gave three grounds for its in limine exclusion ruling,two of which were in error.first,the magistrate judge found there was no evidence that keach and tselikis would color their testimony because of contingent fee agreement with crowe and their firm financial interest in the outcome of the case.second,the magistrate judge believed that unlike all other witnesses testifying,lawyers are officers of the court who,apart from the oath taking,are ethically bound to testify truthfully.third,the magistrate judge concluded that allowing the parties to the lawyer witnesses about their firm fee arrangements would risk causing the jury to be confused as to what the real issues in the case were.the court was satisfied that the probative value of such fee related evidence was substantially outweighed by this danger of confusion.apparently,the court felt that the use of an attorneys fee agreement to show bias on the part of crowe witnesses would confuse the jury on the question of whether a different agreement required the payment of crowe legal fees by bolduc.accordingly,the court excluded the evidence under federal rule of evidence.
as to the first two grounds,we believe the trial court committed errors of law.the trial court,on the first ground,imposed a burden on the to show some evidence that a witness might color his testimony due to financial incentives before permitting on the fact that the witness had financial incentives to do exactly that.the offered evidence is,of course,classic evidence of bias,which is routinely permitted on.wheeler united states,cir finding it is clear that inquiry into the possible financial stake of a witness in a particular outcome of a case in which the witness is testifying is a proper subject for.
the problem was exacerbated here because the witnesses,admittedly not called as experts,gave what amounted to opinion testimony as to the meaning of the contract language.the majority rule in this country is that an expert witness may not collect compensation which by agreement was contingent on the outcome of a controversy.that rule was adopted precisely to avoid even potential bias.new eng.bd.of assessors,see accrued fin,prime retail,cir.maine enforces this policy in part by a bar rule which prohibits the hiring of witnesses on a contingent fee basis.maine bar rule g.
the issue before us is not whether the lawyers should have been permitted to testify at all.bolduc did not seek to exclude the testimony of crowe attorney witnesses,but sought only to be able to examine them for bias.the issue,then,is whether a restriction on for bias as evidenced by a contingent fee agreement on the ground that the witnesses are attorneys is appropriate.the trial court mistook this issue of for bias for the issue of whether the maine bar code permitted the attorneys to testify at all.where witnesses under contingent fee agreements are permitted to testify,examination on the contingent fee is considered vital.see united states valona,cir other circuits do not consider any type of witness contingent fee arrangement outrageous and instead allow the jury to consider the fee arrangement in its evaluation of witness credibility.collecting cases.see generally note,contingent fees for expert witnesses in civil litigation,yale.
the first circuit considered the interaction between permitted testimony of a witness paid on a contingent fee basis and opportunity to in united states cresta,cir.this court held in that criminal case that the district court did not commit reversible error by declining to exclude the testimony of any informant apparently paid on a contingent basis.id.at.part of the,the court explained,was that there would be vigorous for bias 
a contingent fee arrangement is not per se impermissible on a case by case basis,varying factors determine whether the arrangement in question is permissible 
while the risk of perjury is recognized,courts have chosen to rely upon to ferret out any false testimony.rather than adopting an exclusionary rule,courts have chosen to leave the matter to the jury to consider in weighing the credibility of the informant.
there are established safeguards that must be followed to ensure the veracity of the witness the jury must be informed of the exact nature of the contingency agreement the defense counsel must be permitted to the witness about the agreement and the jury must be specifically instructed to weigh the witness testimony with care.
id.at citation omitted see united states,cir quoting cresta,at.
the second ground for exclusion relied on by the trial court is also flawed.the court held that because attorneys are officers of the court and are ethically bound to testify truthfully,there was a basis to preclude for bias.witnesses who are attorneys may not be protected by special dispensation from the normal rigors of.such a rule of favor,as adopted by the trial court,would undermine compliance by attorneys with their obligations.
further,it was the province of the jury,not the court,to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.see blake pellegrino,cir finding that the judge can not substitute his own judgment for that of the jury in assessing the persuasiveness of evidence.that the court has a high opinion of attorneys in general,or even of particular attorneys,does not justify the court substituting its judgment as to the veracity of those attorney witnesses for the judgment of the jury.
there is a question as to whether our standard of review for the in limine exclusion should be for abuse of discretion or for plain error.our rule as to motions in limine is that a party must renew at trial its motion to offer or exclude evidence if there has been an earlier provisional ruling by motion in limine and a clear invitation to offer evidence at trial.united states holmquist,cir.if,by contrast,the in limine ruling is final and unconditional,the issue was preserved for appeal and no further steps need be taken to preserve the issue.fusco general motors,cir.here there was no attempt at trial to introduce the evidence which was the subject of the in limine exclusion.our circuit rule has now been codified in a amendment to rule,federal rules of evidence.the rule provides in part once the court makes a definitive ruling on the record admitting or excluding evidence,either at or before trial,a party need not renew an objection or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal.a.
as the commentary to the rule makes clear the amendment imposes an obligation on counsel to clarify whether an in limine or other evidentiary ruling is definitive when there is doubt on that point.advisory committee note,amendment.unfortunately,the trial court left doubt on the point in its ruling 
and,if you feel at any point during the trial that despite this ruling,which is in the nature of an in limine ruling and is therefore by definition tentative,if you feel that you have an argument based on the circumstances of the record as it has developed to press again this issue,then you may do so,of course,but at sidebar.in other words,you are not to be asking any questions of witnesses in that seeks to elicit this kind of information until we address the issue again at sidebar.i not inviting you to do that,you understand,but i just want to be clear that obviously if you think there is something significant about the way that the evidence has gone in and has not been taken into account by way of analysis,then you can raise it again.
it is not true,as the trial court assumed,that in limine rulings are by definition tentative.see black law dictionary ed.defining in limine as preliminarily presented to only the judge,before or during trial.some in limine rulings may be final,and whether the ruling is final or tentative has important consequences for counsel.the trial court ruling can be read either way that the ruling was only tentative,or that it was final unless circumstances at trial changed and warranted a new effort to introduce the evidence.formulations such as the one used by the trial court here are not uncommon but are inadvisable because of the ambiguity created.
the burden,though,was on bolduc to clarify whether the in limine ruling was final or not,and he did not.however,given the duality of the magistrate judge in limine order,we think it better to grant bolduc the benefit of an abuse of discretion standard of review on the rule decision we discard the two erroneous rationales and focus on the court ruling that the risk of jury confusion outweighed the benefit from the evidence.appellate courts have been very reluctant to a trial judge rule ruling,given the advantages of observation of the trial.see united states,cir.while we might well have ruled differently on the rule admissibility question were our review de novo,we can not say the judgment reached was so out of kilter as to constitute an abuse of discretion.
iii.judgment as a matter of law 
our review of a denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law is de novo.zimmerman direct fed.credit union,cir.a motion for judgment as a matter of law only may be granted when,after examining the evidence of record and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party,the record reveals no sufficient evidentiary basis for the verdict.id.citing reeves sanderson plumbing,d.this review is weighted toward preservation of the jury verdict,which stands unless the evidence was so strongly and overwhelmingly inconsistent with the verdict that no reasonable jury could have returned it.primus galgano,cir.
bolduc first argument is that the contract was unambiguous as a matter of law.he contends that the contract entitled bolduc to do one of three things upon receiving notice of a suit against crowe take up the defense himself and either proceed with the case or settle it let crowe continue the defense and reimburse him for his costs or do nothing.the magistrate judge disagreed and rejected bolduc summary judgment motion and subsequent motions for judgment as a matter of law on that ground.contract interpretation on ambiguity,as a matter of law,is subject to de novo review.mirra sch.dist,cir see lohnes level communications,cir applying plenary review to the question of contract ambiguity.
as a preliminary matter,we consider the interaction between this question and bolduc second argument,that crowe late notice constituted a material breach of the contract.bolduc briefs do not clearly set forth the relationship between his notice argument and his argument that the contract is unambiguous in imposing no defense obligation.one might ask why,if bolduc clearly had no obligation to pay defense costs,there was a contract provision requiring crowe to give bolduc immediate written notice of any lawsuit.bolduc response would seem to be that he agreed to pay indemnity for any judgment up to the amount of annuity and the consulting fee if,and only if,he was given timely notice of the lawsuit and had the chance to choose to defend from the outset.but since the achille bayart lawsuit resulted in no judgment against crowe,there was nothing to indemnify under this theory and so no notice issue is raised.
if,on the other hand,the late breach issue does have significance with regard to the issue of ambiguity,as bolduc professed to the trial court and to us,then its import must be that bolduc did have an obligation to pay defense costs which he denied having subject to his receiving immediate written notice.if so,and if,as the jury determined,there was no material breach,then bolduc was,on this theory,responsible to pay defense costs.on this second approach,only the material breach issue is important.
bolduc tries to ride both horses at once before the jury,bolduc emphasized the prejudice from late notice theory.before this court,bolduc emphasizes the theory that an unambiguous contract imposed no obligation at all to pay defense costs.while counsel are entitled to present inconsistent theories,there are obvious dangers.where,in a civil case,the two theories advanced are so intellectually antagonistic that the one necessarily makes the other false,the proponent of the irreconcilable theories runs considerable risks.
in any event,neither horse has legs.the theory that the contract unambiguously absolved bolduc from defense costs save for requested cooperation costs incurred by crowe is unpersuasive,and the jury was warranted in adopting crowe interpretation.the theory that the violation of the requirement amounted to a material breach
