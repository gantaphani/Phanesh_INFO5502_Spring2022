introduction 
the writers guild of america the guild had reason to believe that reality television production companies and television networks violated wage and labor laws.the guild held meetings during which employees of reality television discussed the purported violations.some who participated in the meetings,along with other reality television employees,agreed to be the named plaintiffs in two wage and labor law class action lawsuits against the production companies and the networks collectively defendants.thereafter,the trial court denied defendants motion to disqualify plaintiffs counsel,but did disqualify some plaintiffs from acting as representatives of the putative classes.
on appeal from the trial court order denying the disqualification order,defendants rely on california rules of professional conduct of the state bar,rule rule to contend that the trial court erred in failing to disqualify counsel for plaintiffs.this contention is based upon the facts that the firm who represented the guild was also counsel for plaintiffs,the guild paid for plaintiffs attorney fees and costs,and the litigation was conceived by the guild as part of its organizing campaign,a campaign which many plaintiffs supported.defendants use many of the same facts to further contend that the trial court erred in failing to disqualify all plaintiffs from their roles as representatives of the uncertified classes.
in the published portion of this opinion pts.iv,we hold that the trial court did not err in failing to disqualify class counsel and the trial court did not err in refusing to disqualify all plaintiffs from acting as the named representatives of the putative classes.
in their,plaintiffs appeal from the trial court orders directing their counsel to ask them certain questions relating to their association with the guild.in the unpublished portion of this opinion pt,we hold that the trial court orders were vague.
thus,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
factual and procedural backgrounda.the underlying facts 
the guild is a labor organization representing writers of film,television,documentaries,animation,and technology.
reality television programs use ordinary people rather than professional actors in unscripted dramatic or humorous situations.the guild believed that these shows were produced on low budgets with short deadlines,and were profitable,in part,because employees routinely worked very long hours,without breaks or overtime pay.among other information the guild received was that reality television employees had been paid a flat,weekly rate,but often were provided with fraudulent pay records showing they had received overtime pay.
between january and june,the guild held a number of meetings with people working in reality television.approximately to employees attended these meetings.this unstructured group was referred to as the reality television organizing committee.the group discussed what they perceived as widespread violations of a number of state wage and hour laws,including minimum wage and overtime violations.
in early,david joseph young,the guild interim executive director,had numerous conversations with guild staff members and outside counsel,anthony segall,to evaluate possible litigation on behalf of reality television employees who provided services relating to story development attorney segall noted that by violating wage and hour laws,certain reality television employers were able to unfairly compete with unionized companies that paid legal wages.he believed that wage and hour enforcement lawsuits would create economic pressure on those who paid illegal wages.he also opined that litigation against reality television employers could facilitate the guild unionizing campaign.he foresaw such litigation as having strategic value because it would create a more level playing field and decrease the incentive to not be union if the reality television employers had to play by those same rules.director young believed wage and hour lawsuits might force reality television production companies to recognize the guild as the exclusive bargaining unit for their employees.
attorney segall and attorney emma leheny were partners in the law firm of rothner,segall greenstone the rothner firm.the firm had represented the guild in a significant number of matters for many years.
in the summer of,attorneys segall and leheny attended meetings of the guild organizing committee,at which time potential lawsuits were discussed.some employees who attended the meetings expressed an interest in participating in wage and hour litigation against their reality television employers.these employees were informed that the guild would subsidize the cost of the litigation and were referred to the rothner firm.
of the employees who would become the named plaintiffs in the two lawsuits giving rise to this appeal,had attended meetings of the guild organizing committee.these employees recruited others,who also would serve as representative plaintiffs in the two lawsuits.
all employees met with,and retained,the rothner firm as class counsel.the guild,which had selected the firm,agreed to pay the litigation expenses,including costs and the firm hourly rate.
each of the employees signed a conflict waiver acknowledging that the guild would subsidize the attorney fees for the two class action lawsuits and that the firm represented the guild in other matters.for simplicity,we refer to these persons as plaintiffs.plaintiffs were adamant that they would control the litigation and decide the strategy and the outcome of the lawsuits.the guild informed plaintiffs that they would control the cases,and not the guild.
procedural history 
the two related cases 
on july,plaintiffs,including harmon sharp,iii and troy devolld,filed a class action lawsuit on their behalf and similarly situated employees against four reality television production companies and four television networks for violations of state wage and hour laws relating to eight reality television programs,sharp et next entertainment,et,no.these plaintiffs alleged violations of the labor code,specifically that these eight defendants failed to pay wages and overtime,provide meal and rest breaks,provide wage statements,or keep required records.the class was described as those persons who are or have been employed by the defendants to perform services relating to story development for reality television series.
on august,plaintiffs,including daniel shriver and jubba seyyid,filed a class action lawsuit against a producer of reality television programs and one television network,relating to seven television shows,shriver et rocket science laboratories et,no.this second lawsuit also alleged labor code violations and defined the class in the same manner as the first lawsuit 
both lawsuits sought,among other relief,attorney fees and costs pursuant to labor code sections,subdivision e,and.
a few months after the lawsuits were filed,the guild hired attorney segall to serve as the guild general counsel.he had been working as its outside counsel.when he became general counsel,attorney segall was given an office at the guild,where he usually worked two days a week.attorney segall continued to be a partner in the rothner firm.as the guild general counsel,attorney segall was responsible for overseeing various legal matters,including advising the guild with respect to its unionizing activities.
in august,one plaintiff informed the media that the guild had helped a group of reality television writers and editors file a class action lawsuit to end the companies exploitative practices in this burgeoning and profitable sector of the hollywood economy.attorney segall informed the media that the guild would file lawsuits as part of an organizing campaign until the objectives of the organizing campaign are met.the lawsuits were also mentioned on the guild website and in a number of news releases as part of the guild larger strategy to organize reality television employees.
the rothner firm continued to represent the guild in other matters.the guild continued to help coordinate communication with plaintiffs and set up meetings at the guild regarding the lawsuits.
after defendants in both cases answered,the trial court deemed the two cases related.
the parties conducted extensive discovery.defendants indicated they would depose guild employees and two plaintiffs from each class action lawsuit to advance the theory that the guild was the driving force behind the litigation.plaintiffs objected to this discovery asserting,in part,that it intruded on their rights of association.
defendants filed a motion to compel.in opposing the motion and in subsequent depositions,plaintiffs claimed the privilege,based in part upon the common interest privilege.in raising this objection,the rothner firm stated that t he guild and the plaintiffs share a common interest the full payment to reality television writers of all wages earned.the rothner firm informed defendants that the guild and the named plaintiffs share a common interest in the subject of this litigation and are thus entitled to communicate with their attorneys and with one another to further their common interest.
in march,the trial court denied in part and granted in part defendants motion to compel.the trial court ordered plaintiffs to respond to one document request and six interrogatories,and permitted defendants to take the depositions of designated guild employees and four plaintiffs two from each lawsuit.
thereafter,the parties stipulated to the following facts the rothner firm represented the guild in other matters and this fact had been revealed to plaintiffs the guild had been involved in investigating and providing material support to litigate both lawsuits the rothner firm had entered into written agreements with plaintiffs that included mandatory disclosures regarding a third party payor,which was the guild and the guild was paying the hourly rate of the rothner firm and had advanced all litigation costs.additionally,the guild offered to stipulate that it did not make decisions regarding legal strategies,nor did it control the litigation.
the rothner firm represented guild director young when he was deposed by defendants.among other statements,young testified that the rothner firm was not required to obtain,nor had it obtained,approval from the guild before it performed any task in the two related class action lawsuits.at times during the deposition,young was instructed not to answer based upon the common interest privilege.thereafter,young signed a declaration in which he declared it was his understanding that litigation decisions would be made by plaintiffs and their counsel,and not by the guild.
four plaintiffs sharp,devolld,shriver and seyyid testified in their depositions that one of their personal goals for being involved in the lawsuits was to assist the guild in its campaign to organize reality television employees.
while the parties were involved in the discovery disputes,attorney leheny filed a charge with the national labor relations board the nlrb alleging defendants discovery interfered with plaintiffs right to engage in concerted activity protected by the national labor relations act.subsequently,the guild withdrew the nlrb charge.
the motion to disqualify,the august and,orders,and defendants appeal 
defendants motion to disqualify and the trial court august and,orders 
on june,the guild signed a conflict waiver acknowledging that it would not interfere with the independent professional judgment of plaintiffs counsel and memorializing the fact that plaintiffs and not the guild controlled the litigation.
in july,defendants brought a motion to disqualify the entire rothner firm.defendants also sought to disqualify all plaintiffs from their role as representative parties defendants argued the discovery ordered by this court regarding conflicts affecting the named plaintiffs and their counsel confirmed defendants the guild conceived,developed,and implemented these two class action lawsuits to advance its efforts to organize employees working on reality television programming b ecause the named plaintiffs and their counsel were hand picked by the guild,are subject to the influence of the guild,and have interests which conflict with those of the putative classes,they are disqualified from representing the absent class members in these cases.
in their motion,defendants raised,among others,the following arguments the interests of the guild and plaintiffs conflicted in that the goal of the litigation was to maximize a fair,adequate,and reasonable resolution through settlement or otherwise,whereas the guild goal was to further its unionizing activities the divided loyalties of plaintiffs and the rothner firm disqualified plaintiffs from acting as representatives of the putative classes the rothner firm was disqualified because there were conflicts of interest that violated rule and all class members of the two putative classes were required to provide written consent to the firm representation.
as of july,attorneys and law clerks from the rothner firm expended over hours on the two lawsuits.of the time expended,percent was performed by attorney leheny,or associates and law clerks under her direction.this included defending three motions,filing one motion,engaging in seven months of discovery,and reviewing over pages of documents that had been exchanged.
after an august,hearing on defendants motion,the trial court issued two separate orders filed two days apart on august and august,denying the disqualification motion.the trial court held that disqualification of the entire rothner firm was unnecessary because the guild had not taken any direct action to interfere with the efforts to obtain maximum compensation for class members and the guild had not taken steps to ascertain defendants strategy.however,the trial court was concerned about potential conflicts of interests and the hypothetical possibility that the guild would control,influence,or interfere with the two related class action lawsuits.the trial court noted that the primary goal of the class actions is to obtain wages and hours earned by reality show workers but unpaid,whereas the secondary goal,according to the guild and to certain of the named plaintiffs is to organize such workers under the guild.the secondary goal is extraneous to the remedies available under the current pleadings and irrelevant to the adjudication of issues framed by the pleadings,and is allowed here only on the collateral subject of disqualification.the court concluded that these two goals did not necessarily conflict,stating there is nothing pernicious about the guild providing legal counsel to members even if the union is in the process of organizing an affected class of workers.
the trial court ruled that disqualification of class counsel is not the proper remedy,particularly in the absence of evidence that the guild has taken any action that interferes with class counsel efforts to obtain maximum compensation for members of the class or evidence that class discovery has been skewed in the direction of ascertaining defendants organizing counter strategies.rather,certain prophylactic measures should be instituted to insure that the guild will not influence the prosecution of the wage and hour claims.these measures included establishing ethical walls that barred members of the rothner firm from communicating with the guild or attorney segall about the litigation,except with regard to the payment of fees.the trial court ordered that there shall be no communications between class counsel,attorney leheny and those working at her direction,and the guild,except for communications relating to the guild payment of legal fees and costs in prosecuting the class actions,and that class counsel shall prevent the guild access to any communications other than fee and cost related communications.
additionally,the trial court ordered the removal of the four plaintiffs who had provided deposition testimony sharp,devolld,shriver and seyyid from their roles as class representatives of the putative classes because these plaintiffs had admitted in their depositions that one of their personal goals was to assist the guild unionizing efforts.the trial court ordered the rothner firm to advise the remaining plaintiffs that the court has determined that organizing the members of the class is not a proper goal of this litigation.further,attorney segall,the guild,and all plaintiffs who continued in their representative capacities were to provide written consent to the terms of the court order.after the hearings,these written consents were obtained.additionally,each plaintiff issued a written notice stating that organizing members of the classes was not a proper goal of the pending litigation.class counsel attorney leheny and those working at her direction discontinued all communication with the guild and with attorney segall regarding the litigation,except for discussions about the payment of fees and costs.
after the august,hearing,class counsel voluntarily associated as robert newman,an attorney with no prior relationship with the guild.attorney newman accepted the case on a contingency.further,class counsel voluntarily agreed that they would not provide legal advice to the guild regarding its organizing campaign,nor perform any work relating to the campaign while the two cases were pending.attorney leheny notified sharp,devolld,shriver and seyyid that they had been removed as class representatives.director young and all plaintiffs who remained as named class representatives signed forms consenting to the terms of the trial court orders.
defendants appeal 
defendants have appealed from the two orders dated august and.they contend that the trial court erred in denying their motion to disqualify the entire rothner firm and in denying their request to disqualify all plaintiffs from their roles as representatives of the two putative classes.the four plaintiffs who were removed from their roles as representatives of the two uncertified classes sharp,devolld,shriver,and seyyid have not appealed from the order removing them as representatives of the putative classes.neither plaintiffs nor the rothner firm have objected to the prophylactic measures imposed by the trial court,including the imposition of ethical walls 
the verbal order and written ruling on the motion to clarify,and plaintiffs 
at the august,hearing on defendants disqualification motion,the trial court expressed some concern about plaintiffs association with the guild.the trial court directed attorney leheny to ask certain questions of those plaintiffs who had not been removed from their representative roles.on october,the trial court ruled on an ex parte motion to clarify its august,verbal orders.
plaintiffs from the trial court verbal orders of august,and from the written order of october.
as of the date of the filing of these appeals,the classes have not been certified 
discussiona.the appeal by defendants 
defendants contend the trial court erred in denying their disqualification motion.they argue that the entire rothner firm should have been disqualified and all plaintiffs should have been removed from their representative roles.we conclude that defendants arguments are unpersuasive.
the denial of the motion to disqualify the entire rothner firm 
defendants contend rule c,c,c,and c f mandate disqualification of the entire rothner firm.defendants argue the interests of the guild and the interests of plaintiffs actually and potentially conflict such that the rothner firm can not represent both the guild and plaintiffs.defendants assert that the rothner firm duty of loyalty to the guild creates actual and potential conflicts of interest because the guild interest in furthering its organizing efforts is antithetical to the sole interests of absent class members,which is to maximize the recovery on the wage and hour claims.we hold that there were effective conflict waivers and thus,the trial court did not err in declining to disqualify the entire rothner firm 
a.the standard of review from rulings on motions to disqualify counsel 
motions to disqualify counsel are especially prone to tactical abuse because disqualification imposes heavy burdens on both the clients and courts clients are deprived of their chosen counsel,litigation costs inevitably increase and delays inevitably occur.as a result,these motions must be examined carefully to ensure that literalism does not deny the parties substantial justice.citation.at the same time,we recognize that disqualification of counsel is necessary under certain circumstances,to protect the integrity of our judicial process by enforcing counsel duties of confidentiality and loyalty.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems cal th,d,see also flatt superior court cal th,d.city of santa barbara superior court th,d,fn.omitted see also,city and county of san francisco cobra solutions,cal th,d.
generally,a trial court decision on a disqualification motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.citations.if the trial court resolved disputed factual issues,the reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the trial court express or implied findings supported by substantial evidence.citations.when substantial evidence supports the trial court factual findings,the appellate court reviews the conclusions based on those findings for abuse of discretion.citation.however,where there are no material disputed factual issues,the appellate court reviews the trial court determination as a question of law.citation.in any event,a disqualification motion involves concerns that justify careful review of the trial court exercise of discretion.citation.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,supra,cal th at,d,speedee oil change,citing in part,in re complex asbestos litigation d.accord,city and county of san francisco cobra solutions,supra,cal th at,d.
here,there are no factual disputes.thus,we independently review the trial court decision not to disqualify the entire rothner firm.
b.the conflict of interest rules and rule 
it is well established that in considering a motion to disqualify counsel,the paramount concern is the preservation of public trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar.jessen hartford casualty ins.th,d.rhaburn superior court th,d.a trial court authority to disqualify an attorney derives from the power inherent in every court t o control in furtherance of justice,the conduct of its ministerial officers,and of all other persons in any manner connected with the judicial proceeding before it,in every matter pertaining thereto.code civ,subd.a speedee oil change,supra,cal th at,d.city of santa barbara superior court,supra,th at,d.
disqualification of counsel not only prevents attorneys from breaching their ethical duties,but also protects the judicial process from any taint of unfairness that might arise from conflicts of interests.ultimately,disqualification motions involve a conflict between the clients right to counsel of their choice and the need to maintain ethical standards of professional responsibility.citation.city and county of san francisco cobra solutions,supra,cal th at,d,accord,gilbert national for housing partnerships th,d gilbert national.

purposes of rule and of requiring informed written consent

when considering purported conflicts of interests arising from concurrent representations,such as the situation before us,courts focus on the attorney duty of loyalty.attorneys who concurrently represent more than one client should not have to choose which client interest are paramount or make a choice between conflicting duties.flatt superior court,supra,cal th at,d,speedee oil change,supra,cal th at,d,santa clara county counsel woodside cal th,d,abrogated by statute on other grounds as recognized in coachella valley mosquito vector control dist.california public employment relations bd.cal th,d.

additionally,the rules of professional conduct recognize that there may be a conflict of interest where,such as the matters before us,a third party is paying for the attorney to represent another person or entity.w hen a third party pays for a lawyer service to a client there is a danger that the lawyer will tailor his or her representation to please the payor rather than the client.citations.the distraction can become more pronounced if the lawyer hopes to be rehired by the same payor on a recurrent basis.hazard hodes,supra,at,fn.omitted accord,to.
however,automatic disqualification is not required in all circumstances where representation of one client creates actual or potential conflicts of interests with another client or when there is a third party payor situation.rather,clients may consent in writing rule a to continued representation by the conflicted attorney after the attorney discloses the relevant circumstances and the actual and reasonably foreseeable adverse consequences to the client rule a.in order for there to be valid consent,clients must indicate that they know of,understand and acknowledge the presence of a conflict of interest gilbert national,supra,th at,d rest d of the law governing lawyers,supra,informed consent requires that the client or former client have reasonably adequate information about the material risks of such representation to that client or,former client.aba model rules conduct,rule e informed consent denotes the agreement by a person to a proposed course of conduct after the lawyer has communicated adequate information and explanation about the material risks of and reasonably available alternatives to the proposed course of conduct.see,in re marriage of egedi th,d.

d.there were effective written waivers 
plaintiffs and the guild waived any conflict of interest 
here,all plaintiffs,who were the named representatives of the putative classes,were fully aware of all conflicts,which they waived.plaintiffs signed conflict waiver forms in which they acknowledged that the guild was paying for the litigation.plaintiffs knew that the rothner firm represented the guild.plaintiffs were adamant that they would control the outcome of the litigation and would decide the outcome of the case.the guild signed a conflict waiver acknowledging that it would not interfere with the independent judgment of plaintiffs counsel and memorializing that plaintiffs,and not the guild,controlled the litigation.pursuant to court order,plaintiffs were informed that the proper goal of the litigation was not to facilitate the guild unionizing activities,and plaintiffs provided written consent acknowledging that they had been so informed.the guild and plaintiffs provided written consent to the trial court order.
thus,all clients who were directly affected by any purported conflict,the guild,and all plaintiffs,were fully apprised of any potential conflicts of interests,understood the role of the rothner firm,the aim of the litigation,and who was to control the litigation.the clients the guild and plaintiffs understood the relevant circumstance and the actual and foreseeable consequences of the rothner firm simultaneous representation of them.the written waivers demonstrated that the guild and plaintiffs understood and acknowledged the presence of all purported conflicts of interests and the material risks of continued representation by the rothner firm.plaintiffs and the guild made rational choices armed with full disclosures and provided informed written consent to the simultaneous representation by the rothner firm.
plaintiffs could provide the required waivers 
defendants argue that the waivers by plaintiffs were inadequate.defendants suggest each and every member of the two putative classes was required to provide written consent to representation by the rothner firm.this argument,which we examine de novo,is not persuasive for a number of reasons.
defendants argument ignores the procedural posture of the case.plaintiffs have not filed motions to certify the classes and no classes have been certified.thus,at this point in the litigation,the plaintiffs represent themselves.
further,obtaining consent from all absent class members prior to certification is impractical,as the names of the absent class members are most likely unknown.see southern california edison superior court cal d,fn,hazard hodes,supra,at i t is unrealistic to speak of individual consultation with large numbers of class members and unrealistic to imagine that each client could give truly informed consent.even after a class is certified,it is often impossible to ensure that every class member receives actual notice and thus notice to class members of a lawsuit needs only be reasonably calculated to reach absent class members cal.rules of court,rule f hypertouch,superior court th,d actual notice not required.
also,in actuality,defendants argument is a request that we require all members of the class to the class action litigation.however,procedures conflict with california class action procedures and inevitably are methods that permit a class action defendant to chip away at the size of a class.hypertouch,superior court,supra,th at,d.were we to require a procedure by which each and every member of a class action lawsuit has to agree to the choice of class counsel,we would eviscerate the class action device that is designed to permit class members to sit back through the process,knowing there are safeguards for their protection.id.at,d.
additionally,the class action procedures already include a system by which the court determines if the named class representatives can adequately represent the class.these procedures ensure that if there are conflict of interest issues,the representative plaintiffs are capable of providing informed consent on behalf of the class.the plaintiffs seeking certification have the burden to show that they can adequately represent the class by vigorously and tenaciously protecting the class members interests.lockheed martin superior court cal th,d,simons horowitz d.as part of this analysis,the trial court assesses the competency of class counsel,if the firm is representing the class as a whole and not simply the interests of the named representative plaintiffs richmond dart industries,cal d,cal pak delivery,united parcel service,th,d cal pak delivery,and if the named plaintiffs have lent their names to litigation that is controlled by class counsel.howard gunty profit sharing plan superior court th,d.a person class representative status may be defeated if there is a serious conflict among the members of the class that goes to the very subject matter of the litigation richmond dart industries,supra,at,global minerals metals superior court th,d morgan,superior court th,d.
thus,when plaintiffs seek to have the classes certified,they will have the burden of meeting these requirements.at that time,if the trial court concludes that plaintiffs motives for pursuing the lawsuits or their connection to the guild make them incapable of providing informed written conflict waivers,then the trial court will not permit certification.
while california rules of professional conduct and case law have not directly addressed the issue presented here,permitting named class members to provide informed consent in class action lawsuits is consistent with the aba model rules of professional conduct,which may serve as guidelines absent california authority or a conflicting state public policy citation.city and county of san francisco cobra solutions,supra,cal th at,d.aba model rules of professional conduct,rule addresses conflict of interests between concurrent clients.comment authorizes the class representative to provide informed consent.it reads when a lawyer represents or seeks to represent a class of plaintiffs or defendants in a lawsuit,unnamed members of the class are ordinarily not considered to be clients of the lawyer for purposes of applying paragraph a of this rule that restricts representation when there are concurrent conflicts of interest.thus,the lawyer does not typically need to get the consent of such a person before representing a client suing the person in an unrelated matter.similarly,a lawyer seeking to represent an opponent in a class action does not typically need the consent of an unnamed member of the class whom the lawyer represents in an unrelated matter.aba model rules conduct,rule,com.
in the realm of class actions,the rules of disqualification can not be applied so as to defeat the purpose of the class proceedings.lazy oil witco cir,traditional rules of professional conduct can not be applied mechanically in the realm of class actions.rather,the circumstances of each case must be evaluated.
the motion to disqualify here is not brought by one of the parties who may suffer because of a purported conflict,but by opposition parties who are not directly touched by the purported conflict.disqualification of the rothner firm may impose a significant hardship on plaintiffs,who will bear the burden on finding replacement counsel with the skills and knowledge of the rothner firm,a firm that already has expended more than hours on the case,including the review of more than pages of documents over seven months.mcphearson michaels th,d.as such,we must be skeptical of the impetus and purpose of defendants motion to disqualify the rothner firm because it poses the very threat to the integrity of the judicial process that it purports to prevent.such motions can be used to harass opposing counsel,to delay the litigation,to intimidate an adversary into accepting settlement on otherwise unacceptable terms,or for other strategic purposes.citation.accord,zador kwan,supra,th,d mcphearson michaels,supra,at,d generally conflicts may be waived by persons personally interested and courts must be skeptical when disqualification motions are brought by opposing parties.
lastly,we can not ignore the public interest consequences of permitting the disqualification of the rothner firm at this point in the litigation.it is the policy of this state to vigorously enforce minimum labor standards in order to ensure employees are not required or permitted to work under substandard unlawful conditions and to protect employers who comply with the law from those who attempt to gain a competitive advantage at the expense of their workers by failing to comply with minimum labor standards.constitutional rights of association,speech,and assembly permit unions to provide,and assist in obtaining,legal services for their members.united transportation union michigan bar,d mine workers illinois bar,d railroad trainmen virginia bar,d frye tenderloin housing clinic,cal th,d,the first amendment protects the associational and expressive rights of lawyers and join together to employ litigation to seek redress of grievances.
wage and hour litigation is often financed by labor unions to support their members and members of the public because employees often lack the resources to do so.such litigation is designed to protect all workers,including members of the union and,shaffer farm fresh,cir aguiar cintas.th,d gentry superior court cal th,d,recognizing that class actions play important role in enforcing labor laws.to deny these employees access to attorneys knowledgeable in labor law based upon an objection filed by their employer,when the named representatives of the class action lawsuit and the union have waived all conflicts and the motion is brought before class certification is sought will provide a tactical edge to the employer at the expense of the putative class.it will also preclude attorneys from representing union members if the attorneys have assisted the union in activities.see,mcclendon continental group,union funding does not make interest of named parties antagonistic to interests of class.the california rules of professional responsibility can not be construed so as to prohibit this type of advocacy.further,they can not be construed so as to hurt class members,under the guise of protecting them.
we can not assume that the rothner firm will fail to abide by its ethical obligations and there is no evidence that it will subvert the interests of one of its clients,plaintiffs and members of the putative class,for those of its other client,the guild.shaffer farm fresh,supra,case under the federal labor standards act funded by union union primary outside counsel acted as counsel for the class under virginia rules of professional conduct,circuit court reversed a disqualification order holding it was based upon speculation that attorneys would subvert the clients interests for those of the union compare with kamean local,intern.broth.of teamsters named plaintiffs and counsel are disqualified where litigation was designed by opposing union to dismantle the very class plaintiffs purportedly were acting to assist.
as stated above,the focus of disqualification motions must be on the preservation of public trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar.thus,in exercising its inherent authority,a trial court may,at times,decline to accept a client proffered waiver,people baylis,supra,th at,d where criminal court is confronted with actual conflict that may affect integrity of the proceedings,court is not obligated to accept as adequate a conflict waiver in re th,d conflict not waivable where father,an attorney,pleads nolo contendere to molesting his daughters,and three daughters waive conflict of interest to permit father to represent them in petition to destroy juvenile records and eliminate references to them in juvenile file of another sibling tsakos shipping trading,juniper garden town homes,th,d where there is an actual conflict,party may not consent to dual representation of conflicting interests at trial.consent can not cure a conflict where it is not reasonably likely that the lawyer will be able to provide adequate representation to one or more clients.rest d law governing lawyers,supra,at see also,hazard hodes,supra,at.this is not one of those cases.
e.the cases relied upon by defendants do not alter our conclusion 
defendants rely on a trio of cases all making the statement that unidentified class members can not waive a potential conflict of interest.this statement originated in palumbo,at page palumbo.thereafter,it was quoted in cal pak delivery,supra,th,d,and finally,without proper attribution,it was quoted in apple computer,supra,th,d.however,at most,these three cases hold that courts properly disqualify counsel when there are irreconcilable conflicts of interests.these authorities do not mandate that all conflict waivers must be from each and every member of a class.
in palumbo,an attorney obtained an ownership interest and a seat on the board of the defendant affiliate upon resolving a race discrimination case.palumbo,supra,at.thereafter,the same attorney brought a class action race discrimination lawsuit against the defendant.palumbo held that the attorney could not act as class counsel.in so holding,the court stated,that by bringing a class action lawsuit against the defendant alleging misdeeds by the defendant affiliates,plaintiff is essentially suing himself.id.at.the court also stated,the fact that counsel seek s to represent a national class of plaintiffs makes the decision to disqualify even more compelling.if he were representing only an individual plaintiff,he could conceivably seek a written waiver of conflict of interest.but in this case,he seeks to represent a large,unenumerated and as yet unidentified class of plaintiffs.unidentified class members can not waive a potential conflict of interest.id.at.
cal pak delivery,supra,th,d,involved a situation in which an attorney represented one named plaintiff,his client cal pak delivery,in an action styled as a class action lawsuit against the united postal service.the attorney offered to sell out cal pak delivery,the sole class representative,as well as all putative class members by offering to accept a personal payment of to million in exchange for dismissing the lawsuit,with the purported class taking nothing.id.at,d.the appellate court stated that although counsel actions did not involve the misuse of confidential information,nor directly prejudice adverse parties,it was nonetheless more inimical to the interests of those he ostensibly represented.id.at,d.the attorney breached his fiduciary duties and his duty of loyalty.ibid.cal pak delivery clearly was correct in upholding the order disqualifying counsel as it would have been abhorrent to permit class counsel to remain in that role after he tried to sell out the class for personal gain.however,in discussing the issues,cal pak delivery threw into the discussion a long quotation from palumbo,supra,at pages to,which included the sentence unidentified class members can not waive a potential conflict of interest.cal pak delivery,supra,at,d.
in apple computer,supra,th,d,an attorney was the sole named plaintiff in a class action brought under business and professions code section the ucl.the attorney law firm and represented the class.also served in a number of other cases,all brought under the ucl.apple computer,supra,at,d.apple held that both law firms should be disqualified because their interest in the litigation was to maximize litigation fees at the expense of class members.apple noted that the attorney fees would dwarf the the individual members of the class could reap and there was concern that the litigation was manufactured solely to produce attorney fees.id.at,d.further,should also be disqualified because it had a financially interdependent relationship with the attorney firm.id.at,d.here,defendants rely upon footnote seven of apple that stated assuming that this type of conflict could be waived by a client see flatt superior court,supra,cal th at,fn,d,a waiver is not possible in this case.unidentified class members can not waive a potential conflict of interest.cal pak delivery,united parcel service,supra,th at,d.apple computer,supra,at,fn,d.by this citation,apple failed to recognize that cal pak delivery had taken the quote from palumbo.further,apple holding makes the footnote dicta.in apple,the lawsuits were not designed to benefit the class members.rather,the plaintiff attorney and his law firm manufactured class action lawsuits fo
