in this appeal,which involves the interplay between the issuance or renewal of bureau of land management blm grazing permits and the provisions of the equal access to justice act eaja,western watersheds project western watersheds appeals the summary judgment determination that eaja fees were not available to western watersheds because its environmental claims were brought in a grazing permit renewal proceeding.we agree with the district court reasoning and affirm.
background 
statutory and regulatory.the taylor grazing act of 
the taylor grazing act of authorizes the secretary of the interior to issue federal grazing leases to qualified applicants.blm,an agency within the department of interior,implements the act and,since,has required ranchers grazing cattle on federal land to obtain a grazing permit.b.blm also monitors rangeland health,environmental issues within a given grazing allotment and,based on its evaluation of a particular allotment,may determine that corrective actions are necessary.see c.these permitting and monitoring functions overlap because permittee actions may affect rangeland health.accordingly,when a party seeks a new or renewed grazing permit,blm considers what terms,if any,are necessary to include in the permit to improve rangeland health.
to determine the necessary terms,blm considers the permit against the standards and guidelines for the relevant geographical area,which in turn requires consideration of issues such as water quality and habitat for endangered or threatened species.d.once blm has identified terms for the permit,it issues a proposed grazing decision.an applicant,permittee,or other interested party may protest this decision.absent a protest and reconsideration,the proposed decision becomes a final grazing decision,which an interested party may then appeal.if no appeal is taken,or if a decision on appeal affirms an agency decision,the final grazing decision terms become the terms of the new grazing permit or renewal.a.thus,agency action results in either the grant or denial of a its renewal or includes consideration of rangeland health and provides opportunity for interested parties to object.
the equal access to justice act 
the eaja partially waives the sovereign immunity of the united states,allowing an award of attorneys fees in certain circumstances.in general,a n agency that conducts an adversary adjudication shall award,to a prevailing party other than the united states,fees and other expenses incurred by that party in connection with that proceeding,though there are exceptions if the adjudicative officer of the agency finds that the position of the agency was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.a.
central to this appeal is whether the underlying proceeding falls within the eaja definition of adversary adjudication.in relevant part,adversary adjudication means an adjudication under section of the administrative procedure act apa in which the position of the united states is represented by counsel or otherwise,but excludes an adjudication for the purpose of establishing or fixing a rate or for the purpose of granting or renewing a license.b c i emphasis added.a grazing permit,such as here,is a license for the purpose of this statute.see b.
factual history 
western watersheds is a,conservation group with a history of litigation success.in,western watersheds obtained an injunction against blm the hahn injunction,requiring blm to correct environmental degradation caused through blm management of public lands in idaho,including its issuance of grazing permits to cattle ranchers on the hardtrigger allotment of the owyhee resource area in southwestern idaho.see idaho watersheds project hahn,cir,abrogated on other grounds by winter natural res.def.council,as recognized in monsanto geertson seed farms.
in response to the hahn injunction,blm reviewed its grazing management in the hardtrigger allotment,concluding that livestock grazing was causing violations of applicable minimum rangeland health standards.in april,blm sought to address this problem by issuing five final decisions renewing amended grazing permits that included new requirements for rangeland improvements,such as construction of new fences,pipelines,troughs,cattle guards,and other range improvements.blm supported these decisions with an environmental assessment and a finding of no significant impact,pursuant to the national environmental protection act nepa,see.
in may,western watersheds filed administrative appeals of each permit,alleging numerous violations of nepa and other federal regulations,including claims that blm failed to examine environmental impacts on sensitive plants and wildlife that would result from the construction of the rangeland improvements prescribed in the renewed permits.an administrative law judge alj consolidated the appeals and granted a partial stay.the parties then entered into a stipulated settlement agreement that,once approved,reversed blm decisions renewing the permits and enjoined construction of all range developments.
having succeeded,western watersheds moved for fees and costs under the eaja.the alj denied the motion,finding western watersheds was not a prevailing party,an issue disputed in the administrative proceedings but uncontested by the government before the district court.
western watersheds appealed to the interior board of land appeals appeals board.the appeals board affirmed the alj decision denying fees,though it declined to affirm the reasoning that western watersheds was not a prevailing party.instead,the appeals board found the appeal challenged renewals of five grazing permits on the hardtrigger allotment and that it therefore fell within one of the exceptions to the class of adversary adjudications for which fees are awarded.the appeals board deemed the case controlled by william thoman,ibla,in which it had noted that,while not every case involving a license necessarily falls within the eaja exception,those adjudications for the purpose of granting or renewing a license clearly do.while the appeals board accepted that western watersheds motive behind its appeal was to force environmental compliance rather than to dispute a permit it sought for itself,the appeals board explained that appellants subjective motivation for pursuing an appeal can not change the objective character of the underlying proceeding being challenged,which in this case was a grazing permit renewal.
after the appeals board denied reconsideration,western watersheds filed in the district court pursuant to the apa and moved for summary judgment,seeking reversal of the appeals board decision.characterizing the issue as whether the adjudication was for the purpose of granting or renewing a license so as to preclude attorney fees,the district court found that the nature of the initial proceedings rather than the intent of the party seeking fees defines the purpose of the adjudication.consequently,the district court denied western watersheds motion for summary judgment and affirmed the appeals board decision.this appeal followed.
ii.standard of review 
the district court interpretation of the eaja as well as its denial of summary judgment in an administrative action are reviewed de novo.see zambrano,cir,amended by cir gifford pinchot task force fish wildlife,cir.a final decision of the appeals board shall be set aside only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a gilmore lujan,cir.
iii.discussion 
the sole issue here is whether western watersheds administrative appeal was an adjudication for the purpose of granting or renewing a license and thus excepted from the definition of adversary adjudication for which fees are otherwise recoverable under the eaja 
the parties offer competing views on how to determine the purpose of an adjudication and,correspondingly,the availability of attorneys fees under the eaja.the appeals board argues that the purpose of an administrative appeal is controlled by the nature of the underlying agency this case,the renewal of grazing permits.western watersheds contends that the purpose of its appeal was
