a judgment creditor filed a lien under code of civil procedure section against a pending lawsuit brought by the judgment debtor.the judgment debtor and the defendants subsequently agreed to settle that lawsuit with a payment by the defendants of in cash,a transfer of interests in real property,and a payment by the defendants of the taxes past due on the real property.the judgment debtor moved for an order approving the settlement and the payment of attorney fees and costs ahead of the judgment creditor.the judgment creditor opposition to the motion claimed the transfer of the real property interest was structured to avoid its judgment lien and it was inequitable to give the attorney lien priority because the attorneys helped evade the lien.the superior court approved the settlement and ruled the lien of the attorneys for fees and costs had priority.
the judgment creditor appeals,claiming too little information was presented about the transfer of interests in the real property for the superior court to have properly exercised its discretion in approving the settlement.because of this lack of information,the superior court was unable to tell if the settlement was structured to evade the judgment lien.we conclude the record did not contain information necessary for the superior court to exercise its discretion,and the judgment debtor failed to provide sufficient facts for the court to understand the property interests being transferred,the entities involved,and the relationship between the entities and the property interests.we reverse and remand for further consideration.
facts and proceedings

in accordance with the agreement,p d filed an action on behalf of oldham,as an individual and as trustee for the eno trust,against defendants in kern superior court,case oldham action.max gradowitz and marta gradowitz filed a against oldham alleging in damages from a breach of contract.
lienholder became aware of the oldham action and filed a judicial council form notice of lien,in that case on march.the notice of lien was filed pursuant to code of civil procedure section 
on january,the mandatory settlement conference was held in the oldham action,but a settlement was not reached.however,within a week,the parties to the oldham action had reached a tentative agreement on settlement.a draft of the settlement agreement prepared by counsel for defendants stated that defendants would pay in cash,execute a grant deed in oldham favor with respect to of a section of agricultural land located in riverside county,california jojoba property,obtain title insurance on the jojoba property in favor of oldham,and cause california investment fund,cif to assign its deed of trust in the jojoba property to oldham.the draft settlement agreement also stated oldham was to deliver to counsel for defendants an unrecorded grant deed dated august,that he held against the jojoba property grant deed.under the grant deed,california capital fund,granted the jojoba property to ernest oldham,trustee,for investors of capital investment fund,ii.
by letter dated january,p d informed counsel for lienholder of the proposed settlement and provided a copy of the draft of the settlement agreement.the letter also proposed that percent of the cash proceeds from the settlement be paid to p d as its attorney fees with the balance applied to lienholder judgment lien.
subsequent negotiations between oldham and defendants led to their execution of a final settlement in late february.under the settlement agreement,defendants agreed to pay oldham and the eno trust in cash,cause cif to reconvey its deed of trust against the jojoba property,and pay all past due property taxes against the jojoba property as a result of changes from the terms of the draft settlement agreement,oldham would not receive fee simple ownership of the jojoba property.instead,oldham could take title to the jojoba property as trustee for investors of capital investment fund.ii if he chose to record the grant deed.the settlement agreement did not require oldham to record the grant deed.
the record on appeal does not contain any information about cif,capital investment fund.ii,or the investors in capital investment fund.ii,except that defendants appear to control cif to an extent that they can cause it to reconvey its deed of trust against the jojoba property.the public records maintained by the california secretary of state and available through the internet indicate a corporation named california investment fund,was incorporated on january,was suspended and reinstated in,and was suspended again on may,by the franchise tax board.according to those records,the corporation is still suspended.it is not clear whether this corporation is the cif referred to in the settlement agreement.also,the search of these records did not reveal a corporation named capital investment fund.ii 
after the parties signed the settlement agreement,counsel for oldham filed a motion for an order approving the settlement and for the disbursement of settlement proceeds.the motion proposed that the attorney fees and costs of oldham counsel be paid from the cash proceeds and the remaining available cash be paid to lienholder.
lienholder filed an opposition to oldham motion arguing for denial of the motion because oldham did not provide the court with enough information to exercise its discretionary authority to include such terms and conditions as the court deems necessary in accordance with section,subdivision b.in particular,the motion focused on how the settlement handled the jojoba property,the uncertainty created regarding oldham interest in the jojoba property,and the possibility the uncertainty was created to evade the judgment lien.lienholder argued that oldham should have filed a declaration explaining why the grant deed was never recorded,how he could have acted as a legitimate trustee without recording the grant deed to protect the interests of the beneficiaries and why the settlement terms concerning the jojoba property were modified so oldham would not take fee simple title.
in oldham reply to lienholder opposition,oldham counsel responded to lienholder demand for an explanation of the change in settlement terms concerning the jojoba property by stating that the explanation demanded would invade the privilege.also,the declaration of counsel for oldham accompanying the reply stated the following about the settlement agreement treatment of the jojoba property 
when tentative settlement terms were agreed to in late january,a portion of the settlement called for defendant california capital fund,sic to deed the jojoba property to oldham.during our due diligence regarding the jojoba p roperty,we discovered the property had been previously deeded to oldham as a trustee on august.a true and correct copy of the august,grant deed is attached hereto as exhibit a.since the property was previously deeded to oldham as a trustee for the benefit of investors in capital investment fund.ii,it did not seem viable to have the deed reconveyed to the defendant so that a new deed,solely in the name of oldham,could be issued as part of this settlement.accordingly,we negotiated with defendants to reconvey their deed of trust against the property and pay the back property taxes.
the superior court heard oral argument on the motion for an order approving the settlement on march.at the start of the hearing the superior court stated its tentative ruling was to grant oldham motion and also stated,i not sure i need to establish what the real property tax situation may be,but in terms of the priority issue and whether or not this settlement can go forward,i see nothing legally preventing the settlement at the end of the argument,the superior court stated it would rule as stated in its tentative order,and directed p d,as counsel for oldham,to prepare the order.on march,a written order approving the settlement and directing disbursement of the cash proceeds was filed.of the cash proceeds of,p d was to receive to pay its fee and for costs.the balance of was to be applied to the judgment lien of lienholder.
three weeks later,lienholder filed a motion to enter judgment against defendants for violation of the rights of lienholder.in the motion,lienholder argued that defendants transferred property that was subject to the lien within the meaning of section,subdivision c and therefore were liable to lienholder for the value of the interest in the jojoba property that was transferred free of its judgment lien.
defendants filed an opposition to the motion to enter judgment against them,contending the superior court lacked jurisdiction to enter such an order and lienholder waived its argument by not raising the issue in its opposition to the motion to approve the settlement.the motion was heard on may,and the superior court denied the motion on the grounds that its ruling on the motion to approve the settlement resolved the issues raised by lienholder motion.lienholder then filed a notice of appeal of the order approving the settlement and the order denying the motion to enter judgment against defendants.
discussion 
this appeal concerns provisions in the code of civil procedure governing the lien a judgment creditor may obtain against a judgment debtor who is a party to a pending action or proceeding.article.under article,a judgment creditor may place a lien on the rights of the judgment debtor to receive money,property or both by way of a settlement or judgment entered in that action,subd.a.in this appeal,the primary dispute concerns section,which provides in relevant part 
a except as provided in subdivision c of section,unless the judgment creditor money judgment is first satisfied or the lien is released,no compromise,dismissal,settlement,or satisfaction of the pending action may be entered into by or on behalf of the judgment debtor,without the written consent of the judgment creditor or authorization by order of the court obtained under subdivision b.
b upon application by the judgment debtor,the court in which the action is pending may,in its discretion,after a hearing,make an order described in subdivision a that may include such terms and conditions as the court deems necessary.the application for an order under this subdivision shall be made on noticed motion.the notice of motion shall be served on the judgment creditor.service shall be made personally or by mail.
oldham and defendants argue that the superior court approval of their settlement of the oldham action was within the discretion granted by subdivision b of section.in contrast,lienholder argues the superior court abused its discretion by acting without sufficient information about the undisclosed benefits oldham received,or may have received,from cif reconveyance of its deed of trust against the jojoba property,and defendants payment of the property taxes due on the jojoba property.
ii.standard of review 
an abuse of discretion standard generally applies to a decision concerning the approval of a settlement under section.pangborn plumbing carruthers skiffington th,d.
iii.the proponent of the settlement failed to present facts material to approval 
it is well established that t o exercise the power of judicial discretion,all material facts and evidence must be both known and considered,together with legal principles essential to an informed,intelligent and just decision.people lara th,d in re cortez cal d.thus,a superior court abuses its discretion when it fails to consider relevant factors.see visco abatti d.to apply these principles,we must determine what facts are material to the approval of a settlement under section,and whether,in this case,the superior court knew and considered those facts.
facts relating to evasion of the lien are material 
a lien under article reaches the judgment debtor right to both money and property,subd.a.therefore,if oldham received rights to the jojoba property under the settlement,lienholder lien should have reached those property rights.
one purpose of the lien is to establish and preserve the judgment creditor priority to the money and property the judgment debtor may receive from the pending action.legislative revision com,west civ.proc.ed.foll.this legislative purpose is best served if a lien obtained under article is an effective remedy for judgment creditors.to provide an effective remedy,we conclude article must be implemented to prevent the judgment debtor,with or without the active assistance of other parties to the settlement agreement,from structuring a settlement so it receives benefits while evading the lien of the judgment creditor,absent appropriate equitable considerations.
this conclusion is based on the principle that,when a judgment debtor can evade a lien and incur no consequences,the lien will not provide an effective remedy to the judgment creditor,case law arising under the predecessor statute,and analogies to other areas of law where a court has the discretion to approve a settlement.
the fourth district court of appeal has recognized that one purpose of the predecessor of article,former section,was to prevent certain types of collusion that result in harm to the judgment creditor interests.abatti eldridge d.disapproval of the settlement upheld.in that case,the judgment creditor interests were harmed because he would have received nothing under the settlement negotiated between the judgment debtor and certain of his creditors.ibid.the fourth district stated that the court should have all relevant and necessary information to determine the size of the pie,the slice of the pieces,and when it is appropriate for one creditor to go hungry.id.at.the court also observed that some facts become conspicuous by their omission.ibid.
the fourth district analysis remains instructive even though former section was repealed by the enactment of article.although the california law revision commission comments to article do not explicitly address settlements designed to evade the lien of the judgment creditor,nothing in the comments suggests that lien evasion is no longer a factor material to analyzing the equities of the settlement.the commission was aware of the abatti eldridge decision and cited it to support certain points.see legislative com.com.and cal.law revision com,west civ,supra,foll.if the prevention of collusion and lien evasion were no longer important for purposes of article,we infer that the commission would have explicitly commented on such a significant change.also,neither oldham nor defendants have cited to any legislative history or other authority stating that lien evasion is immaterial to the approval of a settlement under section.
our conclusion that lien evasion is material and must be considered by the superior court is consistent with the rules of law applied to other situations where courts are requested to exercise their discretion in the approval of settlements.in approving the settlement of a class action,a court exercises its discretion in determining whether the settlement is fair and reasonable.wershba apple computer,th,d.to exercise this discretion and protect the interests of persons who are not parties to the settlement agreement,the court must consider evidence that enables it to reach a reasoned judgment that the agreement is not the product of fraud or overreaching by,or collusion between,the negotiating parties.dunk ford motor th,d.
