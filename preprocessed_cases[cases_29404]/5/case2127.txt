the registry,udr,and harvey saltz appeal from an order denying udr special motions to strike the complaint pursuant to code of civil procedure section all further code references are to the code of civil procedure unless otherwise indicated and awarding plaintiffs attorney fees pursuant to subdivision c of section.section,commonly referred to as the statute provides for a special motion to strike a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,subd.b.
we affirm the order denying udr special motions to strike because udr failed to notice a timely hearing on the motions.section,subdivision f provides that a special motion to strike shall be noticed for hearing not more than days after service unless the docket conditions of the court require a later hearing.udr failed to notice its motions for hearing within days of service and failed to show the condition of the trial court docket required a later hearing.the trial court therefore could not grant the motions.
we dismiss saltz appeal because he failed to bring his own motion to strike pursuant to section and therefore lacks standing to appeal.we conclude the award of attorney fees was erroneous because the trial court did not articulate the reasons for the order and because the record does not otherwise support an award of attorney fees.

discussion 
special motions to strike were not noticed for a timely hearing because they were not noticed for hearing within days of their service,and udr failed to show docket conditions required a later hearing.
the statute provides that a cause of action arising out of an act of the defendant in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or free speech is subject to a special motion to strike,subd.b.the legislature enacted the statute to protect defendants,including corporate defendants,from interference with the valid exercise of their constitutional rights,particularly the right of freedom of speech and the right to petition the government for the redress of grievances.schoendorf registry,th,d.
subdivision f of section provides specific time deadlines for bringing a special motion to strike.subdivision f consists of these two sentences the special motion may be filed within days of the service of the complaint or,in the court discretion,at any later time upon terms it deems proper.the motion shall be noticed for hearing not more than days after service unless the docket conditions of the court require a later hearing.
udr special motions to strike were timely under the first sentence of subdivision f of section because they were filed within days of service of the complaint.the motions were not noticed for a timely hearing,however,under the second sentence of subdivision f.udr served the motions on september.they were noticed for hearing for october,than days later.
udr failed to show that the trial court docket conditions required a hearing beyond the deadline.in its moving papers,udr did not attempt to show the condition of the trial court docket required a later hearing.when plaintiffs opposed the motions on the ground of improper notice,udr submitted an attorney declaration to the trial court offering this explanation said motion was set with the assistance of the court clerk.upon my telephonic request,the court clerk informed me of various dates the court would be able to hear the three motions in this case.i then coordinated said dates with the dates of availability of all defendants.october,was the earliest option under the circumstances.
this declaration does not show that docket conditions required a later hearing,as subdivision f of section requires.the declaration does not state that october was the earliest date available on the court calendar.the declaration establishes only that udr selected the october date for the defendants convenience.subdivision f of section does not identify a party convenience as a ground for hearing a special motion to strike more than days after service.
