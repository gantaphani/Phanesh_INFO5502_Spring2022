background 
history of merrick claim 
clinton merrick,purchased an own occupation disability policy from defendant paul revere life insurance company in.under that policy,if merrick was unable to perform the important duties of his occupation due to injury or sickness,he was entitled to a total disability benefit of per month for the duration of his disability.at the time,merrick was one of three partners at a venture capital firm,responsible for raising capital,evaluating investment options,and participating as a director in companies in which the firm invested.merrick had entered the venture capital arena following a successful career as a marketing executive,where his accomplishments included campaigns for country time lemonade,crystal light drink mix,and the man.
in the early,merrick began suffering from fatigue,muscle pain,mental confusion,and other difficulties that affected his work performance.his attending physician,simon epstein,referred him to several specialists to identify the problem.in august,stuart mushlin indicated that merrick may be suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome cfs and found him unable to work.this diagnosis coincided with his partners decision to buy out merrick interest in the firm due to recent underperformance,which merrick attributed to his health problems.
merrick first alerted paul revere to his disability on may,stating that he was suffering from a disabling condition but was not yet filing a claim.merrick then met with additional specialists and underwent a battery of specialized tests at the mayo clinic,some of which showed normal results and some of which indicated abnormalities.michael silber,summarizing the mayo clinic results,diagnosed merrick as suffering from cfs and lyme disease,and advised that he restart work at a much lower stress level than previously.by this time merrick was under the regular care of alan rapaport rather than epstein both epstein and rapaport concurred with the cfs diagnosis and found merrick unable to work.
following the mayo clinic confirmation of the cfs diagnosis,merrick filed a formal claim with paul revere.paul revere physician reviewed merrick documentation,questioned the diagnosis but ultimately agreed that the records supported a finding of significant impairment.therefore paul revere began paying out merrick claim as of december,when his benefits began to accrue.
merrick tried to start a new venture capital firm in late,but his illness prevented him from getting beyond the initial stages.merrick other insurer,northwestern mutual,notified paul revere in june that merrick was seeking to enter a new business venture.that august,a paul revere field representative offered to settle merrick claim for an amount equal to four months of disability benefits,citing the return to work and recovery provision of his claim.merrick declined,whereupon the representative left him with a check for one month of benefits.merrick returned this check because he believed an endorsement provision on the check would have settled his claim upon cashing.
paul revere then arranged for james donaldson to perform an independent medical examination in december.donaldson report was inconclusive based on his tests,he concluded that merrick does not have either an active neurological problem or active lyme disease but did note his chronic fatigue,attributing it to depression.he also found that merrick deserves aggressive treatment,both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy,by a seasoned psychiatrist.paul revere claim file shows that the company interpreted donaldson report as supporting significant impairment,and as implying that merrick could not return to work rapaport,merrick treating physician,disputed donaldson conclusions and reiterated his cfs diagnosis.
paul revere conducted an intensive review of merrick claim file,which concluded that there does not appear to be any disability.the field representative again offered a compromise settlement,which merrick refused.on december,paul revere denied merrick claim on the ground that the internal review showed no objective medical documentation which supports an inability to perform the duties of your occupation as a venture capitalist.after merrick protested,paul revere agreed to pay two additional months of benefits while merrick provided the company with objective medical evidence.but the company medical consultants rejected the two reports merrick offered to document his illness,so paul revere continued to deny merrick claim.merrick filed suit against paul revere and its parent corporation,unum provident,in april,claiming breach of contract and of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.
pretrial motion in limine 
merrick sought production of all documents added to paul revere claim file after merrick brought suit.the insurers resisted this request,citing among other reasons privilege.after merrick brought a motion to compel production,the magistrate judge warned the insurers that failure to produce a privilege log would waive privilege and instructed the insurers not to invoke the privilege unless the claim file actually included privileged material.paul revere then reiterated its privilege objection in a supplemental response to merrick document request,without producing a privilege log,and attested that n otwithstanding and subject to these objections,it had produced all responsive documents.
in the meantime,merrick discovered that when he filed this suit,counsel for the insurers assumed active management of the merrick claim file.as a result,he became concerned that the insurers were using the privilege to shield otherwise responsive documents from discovery,by claiming they were privileged communications between the insurers and counsel rather than routine documents related to claims adjustment.merrick sought another hearing before the magistrate judge,who granted merrick motion to compel,held all privileges waived and ordered the insurers to produce all responsive documents.the insurers produced no additional documents in response indeed,unum provident reiterated its privilege claim in a later discovery response.
merrick then brought a motion in limine to suppress all documents in his claim file acquired after litigation commenced,on the ground that the insurers were picking and choosing which documents would be produced in discovery.in response,the insurers stated that no documents had been withheld on the basis of privilege,although at the hearing counsel for the insurers suggested in passing that such privileged documents existed.merrick found this representation incredible,given that the insurers had collected over pages of documents following the filing of the suit yet produced only three short memos analyzing that material.merrick insisted before the district judge that the insurers were hiding evidence and demanded production of all notes and other documents reflecting the thought processes underlying management of merrick claim.the district court judge granted the motion in limine,and at trial suppressed much of this documentation on the ground that defendants were picking and choosing which documents to produce.after the court granted the motion in limine,the insurers submitted a declaration stating that they did not any documents on the basis of privilege.
at trial,merrick argued that the denial of his claim was part of a larger scheme to scrub the company liability for expensive and noncancellable own occupation disability policies.merrick relied largely upon the testimony of stephen prater,an insurance industry expert,who testified regarding unum provident allegedly aggressive and unethical practices.these practices included pressuring claimants to settle for a fraction of total benefits,insisting upon objective medical evidence of a disability even when the policy did not require such evidence,building a stable of biased independent medical examiners who would support claim denials,and holding regular round table meetings with lawyers,doctors,and claims handlers designed to the most expensive claims.merrick introduced a substantial number of internal unum provident memos showing the evolution of this scheme during the early,and prater testified regarding the tremendous financial gains unum provident posted by adopting these best practices.
unum provident announced a merger with paul revere,merrick insurer,in april.prater testified that in the months leading up to the merger,unum provident began importing its best practices procedures to the paul revere organization,including training its claims representatives in objectification and round tabling paul revere claims.prater testified that paul revere representatives received this training shortly before the company began merrick claim which it had initially paid out.prater testified that the company handling of merrick claim was consistent with many of unum provident improper practices,including attempting to settle for a fraction of the total amount and threatening to sue for reimbursement if merrick refused to settle,insisting upon objective medical evidence and seeking to get merrick claim off the books before the end of the fiscal year.merrick also argued that the explanations paul revere gave merrick for denying his claim were inconsistent with the company internal documentation,which largely supported the conclusion that merrick suffered significant impairment.
the jury returned a verdict for merrick,awarding him in unpaid benefits and for mental and emotional distress,to be paid by the insurers jointly and severally.it also imposed in punitive damages on paul revere and on unum provident.the insures brought a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure and a motion for a new trial under rule.the judge denied these motions and awarded merrick in attorney fees.the insurers timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
the insurers appeal several decisions made by the court below.we address each argument in turn.
motion for new trial 
in their opening brief,the insurers argue that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issues of bad faith and punitive damages.merrick responds,correctly,that the insurers did not include these claims in their rule motion below,meaning the issue is not properly before us now.desrosiers flight int l,cir.in their reply brief,the insurers concede the point and ask the court to construe their argument as an appeal of their rule request for a new trial,which did raise these arguments.
generally,issues raised for the first time in a reply brief are considered waived.eberle city of anaheim,cir.here,however,we exercise our discretion to consider the insurers claim because the appellee has not been misled and the issue has been fully explored.see ellingson burlington,cir.the insurers rule argument is identical to their rule argument,to which merrick has responded.we note,however,the differing standard of review.whereas a properly presented rule question is reviewed de novo,we give great deference to the trial court denial of a motion for a new trial,and will reverse for a clear abuse of discretion only where there is an absolute absence of evidence to support the jury verdict.desrosiers,at emphasis in original quoting pulla amoco oil,cir white.
given this deferential standard of review,we find the evidence more than sufficient to support the jury bad faith verdict.under nevada law,b ad faith is established where the insurer acts unreasonably and with knowledge that there is no reasonable basis for its conduct.albert wohlers bartgis,citation omitted.viewing the evidence in merrick favor,bains llc arco prods,cir,the jury could have found that the insurers conducted a biased investigation of merrick claim as part of an improper initiative to target and terminate expensive own occupation policies.it also could have found that the insurers misrepresented the terms of the policy by requiring merrick to present objective medical evidence of his disability.the nevada supreme court recognizes biased investigations and misrepresentation of policy terms as evidence of bad faith.see powers,albert wohlers bartgis.we have previously found that these defendants improper supports a finding of bad faith claim denial in a case decided under california law,which like nevada anchors bad faith liability in the reasonableness of the insurer action.see hangarter provident life and accident ins,cir.
similarly,there was substantial evidence before the jury that the insurers should be liable for punitive damages.under nevada law,a plaintiff may secure punitive damages upon showing by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is guilty of oppression,fraud,or malice,express or implied.here,the jury could have concluded that by subjecting merrick claim to improper procedures,the insurers undertook an intentional course of conduct designed to ensure the denial of the claim.see powers,at.both the nevada supreme court and the ninth circuit have held that such conduct could constitute fraud and malice.id.at see also hangarter,at california law 
because we can not say that there was a complete absence of evidence to support the jury verdicts,we affirm the district court denial of the insurers rule motion.
motion in limine 
the insurers also challenge the district court order suppressing certain evidence placed in the claim file after litigation commenced.the district court granted this motion upon finding that the insurers withheld evidence that they were ordered to produce regarding their treatment of merrick claim.the insurers argue that the court erred in finding that they had withheld any evidence.courts need not tolerate flagrant abuses of the discovery process and have inherent power to exclude evidence as a sanction for such abuses.campbell indus.gemini,cir.we review the imposition of discovery sanctions for abuse of discretion and the underlying factual determinations for clear error.valley eng rs eng g,cir.based upon the record,we can not conclude that the district court finding that the insurers withheld evidence is clearly erroneous.the insurers pretrial behavior gives rise to such an inference.the insurers invoked the privilege in response to a specific document production request,and continued to do so even after the magistrate judge instructed them not to invoke the privilege unless the privilege was actually shielding documents.their responses expressly objected on the basis of privilege and attested that subject to these objections,their production was complete only after the magistrate ordered the privileges waived in response to merrick assertion that defendants were withholding evidence,and merrick brought his motion in limine,did the insurers state unequivocally that no documents were withheld on the basis of privilege even then,counsel statement at the hearing could be understood as admitting the existence of withheld documents.
in addition,the existence of withheld documents may be inferred from the paucity of material actually produced.although the insurers received over pages of documents pertaining to merrick claim after litigation began,it produced only three short memos analyzing this material,none of which was generated by the attorneys who were actively managing the case file after merrick filed his complaint 
against these facts,the defendants offer only their sworn statement that documents were not withheld.while proving a negative is difficult,the defendants conduct and the dearth of documents actually
