in carson city appeal,we hold that deputy district attorneys are final policymakers in nevada for purposes of establishing municipal liability under.as a result of our holding,we affirm the jury verdict.

factual and procedural history 
on june,deputy darrin sloan chased a car into the parking lot of the carson city inn.at the time of the pursuit,radio traffic identified the owner of the car as freddy little.the driver,who was african american,got out of the car,and deputy sloan continued the chase on foot.after leaping over several fences in pursuit,deputy sloan lost track of the suspect.he then returned to the abandoned car and began an inventory.
during the next minutes or so,the police received several reports that an african american man was running through areas near the inn.sloan supervisor,sergeant moltz,saw an african american man suddenly jump from some bushes and run through the parking lot of the nevada appeal newspaper offices.shortly thereafter,another officer,deputy guimont,found plaintiff david webb,an african american man,lying on the ground behind a vehicle parked in an adjoining parking lot.deputy guimont detained plaintiff at gunpoint and waited for deputy sloan arrival.
deputy sloan arrived at the location where deputy guimont had detained plaintiff.he noticed that plaintiff clothing did not match that of the man whom he had been chasing,but that plaintiff did have a similar black bag.sloan asked plaintiff,why were you driving freddy little car plaintiff responded that he did not know who freddy little was.the deputies arrested plaintiff for various traffic offenses and for obstructing police officers.
on july,another police officer told sloan that freddy little had been bragging that he had outrun the cops on june.either the next day or the next business day,sloan informed district attorney melanie bruketta that he no longer believed that plaintiff was the person whom he had been chasing on june.in a supplemental report,sloan likewise wrote that he no longer believed that plaintiff was the person who was driving the car that he had been chasing.
despite sloan timely advisement,plaintiff was not released from jail until july.nor did the district attorney office drop any of the charges.on august,plaintiff met with a deputy district attorney,ray oster.oster told plaintiff that,if he pleaded guilty to the obstruction charge,oster would drop the traffic charges.plaintiff refused.a week later,the district attorney office dropped the traffic charges anyhow but proceeded with the obstruction charge.
chief deputy district attorney anne langer took over prosecution of the obstruction charge.on september,langer offered to drop the obstruction charge if plaintiff signed a waiver of civil liability.plaintiff again refused.in a later chance meeting,langer assured plaintiff that she would prosecute him to conviction on the obstruction charge.plaintiff later testified that langer had told his lawyer that she was prosecuting him because he refused to sign the waiver.
in october of,plaintiff went to trial on the obstruction charge.at the trial,deputy sloan testified that plaintiff had done nothing to delay him in performing his duties.deputy guimont similarly testified that plaintiff had not obstructed the police.plaintiff was acquitted.
procedural history 
shortly after his acquittal,plaintiff filed a complaint containing nine claims for relief under both federal and state law defendants moved for dismissal or,in the alternative,for summary judgment.the motion was denied for all claims but one.defendants appealed,seeking review on the issue of qualified immunity.plaintiff responded to the appeal and filed a motion to certify the appeal as frivolous.the district court denied certification,and this court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.plaintiff motion for interim fees was also denied.
plaintiff then moved for summary judgment,which was denied.the case proceeded to trial when settlement efforts failed.
the jury found in favor of deputy sloan on all counts,but in favor of plaintiff as against carson city.in special interrogatories,the jury found that defendant carson city had a custom,policy,or practice that violated plaintiff federal constitutional right not to be prosecuted without probable cause,and that carson city has a custom,policy,or practice to falsely imprison individuals.the jury found that deputy sloan did not falsely arrest plaintiff but that carson city falsely imprisoned,maliciously prosecuted,and committed abuse of process against plaintiff under state law.the jury awarded plaintiff without apportionment among the separate claims.
plaintiff counsel,the law firm of cooke story,moved for an award of attorney fees in the amount of.the district court awarded fees but determined that the total amount should be for work performed by cooke story and for work performed by plaintiff previous lawyer,terri.
carson city timely appeals the decision that municipal liability may attach for the actions of deputy district attorneys.carson city also argues that it enjoys sovereign immunity for the discretionary decisions of district attorneys under nevada revised statute nrs.
cooke story timely appeals the district court decision to award a lower fee than it requested.keyser cooper does not appeal her portion of the fee award,however.
discussion 
municipal liability under is proper in this case because the deputy district attorneys were acting as final policymakers for carson city in deciding whether to prosecute plaintiff 
there are two ways to establish municipal liability under,in addition to express adoption of an unconstitutional policy.
section provides that e very person who,under color of law,subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law or other proper proceeding for redress.congress intended the term person to include municipalities,such as carson city.christie iopa,cir.
nevertheless,municipal liability under can not be founded on a theory of respondeat superior.gibson county of washoe,cir,cert.denied,d.congress intended to hold municipalities liable only when action pursuant to official municipal policy of some nature caused a constitutional tort.christie,at quoting monell dep t of soc,d.generally,then,the actions of individual employees can support liability against a municipality under only if those employees were acting pursuant to an official municipal policy.see pembaur city of cincinnati,d stating that t he official policy requirement was intended to distinguish acts of the municipality from acts of employees of the municipality.
as we explained in christie,a municipality still may be liable even if it does not expressly adopt the alleged policy.at.there are two alternative ways such liability can attach.first,if an employee commits a constitutional violation pursuant to a longstanding practice or custom,the employee act is sufficient to support municipal liability.id.by contrast,a single constitutional deprivation ordinarily is insufficient to establish a longstanding practice or custom.id.a municipality can be liable even for an isolated constitutional violation,however,when the person causing the violation has final policymaking authority.id.
as to the first alternative,plaintiff must prove the existence of a longstanding practice or policy to the satisfaction of the factfinder.trevino gates,cir normally,the question of whether a policy or custom exists would be a jury question.on the other hand,when the issue concerns a single constitutional deprivation under the second alternative,the court must decide,as a matter of state law and before the case may be submitted to the jury,whether the person who committed the violation had final policymaking authority.christie,at.
plaintiff argues that he proved both that carson city had a longstanding practice or custom of incarcerating and prosecuting people it knows to be innocent and that municipal liability is proper in this case because the deputy district attorneys were acting with final policymaking authority.because we agree with the second argument,a question that we previously left open,herb hallman chevrolet,cir,we need not reach the first.
deputy district attorneys in nevada have final policymaking authority for the municipality.
in nevada,the legislature confers final policymaking authority on principal prosecutors and confers that same authority directly on deputies.nrs provides all district attorneys are authorized to appoint deputies,who may transact all official business relating to the offices to the same extent as their principals.
by its plain text,that statute confers authority on deputy district attorneys that is coextensive with the authority enjoyed by principal district attorneys.thus,if principal district attorneys are final policymakers,then so are their deputies.
whether the principal prosecutor has final policymaking authority is easily resolved.the nevada constitution does not create the office of the district attorney.lane second judicial dist.court.rather,the state constitution confers the power to do so on the legislature.const.pursuant to that power,the legislature statutorily created the office and prescribed its duties.lane,at.the nevada supreme court has noted that t he matter of the prosecution of any criminal case is within the entire control of the district attorney.cairns sheriff,clark county,per curiam emphasis added.thus,in nevada,principal district attorneys are final policymakers for the local government in a particular area,or on a particular issue.mcmillian monroe county,d.specifically,nevada district attorneys are final policymakers in the particular area or particular issue relevant here the decision to continue to imprison and to prosecute.
the state attorney general exercises supervisory power over county district attorneys,but this does not remove final policymaking authority even from principal district attorneys.as pertinent here,nrs provides that the attorney general may 
exercise supervisory powers over all district attorneys of the state in all matters pertaining to the duties of their offices,and from time to time require of them reports as to the condition of public business entrusted to their charge.
both this court and the nevada supreme court,however,have emphasized the discretionary and permissive nature of that authority.the power to supervise a district attorney which is granted to the attorney general by nrs,means supervision and can not sensibly be read as a grant of power to usurp the function of the district attorney.ryan eighth judicial dist.court.the tenor of these statutory provisions is that with respect to the general run of prosecutions in the various counties of nevada the attorney general of nevada has no duties and responsibilities.his authority concerning supervision of district attorneys is permissive and discretionary.houston bryan,cir quoting with approval the district court decision below.in the light of these authorities,and in the absence of any evidence in the record that the attorney general in fact ever exercises that supervisory power,we hold that principal district attorneys are final policymakers for the municipality with respect to the conduct of criminal prosecutions.
as previously stated,the nevada legislature confers the same final policymaking authority on deputy district attorneys.the principal does not delegate constrained discretion to a deputy upon appointment.rather,the legislature states that,upon appointment,deputies may transact all official duties to the same extent as their principals.
we are mindful that the nevada statutory text is permissive,not mandatory deputies may transact official business to the same extent as their principals.conceivably,the principal prosecutor could constrain that authority.that possibility does not change our analysis,because carson city presented no evidence that its principal district attorney actually has constrained the deputies authority.in fact,carson city presented evidence to the contrary.
in christie,we held that deputy prosecutors in hawaii did not have final policymaking authority,a holding on which carson city relies.at.that case is distinguishable in fundamental ways,however.
there,it was clear that the chief prosecutor had final policymaking authority.id.at.the hawaii charter gave principal prosecutors the authority to appoint deputies,but did not describe the authority that those deputies would enjoy to make decisions or to choose among alternatives.id.at.accordingly,christie framed the question as whether the chief prosecutor had delegated that authority to deputy prosecutors.id.at.that was a hard question,because to avoid imposing respondeat superior liability we had to ascertain the precise degree to which a principal delegates authority.id.here,however,the legislature directly delegates coextensive authority to the principal prosecutor and the deputies.
in christie,we found it significant that i f the deputy prosecutor disagreed with the principal prosecutor decision to prosecute plaintiffs,she had to contact the principal prosecutor she could not decide unilaterally to drop the case.id.at.by contrast,carson city presented affirmative evidence that any deputy in the office could have made the decision to dismiss the charges against plaintiff without consulting with any supervisor.
because of the distinctions between nevada deputy district attorneys and the hawaiian deputy prosecutors in christie,christie does not control the outcome of this case.the district court correctly held that deputy district attorneys in nevada are final policymakers whose actions can be the acts of the municipality for the purposes of attaching liability under 
b.we need not reach carson city immunity claim because the verdict can rest on a valid federal ground.
citing nrs,carson city argues that deputy district attorneys enjoy immunity for their discretionary acts.we need not reach this issue.if the immunity defense is viable,then the state claims were submitted to the jury in error.the federal claims,however,remained valid.
sometimes,a jury verdict may stand on a legally viable theory even if a legally defective theory also was presented.as explained in portland feminist women health center advocates for life,cir 
our analysis of the viability of the plaintiff theories leaves us with a situation in which one of the theories submitted to the jury was legally defective.as a general rule,a general jury verdict will be upheld only if there is substantial evidence to support each and every theory of liability submitted to the jury.kern levolor lorentzen,cir quoting syufy enters.american multicinema,cir,cert.denied,d,and cert.denied,d.an exception to this rule exists,however,when we are able to construe a general verdict as attributable to a theory submitted to the jury that was viable in deciding whether to exercise this discretion,the factors we consider are the potential for confusion of the jury whether the losing party defenses apply to the count upon which the verdict is being sustained the strength of the evidence supporting the count relied upon to sustain the verdict and the extent to which the same disputed issues of fact apply to the various legal theories.id.citing traver meshriy,cir.

a consideration of the relevant factors in this case weighs in favor of affirming the full jury award on federal grounds 
first,the verdict eliminates any concern about jury confusion.instead of the general verdict entered in portland feminist,the jury answered special interrogatories explaining on which theories it found in plaintiff favor and on which it did not
