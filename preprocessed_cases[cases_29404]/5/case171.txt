appellee gaia house mezz llc gaia and state street were bound by a mezzanine agreement for the construction of a residential building in manhattan.after a difference over monies owed,gaia initiated this action,alleging principles of equity prevented state street from demanding payment of approximately million in interest and approximately in attorney fees.following a bench trial,the united states district court for the southern district of new york griesa,judge entered judgment in favor of gaia on the interest and attorney fee issues and required state street to pay an additional in damages.we reverse and find that state street is entitled to the million in interest and attorney fees and is not liable for damages.
background 
in december,gaia entered into a mezzanine loan agreement the agreement with lehman brothers to help finance the construction of a residential building.the agreement was secondary to gaia loan with istar fm loans llc istar of approximately million.after lehman brothers bankruptcy in september,state street assumed gaia loan.gaia failed to pay off any of its debt to state street by the initial maturity date of july,and committed several other defaults at the time of the initial maturity date,gaia owed state street approximately million in principal and million in interest.
in september,state street and gaia modified the agreement with the second loan modification agreement second modification,which expressly waived gaia prior defaults,including its failure to achieve substantial completion by the date specified in the agreement.the second modification established a new maturity date of january,with the option to extend the maturity date four times up to july.the second modification included as events of default the failure to obtain a temporary certificate of occupancy tco for penthouse by april,or the failure to attain substantial completion by june.
in addition to new deadlines,the second modification created several new provisions relevant here,including the accrued interest waiver,the affiliate purchase right,and the lockbox agreement.the accrued interest waiver provides 
on the maturity date,the entire debt,if not sooner paid,shall become due and payable in full.notwithstanding the foregoing,if the entire debt,other than the accrued interest,is paid in full on the scheduled maturity date and no event of default occurs prior to such scheduled maturity date,lender shall waive the payment of accrued interest from borrower 
second modification.this had the effect of freezing interest at million and providing an loan on the million in principal,provided there were no future events of default.gaia monthly statements reflected the calculation of the monthly interest and tracked the total amount of interest accrued since the initial maturity date the accrued interest.
the affiliate purchase right provision states that borrower or an affiliate of borrower shall be allowed to purchase any of residential units,or in order to satisfy the loan and senior loan reduction covenants described above at the applicable minimum unit sales price.second modification.this provision enabled gaia,or its affiliates,to purchase the specified units in order to avoid a default and a quick foreclosure.the second modification also incorporated the amended and restated mezzanine lockbox agreement lockbox agreement,which provided a mechanism for the distribution of proceeds from the sale of units.proceeds would be distributed in a specified priority such that state street loan would be paid in full,then gaia could recoup its equity investments,and any remaining proceeds would be split between gaia and state street until all units were sold.
after the second modification,gaia committed several events of default,including the failure to obtain a tco for by april.in may,the parties agreed to the third loan modification agreement third modification.the third modification expressly waived the previous event of defaults,including the failure to obtain tcos.the third modification also extended the deadline to obtain a tco for and attain substantial completion to july,and extended the maturity date to january,pursuant to the third extension option.the third modification repeated relevant provisions of the second modification,including the accrued interest waiver and the affiliate purchase right.
gaia failed to obtain a tco for and failed to achieve substantial completion by the specified deadline of july.despite these events of default,the parties took action otherwise required by the agreement,gaia closed on several apartments during the summer of,and gaia made its final payment to istar in august.
on december,state street provided written notice that gaia failure to achieve substantial completion and obtain a tco for by july,constituted events of default.on december,gaia obtained the tco for.on january,state street notified gaia in writing that,because of the events of default,state street was not required to waive the accrued interest.the letter also noted state street would agree to the fourth extension option to the maturity date,despite the events of default,provided certain other conditions,not relevant here,were satisfied.state street reserved all rights and remedies with respect to the events of default and stated 
nothing contained in this letter,including without limitation,state street willingness to agree to the exercise of the fourth extension opinion as noted above despite the specified defaults,or any delay on the part of state street in exercising any of its rights and remedies under the loan agreement shall be considered to be a waiver or modification thereof or of state street entitlement to the payment of accrued interest.
state street,letter to gaia.
in february,gaia obtained a loan from doral bank in order to purchase the remaining three unsold units and replace state street as the lender.on march,gaia notified state street of its intention to exercise the affiliate purchase right and purchase the remaining three units for the minimum contract price.on march,state street responded that it did not object to gaia use of the affiliate purchase right.state street again observed that two events of default had occurred and declared that it was not required to waive,and will not waive,the payment of accrued interest.state street,letter to gaia.gaia affiliates purchased the remaining three units for the minimum contract price.the resulting proceeds did not cover all of gaia equity,and thus,state street did not receive profits under the profit sharing provision of the lockbox agreement.
in july,gaia paid off the remaining million in principal.under protest,gaia also paid approximately million in accrued interest and in professional fees.because gaia had not planned to pay the accrued interest,it was forced to obtain in additional financing from doral bank the doral damages in order to make the final payment.
gaia then initiated this litigation,alleging it was entitled to a return of the accrued interest and professional fees and that state street was liable for the doral damages.state street counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that it was entitled to the accrued interest and that it was not liable for the doral damages.state street also requested attorney fees incurred in this litigation pursuant to the agreement professional fee provision.following a bench trial,the district court found equity required state street to return the accrued interest and professional fees paid by gaia and that state street was liable for the doral damages.state street now appeals.

discussion 
accrued interest 
it is undisputed that state street did not violate any terms of the agreement by demanding payment of the accrued interest and that gaia failed to obtain the tco for or attain substantial completion by the dates specified in the agreement.the only issues on appeal are whether equitable estoppel,principles of good faith and fair dealing,or general principles of equity prevent state street from keeping the accrued interest.
equitable estoppel 
under new york law,a claim for equitable estoppel rests upon the word or deed of one party upon which another rightfully relies and so relying changes his position to his injury.nassau trust montrose concrete prods,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the party alleging equitable estoppel must demonstrate 
an act constituting a concealment of facts or misrepresentation an intention or expectation that such acts will be relied upon actual or constructive knowledge of the true facts by the wrongdoers reliance upon the misrepresentation which causes the innocent party to change its position to its substantial detriment.
capital armadora,cir.
the district court found that state street committed an act of concealment by not providing immediate notice that two events of default had occurred and instead waiting nine months before informing gaia that payment of the accrued interest was required.it found that state street silence was intended to perpetuate the idea that gaia was entitled to a waiver of the accrued interest and to induce gaia into continuing with the project.
the district court finding fails as a matter of law,because a party silence does not give rise to a claim of equitable estoppel when the party has no duty to speak.compare babitt vebeliunas in re vebeliunas,cir finding defendant silence could not give rise to equitable estoppel because defendant had no duty to speak,with kosakow new rochelle radiology,cir finding silence constituted an act of concealment when employer had legal obligation to provide notice.here,gaia agreed,per the terms of the agreement,that once a described default occurred,then an event of default shall automatically exist that state street had no obligation to accept any cures and that,in response to such events of default,state street could take such action,without notice or demand,as lender deems advisable,compilation of key contract terms.thus,state street did not have a duty to provide gaia notice of the events of default or of its intention to collect interest,and its silence can not give rise to a claim of equitable estoppel.
the district court disregarded the above provisions of the agreement because it found that state street routinely disregarded the agreement when it suited state street interests.specifically,the district court noted that state street granted the fourth extension option,even though under the agreement the extension was not available in the event of a default,and state street consistently ignored the definition of substantial completion.
in addressing this reasoning,we first acknowledge that any written agreement,even one which provides that it can not be modified except by a writing signed by the parties,can be effectively modified by a course of actual performance.harold rosen trust rosen,aff.accordingly,whether state street course of performance was inconsistent with the terms of the agreement requires us to first consider these terms.under the agreement,state street was permitted to at any time and from time to time waive any one or more of the conditions,requirements or obligations contained herein.compilation of key contract terms.gaia agreed that any such waiver shall be deemed to be made in pursuance hereof and not in modification thereof,and any such waiver shall not be considered a waiver of such condition in any other instance or any other circumstance.id.additionally,the agreement provided that in order to be effective,a waiver must be made expressly and in writing,and the failure of lender to insist upon strict performance of any term hereof,shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such term.id.
turning to state street course of performance,the record demonstrates that when state street waived provisions of the agreement,including the requirement to obtain substantial completion,it did so expressly and in writing,while reserving all other rights.when state street waived the events of default for purposes of the fourth extension option,it did so expressly and in writing,as required by the agreement.state street also expressly stated in writing that the waiver of the events of default for purposes of the fourth extension option had no effect on state street ability to require payment of the accrued interest,consistent with the agreement provision that a waiver in one instance should not be considered a waiver in any other circumstances.additionally,even if state street did not insist on gaia strict performance of its obligation to obtain substantial completion prior to its final payment to istar,gaia agreed that state street failure to insist on strict performance of a particular term shall not be deemed to be a waiver of such term.id.thus,state street course of performance,including its disregard of particular contractual obligations on gaia part from time to time,was consistent with the agreement,and the agreement remains enforceable.see john doris,solomon guggenheim,reaffirming the obligation of the courts to enforce the terms as agreed to by the parties.
returning to whether there was a misrepresentation or omission,gaia argues that emails and the monthly account statements from trimont real estate advisors,trimont,the company contracted to service state street accounts,indicated that state street would not collect the accrued interest.the trimont statements tracked the total amount of accrued interest in an uncapitalized deferred interest balance line item but did not specifically state that the interest was due or add the interest to the loan total balance after receiving the august trimont statement,which included an uncapitalized deferred interest balance of over million,gaia sent an email asking trimont to confirm that the accrued interest would be due only if there were an event of default.trimont confirmed that was correct,but did not state whether an event of default had occurred 
even if the monthly statements or emails are misleading in that they do not state that an event of default had occurred or that the accrued interest would come due,gaia reliance on them is unreasonable.gaia does not dispute that it failed to obtain a tco for by july,or that the agreement defines such a failure as an event of default.as a sophisticated real estate developer who negotiated the agreement with counsel,gaia had to look no further than to the plain language of the agreement to know that an event of default had occurred and that the accrued interest would come due on the date of maturity,without further action by state street.gaia can not allege that the representations from trimont demonstrated that an event of default did not occur or that state street had no intention to collect the accrued interest in light of the contractual terms stating otherwise.see grumman allied,rohr,cir finding no justifiable reliance when party has access to all of the material facts and the expertise necessary to understand the facts state mortg.loan enforcement admin.coney island site five houses,finding a party can not claim justifiable reliance in the face of a conflict between the alleged misrepresentations and the written terms of the agreements.
even if gaia had been able to demonstrate reasonable reliance on a misrepresentation or omission by state street,its claim still fails because it did not demonstrate that the alleged misrepresentations caused it to change its position to its substantial detriment.the district court found that state street silence induced gaia to expend significant effort in completing construction and selling units during difficult economic conditions.gaia argues it detrimentally changed its positions as a result of state street concealment by a executing the second and third modifications and b expending significant time and money to finish the project.
the district court conclusion that gaia suffered detrimental reliance by continuing with the project fails as a ma
