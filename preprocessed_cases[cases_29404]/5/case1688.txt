introduction 
joseph sorge appeals after the trial court modified the child support awarded to his,maryanne sorge,and awarded sanctions and attorney fees,both related to the costs of the underlying litigation,as well as pendente lite attorney fees for defending against joseph appeal.
on appeal,joseph first contends that the trial court erred in calculating the child support amount.according to joseph,the trial court ignored his bona fide business expenses in calculating his monthly income,in contravention of family code section,subdivision a.
joseph also contends that the trial court erred in concluding that for purposes of section,subdivision c,the parties duty to disclose to each other,sua sponte,all material changes in their financial status continues from the date of separation until the trial court no longer has jurisdiction to order child support.joseph argues that the court erred in determining that the cessation of a child support obligation is the event that constitutes a valid,enforceable,and binding resolution of all issues relating to child support under section,subdivision c.according to joseph,because the trial court award of sanctions to maryanne was based in part on the court erroneous interpretation of section,subdivision c,the sanctions order must be reversed.
finally,joseph contends that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding maryanne attorney fees in the amount of for proceedings in the trial court,and in pendente lite attorney fees for proceedings on because maryanne has no need for these fees,since she has a net worth of over million,more than half of which is in liquid assets.
we conclude that the trial court erred in sanctioning joseph on the ground that he breached his fiduciary duty under section,subdivision c to disclose to maryanne all material changes in his income.specifically,we conclude that any fiduciary duty that joseph had to disclose material changes in his income to maryanne ended upon entry of their divorce decree.we reject all of joseph other contentions.
the trial court sanction order must be reversed and the matter remanded for the trial court to reconsider that issue.in all other respects,we affirm the trial court orders.
factual and procedural backgrounda.factual background 
maryanne and joseph were married in,and separated in september.the parties had three children.maryanne filed a petition for divorce in wyoming in november.
pursuant to a marital settlement agreement msa that the parties entered into in wyoming,the parties agreed to share joint custody of the children,who were minors at the time the divorce petition was filed.maryanne and joseph also agreed that joseph would pay maryanne child support in the amount of per month for all three children and not less than per month for one child an amount that was based on joseph gross income of more than per year related to his position at stratagene holding corporation,stratagene,a company that joseph founded.the child support was to commence in july or the first day of the month in which maryanne and the children moved to san diego,california.joseph also agreed to pay maryanne per month in nonmodifiable spousal support for months.
the msa was made a judgment of the wyoming court on march.the parties subsequently registered the msa with the san diego county superior court,and it was established as a judgment on november,
procedural background 
maryanne motion to modify custody of the remaining minor child,modify child support,award attorney fees,and establish spousal support arrears 
on august,maryanne filed an order to show cause osc seeking to modify the child custody and visitation arrangement for the parties minor son,who was years old at the time.maryanne also requested modification of child support,as well as attorney fees,and spousal support arrears.
the parties retained tony yip as a joint expert to perform an analysis of the parties income and assets.
maryanne filed a schedule of assets and debts in july,which showed that she had no debt,and that she had in assets.in an income and expense declaration dated august,maryanne indicated that she had million in assets and in monthly expenses.
joseph income and expense declaration demonstrated that he had sold stratagene and no longer held his position at the company.his average monthly income included in salary,in dividends and interest,and in investment and ordinary losses.joseph listed his monthly expenses as.
yip prepared an initial report in which he presented joseph income in two different ways,the first of which included joseph net losses from a number of companies that he founded after selling his interest in stratagene,and the second of which excluded those losses.joseph objected to the second approach,and suggested to yip that taking an approach that excluded his net losses would constitute professional malpractice.joseph threatened yip firm with a lawsuit for damages that joseph might suffer as a result of yip report.
yip firm appeared ex parte before the trial court,seeking guidance as to how to present joseph income in the report.the trial court ordered that yip could present his report as yip deemed necessary,and specifically,that yip could include alternative approaches to determining joseph income.
in the final report,yip noted that joseph had received in excess of million,before taxes,from the sale of his interest in stratagene when he sold the company in.joseph used those funds for a number of purposes,including making capital contributions to several new companies,purchasing real property,paying down mortgages,and paying income taxes.joseph placed the remainder of the proceeds from the sale of stratagene in various investment accounts.his portfolio balance as of december,was million.
with respect to the companies that joseph started in,yip noted that the companies experienced significant operating losses in and.in yip final report,yip presented joseph income using the same two methods that he had used in his initial report.applying the first method to calculate joseph income,yip included both income and losses from joseph companies between june and december.using this method,joseph had a net monthly loss of in,and a net monthly loss of in.applying the second method,yip excluded the losses from joseph companies.under this method,joseph had a net monthly income of in,and in.
yip did not analyze the detailed expenses of the companies for possible personal nonrecurring expenses.yip explained that the reason he did not analyze the expenses was because he determined that if the trial court decided to include the million in net losses over the relevant period for purposes of calculating support,then joseph would have a net loss of million in as the basis for support,and the a dd backs of personal nonrecurring expenses,if they existed,would not result in a net positive number.
in addition to the income losses from joseph companies,joseph had interest and dividend income of million from june to december,and million from january to december.
maryanne motion to compel and request for sanctions 
in october,maryanne filed a motion to compel the production of documents and other information,and a request for sanctions against joseph in the amount of.the request for sanctions was based,for the most part,on joseph refus al to produce information and documents,and for providing false,evasive and misleading discovery responses to the parties joint expert and respondent counsel.among the things that maryanne complained of in her request for sanctions was that joseph failed to disclose that he received more than million in income during,failed to disclose that he received more than million in cash between january and june from the sale of stratagene stock,and failed to disclose that he received more than million in cash from the sale of his interest in stratagene.
yip testimony 
at the hearing,yip testified about his final report,and explained the two different methods that he used to calculate joseph income for purposes of the report.yip agreed that the expenses that appeared in joseph accountings for his businesses were current operating expenses,and said that he had no reason to believe that the expenses were not legitimate business expenses.yip also testified that he assumed that joseph was operating all of the businesses with the intent of making them profitable,and that he understood the expenses to be expenses not because they fit a particular internal revenue code definition of a expense,but because he viewed the companies as being at an early stage in their development.yip further explained that he did not assume that joseph was engaging in any of the businesses as a hobby or tax shelter.
yip did not examine any of the particular expenses reported by the companies.instead,he considered and included all of the expenses under the first method for calculating joseph income,and excluded all of the expenses under the second.using the first method,joseph income was negative.
the court january,order 
in addressing the parties contentions with respect to maryanne various requests,the trial court issued a lengthy statement of decision and order that covered a number of topics.of relevance to this appeal are the court comments with respect to modification of child support,sanctions against joseph,and attorney fees and costs awarded to maryanne.the trial court declined to consider the operating expenses of the companies in determining joseph income,for purposes of calculating child support,and increased child support from per month to approximately per month.in addition,the trial court determined that joseph had engaged in conduct that frustrated settlement and furthered the litigation,and that he had also breached his fiduciary duties to maryanne by failing to disclose material changes to his income,beginning in and continuing throughout the litigation.finally,with respect to attorney fees and costs,after noting that joseph retains of the parties combined incomes and approximately of the combined liquid assets,the trial court ordered joseph to pay in attorney fees and costs to maryanne.
maryanne request for pendente lite attorney fees and costs to defend against joseph appeal from the trial court january,order 
on august,maryanne filed a request for an additional in pendente lite attorney fees and in costs to defend against joseph appeal.according to maryanne,because joseph appealed the order of the trial court,he had not paid her any of the in child support,in child support arrears,in attorney fees,or in sanctions that the trial court had ordered,but instead,posted a cash undertaking to stay the order for those amounts.
maryanne attached an income and expense declaration in which she stated that her only income derived from dividends and interest on her investments.for the month prior to her request for pendente lite attorney fees,that income had been in excess of.maryanne estimated her assets to be approximately million,of which million were liquid assets.maryanne indicated that she was remarried,but declined to state her husband income.maryanne expenses were listed as per month.
maryanne trial attorney filed a declaration stating that it had cost to prepare the motion for pendente lite attorney fees,and that his firm would be required to spend approximately hours assisting appellate counsel in drafting maryanne respondent brief on appeal.maryanne appellate counsel declared that he was a certified appellate specialist and certified family law specialist,and estimated that it would take him approximately hours to defend joseph appeal.he requested a pendente lite award of,and asked the court to retain jurisdiction over the issue of appellate attorney fees and costs,given the potential for further complications.
joseph income and expense declaration listed cash and checking accounts valued at,and stated that the value of his stocks,bonds and other assets that he could easily sell was.joseph stated that the value of his less liquid assets was,for a total asset value of more than million.joseph estimated expenses were listed as per month,including business expenses of per month.
on november,the trial granted maryanne request for pendente lite attorney fees and costs on appeal,and ordered joseph to pay maryanne as a contribution to her appellate attorney fees and costs,pursuant to sections and.joseph filed a timely notice of appeal with respect to the court order requiring him to pay maryanne in pendente lite attorney fees and costs.
discussiona.the trial court did not err in determining joseph income for purposes of setting child support 
joseph contends that the trial court never calculated guideline support pursuant to the family code underscoring omitted because,according to joseph,the court excluded bona fide business expenses and,therefore,the court calculated child support based on only the positive numbers.joseph asserts that the expenses shown on his profit and loss statements were required for the operation of his good faith businesses,and that the court had no legal basis for excluding those business expenses from its calculation when it determined his income.what joseph fails to acknowledge is that the court had discretion under subdivision b of section to consider joseph earning capacity,rather than his actual income,for purposes of calculating guideline child support.it appears from the court discussion of the child support issue that this is precisely what the court did when it elected not to consider the expenses from joseph start up businesses in calculating child support.
additional background regarding the trial court order with respect to whether to consider or exclude joseph business expenses in determining child support 
the court noted that the existing child support order was based on joseph having an annual gross income of.the court found that joseph sale of stratagene constituted a substantial change in his financial circumstances because that sale netted him approximately million.in,after the sale of stratagene,joseph property investment portfolio,alone,generated unearned income of more than million.
the court then considered the losses that joseph suffered as a result of the businesses that he formed after he sold stratagene.the court quoted section,subdivision a,and also cited and explained the case of in re marriage of berger th berger.the court noted that yip had calculated joseph income in two different ways including the losses from the businesses,and excluding those losses.
the court observed that the difference in joseph monthly income when calculated using these two methods was dramatic.excluding the losses from the companies,joseph monthly income in was if those losses were included,joseph monthly income that year would be negative.the court concluded that although joseph was not deferring the receipt of a salary,like the husband in berger,joseph was ask ing this court to shield a portion of his income from support.
the court noted that joseph maintained an affluent,even wealthy lifestyle despite those business losses,and went on to describe the multiple homes that joseph owns,a multimillion dollar house that joseph purchased in las vegas in,and a million ranch that joseph purchased in san marcos in.the court further noted that joseph continued to use private jets for international travel.the court observed,joseph losses have not hampered his lifestyle.
with respect to joseph income,the court ultimately concluded 
joseph may not voluntarily prefer his businesses to his child right to receive current support in accordance with joseph abilities.joseph may not invest in businesses and thereby minimize his support obligation while he maintains a wealthy lifestyle.joseph may not divest himself,in whole or in part,of his earning ability at the expense of his minor child.joseph may not take a break from his child support obligation in favor of his business investments.marriage of berger,supra,at and.in short,as the court in berger determined,joseph can not unilaterally,and voluntarily,arrange his business affairs in such a way as to effectively preclude his children from sharing in the benefits of his current standard of living.marriage of berger,supra,at.
this court is mindful of the mandate of section,subdivision a to deduct business expenses in the calculation of gross income.joseph strongly makes this argument.however,that statute,which far predates berger,does not compel the court to deduct losses from business investments to enable a parent to prefer his business investments to his support responsibility for a season while that parent maintains a wealthy lifestyle.to do so would enable joseph or any parent to voluntarily divert income otherwise available for support to various businesses,live extravagantly off sizeable assets,and plead poverty at the support hearing.see marriage of berger,supra,at.to apply that statute in this manner would create the impermissible irony berger described of enabling joseph,who does not need a job to support himself in the short term as a less wealthy man would to spin that into the justification for granting him a break from the obligation to support his family.marriage of berger,supra,at.
therefore,the court declines joseph request to deduct from his income any of the business losses.
standards of review 
the standard of review for an order modifying a child support order is well established.a determination regarding a request for modification of a child support order will be affirmed unless the trial court abused its discretion,and it will be reversed only if prejudicial error is found from examining the record below.citations.thus,t he ultimate determination of whether the individual facts of the case warrant modification of support is within the discretion of the trial court.citation.the reviewing court will resolve any conflicts in the evidence in favor of the trial court determination.citation.citation.in re marriage of williams th,williams.
however,the trial court has a duty to exercise an informed and considered discretion with respect to the parent child support obligation citation.furthermore,in reviewing child support orders we must also recognize that determination of a child support obligation is a highly regulated area of the law,and the only discretion a trial court possesses is the discretion provided by statute or rule.citations.citation.in short,the trial court discretion is not so broad that it may ignore or contravene the purposes of the law regarding child support.citations.citation.in re marriage of cheriton th,cheriton.
the child support guidelines,generally 
california has a strong public policy in favor of adequate child support.citations.that policy is expressed in statutes embodying the statewide uniform child support guideline.see.the guideline seeks to place the interests of children as the state top priority,subd.e.in setting guideline support,the courts are required to adhere to certain principles,including these a parent first and principal obligation is to support his or her minor children according to the parent circumstances and station in life,subd.a.each parent should pay for the support of the children according to his or her ability,subd.d.children should share in the standard of living of both parents.child support may therefore appropriately improve the standard of living of the custodial household to improve the lives of the children,subd.f.cheriton,supra,th at,fn.omitted.
to implement these policies,courts are required to calculate child support under the statutory guidelines.see.a dherence to the guidelines is mandatory,and the trial court may not depart from them except in the special circumstances enumerated in the statutes,subd.k citation.citation.the guideline amount of child support,which is calculated by applying a mathematical formula to the parents incomes,is presumptively correct.citation.williams,supra,th at.for example,section provides in pertinent part a the amount of child support established by the formula provided in subdivision a of section is presumed to be the correct amount of child support to be ordered.b the presumption of subdivision a is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted by admissible evidence showing that application of the formula would be unjust or inappropriate in the particular case,consistent with the principles set forth in section,because one or more of the following factors is found to be applicable by a preponderance of the evidence,and the court states in writing or on the record the information required in subdivision a of section italics added.
a deviation from the guideline amount may be appropriate where a pplication of the formula would be unjust or inappropriate due to special circumstances in the particular case,subd.b.the statute provides a nonexhaustive list of some examples of special circumstances that might call for deviation from the guideline calculation,including,for example,cases in which parents have different arrangements for different children,or where the parents have substantially equal,but one parent has a much lower or higher percentage of income used for housing than the other parent.ibid.
calculating annual gross income for purposes of determining guideline support 
section sets forth the manner by which a trial court is to ascertain a parent income for purposes of determining the guideline child support amount.this section provides 
a the annual gross income of each parent means income from whatever source derived,except as specified in subdivision c and includes,but is not limited to,the following 
income such as commissions,salaries,royalties,wages,bonuses,rents,dividends,pensions,interest,trust income,annuities,workers compensation benefits,unemployment insurance benefits,disability insurance benefits,social security benefits,and spousal support actually received from a person not a party to the proceeding to establish a child support order under this article.
income from the proprietorship of a business,such as gross receipts from the business reduced by expenditures required for the operation of the business.
in the discretion of the court,employee benefits or benefits,taking into consideration the benefit to the employee,any corresponding reduction in living expenses,and other relevant facts.
b the court may,in its discretion,consider the earning capacity of a parent in lieu of the parent income,consistent with the best interests of the children.
c annual gross income does not include any income derived from child support payments actually received,and income derived from any public assistance program,eligibility for which is based on a determination of need.child support received by a party for children from another relationship shall not be included as part of that party gross or net income.
i ncome is broadly defined for purposes of child support.citations.subject to certain statutory exceptions annual gross income means income from whatever source derived citation.although section specifically lists more than a dozen possible income sources,by the statute express terms,that list is not exhaustive.citations.rather,the codified income items are by way of illustration only.income from other sources should properly be factored into the annual gross income computation.citations.citation.the judicially recognized sources of income cover a wide gamut.citation.th.
in determining a parent income for purposes of calculating guideline child support,a trial court may choose to follow the guidance of subdivision a of section,by utilizing the factors identified in subdivision a through a to determine a parent actual income,or the court may,in its discretion,impute to that parent an income different from his or her actual income,an income amount that corresponds with that parent earning capacity.thus,a trial court may ultimately calculate the guideline child support amount by using,as the income factor in its support calculation,either the parent actual income,as calculated under section,subdivision a,or the parent imputed income,as authorized by section,subdivision b,if the court determines that imputing income to the parent would be more appropriate and would better serve the child best interests 
use of a parent assets in calculating child support 
regarding a parent assets,the supreme court has stated,assets at the time of dissolution play little part in the computation of child support.they may enter indirectly into the calculation in two ways in assessing earning capacity,a trial court may take into account the earnings from invested assets see,cheriton,supra,th at and a court may deem assets a special circumstance,subd.b that may justify a departure from the guideline figure for support payments citation.but these are exceptional situations the child support obligation is based primarily on actual earnings and earning capacity.mejia reed cal th.
with respect to assessing earning capacity,the court in cheriton determined that the trial court had erred in failing to include the father gross proceeds of million from his exercise of stock options and sale of stock in determining the father income.cheriton,supra,th at.by refusing to consider the father substantial wealth in setting child support,the trial court had effectively permitted him to avoid his obligation to support his children according to his ability,his circumstances and station in life,and his standard of living,subds.d,a,f.cheriton,supra,at,fn.omitted.the cheriton court concluded that the trial court refusal to consider the father substantial wealth in setting child support may have resulted in an order that is too low to be in the best interests of his children,based on an assessment of their reasonable needs,and remanded the matter for the purpose of allowing the trial court to a t the very least,consider imputing reasonable income on the father assets,pursuant to section,subdivision b,to the extent necessary to meet the children reasonable needs.cheriton,supra,at,citations omitted.
thus,where the supporting party has chosen to invest his or her funds in assets,the trial court has discretion to impute income to those assets based on an assumed reasonable rate of return.citations.in re marriage of pearlstein th,fn.omitted see also in re marriage of schlafly th,court did not abuse discretion in imputing three percent rate of return on stock market portfolio county of kern castle th,based on statute and case law,a trial court may impute income based on interest that could be earned from investment of a lump sum inheritance.
joseph maintains that the trial court was required to consider the operating expenses of his newly formed businesses in determining his annual gross income for purposes of calculating a guideline child support amount.joseph relies specifically on subdivision a of section in contending that the trial court should have reduced the income that he received each month by the monthly expenditures that were necessary to operate his new companies.joseph essentially contends that the trial court calculated his income incorrectly for purposes of determining the guideline support amount.according to joseph,the court deviated from the appropriate guideline calculation which,under joseph theory,would have resulted in maryanne owing him child support,without making the findings that are required before a court may deviate from the guideline support amount under section.joseph argument is premised on the notion that the trial court had no authority to utilize an income amount that did not include the losses he suffered as a result of the operating expense of his businesses.we disagree that the trial court erred in calculating joseph income.
although section,subdivision a provides that gross receipts from a business are to be reduced by expenditures required for the operation of the business in calculating income under subdivision a of that section,subdivision b of section provides a trial court with discretion to determine a parent annual gross income on a basis different from that parent actual income.pursuant to subdivision b,the court may,in its discretion,consider the earning capacity of a parent in lieu of the parent income,consistent with the best interests of the children.thus,although subdivision a of section instructs the trial court to deduct the operating expenditures of a parent business in determining that parent actual income,the court is not required to utilize a parent actual income in setting child support if it determines that the parent actual income does not reflect that parent earning capacity.the trial court thus was not required to use joseph actual income in the guideline support formula,as joseph argument suggests.rather,it was within the court discretion to consider joseph earning capacity in lieu of his actual income.
although the trial court did not expressly state that it was imputing income to joseph pursuant to subdivision b of section,it is clear that this was,in fact,what the court did when it declined to include the losses caused by the operating expenses of joseph companies in calculating joseph income.the court rejected the use of joseph actual income as calculation under section subdivision a,in favor of a calculation of income that was based,at least in part,on an amount that the court determined was fair to impute to joseph in view of his decision to invest in companies that would predictably operate at a loss for some period of time,rather than investing in assets.
indeed,by not taking into consideration the operating expenses of joseph companies in determining joseph income for purposes of calculating the guideline support amount,the trial court effectively imputed a net zero income to joseph with respect to these companies,rather than allowing him to take a loss from the operating expenses from these companies.the only error in the trial court analysis of this issue,if any,was that it did not articulate that it was effectively proceeding pursuant to the discretion granted the court under subdivision b of section to adjust the income calculation to reflect joseph earning capacity,rather than simply calculating joseph actual income pursuant to subdivision a of section.despite failing to expressly state that it was attributing income to joseph pursuant to subdivision b,the court employed language pertaining to imputing income that is nearly identical to the language used in section,subdivision b,in commenting that joseph may not divest himself,in whole or in part,of his earning ability at the expense of his minor child.italics added.as we will explain further,it was within the court discretion to attribute income to joseph under section,subdivision b rather than calculating his income under subdivision a.
the strong public policy in favor of providing adequate child support has led to an expansive use of the earning capacity doctrine in setting the level of support when consistent with the needs of the child.citation.in re marriage of destein th,destein.destein and subsequent cases have made clear that a trial court has discretion to consider not only a parent earning capacity with respect to income from labor,but also to impute a reasonable rate of return on the supporting parent underutilized or investment assets in order to calculate guideline child support in the best interests of the child.williams,supra,th at,italics added.
thus,for example,in destein,supra,th at pages,the issue was whether the trial court abused its discretion in imputing to the father a hypothetical rate of return on his real estate investments when those investments do not produce income and would need to be liquidated to do so.citing section,subdivision b,the destein court found no error,noting that t he only statutory limitation on the court discretion to apply the earning capacity doctrine to investment assets is the best interests of the child.id.at.according to the destein court,there was no legal bar to attributing income to assets that were allocated for growth rather than income,and the trial court was permitted to address the difference in the parties living standards by imputing income from the father real estate investments.id.at.the destein court concluded that attributing a six percent rate of return on the equity in the father assets,pursuant to the opinion of the mother accounting expert,was reasonable.id.at.
similarly,in in re marriage of dacumos th dacumos,the appellate court considered whether it would be proper to attribute income to a father assets.id.at.the father owned two rental properties,which he was renting at a loss.id.at.the dacumos court determined that the trial court had not erred in imputing income to the rental properties,noting that the broader definition of earning capacity to include income that could be derived from assets as well as from work is in accord with legislative intent.id.at,italics added.in reaching this conclusion,the court reasoned that j ust as a parent can not shirk his parental obligations by reducing his earning capacity through unemployment or underemployment,he can not shirk the obligation to support his child by underutilizing assets.id.at.
expanding upon this approach to the determination of a parent income,the court in williams,supra,th at page,determined that a trial court acted within its discretion under section,subdivision b in implicitly determin ing that the children best interests would be served by an increase in guideline child support,calculated in part by attributing an assumed percent rate of return on father investment assets.the williams court explained,to ensure that child support orders are made in the best interests of the children,section,which provides for implementation of the statewide uniform guidelines for child support,gives a court great latitude in applying its principles to individual cases.in outlining relevant considerations,the legislature did not limit the guidelines simply to parental income from salary,return on investment,or from any other particular source.rather,it adopted the broader concepts of station in life,ability to pay,and standards of living.citation.consequently,our supreme court has refused to read any limitation into a trial court discretion to impute income when in the child best interests.citations.williams,supra,at.
it seems clear that in declining to consider joseph business losses from the companies that joseph formed after he obtained more than million in cash from the sale of his interest in stratagene,the trial court was preventing joseph from shirking his obligation to support his child by underutilizing assets dacumos,supra,th at.the money that joseph received from his sale of stratagene could have produced income indeed,joseph has invested a large portion of those funds and earns significant returns on his investment portfolio.joseph chose to invest a significant portion of the proceeds from the sale of his company in assets that did not produce income during the second half of and all of,and in fact,operated at a loss during the relevant time period.
under section,subdivision b and relevant case law,the trial court could have imputed positive income to joseph for the cash assets that he chose to use to make capital outlays and to pay operating expenses for his various start up business ventures rather than investing that money in assets that would earn income similar to the income his investment portfolio earned during the same time period.the court thus could reasonably have imputed the same percentage return on the money joseph earned from his investment portfolio to the money that joseph chose to invest in his companies.from this perspective,it was certainly reasonable for the court to do what it appears to have done here,which was to implicitly impute a zero percent return on the money joseph invested in the companies.in essence,by not allowing joseph to deduct the operating expenses of his newly formed companies from his actual income,the court was imputing no income to joseph based on the cash that he invested in those companies,and disallowing any claim that joseph income was negative.
the language that the trial court used in its order demonstrates that the court was attempting to determine joseph earning capacity rather than accepting joseph representation that although he had assets with a value in excess of million and continued to maintain his wealthy lifestyle,for purposes of calculating child support,his income was negative.for example,the court stated joseph may not voluntarily prefer his businesses to his child right to receive current support in accordance with joseph abilities.joseph may not invest in businesses and thereby minimize his support obligation while he maintains a wealthy lifestyle.joseph may not divest himself,in whole or in part,of his earning ability at the expense of his minor child.joseph may not take a break from his child support obligation in favor of his business investments.italics added.these statements,and particularly the court use of the words earning ability,show that the court was focusing on the crux of subdivision b of section,a parent earning capacity.
the court thus essentially gave joseph the benefit of the doubt with respect to joseph new investments by not imputing to him any positive income from the capital outlays that joseph invested in those businesses income that joseph could have had if he had made a different decision with respect to how to invest the money that he invested in these companies.the trial court did not abuse the discretion granted it pursuant to subdivision b of section in determining that joseph choice to invest his considerable wealth in companies that were operating at a loss should not undermine his dependent child right to receive current support in accordance with joseph earning capacity.
joseph takes issue with the trial court reliance on berger,supra,th,and attempts to distinguish berger,pointing out that the father in berger was voluntarily deferring his own income,while joseph bona fide business expenses,paid out in cash to third parties,are a strict statutory deduction from his income.italics omitted.we agree that berger is not precisely on point with this case,since the father in that case had been promised a salary that he chose to defer for a period of time in order to try to get his landscaping company off the ground.earning capacity thus was not at issue in berger.see berger,supra,at.
berger is relevant to the present case,however,to the extent that it discusses a parent obligation not to voluntarily act in a way that negatively impacts the support that a child is entitled to receive from that parent.this case,like berger,involves an unusual situation in which considering a parent actual monthly income would not reflect the true nature of the parties relative lifestyles and wealth.like the husband in berger,joseph has sufficient wealth to enable him to choose to spend some of his capital on starting up a handful of new business ventures,all of which he expects will operate at a loss in the short term,but will bring him income in the future.as the trial court noted,joseph continues to maintain his very wealthy lifestyle,despite the losses from his business ventures given the net value of joseph assets,it is clear that his net worth is far greater than maryanne.thus,as in berger,it would be ironic to allow joseph wealth wealth which gives him the freedom to make a decision berger,supra,th at to invest in ventures that operate at a loss for some period of time to be spun into the justification for granting him a break from the obligation to support his family ibid,irrespective of the merits of those new ventures.
because the court erroneously concluded that joseph had a fiduciary duty to disclose to maryanne material information about changes in his income after a final child support order had been entered and sanctioned joseph,in part,for violating that fiduciary duty,the sanctions order must be reversed the court must reconsider sanctions on remand 
the trial court awarded maryanne sanctions in the amount of pursuant to sections and,which authorize the court to impose sanctions in family law proceedings.joseph contends that the sanction award was based,in part,on the court erroneous conclusion that joseph owed maryanne a fiduciary duty to provide her with material facts and information regarding his income after there was a final judgment of dissolution of their marriage.
additional background regarding the court sanctions award 
the parties requested sanctions against each other,and the trial court addressed both parties requests.however,because joseph does not appeal the trial court denial of his request for sanctions against maryanne,we do not describe the court ruling in this respect.rather,we describe the court ruling only with respect to maryanne request for sanctions against joseph,which the trial court granted,and which joseph challenges on appeal.
the trial court noted that maryanne sought sanctions against joseph under section for behavior that frustrated settlement and furthered the litigation,and also under sections and for breaches of fiduciary duties for failing to disclose material changes in his income beginning,failing to disclose material facts about his income from the date of her filing in august to the date of formal discovery in march,failing to produce material information and documents concerning various trusts,providing misleading financial and tax information,providing misleading information regarding bsp and the use of funds from bsp to pay child support.
joseph had argued that he no longer owed maryanne any fiduciary duties,since the two were no longer married and there was a final judgment in their marital dissolution case.the court explained that despite joseph protestations to the contrary,the court was of the view that joseph continued to owe maryanne a fiduciary duty to disclose material information pertaining to his income and expenses even after the wyoming divorce decree was entered.the court stated,section,subdivision c must be interpreted to apply until the court loses jurisdiction to make a child support order because the order for child support is terminated by the court or terminates by operation of law pursuant to sections,and.citation.therefore,maryanne interpretation of section,subdivision c is consistent to the statutory intent joseph is not.the court concluded that the fiduciary duties outlined in section,subdivision c continued in this case after the entry of the wyoming decree and,because the parties son was and is at all times herein,an unemancipated minor child of the parties,the fiduciary duties have at all times herein remained in effect and are presently in effect between maryanne and joseph.
based on its conclusion that the parties continued to owe each other fiduciary duties,and in particular,a fiduciary duty to disclose all material changes to their incomes and expenses,the court determined that joseph had breached his fiduciary duties to maryanne.specifically,the court found that joseph failed to disclose various material facts and information regarding his income prior to maryanne seeking formal discovery of those matters,and also found that joseph had used a variety of intimidation tactics throughout the litigation.the court concluded,
the court therefore finds joseph failure to provide information to maryanne about the stratagene sale,the failure to provide maryanne copies of the sorge trusts i iv documents and joseph intimidation tactics in this matter violated his fiduciary duties to maryanne and fueled the litigation in this matter.therefore,maryanne motions are granted and she is awarded in sanctions pursuant to section and section.the court does not find sufficient evidence to warrant sanctions on any of the other facts argued by maryanne.italics added.
relevant legal standards 
provisions regarding fiduciary duties owed between parties in a dissolution action 
section sets out the legislative policy behind the disclosure requirements between parties to a marital dissolution action.in that section,the legislature explains that i t is the policy of the state of california to marshal,preserve,and protect community and assets and liabilities that exist at the date of separation so as to avoid dissipation of the community estate before distribution,to ensure fair and sufficient child and spousal support awards,and to achieve a division of community and assets and liabilities on the dissolution or nullity of marriage or legal separation of the parties as provided under california law,subd.a.
in order to promote this public policy,a full and accurate disclosure of all assets and liabilities in which one or both parties have or may have an interest must be made in the early stages of a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation of the parties,regardless of the characterization as community or separate,together with a disclosure of all income and expenses of the parties.moreover,each party has a continuing duty to immediately,fully,and accurately update and augment that disclosure to the extent there have been any material changes so that at the time the parties enter into an agreement for the resolution of any of these issues,or at the time of trial on these issues,each party will have a full and complete knowledge of the relevant underlying facts,subd.c.
subdivision c of section provides from the date of separation to the date of a valid,enforceable,and binding resolution of all issues relating to child or spousal support and professional fees,each party is subject to the standards provided in section as to all issues relating to the support and fees,including immediate,full,and accurate disclosure of all material facts and information regarding the income or expenses of the party.italics added.
provisions regarding sanctions 
section,subdivision c requires the trial court to impose monetary sanctions and to award reasonable attorney fees if a party fails to comply with any portion of the chapter of the family code that deals with a spouse fiduciary duty of disclosure during dissolution proceedings.that provision provides,if a party fails to comply with any provision of this chapter,the court shall,in addition to any other remedy provided by law,impose money sanctions against the noncomplying party.sanctions shall be in an amount sufficient to deter repetition of the conduct or comparable conduct,and shall include reasonable attorney fees,costs incurred,or both,unless the court finds that the noncomplying party acted with substantial justification or that other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust,subd.c.
similarly,section,subdivision a provides the trial court with authority to order the opposing party to pay attorney fees and costs in the nature of a sanction when the conduct of each party or attorney frustrates the policy of the law to promote settlement of litigation that subdivision further provides notwithstanding any other provision of this code,the court may base an award of attorney fees and costs on the extent to which the conduct of each party or attorney furthers or frustrates the policy of the law to promote settlement of litigation and,where possible,to reduce the cost of litigation by encouraging cooperation between the parties and attorneys.an award of attorney fees and costs pursuant to this section is in the nature of a sanction.in making an award pursuant to this section,the court shall take into consideration all evidence concerning the parties incomes,assets,and liabilities.the court shall not impose a sanction pursuant to this section that imposes an unreasonable financial burden on the party against whom the sanction is imposed.in order to obtain an award under this section,the party requesting an award of attorney fees and costs is not required to demonstrate any financial need for the award.ibid.section advances the policy of the law to promote settlement and to encourage cooperation which will reduce the cost of litigation.citation.in re marriage of petropoulos th.
together,sections and give the trial court authority to order sanctions and the payment of attorney fees for breach of a party fiduciary duty of disclosure and for conduct which frustrates the policy of promoting settlement.in re marriage of feldman th,feldman.
standards of review 
a sanction order under section is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.t he trial court order will be overturned only if,considering all the evidence viewed most favorably in support of its order,no judge could reasonably make the order.citation.in reviewing such an award,we must indulge all reasonable inferences to uphold the court order.citation.although no case law discusses which standard of review we should apply to an order awarding sanctions under section,subdivision c,because the sanction is similar to that imposed under section as well as similar to a sanction for civil discovery abuses which are reviewed for abuse of discretion,we will apply an abuse of discretion standard to an order for sanctions under section,subdivision c.citation.feldman,supra,th at,fn.omitted.
to the extent that we are called upon to interpret the statutes relied on by the trial court to impose sanctions,we apply a de novo standard of review.feldman,supra,th at.we review any findings of fact that formed the basis for the award of sanctions under a substantial evidence standard of review.citation.ibid.
a.the trial court erred in determining that joseph owed maryanne a continuing fiduciary duty under section,subdivision c 
joseph contends that the trial court erred in interpreting section,subdivision c as requiring a continuing duty between divorced parents to make immediate,full,and accurate disclosure of all material facts and information regarding the income or expenses of the party,beyond the entry of a final judgment in a dissolution action,as long as there is a child for whom a support order remains in effect.
our task in construing a statute is to ascertain the legislative intent so as to effectuate the purpose of law.citation.the statutory language ordinarily is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.we give the words of the statute their ordinary and usual meaning and construe them in the context of the statute as a whole and the entire scheme of law of which it is a part.citation.if the language is clear and a literal construction would not result in absurd consequences that the legislature did not intend,the plain meaning governs.citation.if the language is ambiguous,we may consider a variety of extrinsic aids,including the purpose of the statute,legislative history,and public policy.citation.citation.in re marriage of fong th.
the trial court noted that section et does not define the words valid,enforceable,and binding resolution of all issues relating to child or spousal support and professional fees,and,therefore,determined that it should look elsewhere for guidance as to the objectives of the statute and the legislative intent.after citing the objective of the child support disclosure statutes as being the fashioning of fair and sufficient child support awards and fostering full disclosure and cooperative discovery,the trial court noted that not all disputes concerning child support involve married or once married parents.the trial court proceeded to conclude that if it were to agree with joseph argument that the wyoming divorce decree constituted a valid,enforceable and binding resolution of the child support issue,then the result would be that the fiduciary duties would be available only to parents who are still married but not to parents who were never married or who are no longer married.
according to the trial court,joseph argument would result in a system of parents one class of parents would be able to effectively obtain or modify child support orders fairly,efficiently,accurately and economically where the others would have to resort to formal discovery which can have the opposite effect.determining that the legislature would not create such a system,the court concluded that t he fiduciary duties must be available for all parents for the same duration,and t o accomplish that result,section,subdivision c must be interpreted to apply until the court loses jurisdiction to make a child support order because the order for child support is terminated by the court or terminates by operation of law pursuant to sections,and.
noting that child support remains at issue long after the entry of a judgment of dissolution,the trial court was of the view that there was no valid,enforceable and binding resolution of all issues relating to child or spousal support and professional fees under section,subdivision c until all support obligations terminated.the trial court concluded that to ensure fair support orders and foster full disclosure and cooperative discovery in all cases in which child support is pending,either before or after judgment,the fiduciary duties called for in section et seq.must continue as long as the issue of child support is pending,not final,or,in short,until the court jurisdiction to order child support ends.
we disagree with the trial court interpretation of section,subdivision c,and conclude that this subdivision does not impose on divorced parties a continuing fiduciary duty to disclose all material facts regarding a party income after a final custody and support order has been entered.
the relevant language of section,subdivision c states that the duty of immediate,accurate and full disclosure of material facts regarding income and expenses is owed f rom the date of separation to the date of a valid,enforceable,and binding resolution of all issues relating to child or spousal support and professional fees.
the terms valid,enforceable,and binding all refer to the legal strength or force of the resolution at issue.the definition of resolution that seems most applicable here is the act of determining.see webster new internat.dict.thus,the statute essentially requires that there be a final determination of all issues relating to child support before the parties fiduciary duty to one another regarding disclosure of income will end.the most reasonable interpretation of what would constitute a legally effective determination of all the issues relating to child support is a final,as opposed to interim,temporary,or pendente lite,child support order.in other words,a child support order that the parties the court have indicated is intended to be a final,permanent determination of child support represents a valid,enforceable,and binding resolution of all issues relating to child support.
in making this determination,we take guidance from the distinction that the supreme court has drawn between temporary and final orders in the context of child custody.in this context,it is clear that the supreme court has indicated than an order may be final or permanent,despite being subject to modification in the future.see,montenegro diaz cal th montenegro.we find this framework useful in considering a child support order,as well.in both the child custody and child support contexts,an order may be considered final or permanent,despite being subject to modification in the future.
further,interpreting the phrase valid,enforceable,and binding resolution of all issues relating to child support to refer to a final child support order,harmonizes section,subdivision c with other statutory provisions that would be rendered superfluous under the trial court interpretation.specifically,section et sets out a framework for the exchange of financial information between parties whose dissolution proceedings are final.a fter the entry of a judgment of dissolution,a custodial parent is entitled,upon written request,to an annual declaration of income and expenses from the parent paying child support,regardless of whether a notice of motion or order to show cause has been filed.see.in re marriage of armato th,armato.
section provides that t he purpose of this article,article,discovery before commencing modification or termination proceeding is to permit inexpensive discovery of facts before the commencement of a proceeding for modification or termination of an order for child,family,or spousal support.as the armato court explained,by mandating the production of such information,the family code provides the parties with a means to resolve support issues without judicial intervention,permits the parties to reassess on a periodic basis whether a modification is warranted,discourages the filing of meritless claims for a change in support,and encourages the use of voluntary agreements to modify support payments.armato,supra,th at,italics added.
section indicates that a party may request discovery pursuant to this article no more than once every months.section provides in pertinent part 
a at any time following a judgment of dissolution of marriage or legal separation of the parties,or a determination of paternity,that provides for payment of support,either the party ordered to pay support or the party to whom support was ordered to be paid or that party assignee,without leave of court,may serve a request on the other party for the production of a completed current income and expense declaration in the form adopted by the judicial council.
it is apparent that pursuant to section,subdivision a,a party subject to a child support order,whether it is the party ordered to pay the support or the party entitled to receive the support,has a right to make an annual request for a declaration of income and expenses from the other party.the fact that the legislature enacted section makes it clear that the legislature did not intend for divorced parties to continue to owe each other the same fiduciary duty to disclose all material changes in income as married persons or those in domestic partnerships do,simply because the parties share a child together and an order for the support and maintenance of that child remains in effect.
if we were to interpret section,subdivision c in the manner that the trial court suggests,there would be no need to have enacted a provision that would allow a parent to request income information under section,since that party would already be entitled to have the other party provide all material facts and information related to his or her income throughout the year.we should avoid an interpretation of section,subdivision c that would render the discovery procedures provided in section unnecessary.see kleffman vonage holdings cal th,w e must avoid interpretations of statutes that would render related provisions unnecessary or redundant.see also kavanaugh west sonoma county union high school dist.cal th,a statute should be interpreted with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect.citation.
we conclude that for purposes of section,subdivision c,a valid,enforceable,and binding resolution of all issues relating to child support means a final judicial child support determination,whether obtained pursuant to agreement of the parties or after litigation of the matter before the court.despite the fact that a final child support determination is never truly final or permanent,in the sense that it may always be modified at the request of a party who can demonstrate that changed circumstances justify a modification,for purposes of section,subdivision c,a child support order that the parties the court indicate is not intended to be temporary or interim or pendente lite should be considered to be the final resolution of all issues related to child support.thus,once a final order of child support has been entered in a dissolution case,the parties are no longer subject to the standards provided in section as to all issues relating to the support and fees,including immediate,full,and accurate disclosure of all material facts and information regarding the income or expenses of the party,subd.c.
b.a final child support determination was made upon the entry of the wyoming divorce decree 
the parties wyoming divorce decree states the parties entered into a marital settlement agreement dated june,the purpose of which is to make a final and complete settlement of all rights and obligations between the parties,including those concerning their property,the support and maintenance of each of them and their children,and all other matters existing between the parties growing out of their marital relationship.italics added.
by stating that the wyoming divorce decree was to constitute the final and complete settlement of the support and maintenance of their children,joseph and maryanne made clear their intent that this agreement,which was reduced to a judgment,be the final support order.further,the parties conduct after entry of this divorce decree indicates that this was their intention.see montenegro,supra,cal th at evidence of parties conduct following entry of ambiguous orders supported court determination that the parties did not intend for the orders at issue to be final judgments as to custody.neither party sought to modify the child support order until maryanne had reason to believe that joseph assets had increased significantly,thus indicating a change in circumstances warranting modification of the child support order.thus,as of the time the wyoming divorce decree was entered,the parties in this case were no longer required to disclose all material facts and information regarding the income or expenses of the party to the other pursuant to section,subdivision c.the court therefore erred in concluding that joseph breached his fiduciary duty to maryanne by failing to disclose to her material facts and information regarding his income,after entry of the wyoming divorce decree.
c.the trial court sanctions order,which was based in part on the court erroneous determination that joseph had breached his fiduciary duty to maryanne by not disclosing certain information related to his income,must be reversed and the matter remanded for further consideration by the court 
joseph contends that because the sanction order was based,in part,on the trial court erroneous conclusion that joseph continued to owe maryanne a duty to disclose all material facts and information concerning his income or expenses,the sanction order must be reversed.maryanne contends that even if we determine that the trial court erred in concluding that joseph breached a fiduciary duty owed to maryanne,we may nevertheless affirm the trial court sanction award on the ground that the award was also premised on section,and joseph does not challenge the sanction award on that ground.
it is clear from the record that the trial court awarded sanctions pursuant to both section and section.because the court concluded that sanctions were appropriate based at least in part on its erroneous determination that section,subdivision c continued to apply to joseph even after the parties had a valid,enforceable and binding resolution of all child support matters,and because it is impossible to determine from the court sanction award what portion of the award is attributable to this erroneous conclusion,we must reverse the entire sanction award and remand for the court to determine anew what amount of sanctions it should award,if any,based on its finding that joseph utilized various intimidation techniques throughout the litigation see in re marriage of abrams th,overruled on another ground in in re marriage of lamusga cal th,remanding issue of sanctions because h aving found merit in only one of the court three reasons for imposing the attorney fee sanction,we can not say with any certainty that the court necessarily would have exercised its discretion in the same fashion based only on the one valid reason.
c.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney fees 
the trial court orders with respect to attorney feesa.the trial court january,attorney fee order 
with respect to maryanne request for an award of attorney fees pursuant to section the trial court cited the factors that the court is to consider in fashioning an award of attorney fees and costs,including the parties respective incomes,the parties comparative need,the parties respective resources,the complexity of the case,the skill of counsel,the reasonableness of the fees,and any other factors affecting the parties abilities to pay.
the court stated,the fact that maryanne has ample resources to pay her attorney fees does not necessarily bar an order for attorney fees and costs,noting that pursuant to california statutes and case law,a party need is relative.the trial court then cited in re marriage of th,a case in which the parties had ample resources to pay their attorney fees,in that the husband had million in assets and the wife had million in assets.the court in awarded the husband in attorney fees and costs,which the wife disputed on appeal,and the appellate court rejected the wife argument that the party requesting attorney fees was required to show need.
after considering the relevant factors,and noting that joseph retains of the parties combined incomes and approximately of the combined liquid assets,the court ordered joseph to pay in attorney fees and costs to maryanne.
b.the tri
