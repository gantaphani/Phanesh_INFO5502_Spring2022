this appeal arises from the united states district court for the northern district of california.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of sidense corporation sidense,holding that it did not infringe kilopass technology,kilopass patents the patent,and.kilopass,sidense,wl.we summarily affirmed that decision under federal circuit rule.kilopass,sidense,app x.while that appeal was pending,sidense filed a motion in the district court seeking an award of attorneys fees under,which the district court denied.kilopass,sidense,wl.sidense now appeals from the district court denial of that motion.we vacate and remand for reconsideration consistent with this opinion.
kilopass and sidense are competitors in the embedded memory nvm market.memory cells use transistors to store information.nvm memory consists of memory devices that retain their information or state when power is removed.kilopass markets technology used to create its t nvm memory technology.sidense has a competing fuse product,the design and technology of which it licenses to its customers,who in turn use those designs to build embedded memory cells.
kilopass patents cover a memory cell comprised of transistors located at the of a column bitline and a row wordline.each transistor has a gate connected to a column bitline and a source connected to a row wordline.patent ll.opposite the source is a drain that is not connected to any bitlines or wordlines.id.beneath the gate is a substrate separated from the gate by a dielectric oxide.id.the dielectric oxide is engineered to break down when a sufficient voltage is applied to the gate.id.ll.if the gate oxide breaks down,a conductive link forms between the source and drain,allowing current to flow through the transistor.id.ll.the flow of current indicates that the transistor is in a programmed state,while the absence of current flow indicates that it is in a state.id.
kilopass patent,which is representative of the patents in suit,is directed to a programmable memory cell utilizing a transistor at the intersection of a column bitline and a row wordline.patent abstract.representative claim reads as follows 
a programmable memory cell useful in a memory array having column bitlines and row wordlines,the memory cell comprising 
a transistor having a gate,
a gate dielectric between the gate and over a substrate,
and first and second doped semiconductor regions formed in said substrate adjacent said gate and in a spaced apart relationship to define a channel region there between and under said gate 
and wherein the second doped semiconductor region of the transistor is connected to one of said row wordlines,
and wherein said gate dielectric is formed such that the gate dielectric is more susceptible to breakdown near the first doped semiconductor region than said second doped semiconductor region.
id.ll.emphases added.
claim of the patent requires a first and second doped semiconductor region of the memory cell where the second doped region is connected to one of the wordlines.id.sidense fuse cells,however,utilize a shallow trench isolation sti region for the transistor drain instead of a first doped region.kilopass,wl,at.the claim also requires the second doped region to be connected to a row wordline,but sidense fuse product connects the second doped region to the column bitline.kilopass,wl,at.these differences formed the basis of the district court noninfringement determination,which we affirmed.kilopass,wl,at,aff,app x.
in,kilopass founder and an inventor on all three of kilopass patents,jack peng,reviewed an international patent application submitted by sidense that was directed to protecting sidense competing fuse memory cell.peng believed that the fuse was similar to kilopass patented cells,except that sidense used a split gate implementation.kilopass,wl,at.peng contacted a patent attorney at the law firm perkins coie to discuss potential infringement.in an email to the perkins attorney,peng explained that kilopass did not file a dedicated patent for this split gate implementation and that we should have a long time ago even though we were very busy.according to peng,it was not a priority to kilopass at that time because sidense split gate memory cell is not,so their practical cell size will be larger than kilopass t cell.
the perkins counsel nonetheless believed that there was a sufficient basis to challenge sidense with infringement contentions in a friendly way to see what their reaction is.on november,the perkins counsel sent a letter to sidense advising that it should be interested in obtaining a license to kilopass patents or otherwise provide kilopass with an explanation of how these products avoid the claims of the,inter alia.
sidense responded on january,stating,i t is our opinion that no products produced by sidense,nor their methods of operation,fall within the scope of the claims.specifically,sidense noted 
e ach claim require s that the transistor have first and second doped semiconductor regions formed in the substrate adjacent the gate and a second doped semiconductor region connected to the row wordline such elements are not present in sidense memory cell transistors.for at least these reasons,we do not believe any license of these patents is necessary.
emphases added.sidense also proposed that it was prepared to consider a examination,on a confidential basis to confirm whether sidense products infringed,provided kilopass agreed to pay the costs of same and to be bound by any findings in this regard.
after reviewing sidense response,the perkins counsel sent the following to peng and kilopass ceo 
here is my report on sidense response to our charge of infringement.i still believe given our knowledge of sidense technology,that they infringe our patents.please keep in mind that i am assuming that their memory design is the same as detailed in their patent application note that it is possible that sidense may have changed their memory design to be different from what is shown in speaking with jack peng earlier today,we speculated that sidense may have eliminated the first doped region and replaced it with a shallow trench isolation sti of some sort i f in fact they have eliminated the first dope region,then they would not infringe our claims literally.if that is the case,then we would have to go through a reissue proceeding in the patent office that may take years in order to modify our claims to include the situation where there is no first doped region the most crucial bit of information we need to find out is the design of their memory cell.we have been assuming that their patent application shows their memory cell.this is not always the case and it would be good if we could find out definitively how their memory cell is constructed.i still feel strongly about our case if they are using the memory cell described in their patent application.
emphasis in original.that made clear that the analysis by perkins counsel up to that point had been based on the assumption that the design of sidense fuse cell was the same as the cell described in sidense international patent application and if that assumption was incorrect and sidense had in fact replaced the first doped region,the drain with an sti region,then sidense would not infringe the claims literally.id.
in june,a kilopass employee obtained a diagram of sidense fuse cell at a presentation,which confirmed that sidense had replaced the drain with an sti.the perkins counsel then sent the following to kilopass officials my preliminary review of all the sidense materials indicates that they have redesigned their memory cell to avoid infringement of our patents.or at least make our case much tougher.emphasis added.counsel also noted that sidense employed an opposite wordline and bitline configuration,the gate of each transistor was connected to a row wordline and the source was connected to a column bitline.counsel stated that he was not so worried about the interchange of the bit line and word line,but that he was more worried about the fact that sidense cell uses an sti on one side of the gate and not a drain.id.at.
despite that advice from its perkins patent counsel that sidense did not infringe the claims literally,and that kilopass case was much tougher,kilopass retained the law firm of morrison foerster mofo to conduct another analysis.on march,counsel from mofo kilopass ceo the following 
as we mentioned during the meeting,assuming sidense nvm product uses an sti region as opposed to two n regions to define the channel below the gate kilopass appears to have a valid claim that sidense nvm product is at least equivalent to the invention claimed by claim of kilopass patent,and therefore that sidense infringes that patent.
as we also discussed,the next step is for us to conduct a more detailed investigation and analysis to confirm our initial impressions,which you asked us to complete before your april meeting with kilopass board.
emphases added.
mofo then immediately began its more detailed investigation in order to meet kilopass deadline.however,eight days later,on march,kilopass instructed mofo to stop all work on the project.the reason is unclear,but mofo subsequently sent kilopass an invoice for hours of work relating to kilopass investigation of potential infringement claims against sidense.j.the invoice was accompanied by a preliminary infringement chart for the patent reflecting mofo analysis.id.
the infringement chart provided an analysis concerning the doctrine of equivalents and concluded that kilopass appears to have a reasonable argument that sidense field oxide region is equivalent to the doped region in claim of the patent,and therefore satisfies this limitation.with regard to literal infringement,the mofo counsel opined 
i f doped region is defined as an area on the semiconductor where the electrical properties have been changed,it may be difficult to argue that the field oxide region is a doped region if,however,doped region could reasonably be defined more broadly as simply an area to which a dopant is applied,then we may be able to argue that the field oxide region is a doped region.determining the potential viability of this argument will require additional investigation,technical feedback from kilopass and possibly input from an independent expert.
although mofo preliminary infringement chart opined favorably to kilopass regarding the doctrine of equivalents,there is no evidence in the record that mofo analysis was complete at that time,nor is there any evidence that kilopass considered mofo preliminary infringement chart in deciding to bring suit against sidense.kilopass retained mofo to conduct an infringement analysis but terminated that relationship only eight days later.it does not appear that kilopass was aware of how much work mofo had done up to that point or that mofo was even in the process of completing an infringement chart.in other words,it appears that kilopass officials had already set their mind prior to learning of mofo infringement analysis.
in,a team of engineers led by kilopass cto sent an exemplary sidense memory device to a for.after receiving the results,the cto created a slide presentation for a meeting of kilopass board noting that kilopass had retained the law firm snr denton to investigate potential infringement against sidense.the cto also stated that denton a ttorneys do have a conclusion yet as to the reading of doped region and sti region and that their formal analysis was in progress.however,in the cto opinion,f rom an engineer perspective,sidense infringed under the doctrine of equivalents.id.
on may,kilopass filed suit against sidense in the united states district court for the northern district of california,alleging both literal infringement and infringement under the doctrine of equivalents.
during the course of the proceedings,the district court discovered that kilopass was making claim construction arguments to the united states patent and trademark office board of patent appeals and interferences the board that were directly contrary to those being made to the court in order to distinguish over a key piece of prior art during a concurrent inter partes reexamination.kilopass,wl,at.the district court admonished kilopass for engaging in gamesmanship.
additionally,the district court ruled that kilopass had attempted to amend its infringement contentions and advance previously undisclosed theories under the doctrine of equivalents long past the applicable deadline and without the court approval.kilopass,wl,at.the district court noted that kilopass assertion of a new theory of equivalence is particularly inappropriate in light of evidence that kilopass has known for many years that sidense does not literally infringe its patents.id.at emphasis added.
after ruling that kilopass had disavowed claim scope and striking evidence relating to kilopass theory of equivalence,the district court granted sidense summary judgment of noninfringement.id.at.the district court reasoned that kilopass ignored numerous differences between the patent claims and sidense accused products and that peng,a named inventor on all three patents in suit,admitted before kilopass filed suit that kilopass had actually considered using sidense design but chose not to because it resulted in a larger cell size.id.at.
kilopass appealed the district court grant of summary judgment to this court,and we summarily affirmed pursuant to federal circuit rule.kilopass,app x at.while that appeal was pending,sidense filed a motion in the district court for an award of attorneys fees pursuant to.relying on the standard set forth by a panel of this court in brooks furniture manufacturing dutailier,the district court denied the motion,stating 
although sidense was the prevailing party on the patent claims,the court concludes that sidense has not met its burden of establishing with clear and convincing evidence that kilopass brought or maintained the prosecution of its patent infringement in bad faith.kilopass performed substantial investigation and was able to obtain opinions from two different law firms that kilopass had a claim against sidense.in addition,kilopass chief technology officer performed his own independent analysis based on the results of an outside forensics firm to determine that a suit was appropriate.
kilopass,wl,at citations omitted.
sidense now appeals the district court denial of its motion for attorneys fees.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
a determination of whether to award attorneys fees under involves a process.first,a district court must determine whether the prevailing party has proved by clear and convincing evidence,ruiz chance,that the case is exceptional.cybor fas,en banc.under brooks furniture,
a case may be deemed exceptional when there has been some material inappropriate conduct related to the matter in litigation,such as willful infringement,fraud or inequitable conduct in procuring the patent,misconduct during litigation,vexatious or unjustified litigation,conduct that violates federal rule of civil procedure,or like infractions.see,cambridge prods.penn nutrients,beckman instruments,lkb produkter ab.absent misconduct in the litigation or in securing the patent,sanctions may be imposed against the patentee only if both the litigation is brought in subjective bad faith,and the litigation is objectively baseless.professional real estate investors columbia pictures industries,d see also forest,abbott.
we review de novo whether the court applied the proper legal standard under,and review the court factual findings for clear error.brasseler,i,stryker sales.a finding is clearly erroneous when,despite some supporting evidence,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states gypsum.second,if the district court finds the case to be exceptional,it must then determine whether an award of attorneys fees is appropriate.cybor,at.we review that determination for an abuse of discretion.id.
sidense argues that the district court erred in not finding this case exceptional under brooks furniture because kilopass claims were objectively baseless and brought in subjective bad faith.in the alternative,sidense urges us to change the standard for assessing exceptionality under as set out in brooks furniture and cases that followed.kilopass responds that,as the trial court found,it had a good faith basis for bringing and pursuing its infringement claims against sidense products.kilopass also argues that we should not alter our exceptional case standard.
sidense first faults the district court for its reliance on our decision in marctec,llc johnson johnson,which,in sidense view,requires too great a showing to establish subjective bad faith.quoting ilor,llc google,marctec stated that,when a defendant seeks fee shifting under based on the allegation that the plaintiff claims were objectively baseless,the patentee case must have no objective foundation,and the plaintiff must actually know this.marctec,at emphasis added.requiring actual knowledge that claims are baseless,according to sidense,sets too high a bar for establishing that a case is exceptional.these concerns are echoed in the recent successful petition for a writ of certiorari in octane fitness,llc icon health fitness,cert.granted.petitioners argued that requiring defendants to prove actual knowledge results in impermissibly disparate treatment of plaintiffs and defendants under because a plaintiff can demonstrate exceptionality by proving willful infringement,which only requires a showing of recklessness.see petition for writ of certiorari,octane fitness,llc icon health fitness,wl,at,see also fogerty fantasy,d stating that p revailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants are to be treated alike in the context of assessing entitlement to attorneys fees under eltech.ppg,t here is and should be no difference in the standards applicable to patentees and infringers who engage in bad faith litigation.
it is unclear whether the district court,in its brief analysis,required sidense to demonstrate that kilopass had actual knowledge that its claims were baseless.but,to the extent that the district court did require actual knowledge of objective baselessness,it erred.the language from ilor and marctec that sidense interprets as requiring actual knowledge does not reflect this court law governing and is dictum as we made clear in highmark,allcare health management,subjective bad faith only requires proof that the lack of objective foundation for the claim was either known or so obvious that it should have been known by the party asserting the claim.id.at emphases added quoting in re seagate,llc,en banc.thus,actual knowledge of baselessness is not required.like a plaintiff seeking to recover attorneys fees under based on alleged willful infringement,a defendant need only prove reckless conduct to satisfy the subjective component of the analysis.see highmark,at seagate,at t o establish willful infringement,a patentee must show by clear and convincing evidence that the infringer acted despite an objectively high likelihood that its actions constituted infringement of a valid patent.
in addition to any errors the district court may have made by requiring too great a showing of subjective bad faith,the court erred by taking too narrow a view of the proof that can satisfy the subjective prong of the analysis.the court rejected sidense request for fees based solely on sidense purported failure to establish subjective bad faith.kilopass,wl,at t he court concludes that sidense has not met its burden of establishing with clear and convincing evidence that kilopass brought or maintained the prosecution of its patent infringement in bad faith.the court reached this determination,however,without addressing the objective merits of kilopass claims.id.instead,it focused exclusively on evidence it considered to be indicative of good faith on kilopass part including opinions of counsel and kilopass own independent infringement analysis.id.this focus was inappropriately narrow,rendering the district court analysis incomplete.
our case law has long held that,in considering a party subjective state of mind,we are to take into account the totality of the circumstances.highmark,at quoting mach,at.in eltech,we examined the difficulty of proving what a party actually knew or did not know,explaining 
the should know rubric obviously applies when a party attempts to escape the consequences of its conduct with the bare statement,i did know.a party confronted with the difficulty of proving what is in an adversary mind must be at liberty to prove facts establishing that that adversary should have known,to prove facts that render the i did know excuse unacceptable.
at.thus,focusing first and only on subjective factors,as the district court did here,is inadequate to obtain the justice that is intended to achieve.subjective bad faith is difficult to prove directly,essentially requiring the discovery of a smoking gun,and evidence of a lack of subjective bad faith is easy to provide,as occurred here.kilopass,knowing that it had no literal infringement case,that sidense product was not within the scope of its claims,was able to overcome sidense fee motion simply by showing that it had consulted counsel who opined about the possibility of prevailing on an infringement claim under the doctrine of equivalents.lack of direct proof of subjective bad faith should not alone free a party from the threat of assessment of attorneys fees under,however.the district court prematurely ended the inquiry without determining whether kilopass doctrine of equivalents theory was objectively baseless and whether that fact or other circumstantial evidence would support an inference of bad faith on the part of kilopass.
the primacy of objective evidence over assertions of subjective good faith or lack of knowledge is well established in our case law the totality of the circumstances does include an evaluation of subjective good faith,but mostly as a negative.if a smoking gun is found,revealing that a patentee knew that he had no chance of winning a lawsuit,then subjective bad faith is easily shown.but one misguided belief,based on zealousness rather than reason,is simply not sufficient by itself to show that a case is not exceptional in light of objective evidence that a patentee has pressed meritless claims.thus,we have observed that,where the patentee is manifestly unreasonable in assessing infringement,while continuing to assert infringement in court,an inference is proper of bad faith.eltech,at.
in discussing the requirement of bad faith to support a finding of exceptionality under,brooks furniture did not speak at all to the type of proofs that are adequate to establish bad faith.brooks furniture thus did nothing to discourage courts from drawing an inference of bad faith from circumstantial evidence thereof when a patentee pursues claims that are devoid of merit.factors such as the failure to conduct an adequate investigation,vexatious or unduly burdensome litigation tactics,misconduct in procuring the patent,or an oppressive purpose are factors which can be indicative of bad faith.the wide variety of ways available to establish bad faith is why our case law has long required a party seeking fees under to prove the other guilty of bad faith litigation by clear and convincing evidence in light of the totality of the circumstances.eltech,at emphasis added see also highmark,at quoting mach,at forest,abbott,considering the record as a whole in determining whether the patentee maintained its infringement counterclaim in bad faith.thus,we vacate the district court judgment denying fees and remand for consideration of whether kilopass acted in bad faith in light of the totality of the circumstances with particular attention paid to the objective merits of kilopass claims and other objective evidence indicative of bad faith.
sidense also argues that it should not even be required to prove that kilopass acted in bad faith to show exceptionality.proof of objective baselessness,in sidense view,should be enough to demonstrate exceptionality under.sidense does not contend that a finding of exceptionality predicated on objective baselessness would demand that the district court shift fees,only that it should permit it to do so in its discretion in light of the totality of the circumstances.sidense argument is not without some force.
in,congress amended the then patent remedy statute,section of the revised statutes of,to state that the court may in its discretion award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.mach,at quoting patent act of august,stat,ed.the legislative history indicates that a key aim of this provision was to enable the court to prevent a gross injustice to an alleged infringer.see mathis spears,quoting,sess,reprinted in cong.serv.this statute was interpreted by the circuit courts of appeals as giving district courts broad discretion to award attorney fees in extraordinary circumstances.see,id.the statute was construed to allow the award of fees in extraordinary cases park in theatres perkins,cir i n granting this power,congress made plain its intention that such fees be allowed only in extraordinary circumstances.an extraordinary case was one bottomed upon a finding of unfairness or bad faith in the conduct of the losing party,or some other equitable consideration of similar force,which makes it grossly unjust that the winner of the particular law suit be left to bear the burden of his own counsel fees.park in theatres,at emphasis added listing additional cases that support this view.
the patent act slightly modified and incorporated the statute into the present day patent remedy statute.see mach,at.section states,the court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.although the word exceptional was added and the word discretion was removed,the legislative history makes clear that no change in meaning was intended 
this section is substantially the same as the corresponding provision in,except in exceptional cases has been added as expressing the intention of the present statute as shown by its legislative history and as interpreted by the courts.
sess,reprinted in cong.ad.news,see also rohm haas crystal chem,quoting federico,commentary on the new patent act,title,united states code annotated,page,at reprinted in pat.trademark off.soc y.
thus,a central aim of,as well as its predecessor,is to prevent an alleged infringer from suffering a gross injustice.the injury to the alleged infringer is the focus an injury that can occur regardless of a plaintiff state of mind.in the same vein,we have stressed that is remedial and for the purpose of compensating the prevailing party for the costs it incurred in the prosecution or defense of a case where it would be grossly unjust to require it to bear its own costs.highmark,at.again,it is clear that the aim of is to compensate a defendant for attorneys fees it should not have been forced to incur.the aim is not to punish a plaintiff for bringing those claims an inquiry that legitimately would involve inquiry into the plaintiff state of mind.thus,relevant legislative history and our own case law at least suggest that we should focus on the gross injustice to the defendant,if any,and not necessarily on the plaintiff subjective state.
even federal rule of civil procedure which allows the imposition of punitive sanctions does not involve inquiry into a party subjective good faith.rule allows courts to impose sanctions where a filing contains claims,defenses,and other legal contentions that are not warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending,modifying,or reversing existing law or for establishing new law.rule functions to assure that parties assert litigation positions that are objectively reasonable at the time of filing.see hall bed bath beyond,noting that rule sanctions are appropriate when a plaintiff asserts frivolous claims in its complaint.importantly,however,rule does not require a showing of bad faith.see chambers nasco,d rule imposes an objective standard of reasonable inquiry which does not mandate a finding of bad faith.because subjective bad faith is not required in the context of rule,it follows that the question of exceptionality under a compensatory provision should involve an objective inquiry as well,under which a party assertions of subjective good faith or lack of knowledge do not bear on whether a case is exceptional.again,while those factors might influence a trial court exercise of its discretion under the second part of the inquiry,when determining whether to award fees after finding exceptionality,it is arguable they should not impact the initial exceptionality finding.
it does not seem,moreover,that the supreme court decision in professional real estate investors would require that we retain the requirement of subjective bad faith as a predicate to a finding of exceptionality.we cited professional real estate investors in brooks furniture for the proposition that both subjective bad faith and objective baselessness are required under in the absence of litigation misconduct or misconduct in securing the patent at issue.brooks furniture,at.but,professional real estate investors does not seem to demand the bad faith requirement we gleaned from it.it is true that,in professional real estate investors,the court does demand inquiry into a litigant subjective motivation.at.but,the court subjective inquiry has nothing to do with what a litigant knew or should have known regarding the merits of its claims the inquiry that currently forms the subjective prong of our analysis.instead,the supreme court focused on whether the baseless lawsuit conceals an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor through the use of governmental process as opposed to the outcome of that process as anticompetitive weapon.id.at alteration and emphases in original citations and internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the subjective component in professional real estate investors,as sidense argues,may only pertain to antitrust concerns not present in analyses.if that is true,professional real estate investors would not demand that subjective considerations remain a necessary component of findings of exceptionality under 
while sidense arguments may constitute good faith assertions that our law should be something other than it is,as a panel,we are not able to entertain them.we must,and do,apply our current law,which requires proof of objective baselessness and subjective bad faith as a prerequisite to a finding of exceptionality the first prong in the court inquiry.see brooks furniture,at.consequently,on remand,the district court should require sidense to prove kilopass subjective bad faith.we reiterate,however,that a subjective bad faith requirement is not the obstacle to fee shifting that the district court in this case appears to have believed.as explained above,a wide variety of proofs can provide the requisite showing of bad faith under,which must be assessed in light of the totality of the circumstances.objective baselessness alone can create a sufficient inference of bad faith to establish exceptionality under,unless the circumstances as a whole show a lack of recklessness on the patentee part.see eltech,at.thus,the retention of the subjective bad faith requirement may prove to have little effect on this case,as well as many that follow.
sidense also contends that it should not be required to prove exceptionality by clear and convincing evidence,as our law currently requires.according to sidense,proof by a preponderance of the evidence should be sufficient under.again,sidense argument is not a frivolous one.
we have justified the requirement that a party prove exceptionality by clear and convincing evidence by citing the presumption that an assertion of infringement of a duly granted patent is made in good faith.highmark,at quoting medtronic navigation,brainlab medizinische computersysteme gmbh.according to our case law,this presumption of good faith originated in the supreme court decision in virtue creamery package manufacturing.see bard.in virtue,however,the court merely stated that p atents would be of little value if infringers of them could not be proceeded against in the courts.such action,considered by itself,can not be said to be illegal.at.this language does not establish,or even suggest,that there is a presumption that patents are asserted in good faith.it simply states that the assertion of a patent,in and of itself,i
