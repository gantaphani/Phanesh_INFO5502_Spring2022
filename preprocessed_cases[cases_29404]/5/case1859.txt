in an earlier opinion in these coordinated water resources control bd.cases th,d swrcb cases this court decided eight appeals and three in seven coordinated cases that arose out of an omnibus water rights proceeding before the state water resources control board the board involving the san francisco joaquin delta estuary.id.at,d.one of the seven coordinated cases was golden gate audubon society state water resources control board super.alameda county,a mandamus proceeding brought by five nonprofit organizations collectively the audubon society parties swrcb cases,at,d.another one of the coordinated cases was central delta water agency state water resources control board super.city and county,a mandamus proceeding brought by six parties with interests in the central joaquin delta collectively the central delta parties swrcb cases,at,d.
ultimately,this court determined the audubon society parties and the central delta parties were entitled to essentially the same mandamus relief against the board swrcb cases,supra,th at,d.on remand,after the trial court entered judgment in favor of the audubon society parties in compliance with this court directive,they sought attorney fees under the private attorney general doctrine embodied in code of civil procedure section section.the trial court denied their motion,concluding they had not shown that the necessity of private enforcement made a fee award appropriate.the trial court based this conclusion on the fact that the relief the audubon society parties obtained directed the board to do nothing more than provide the relief the central delta parties had already obtained.
for reasons we will explain,we conclude the trial court erred in denying the audubon society parties motion for attorney fees under section.that the success they achieved was the same success the central delta parties achieved does not justify a denial of a fee award under the private attorney general theory,especially since the trial court granted the motion by two of the central delta parties for fees under section.where two parties achieve the same relief acting essentially as private attorneys general,even though one of the parties is a public entity,there is no rational basis to conclude that the public entity is entitled to be rewarded for its success under section,but the private party is not.accordingly,we will reverse the order denying the audubon society parties fee motion and remand the matter for a determination of the amount of fees to which they are entitled.
factual and procedural background 
ithe plan and decision 
fortunately,the entire background of these coordinated took up pages in this court earlier not be repeated here.suffice it to say that in may,the board adopted a new water quality control plan for the the plan that,among other things,set minimum monthly average flow rates on the san joaquin river at vernalis the vernalis flow objectives.swrcb cases,supra,th at,d.the plan also included a narrative objective for the protection of salmon,which provided water quality conditions shall be maintained,together with other measures in the watershed,sufficient to achieve a doubling of natural production of chinook salmon from the average production of,consistent with the provisions of state and federal law.id.at,d.the narrative salmon protection objective and the vernalis flow objectives were established along with various other objectives to protect fish and wildlife uses served by the waters of the delta.id.at,d.
in its program of implementation,the plan provided that the various flow objectives for the protection of fish and wildlife,including the vernalis flow objectives,would be implemented through a water rights proceeding in which the board would allocate responsibility for meeting those objectives among water rights holders in the estuary watershed.swrcb cases,supra,th at,d.with respect to the narrative salmon protection objective,the plan provided that in addition to the timely completion of a water rights proceeding to implement river flow and operational requirements which will help protect salmon migration through the estuary,other measures may be necessary to achieve the objective of doubling the natural production of chinook salmon from average levels.id.at,d.
in,the board commenced the water rights proceeding to allocate responsibility for implementing the objectives of the plan.swrcb cases,supra,th at,d.ultimately,as part of that proceeding,instead of allocating responsibility for meeting all of the vernalis flow objectives to water rights holders in the watershed,the board approved an arrangement under which,for a period of time,all of vernalis flow objectives would be met except for vernalis pulse flow objective id.at,d 
the underlying litigation 
in april,the central delta parties filed their writ petition seeking to vacate the board decision in the water rights proceeding decision swrcb cases,supra,th at,d.included in that petition was a cause of action that alleged,among other things,that in adopting decision,the board failed to implement the water quality control plan,including the vernalis fish flow objectives.ibid.
that same month april the audubon society parties filed their own writ petition seeking to set aside decision.swrcb cases,supra,th at,d.in the first cause of action in their petition,the audubon society parties alleged decision was contrary to law and is not supported by substantial evidence because it purport s to authorize water rights inconsistent with applicable water quality objectives of the plan.the audubon society parties further alleged that decision ignored the objective.ibid.
in adjudicating the central delta parties petition,the trial court concluded that the vernalis flow objectives were the legal minimum flow objectives that must be satisfied unless changed in an appropriate proceeding to modify the plan itself.swrcb cases,supra,th at,d.accordingly,the trial court entered judgment in favor of the central delta parties directing issuance of a writ of mandate to the board requiring compliance with the vernalis flow objectives.id.at,d.the court denied the petition on all other grounds.ibid.
in adjudicating the audubon society parties petition,the trial court concluded as relevant here that decision supports and advances the narrative goal of doubling salmon survival.swrcb cases,supra,th at,d.based on its rejection of this and other arguments by the audubon society parties,the trial court entered judgment against them.ibid.
the prior appeals 
numerous parties,including the board,appealed from the judgment in favor of the central delta parties.swrcb cases,supra,th at,d.those parties argued that the plan allowed for staged implementation of the vernalis pulse flow objective,and the board decision to adopt alternate flows during an interim,experimental stage was both authorized and reasonable.id.at,d.this court disagreed,concluding there was nothing in the plan that authorized the board to implement a flow objective other than the vernalis pulse flow objective,even temporarily.id.at,d.this court agreed with the trial court that by adopting an alternate flow regime in lieu of the vernalis pulse flow objective in decision,even on a temporary basis,the board failed to fully implement the plan and instead accomplished a de facto amendment of that plan without complying with the procedural requirements for amending a water quality control plan.id.at,d.accordingly,this court affirmed the judgment in favor of the central delta parties to the extent it directed the issuance of a writ of mandate requiring the board to commence further appropriate proceedings to either assign responsibility for meeting the vernalis pulse flow objective or modify that objective id.at,d.
on appeal from the judgment against them,the audubon society parties renewed their argument that the board had failed to address and implement the narrative salmon protection objective.swrcb cases,supra,th at,d.to the extent the audubon society parties contend ed the board abused its discretion because it failed to do more in this water rights proceeding to achieve the salmon protection objective than implement the vernalis flow objectives,this court agree d with the trial court that the audubon society parties failed to establish an abuse of discretion by the board.id.at,d.this court concluded that the board had no obligation in this water rights proceeding to determine whether other flow objectives should be imposed to achieve the salmon objective.instead,its obligation was to actually implement the specific flow objectives it had committed itself to implementing.id.at,d.on that point,however,this court reiterated that the board did not actually carry through on that commitment because as the court previously concluded in connection with the challenges of the central delta parties the board did not implement the vernalis pulse flow objective.id.at,d.this court agree d with the audubon society parties that by failing to implement all of the vernalis flow objectives,the board fail ed to establish the minimum flows necessary to achieve the standard.ibid.thus,this court concluded the audubon society parties were entitled to a writ of mandate on this narrow ground,even though the trial court,in response to the writ petition by the central delta parties,ordered a writ to issue that would have the same practical effect.ibid.based on this conclusion,this court directed the trial court to enter a judgment in favor of the audubon society parties that was the same as the judgment in favor of the central delta parties with the exception of the language relating to the southern delta salinity objectives,a judgment ordering the issuance of a writ of mandate commanding the board to commence further appropriate proceedings to either assign responsibility for meeting the vernalis pulse flow objective or to modify that objective.id.at,d.
the attorney fees motions 
on remand,two of the central delta delta water agency central delta and south delta water agency south delta,both of which are public a motion for attorney fees under section following entry of the judgment in their favor,the audubon society parties filed a similar motion.it does not appear from the record before us what position the board took on the fee request by central delta and south delta except that they argued the motion was untimely.the board,however,opposed the fee request by the audubon society parties,arguing that they had prevailed at the court of appeal solely due to the successful efforts of the central delta parties and therefore were not prevailing parties and could not show the necessity of private enforcement two of the elements for a fee award under section.
the trial court granted the fee request by central delta and south delta,although limiting their recovery to percent of the fees they claimed due to their partial and limited success upon the overall objectives of their action.the court denied the fee request by the audubon society parties,agreeing with the board that they had not satisfied the last criteri on as to the necessity of private enforcement.
the audubon society parties subsequently filed a timely notice of appeal.no appeal was taken from the award of fees to central delta and south delta.
discussion 
section provides that u pon motion,a court may award attorneys fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if a a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,b the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement,or of enforcement by one public entity against another public entity,are such as to make the award appropriate,and c such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery,if any.
on review,an appellate court may reverse a trial court decision denying attorney fees under section for a prejudicial abuse of discretion.city of sacramento drew d.the pertinent question is whether the grounds given by the court for its denial of an award are consistent with the substantive law of section and,if so,whether their application to the facts of this case is within the range of discretion conferred upon the trial courts under section,read in light of the purposes and policy of the statute.drew,at.
here,the primary issue on appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion in determining that the audubon society parties failed to satisfy the necessity criterion of the statute.thus,we begin with the question of whether the trial court determination on the necessity criterion was consistent with the substantive law of section.we conclude it was not.
the necessity criterionaits historical development 
as noted above,one of the criteria for an award of attorney fees under section is that the necessity of private enforcement,or of enforcement by one public entity against another public entity,is such as to make the award appropriate.to understand how the necessity criterion operates here,we need to trace the development of that criterion and the way it has been applied in various situations.
in its original form,section did not allow for an attorney fee award to a public entity.see stats,ch,city of board of supervisors d.thus,in applying the necessity criterion under the original version of the statute,the sole question was whether the necessity of private enforcement made a fee award appropriate.as this court explained,section wa s intended as a bounty for pursuing public interest litigation california licensed foresters state bd.of forestry th,d.t he statutory requirement of necessity of private enforcement addresses the issue of the comparative availability of public enforcement,it looks to the adequacy of public enforcement and seeks economic equalization of representation in cases where private enforcement is necessary.where suit is brought against governmental agencies and officials,the necessity of private enforcement is obvious.in such situations private citizens alone must guard the guardians and the disparity in legal resources is likely to be greatest.city of sacramento drew,supra,d at.if,on the other hand,there is a public attorney general available to enforce the important right at issue there is no utility in inducing a private attorney general to duplicate the function.id.at.
in committee to defend reproductive rights v.a free pregnancy center d,the appellate court addressed how the necessity criterion operated in a case where a private party engaged in public interest litigation alongside a public entity.in committee to defend,two private parties filed a complaint for false advertising and unfair business practices against various defendants on the ground they were falsely representing that a reproductive counseling facility was a medical facility which provided abortion counseling and referral.id.at.four months after the filing of that complaint,the san francisco district attorney filed a similar action against most of the same defendants.id.at.the two cases were consolidated and tried together.ibid.the trial court issued an injunction restraining the defendants from operating the center in such a way as to suggest abortion services were available.ibid.part of the injunctive relief was based on the complaint of the private plaintiffs alone,and they were also responsible for obtaining relief against parties the district attorney had not named.ibid.nevertheless,the trial court denied the private plaintiffs an award of fees under section on the ground that,in light of the district attorney parallel action,their suit was not necessary as that term is defined in section committee to defend,at.
on appeal,one of the issues was whether the private plaintiffs action should be considered unnecessary within the meaning of section merely because,subsequent to filing their suit,the people,through the district attorney,filed a similar action.committee to defend reproductive rights v.a free pregnancy center,supra,d at.the appellate court answered that question in the negative,noting that although it found no california authority directly on point,federal cases have held that private parties who cooperate with governmental officials in litigation are not barred,by reason of the latter participation,from recovering attorney fees under the private attorney general theory.id.at.in such a case,the court concluded,an attorney fee award is dependent upon an ultimate finding of the trial court that the colitigating private party rendered necessary and significant services of value to the public or to a large class of persons benefited by the result of the litigation.id.at.thus,the rule derived from committee to defend is this if a public entity and a private party prosecute important public interest litigation in the same action,consolidated actions,or as here coordinated obtain the same success,the right of the private party to an award of attorney fees under section depends on whether the private party rendered services that were necessary and significant to achieving that success.
in,the legislature amended section to its present form,which allows a public entity to recover attorney fees from another public entity.people ex rel.brown tehama county bd.of supervisors th,d.by this amendment,the legislature essentially recognized that sometimes there may be a need for one public entity to engage in public interest litigation against another public entity under circumstances that make a fee award under section appropriate.indeed,the legislative history of the amendment to the statute reveals that the amendment was aimed at least in part at enabl ing small public entities to resist large,public entities,who,in the absence of the amendment,would simply bludgeon the former into legal submission.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended.thus,in the wake of the amendment,there may be circumstances in which it is proper to pay a bounty under section to encourage public entities to pursue public interest litigation against other public entities.
in city of santa monica stewart th,d,the appellate court addressed how the necessity criterion operates in a case where two or more private parties engage in public interest litigation alongside each other.the aspect of stewart relevant here involved an initiative passed in the city of pasadena that amended the city charter.id.at,d.when the city refused to perform certain ministerial duties required before the charter amendment could take effect,a city resident amy sought mandamus relief.ibid.two other parties,including the nonprofit organization that sponsored the initiative ftcr,later intervened in the action on amy behalf.id.at,d.
after the court granted amy mandamus petition on the ground the city was required to perform the ministerial duties,ftcr sought an award of attorney fees under section.city of santa monica stewart,supra,th at,d.the trial court denied the motion in part on the ground that ftcr had not contributed significantly to the action because the court probably would have granted the writ petition based on amy arguments alone.id.at,d.
on appeal,the appellate court concluded that the trial court had misinterpreted and misapplied the necessity criterion of section.city of santa monica stewart,supra,th at,d.the city argued that in determining whether an attorneys fees award is warranted or by whom,the necessity portion of the test not only looks to the availability of public enforcement,but weighs the relative contributions of each private guardian.id.at,d.the court disagreed,concluding that the policies underlying the intervention and private attorney general statutes do not support a trial court ability to weigh the contributions of multiple private attorneys general in determining whether each is entitled to attorneys fees.id.at,d.the court observed that a party who intervenes in an action is entitled to all of the same remedies as the original parties.ibid.the court also observed that the policy underlying section encourages a party without substantial resources to prosecute actions to vindicate important public constitutional and statutory rights,knowing that if it prevails it will receive financial compensation for its substantial efforts in that endeavor.ibid.the court concluded that these policies would be undermined by a rule that conditions an intervenor entitlement to private attorney general fees on an assessment of whether the intervenor participation was necessary to the successful result achieved.id.at,d.thus,the rule derived from stewart is this if two private parties prosecute important public interest litigation together and obtain the same success,neither party services can be deemed unnecessary simply because the other party would have succeeded without them.
its application here 
with this understanding of the necessity criterion and its application in mind,we turn to the arguments in this case.as it did in the trial court,the board relies heavily on committee to defend to argue that the audubon society parties did not satisfy the necessity criterion here.in the board view,because two of the central delta delta and south public agencies authorized by statute,committee to defend applies,and the pertinent question in determining whether the necessity of private enforcement was such as to make a fee award appropriate to the audubon society parties was whether the audubon society parties provided necessary and significant services above and beyond those provided by the central delta parties.the board contends they did not,because the audubon society parties contribution on the issue of the vernalis fishery flow objectives was duplicative of the central delta parties and unnecessary.the board contends that s ince a public entity was available to enforce this issue,and,in fact,ably did so,there is no utility in inducing a private attorney general to duplicate the function.
what the board argument overlooks,however,is that central delta and south delta received an award of attorney fees under section for their efforts in these coordinated cases.thus,unlike the district attorney in committee to defend,they were paid a bounty for pursuing litigation to challenge the board failure to fully implement the plan,like any other private attorney general might have been.this distinction raises the question of whether,for purposes of assessing the necessity criterion with respect to the audubon society parties,the rule in committee to defend should apply because central delta and south delta are public entities,or the rule in stewart should apply and the central delta and south delta should be treated as private parties because they were compensated for their efforts like a private attorney general would have been.we believe the answer to that question lies in the purpose of section.
in the wake of the amendment,the purpose of section is to encourage public or do not necessarily have adequate financial resources to do so to pursue important public interest litigation for the benefit of the public at large,or at least for the benefit of more than just themselves or their constituents.of course,there are within the executive branch of the government offices and institutions exemplified by the attorney general whose function it is to represent the general public in such matters and to ensure proper enforcement.serrano priest cal d.when such public entities perform their the district attorney in committee to there is no utility in inducing a private attorney general to duplicate the function city of sacramento drew,supra,d at,and the efforts of the colitigating private party should be evaluated under the rule in committee to defend,looking to see whether the private party rendered services that were necessary and significant to the success that was achieved.if,on the other hand,there is no public attorney general available to act,then the bounty that section provides must be available to any party,public or private,who takes on the responsibility of pursuing important public interest litigation beyond its own interests.and if more than one such party takes on that responsibility,then each such party is eligible for fees under section under the reasoning of stewart,and no single party can be given preference for purposes of determining whether the necessity criterion of the statute has been met.
here,there was no public attorney
