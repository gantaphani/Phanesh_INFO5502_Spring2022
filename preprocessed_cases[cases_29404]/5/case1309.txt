karen coolman amlong,william amlong,and their law firm,amlong amlong,appeal from a district court order imposing sanctions in excess of,under,for their conduct in representing a title vii plaintiff in a sexual harassment lawsuit.after thorough review,we conclude that the district court committed reversible error when,after referring the issue of sanctions to a magistrate judge for an evidentiary hearing and report and recommendation,the district court discarded numerous findings of fact and credibility determinations made by the magistrate judge and substituted its own findings of fact on bad faith,without conducting any evidentiary hearing.the district court also abused its discretion in ordering the amlongs to pay percent back interest on a portion of the sanctions,and we,therefore,reverse that portion of the sanctions award too.
the basic facts in the case are these in may,a former client introduced miami attorney debra valladares to the plaintiff in this title vii case,floride norelus,a haitian immigrant.norelus told valladares that she had suffered a horrific pattern of sexual harassment,rape,and assault at the hands of asif jawaid,the manager of a denny restaurant where she worked.according to norelus second amended complaint,jawaid repeatedly forced her to have oral,vaginal,and anal sex with him in the denny restaurant and at his home.norelus claimed that when she refused jawaid sexual demands,jawaid assigned her unpleasant duties or otherwise punished her.she added that the manager,jawaid,extracted sexual favors in exchange for job advantages,refused to file paperwork reflecting her alien status,and threatened to report her to the immigration authorities.norelus also said jawaid forced her to have sex with his roommate,raheel hameed,at their home and at another denny restaurant that hameed managed.on one occasion,norelus recounted,jawaid and hameed took her to their home,restrained her,repeatedly raped her,and penetrated her vagina with an object.norelus stated that she informed denny authorities of the abuse,but they failed to take proper remedial steps.jawaid allegedly retaliated by reducing norelus work hours and changing her work schedule.
attorney valladares met with norelus,along with valladares former client,david hill,and two of norelus brothers,for three hours.during this meeting,according to valladares testimony during the sanctions hearing conducted by the magistrate judge,one of norelus brothers told valladares that jawaid had personally confessed to having abused norelus.valladares said she also visited the two denny restaurants where norelus claimed to have been abused.valladares said a denny employee told her in valladares words that jawaid definitely had a thing for norelus and that she was like his property,and a denny patron told valladares he had seen jawaid mistreat norelus.neither individual,however,confirmed having witnessed sexual misconduct of the kind that norelus alleged.
valladares then sought assistance from another miami attorney,joseph chambrot,and the two lawyers later sought out the amlongs,who are well known south florida title vii lawyers.working from a sample complaint the amlongs provided from another case,valladares and chambrot filed norelus initial complaint in the united states district court for the southern district of florida on december.the amlongs role was limited at that point,but in january,they assumed formal representation of norelus.the amlong firm filed norelus first amended complaint in the district court on july,and then a second amended complaint on december.the amlong firm assigned primary client contact responsibilities to a associate,lisa stern now lisa stern taylor.
in the course of the discovery process,norelus was deposed over some eight days in january and february.taylor attended all the sessions,and robin hankins,another amlong firm associate,attended some of them.norelus had only limited facility with english,so an interpreter translated the questions into haitian french creole and translated norelus answers back into english.the language difficulties were not the only obstacle in the deposition norelus behavior was highly emotional and erratic.sometimes she answered questions sarcastically or otherwise failed to respond properly.until her lawyers instructed her to correct her testimony,norelus lied about matters related to her immigration status.among other things,she claimed that she did not know lavictore remy,the person whose name she had falsely used to secure employment.taylor,the amlong associate,told the defendants that this testimony was false,and she instructed norelus to tell the truth.norelus then admitted that in fact,lavictore remy was a relative.the plaintiff first deposition produced a voluminous transcript of more than pages.
amlong associates taylor and hankins also attended the february depositions of ten denny employees.notably,none of these witnesses corroborated norelus story.hankins reported back to karen amlong and expressed doubts about the case,but amlong decided to press on with the case.in her testimony at the evidentiary hearing conducted by the magistrate judge,citing her extensive experience in title vii cases,amlong explained that the absence of corroborating witness testimony was not unusual in cases of sexual harassment and assault,because such abuse often occurs outside the presence of witnesses.moreover,amlong said some of the witnesses depositions contained inconsistencies of their own suggesting that the witnesses testimony might not contain the whole story.thus,for example,amlong observed that denny manager jawaid denied ever having had any physical relationship with norelus,but some witnesses suggested jawaid and norelus might have had a consensual sexual relationship.amlong said she hoped to exploit these inconsistencies at trial to cast doubt on the witnesses veracity and draw out unrevealed facets of the story.
nevertheless,amlong testified,in order to test the veracity of the plaintiff account of rape and sexual abuse,the firm retained the services of george slattery,an experienced and respected polygraph examiner,to polygraph norelus.the first of these examinations took place in january,coinciding with norelus first deposition.karen amlong said that she wanted to conduct the examination earlier,but norelus had become pregnant,and slattery refused to administer a polygraph examination during her first trimester.the second polygraph examination took place on april.slattery unambiguously concluded,after each examination,that norelus was telling the truth about her core allegations of sexual abuse,rape,and assault.norelus also received treatment from a psychologist,astrid,who advised the amlongs that norelus appeared to suffer from stress disorder.
karen amlong testified that despite the problems with norelus testimony she remained convinced that norelus was telling the truth.amlong also observed that her ethical duties prevented her from withdrawing her representation.amlong decided to press on with the suit.accordingly,after norelus deposition,on karen amlong instructions,taylor reviewed the deposition testimony with norelus and prepared an errata sheet.taylor testified that she read the questions in english and another person translated.for reasons of cost,according to taylor,they did not use a professional one point norelus brother translated,and at another point a friend of norelus translated.taylor recorded the reasons norelus provided for each change.
the process produced an unusually long errata pages detailing a total of changes to norelus deposition testimony.some of the changes were inconsequential or even harmed norelus case.for instance,at one point in the deposition the defense attorney had shown norelus a time card that appeared to undermine her story.at that time,norelus claimed she could not confirm the time card authenticity because the card was not signed.when the defense attorney pressed the point,norelus testified that she could not recall whether she usually signed her time cards.on the errata sheet,however,norelus changed her testimony so that she admitted unequivocally that she did not always sign her time cards.other changes on the errata sheet,however,appeared to improve norelus case measurably by adding details that norelus had not provided when she was deposed.thus,for example,the testimony as reflected on the errata sheet provided details about jawaid and hameed cars and the route to their house,details that norelus had previously said she could not recall.
after receiving the errata sheet,the defendants asked the district court to dismiss the case,arguing that the extent of the changes in the errata sheet demonstrated that norelus had told numerous lies under oath.on august,the district court denied the motion,observing that,although the errata sheet raised doubts about the truth of norelus story,dismissal is only appropriate when the plaintiff lie is established beyond doubt.the trial court wrote in the instant action,it is unclear to the court at this juncture whether plaintiff original or revised version of the facts constitutes the truth.therefore,dismissal is an inappropriate remedy.the court did,however,grant the defendants alternative request that it reopen norelus deposition and order norelus to pay the costs of reopening the deposition.the district court also directed norelus to file an appendix detailing any changes made to her testimony in her errata sheet or her second deposition.
norelus second deposition spanned three days in september.her behavior was again erratic and at times inappropriate.finally,after one particularly insolent answer,the defendants attorneys adjourned the deposition.on october,at the defendants request,the district court entered another order specifying that the costs of reopening the deposition were jointly payable by norelus and her attorneys.this order made no findings of fact or conclusions of law regarding the amlongs conduct.then,on december,the district court dismissed the action as a sanction to punish norelus for her failure to comply with the august,order.specifically,the court noted,norelus had not paid the costs of reopening the deposition and had not filed the requested appendix.the plaintiff took an appeal from the order of dismissal,but this court dismissed the appeal for failure to prosecute on may.
after the dismissal of the suit,in january,four of the defendants,meos,services,denny,and jawaid,sought sanctions against norelus and the amlongs.pursuant to title,b of the,the district court referred the sanctions motions to a magistrate judge to conduct an evidentiary hearing,make findings of fact and conclusions of law,and file a report and recommendation.on february,after conducting an extensive hearing,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation.the magistrate judge recommended that the court assess attorney fees against the plaintiff,norelus,under k,which permits recovery of attorney fees from parties in civil rights actions.however,the magistrate judge squarely recommended that no sanctions,including attorney fees,be imposed on norelus attorneys.the magistrate judge made factual findings that the amlongs conduct throughout the litigation,including their filing of the errata sheet,was motivated by a legitimate desire to present their client case truthfully and accurately.he concluded that the amlongs conduct did not amount to bad faith conduct justifying sanctions under.
meos,services,denny,and jawaid objected to the magistrate judge report and recommendation and asked the district court judge to impose sanctions on the amlongs notwithstanding the magistrate judge many findings of fact.in a march,order,the district court judge sustained the objections based on her review of the hearing transcript,but notably,without having heard any testimony herself.the district court rejected the magistrate judge factual findings and legal conclusions.
the district court concluded that sanctions against the amlongs were warranted on the basis of four separate sources of judicial authority k rule g of the federal rules of civil procedure and the court inherent powers.the district court to what the magistrate judge had the amlongs had failed to adequately investigate the plaintiff claims.the district court further found that the errata sheet the amlongs filed after norelus first deposition was not designed to ensure that norelus testimony was accurate,as the magistrate judge had found,but rather was a dishonest effort to cover up weaknesses in the plaintiff case.
the district court concluded that by the time the amlongs filed the errata sheet,it had become clear that norelus suit was not grounded in fact,and continuing the lawsuit past that point amounted to bad faith.the district court ordered the amlongs to pay the costs that meos,services,denny,and jawaid had incurred in the litigation starting from the date the amlongs filed the errata sheet.the district court expressly said that the amount payable would include the fees,costs and expenses associated with the sanctions motions,evidentiary hearing and objections.in addition,because the amlongs had not yet paid the costs of reopening the plaintiff deposition as required by the district court october,order,it again directed the amlongs to pay that amount and added percent back interest as an additional sanction.
thereafter,a magistrate judge calculated attorney fees according to the district judge instructions.the district judge issued an order adopting the magistrate judge recommendations with modifications.the district court order required the amlongs to pay to cover attorney fees and costs incurred in reopening norelus deposition,as required by the court october,order.the order further imposed an additional percent interest on the amount.finally,and most significantly,the order required the amlongs personally to pay a total of to cover attorney fees and costs the defendants had incurred after the filing of the errata sheet,as required by the court march,order.this appeal followed.
we review a district court sanctions order for abuse of discretion.the same standard applies whether sanctions were imposed under any of the four provisions the district court invoked in this case.see,schwartz millon air,cir court reviews sanctions under for abuse of discretion malautea suzuki motor,cir court reviews sanctions under rule g for abuse of discretion barnes dalton,cir court reviews sanctions under inherent powers for abuse of discretion sayers stewart sleep,cir court reviews sanctions under k for abuse of discretion.
the application of an review recognizes the range of possible conclusions the trial judge may reach.united states frazier,cir en banc.w hen employing an standard,we must affirm unless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment,or has applied the wrong legal standard.id.citing maiz virani,cir.a decision that is contrary to the law plainly is an abuse of discretion.see cooter gell hartmarx,d a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law.
first,we address the largest component of the sanctions levied against the plaintiff title vii attorneys the district court march,order requiring the amlongs to pay to cover the attorney fees and costs that meos,services,denny,and jawaid incurred in defending the suit after june,the date the amlongs filed the errata sheet.
we begin with the legal standard that governs the imposition of sanctions in this case.the district court grounded its sanctions order on four broad sources of authority k rule g of the federal rules of civil procedure and the court inherent powers.when a district court cites multiple sources of authority for issuing sanctions,the appellate court basic task in reviewing the sanctions is to determine whether the sanctions were permissible under at least one of those sources of authority.see chudasama mazda motor,cir.if any one of the sources of authority invoked by the district court provides a sound basis for the sanctions,we must affirm the sanctions order.but if sanctions are not valid under any of the sources of authority,the appellate court must reverse the sanctions award.
appellants contend,and appellees do not dispute,that k and rule g clearly could not have supported the district court award of sanctions.the appellants are correct.the title vii attorney fees provision,k,could not have supported these sanctions,because the provision authorizes attorney fees only against litigants,not against counsel.roadway express,piper,d noting that k makes no mention of attorney liability for costs and fees and there is no indication that congress intended the provision to control the conduct of litigation durrett jenkins brickyard,cir section k contemplates assessments of attorney fees against losing parties,not against counsel.citing id.
rule g of the federal rules of civil procedure also could not have supported the sanctions award,because that rule only authorizes sanctions traceable to specific discovery abuses.see chudasama mazda motor,cir noting that rule g did not authorize an order requiring a defendant to pay all the costs incurred in the discovery dispute because the defendant discovery abuses were only partly to blame for the delay in the litigation.in this case,the district court issued sanctions for the amlongs decision to proceed vexatiously and in bad faith with a meritless suit,not for any specific discovery violation.
that leaves two sources of authority to consider,and the court inherent powers.we have observed that a district court authority to issue sanctions for attorney misconduct under is either broader than or equally as broad as the district court authority to issue a sanctions order under its inherent powers.see cordoba dillard,cir.therefore,we only examine whether the sanctions imposed here were a proper exercise of the discretion granted to the court under.if the sanctions were permissible under,then they were proper,and there is no need to examine whether the sanctions were also permissible under the court inherent powers.on the other hand,if the sanctions amounted to an abuse of the district court discretion under,they necessarily amounted to an abuse of the court discretion under its inherent powers,because the court inherent power to issue sanctions for vexatious conduct by attorneys does not reach further than.
title,states 
counsel liability for excessive costs 
any attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any court of the united states or any territory thereof who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs,expenses,and attorneys fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.
as a panel of this court observed in peterson bmi refractories,cir,the plain language of the statute imposes three essential requirements for an award of sanctions under 
first,the attorney must engage in unreasonable and vexatious conduct.second,that unreasonable and vexatious conduct must be conduct that multiplies the proceedings.finally,the dollar amount of the sanction must bear a financial nexus to the excess proceedings,the sanction may not exceed the costs,expenses,and attorneys fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.
we have consistently held that an attorney multiplies proceedings unreasonably and vexatiously within the meaning of the statute only when the attorney conduct is so egregious that it is tantamount to bad faith.avirgan hull,cir see also schwartz millon air,cir bad faith is the touchstone.
the amlongs argue,however,that bad faith in this context means subjective bad is,deliberate wrongdoing,such as proceeding with claims the attorney knows for a fact are false or frivolous.in other legal contexts,the term bad faith usually refers to deliberate fraud or misconduct.see black law dictionary ed defining bad faith as d ishonesty of belief or purpose united states foxman,cir interpreting references to bad faith delay in criminal prosecutions to mean situations where the government acted to delay an indictment,hoping that the delay would prejudice the defense.but it is clear from the statutory language and the case law that for purposes of,bad faith turns not on the attorney subjective intent,but on the attorney objective conduct.the term unreasonably necessarily connotes that the district court must compare the attorney conduct against the conduct of a reasonable attorney and make a judgment about whether the conduct was acceptable according to some objective standard.the term vexatiously similarly requires an evaluation of the attorney objective conduct.see christiansburg garment eeoc,d noting,in the course of interpreting k,that the term vexatious in no way implies that the plaintiff subjective bad faith is a necessary prerequisite to a fee award against him,black law dictionary ed defining vexatious as without reasonable or probable cause or excuse harassing annoying.
indeed,other circuits,too,have found that the phrase unreasonably and vexatiously demands an objective analysis and that does not require a malicious intent or a bad purpose.for example,in cruz savage,cir,the first circuit stated,the attorney need not intend to harass or annoy by his conduct nor be guilty of conscious impropriety to be sanctioned.it is enough that an attorney acts in disregard of whether his conduct constitutes harassment or vexation id.at.similarly,in knorr brake harbil,cir,the seventh circuit noted that a court need not find that the attorney acted because of malice to issue sanctions against the attorney.id.at footnote omitted.the tenth circuit in braley campbell,cir,explicitly said that the statute demands an objective analysis.id.at holding that the proper standard under is that excess costs,expenses,or attorney fees are imposable against an attorney personally for conduct that,viewed objectively,manifests either intentional or reckless disregard of the attorney duties to the court.the sixth circuit in jones continental,cir,observed that authorizes a court to assess fees against an attorney for unreasonable and vexatious multiplication of litigation despite the absence of any conscious impropriety.id.at.but see,oliveri thompson,cir holding that sanctions are appropriate under only if the attorney actions are so completely without merit as to require the conclusion that they must have been undertaken for some improper purpose.
other courts also have determined that reckless conduct is sufficient to justify sanctions under.see,estate of blas ex rel.chargualaf winkler,cir stating that sanctions under require a finding of bad faith,but a showing of either recklessness or bad faith is adequate to support such a finding manax mcnamara,cir holding that recklessness,bad faith,or improper motive can support a finding of unreasonable and vexatious conduct.these observations also prescribe an objective analysis,because reckless conduct simply means conduct that grossly deviates from reasonable conduct.see schwartz,at describing recklessness as a gross deviation from conduct that might be reasonable in the circumstances page keeton et,prosser and keeton on the law of torts ed stating that although the term recklessness seems to suggest a certain state of mind,recklessness usually can be proved only by the conduct and the circumstances,and an objective standard must of necessity in practice be applied black law dictionary ed.reckless conduct is a gross deviation from what a reasonable person would do.determining whether conduct is reckless necessarily involves comparing the conduct objectively against the conduct of a reasonable attorney.
the terminology and explanation that we have employed in the past is wholly consistent with the idea that sanctions under are measured against objective standards of conduct.in schwartz millon air,we stated that sanctions are permissible where an attorney knowingly or recklessly pursues a frivolous claim.at emphasis added.thus,objectively reckless conduct is enough to warrant sanctions even if the attorney does not act knowingly and malevolently.in malautea suzuki motor,cir,we found that an attorney conduct was tantamount to bad faith when he either carelessly or deliberately covered up evidence.id.at.
in short,a district court may impose sanctions for egregious conduct by an attorney even if the attorney acted without the specific purpose or intent to multiply the proceedings.that is not to say the attorney purpose or intent is irrelevant.although the attorney objective conduct is the focus of the analysis,the attorney subjective state of mind is frequently an important piece of the calculus,because a given act is more likely to fall outside the bounds of acceptable conduct and therefore be unreasonabl e and vexatious if it is done with a malicious purpose or intent 
it is also,by now,clear that negligent conduct,standing alone,will not support a finding of bad faith under is,an attorney conduct will not warrant sanctions if it simply fails to meet the standard of conduct expected from a reasonable attorney.thus,in schwartz,we wrote 
section is not a provision for sanctioning objectionable conduct by counsel for sanctions under section to be appropriate,something more than a lack of merit is required.the statute was designed to sanction attorneys who willfully abuse the judicial process by conduct tantamount to bad faith.
bad faith is the touchstone.section is not about mere negligence.a determination of bad faith is warranted where an attorney knowingly or recklessly pursues a frivolous claim or engages in litigation tactics that needlessly obstruct the litigation of claims.
schwartz,at.
thus,an attorney conduct must be particularly egregious to warrant the imposition of attorney must knowingly or recklessly pursue a frivolous claim or needlessly obstruct the litigation of a claim.if the attorney misconduct meets this high standard,the district court may order the attorney to pay the costs,expenses,and attorneys fees reasonably incurred because of the attorney is,the excess costs that the attorney multiplication of proceedings has added to the cost of the litigation.see peterson bmi refractories,cir explaining that sanctions under must bear a financial nexus to the excess proceedings.
with this background,we turn to the district court decision to impose sanctions and the procedures it employed in making its determination.
plainly,an attorney threatened with sanctions under is entitled to a hearing.reynolds roberts,cir.in this case,the district court designated a magistrate judge to conduct the necessary evidentiary hearing pursuant to b,which permits a district court to refer matters to a magistrate judge to hold hearings and supply the court with proposed findings of fact and recommendations for disposition pursuant to this order of reference,the magistrate judge conducted an evidentiary hearing over four days involving the testimony of six witnesses,including four of the plaintiff attorneys,who each testified at length about their conduct of the suit,and george slattery,the polygrapher who twice examined the plaintiff.when reduced to transcript form,the evidentiary hearing consumed some pages.
after hearing the evidence and receiving filings from the parties,as we have noted,the magistrate judge submitted a detailed report and recommendation including extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law.based on the testimony at the evidentiary hearing,the magistrate judge made several findings of fact regarding the amlongs conduct.first,the magistrate judge unambiguously found as a fact that throughout the litigation,the amlongs had genuinely believed that plaintiff claims were meritorious despite plaintiff inability to testify completely and truthfully about several aspects of her case.second,the magistrate judge found that karen amlong,an experienced title vii attorney,personally met with plaintiff on more than one occasion and satisfied herself that plaintiff was telling the truth emphasis added.he accepted amlong explanation that she was not surprised or particularly concerned that the sexual harassment activities alleged in this case were not observed by others because they seldom are in this type of case.third,the magistrate judge found as a fact that p laintiff counsel also did not ignore plaintiff propensity to exaggerate or lie during her deposition,noting that the plaintiffs ordered two polygraph examinations by george slattery,a certified polygraph examiner,in order to further test the plaintiff veracity.
the magistrate judge then made a number of explicit findings of fact relating to the errata sheet,which,the defendants claimed,made the attorneys bad faith readily apparent.he wrote 
first,the preparation of the errata sheet and the procedures used to do so was improper and should not have occurred.second,the numerous changes listed in the errata sheet illuminated plaintiff difficulty or inability to relate a consistent account of events underlying her claims.third,the errata sheet revealed to defendant attorneys and the court that plaintiff testimony was highly suspicious and required further exploration through reopened discovery.
however,the preparation of the errata sheet revealed other things.first and foremost,the care and detail in which that document was prepared by plaintiff attorneys reveal their grave concern to tell an accurate story in this case.while many of the changes might have bolstered plaintiff case,submission of this voluminous document clearly did not,and left plaintiff open to renewed challenges concerning her credibility.also,the errata sheet demonstrates,at least in part,the difficulty plaintiff had in dealing with the discovery process including her deposition.
emphasis added.
the magistrate judge also determined that the amlongs should not be faulted for the plaintiff conduct,because they did the best they could with a most difficult client and did not try to prolong the case or multiply these proceeding s to gain a tactical advantage over their adversaries.prolonging this case,by extending plaintiff deposition and exposing plaintiff to further,only hindered counsel ability to win the case.
overall,the magistrate judge concluded that the amlongs acted for good and honest reasons,and that their conduct did not amount to bad faith under an objective test.he found expressly that the amlongs conduct did not demonstrate either subjective bad faith or objective bad faith.he stated,the undersigned finds no evidence of bad faith,improper motive or reckless disregard of duty which would justify sanctions against plaintiff attorneys in this case.nor does the undersigned find that plaintiff counsel sought to or willfully abused the judicial process by conduct tantamount to bad faith citations omitted.
the district court flatly rejected the magistrate judge findings,saying they were contrary to the record.the district judge then went on to make factual findings of her own,notably without any additional hearing,but based on her own independent interpretation of the transcript and record.the district court found that the errata sheet would have put any reasonable attorney on notice that the plaintiff testimony may be incred ible,and from the time they filed the errata sheet,counsel for plaintiff were on notice of the baseless nature of the claims and had an obligation to investigate their client testimony and the supporting evidence.the district court found that karen amlong and william amlong were chiefly responsible for the conduct of the case.the district court further found that the amlongs failed to conduct a reasonable investigation of the facts alleged in the plaintiff complaint and her subsequent amended complaints.the district court judge called attention to the fact that the amlongs had not interviewed fact witnesses other than the plaintiff and had not ordered transcripts from the depositions of the other witnesses finally,and most significantly for our purposes,the district court found that the amlongs filed the errata sheet with the court not for the legitimate purpose of correcting misstatements and inaccuracies,as the magistrate judge had found,but in an effort to cover up flaws and inconsistencies in the plaintiff account of events.the district court determined that the errata sheet demonstrated unreasonable,vexatious behavior that unnecessarily multiplied these proceedings.
the district court rejection of the magistrate judge findings in this manner violated the governing statute,b,as it has been interpreted by our case law.when a district court refers a matter to a magistrate judge to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact,the district court is required to make a de novo determination.id.in making its determination,the district court is generally free to employ the magistrate judge findings to the extent that it sees court may adopt the magistrate judge findings in whole,in part,or not at all.thus,in united states raddatz,d,the supreme court made clear that b permits the district court to adopt the credibility findings made by a magistrate judge without conducting a new hearing before making a final determination.however,in a footnote,the supreme court remarked that there may be one exception to this rule.the statute may not permit a district court to reject a magistrate judge findings regarding the credibility of testifying witnesses without holding a new hearing where it could observe the demeanor of the witnesses 
w e assume it is unlikely that a district judge would reject a magistrate proposed findings on credibility when those findings are dispositive and substitute the judge own appraisal to do so without seeing and hearing the witness or witnesses whose credibility is in question could well give rise to serious questions which we do not reach.
our cases since raddatz have unambiguously and repeatedly observed that a district court may not reject a magistrate judge factual and credibility findings in this manner.in united states marshall,cir,the former fifth stated,i t would be a rare case in which a district judge could resolve credibility choices contrary to the recommendations of the magistrate without himself having had an opportunity to see and hear the witnesses testify.id.at.again,in louis blackburn,cir,a panel of the former fifth circuit held that when a criminal defendant constitutional rights are at stake,the district judge should not enter an order inconsistent with the credibility choices made by the magistrate without personally hearing the live testimony of the witnesses whose testimony is determinative.id.at emphasis added.the former fifth circuit extended this principle to civil cases in calderon waco lighthouse for the blind,cir.in calderon,a panel of the court said that in some cases a district court might be able to reject a magistrate judge findings based on a transcript alone,but,notably,if the witnesses demeanor was important to the magistrate judge determination,the district court would have to hold a new evidentiary hearing and take testimony before rejecting the magistrate judge findings.id.most recently,in united states cofield,cir per curiam,relying in part on marshall and blackburn,we reaffirmed the principle that generally a district court must rehear the disputed testimony before rejecting a magistrate judge credibility determinations.cofield,at.
the district court order in this case flatly violated the rule.the magistrate judge made clear that his findings turned on his evaluation of the credibility and believability of the testimony given at the evidentiary hearing indeed,he stated that his findings were based on hearing the testimony from plaintiff counsel concerning their representation of plaintiff in this case.the magistrate judge evaluation required him to make finely tuned assessments of various witnesses credibility as they testified about their states of mind,beliefs,motivations,and actions at each critical stage of the litigation.it is clear that the witnesses demeanor and credibility at the evidentiary hearing played a critical role in the magistrate judge findings about the amlongs purpose and intent and his conclusion regarding their objective conduct.the demeanor of the witnesses at the evidentiary hearing plainly influenced the magistrate judge determinations about whether the amlongs and the plaintiff other attorneys arranged the polygraph examinations as a stratagem for creating a facade of diligence or,rather,as a genuine effort to discern whether the plaintiff was telling the truth.
the amlongs retained george slattery,the polygraph examiner,who testified that he had performed evaluations in a wide range of cases for an impressive range of law firms,judges,prosecutor offices,defense attorneys,and public defender agencies at both the state and federal levels,as well as state and federal law enforcement agencies.slattery insisted that when he performs services for attorneys involved in civil litigation,his results are not swayed by what the attorneys hope to see.he added that he had evaluated other amlong clients in the past and had reported his conclusions to the amlongs even when he suspected falsehoods.
three of the plaintiff attorneys,debra valladares,joseph chambrot,and karen amlong,also testified at length about the polygraph examination.chambrot,for example,testified that the reason the plaintiff lawyers agreed to have norelus polygraphed was t o avoid being here in sanctions proceedings.to know that we have,you know,a valid cause of action.to avoid misrepresenting to the court or having,you know,the bulk of the case just being a lie.chambrot said he trusted in slattery determination because slattery was somebody who i believe,you know,is really credible and who truly independent.slattery does care one way or the other the outcome of this case.plainly,the magistrate judge credited this too in finding no bad faith.
witness testimony from the plaintiff lawyers also was crucial to the magistrate judge evaluation of several other key aspects of the case.lisa stern taylor,the amlong associate who had the most direct contact with the plaintiff,testified about the instructions she received from the amlongs and the procedures she followed in preparing the errata sheet that the district court later found to be the most salient and concrete indicium of the amlongs bad faith.taylor demeanor in testifying influenced the magistrate judge acceptance of taylor explanation of her actions.thus,taylor testified expressly that the errata sheet was intended to present the facts accurately,and not to put a false or misleading sheen on the plaintiff story 
q william amlong okay.what instructions,if any,had you been given by amlong me concerning the preparation of the errata sheet 
a just by amlong to please go to the court reporter office with norrelus sic and have her go through the deposition and to prepare an errata sheet and to make sure that every time there was a change that i listed a reason for it because that what the rules required,i believe.
q when you changed the testimony,at whose suggestion did you change the testimony 
a any testimony that i changed was made because my client told me that whatever she was telling me was the accurate response.
taylor emphatically stated that she had not suggested any changes norelus should make in her testimony,and had not seen any indication that norelus brother or friend had suggested any such changes.
karen amlong testimony also strongly influenced the magistrate judge findings.amlong described the firm handling of the lawsuit in detail from start to finish.amlong stressed that her assessment of norelus veracity was consistent with the conclusions reached by four other attorneys,william amlong,valladares,chambrot,and taylor the polygrapher,slattery and astrid,the psychologist who examined norelus and diagnosed her with stress disorder.amlong said her assessment of the plaintiff also relied in no small part on her own interactions with norelus,and her many years of experience litigating cases of serious sexual harassment.
karen amlong explained how the firm handled norelus false statements about the plaintiff fraudulent use of her relative name and identification this way 
karen amlong we were concerned,however,because there were some issues of norrelus using the social security number of her aunt,there were some inconsistencies that had come out in the testimony during these depositions and stern had called us when she realized that norrelus had lied,and i believe it was about using her aunt social security number or her name,the alias.
she taylor had called us from the depositions and we said,you have got to go in there and set the record straight.
after our conversation with hankins about these other depositions 
q william amlong when you told stern to go in and set the record straight,is that your understanding of the florida bar rules of professional responsibility and what they require as candor toward the tribunal 
a yes,it is,and when stern realized that she had stated a mistruth she had no option except to go back in and set the record straight.
we were concerned,nonetheless,about what may have been a cultural difference is it okay to just use somebody else name or social security number 
so we called ira kurzban,who has an attorney in town who has worked extensively with haitian clients 
based on our conversation with kurzban,we were convinced that our client,based on all the own assessment of her,her passing the polygraph examination,stern assessment of her after several days of deposition even though she may have lacked candor on peripheral issues,on the central issues of this case she was telling the truth,and just because somebody came into the country illegally does mean that she can be raped and exploited,and that does not take that away from her.

the language and cultural difficulties amlong alluded to in this exchange also were a recurring problem throughout the litigation,according to the attorneys testimony.the plaintiff lawyers testified that norelus spoke only fragmentary english,although her english improved during the course of the litigation.taylor testified that on several occasions during the deposition,norelus told the interpreter her translations were incorrect,until at one point the interpreter responded with a brusque remark.once,the plaintiff apparently used a creole idiom,tous les jours,to communicate that jawaid forced her to perform oral sex many times or all the time,but the interpreter translated the idiom literally as every day,thus changing the details of the plaintiff story.even the defendants adverted to language an apparent effort to discount the import of the polygraph examinations,they elicited testimony from a translator who suggested that slattery,the polygraph examiner,had used flawed creole translations.amlong testified that throughout the litigation,norelus proved a difficult client because of language barriers and because of the degree to which she had been traumatized,but norelus behavior in the reopened deposition improved as norelus english improved,she became more comfortable with the process,and the defense attorneys became less aggressive.the magistrate judge was plainly troubled by the reported language and cultural difficulties.indeed,he found that the errata sheet showed the difficulty plaintiff had in dealing with the discovery process including her deposition.
as for the production of the errata sheet,amlong specifically said,t he idea was not to hide things from people,but to make full disclosure,and we were trying to hide anything from defense counsel,we were trying to tell them what the story was so that they could prepare themselves.she said,this was our way of attempting to set the record straight.from a tactical perspective,amlong added,it would have been easier to proceed to trial without filing the errata sheet,but i felt that filing the errata sheet was the appropriate thing to do w e were trying to do the best job we could to present as honestly as we could what the truth was.
in short,the magistrate judge was called on to find basic facts and draw delicate inferences about the judgments the amlongs made,and the actions they took based on those judgments,at various stages of the litigation.his evaluation was undeniably influenced by the extensive testimony taken at the evidentiary hearing over four days in.indeed,the raw transcript of the hearing could not have captured the nuances of the testimony or the demeanor of the witnesses in a way that would have fairly allowed the district court to make a reliable determination that the magistrate judge was wrong in finding facts and choosing to believe the witnesses.
more particularly,the magistrate judge chose to believe slattery and the attorneys representations that the polygraph examinations were a genuine effort to discern the truth,not a fraudulent attempt to create a false veneer of diligence.the magistrate judge chose to credit the attorneys statements that they had believed the plaintiff core allegations throughout the litigation.he interpreted the filing of the errata sheet as having been motivated by the plaintiff lawyers grave concern to tell an accurate story,just as amlong and taylor had stated in their testimony.the attorneys testifying at the evidentiary hearing attributed some of the apparent irregularities in the litigation to the plaintiff emotional instability and substantial language and cultural barriers.the magistrate judge accepted this testimony,finding that the amlongs did the best they could with a most difficult client and did not try to prolong the case or multiply these proceeding s to gain a tactical advantage.
the district court judge unequivocally rejected the magistrate judge factual findings and conclusions of law regarding both the amlongs subjective intent and their objective conduct.after directly quoting the magistrate judge conclusions,the district court stated,the court finds these conclusions to be based on an incorrect standard,incorrect interpretation of law,and not based on the record emphasis added.the district court never explained how it thought the magistrate judge had misstated or misapplied the law,but the statement that the magistrate judge conclusions were not based on the record clearly indicated that it was discarding his factual findings,including his critical credibility determinations,along with his legal conclusions.to find that the magistrate judge findings were not based on the record was to say that the testimony told a completely different story.
later in her order,the district court judge specifically found as a fact that an improper purpose lay behind the amlongs production of the errata sheet.whereas the magistrate judge had concluded that the amlongs had submitted the errata sheet for the legitimate purpose of advancing the truth,the district court saw the evidence another way 
plaintiff counsel undertook efforts to repair the damage plaintiff deposition caused,and filed the errata sheet in an effort to bolster testimony in contrast to karen amlong testimony,the court close examination of the errata changes indicates a concerted effort to provide factual support to an otherwise meritless case coupled with the complete lack of supporting evidence in this case,the nature and quantity of entries on the errata bolstered inconsistencies or covered up falsities,and thereafter the plaintiff inability to factually support the errata changes at the subsequent bad faith and willful disregard for the judicial process by karen amlong,william amlong,and amlong amlong 
this language was nothing less than a direct repudiation of the testimony that amlong and her former colleague,lisa stern taylor,gave at the evidentiary hearing,and,more importantly,the magistrate judge abiding belief in the veracity of that testimony.while the magistrate judge was convinced,based on his hearing of the testimony,that the amlongs prepared the errata sheet to cleanse the record of contamination and error and bring the court closer to the truth,the district court judge,who had not heard a single word of the testimony,concluded that the amlongs were trying to breathe new life into a dead case for fraudulent or malevolent reasons.the district judge could not have interpreted the errata sheet as a way to repair the damage,bolster testimony,and cover up falsities without necessarily rejecting karen amlong statement and,notably,the magistrate judge finding that the amlongs only wanted to set the record straight and present a truthful record.quite simply,the two factual interpretations are impossible to reconcile in any practical one sees diligence and fair play,the other sees underhanded scheming and malevolence.the district judge analysis necessarily and expressly rejected the magistrate judge credibility findings 
in a subsequent order denying the amlongs motion for reconsideration of the sanctions imposed,the district court again confirmed that it could make its own factual determinations based on the hearing transcript without taking the magistrate judge findings into account at all.norelus denny,slip op.at.june,order denying reconsideration.the district court made no mention of adopting the magistrate judge credibility findings.indeed,the district court expressly rejected the amlongs argument that the court could not make factual findings contrary to those of the magistrate judge unless the court first held an evidentiary hearing.the court cited raddatz for the proposition that the governing statute,b,generally allows a district court to make its own findings without a hearing.while this was a correct statement of the general rule,the district court failed to take note of our precedents establishing an important exception to the rule a district court may not override essential,fact finding by a magistrate judge without hearing the evidence itself or citing an exceptional justification for discarding the magistrate judge findings.
rejecting credibility findings made by a magistrate judge without holding a new hearing is permissible only when there is an articulable basis for rejecting the magistrate original resolution of credibility.marshall,at.the district court in this case did not cite any such articulable basis,nor is any such justification otherwise evident in this record.a determination of a lawyer bad faith is particularly sensitive to demeanor and other intangible cues often not reflected in a transcript.
discarding the magistrate judge credibility findings without rehearing the relevant testimony amounted to an impermissible shortcut that rendered the result invalid and an abuse of discretion.cooter gell hartmarx,d a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law.whether the amlongs objective conduct amounted to bad faith was a mixed question of law and fact.the amlongs intent and purpose at each stage of the litigation was a major factor in evaluating their conduct objectively.the district court judge factual determination that the amlongs had either intentionally avoided learning the truth or had intentionally prolonged the proceedings was an integral part of her determination that the amlongs objective conduct reached the level of bad faith.
we are,therefore,constrained to reverse the district court march,order to the extent that it required the amlongs to pay the costs the defendants incurred because of the continuation of litigation past june.on remand,the district court need not conduct a new hearing.it may accept the magistrate judge basic findings of fact and then reach its own determination as to whether the lawyers conduct was objectively unreasonable and vexatious.alternatively,the district court may,it it so chooses,conduct its own hearing as a prelude to making a new determination.our holding is simply this the district court abused its discretion and clearly erred when it squarely rejected the magistrate judge findings of fact and credibility determinations and substituted its own,without hearing so much as a single witness at a sanctions hearing.we do not mean to imply that it would have been an abuse of discretion for the district court to have imposed sanctions even in the absence of subjective bad faith.that issue is simply not before us today.
the second component of the sanctions the district court imposed on the amlongs was an order to pay in fees and costs incurred in reopening norelus deposition.the amlongs argue that the district court acted improperly in imposing this sanction as well.
the district court initially imposed this sanction on norelus alone in its august,order,under the court inherent powers.the district court then made the amlongs jointly and severally liable for this sanction in an october,order clarifying its earlier order.in its march,order,the district court found that the plaintiff and the amlongs had failed to pay fees and costs for reopening the deposition.the court again ordered the amlongs to pay those fees and costs and ordered the amlongs to pay percent back interest as an additional sanction for the amlongs failure to pay the costs earlier.
the supreme court has stated that b ecause of their very potency,inherent powers must be exercised with restraint and discretion.chambers nasco,d.with this in mind,we have held that before a court can impose sanctions on an attorney under its inherent powers,it must make a finding of bad faith.thomas tenneco packaging,cir b efore a court can impose sanctions against a lawyer under its inherent power,it must find that the lawyer conduct constituted or was tantamount to bad faith.quoting durrett jenkins brickyard,cir in re mroz,cir see also roadway express,piper,d noting that a specific finding as to whether counsel conduct in this case constituted or was tantamount to bad faith would have to precede any sanction under the court inherent powers.
the district court did not make any valid finding of bad faith that could have supported this component of the sanctions.the district court did not make a finding of bad faith conduct by the amlongs either in its august,order requiring norelus to pay the fees and costs associated with reopening the deposition,or in its october,order making the amlongs jointly and severally liable for the costs.
the march,order also did not render the sanctions valid.as we have already explained,in concluding in its march,order that the amlongs conduct amounted to bad faith for purposes of,the district court improperly discarded the findings of fact made by the magistrate judge and substituted its own.as we also explained,the threshold of bad faith conduct for purposes of sanctions under the court inherent powers is at least as high as the threshold of bad faith conduct for sanctions under.see cordoba dillard,cir.so sanctions that are impermissible under are also impermissible under a district court inherent powers.we are,therefore,also constrained to find that neither the august,order originally imposing the sanctions,the october,order making the sanctions jointly payable by the amlongs,or the march,order repeating the sanctions order contained a valid imposition of sanctions under the court inherent powers.accordingly,we reverse the portion of the march,order that required the amlongs to pay the costs of reopening the deposition.
the final remaining component of the challenged sanctions is the district court order requiring the amlongs to pay percent back interest on the amount.the court imposed this as an additional sanction on the amlongs for having failed to comply with the october,order.however,the district court never determined that the amlongs had failed to comply with the october,order in bad faith.accordingly,the order to pay back interest also was necessarily an abuse of discretion and must be reversed.
reversed and remanded.
in view of the majority amendment of the panel opinion,i strike the introductory paragraph of the original dissent,substitute the following,and leave the remainder unchanged.
the panel amended opinion appears to me to be designed to limit its holding to the narrow proposition,already the law in this circuit,that a district judge may not reject a magistrate judge credibility findings without a hearing.the reaffirmation of this proposition is,in the revised opinion,now totally divorced from the facts of this case,from the legal standards applicable to section sanctions,and from the vailditly vel non of the district court holding that the amlongs conduct was sanctionable.surely,we have not labored so long for so little.
the narrowing of the majority holding by the revised opinion does,however,in my view,clearly illuminate the error inherent in the remand it is not required.it is now clear that all concerned agree on the facts concerning the amlongs conduct of this case.all further agree that the correct legal standard to be applied in this case is an objective one.finally,all agree that the issue that must be resolved in this case is whether it was objectively reasonable for the amlongs to have conducted this case in the manner in which they did.
this is what the magistrate judge initially did.he found the underlying claim to have been patently frivolous and the amlongs actions in pursuit of the claim to have grossly transgressed our rules governing the conduct of litigation.he went on,however,to adopt this erroneous view that a lack of subjective bad faith on the part of counsel could immunize their objectively bad conduct from sanctions.
this is not the law in our circuit and the district court quite rightly refused to adopt this conclusion.she held that,having found the conduct to be objectively unreasonable,it was within her discretion to sanction the amlongs,and she did.
no one now suggests that it was not within her authority to do so.the majority revision makes clear that the district court would not abuse her discretion on remand should she reimpose sanctions without any finding whatsoever as to the amlongs subjective good or bad faith.in this circuit,the statute permits the district court to impose sanctions without considering counsel subjective state of mind.
it is error,then,to hold that remand is required because the district judge may have we do not know since she made no finding on the issue disagreed with the magistrate judge on the issue of the amlongs subjective good faith in the conduct of the case.how can such a remand be required when all now agree that this issue is not necessary to the resolution of this case.
i continue to dissent,respectfully,to the vacation of the district court order and remand.i should affirm.
the district judge in this case sanctioned the plaintiff attorneys,karen and william amlong and their law firm,under,for their unreasonable and vexatious pursuit of their client patently frivolous claim.for the past ten years,the parties have litigated the award of these sanctions.
the magistrate judge conducted an extensive evidentiary hearing on defendants motions for sanctions over the course of four days,producing a evidentiary record and a report and recommendation.the district court conducted its own de novo review of the motions and issued a page order awarding sanctions.the amlongs moved for reconsideration,to which the defendants were forced to respond,and the district court issued another order reaffirming the award.
subsequently,the matter was referred to a different magistrate to determine the amount of the award.after still more evidentiary hearings,the magistrate issued his report and recommendation on the amount of sanctions to be awarded.the amlongs objected.after another de novo review,the district court entered a monetary judgment.the amlongs appealed.
as the amlongs concede,from to the time this appeal was filed,the only issue before the lower court was resolution of two motions for sanctions against counsel representing the plaintiff.despite these ten years of litigation on the sole issue of sanctions,and the enormous amount of judicial resources that the judges of the southern district of florida have already invested in deciding this issue,the majority today announces that the job is not done.
the majority instructs the district court that it abused its discretion by not having yet another evidentiary hearing,this time to listen to karen amlong testify to her good intentions in the conduct of this litigation.since the law of this circuit does not permit the district court to consider her subjective good intentions in deciding the issue of sanctions,i respectfully dissent from the holding that the district court erred in not hearing the testimony.
even more importantly from an institutional point of view,our holding today will revise the binding law of this circuit to substitute a subjective test for the objective one that we now apply in deciding whether counsel conduct may be sanctioned under section.this substitution will eviscerate the ability of our district courts to sanction exactly the sort of conduct that the district court in this case found to be a reckless abuse of the judicial process.since a panel of this court may not undertake such a revision,i can not join the opinion.
although the facts are recited in the majority opinion,there are some substantive omissions that i believe must be included,so i begin with the underlying action.
a.the underlying action 
floride norelus,a citizen of haiti,illegally entered the united states in.in june of,using her cousin name,lavictore remy,and social security number,norelus was hired to work at a denny restaurant as a dishwasher she claims that shortly thereafter asif jawaid,the manager of the restaurant,and his roommate raheel hameed began to sexually assault her,both at the restaurant and at jawaid home.she quit her job in may of.
she reported the alleged assaults to both the owners of the restaurant and the police.the owners of the restaurant conducted a prompt remedial investigation,finding her charges baseless the police also conducted an investigation,but,as the amlongs concede in their brief,found inconsistencies and conflicts in norelus allegations,resulting in the state attorney refusal to prosecute.
in december of,norelus filed suit against jawaid,hameed and the various corporate defendants.her complaint alleged,inter alia,that she was raped with a hairbrush,repeatedly forced to have oral,vaginal and anal intercourse in the restaurant,and kidnapped and taken to jawaid and hameed home where she was restrained and repeatedly raped by both of them.the district court characterized the complaint allegations as extraordinarily lewd,lascivious,and sexually graphic.
joseph chambrot signed this original complaint chambrot later testified that he made no inquiry into norelus factual allegations that he included in the complaint,relying rather on his conclusion that norelus looked like a victim,and that she appeared afraid and looked like someone who had been raped.
norelus original complaint was replaced with an amended complaint in july of,and a second amended complaint in february of.both of these complaints were signed by karen amlong amlong later testified that neither she nor anyone else at her firm interviewed a single fact witness prior to the filing of the amended complaints.
as discovery progressed,the defense lawyers took the depositions of thirteen people norelus identified in her sworn interrogatory responses as having witnessed the sexual attacks.the amlongs concede in their brief on appeal that,after these depositions,it was clear that there was not one witness who would collaborate sic her charges of sexual abuse.the defense attorney,who deposed these witnesses,testified that the depositions revealed that 
none of these witnesses ever saw jawaid touch the plaintiff in a sexual way,they never heard any sexual comments,they never saw him follow her into the men room,where she claimed she was allegedly forced to perform oral sex,and,significantly,she never complained about juad sic to any of these people.
amlong later told the district court that neither she nor anyone in her firm ordered a copy of or read a single one of these deposition transcripts prior to the sanctions hearing.amlong explained that it was her frequent practice not to interview fact witnesses,even those testifying for her client,prior to trial because they usually lied.
after the witnesses depositions,norelus herself was deposed in august of,and thereafter over the course of several days in january and february of.during the deposition,norelus insisted that her two brothers serve as translators.throughout the deposition,the brothers would interpret the meaning of questions as well as the actual question,and simultaneously confer with norelus counsel.
from the outset,norelus testimony and conduct during the deposition called into question the validity of her claims.she not only forgot key details alleged in her complaints but provided several inconsistent versions of events,and even outright falsehoods.for example,in august of,when asked about the name lavictore remy,the name she used in applying to denny,she stated that she made up that name and did not know anyone by that name.she repeated this statement at the continuation of her deposition in january.again,she specifically denied having any relative or cousin by that name.shortly after this exchange,she became belligerent and agitated,and her counsel an amlong associate requested a break so that norelus could calm down.upon returning from the break,norelus counsel admitted that norelus did have a cousin named lavictore remy.when norelus was asked why she had lied,she responded what wrong with that 
even more disturbing,norelus deposition testimony directly contradicted many of the allegations in her own complaint,including allegations of oral,vaginal,and anal intercourse in a freezer deposition testimony that no sex occurred in cooler or freezer allegations of sexual intercourse inside the meos restaurant deposition testimony that no sexual intercourse occurred in that restaurant allegations that the managers retaliated against norelus after she complained to the meos owners about sexual harassment deposition testimony that no retaliation occurred because she did not complain until after her resignation and allegations of required medical treatment for the hairbrush rape inability in deposition to provide the name of health care facility where treatment occurred 
instead of providing support for her claims,norelus deposition testimony further undermined her credibility by expanding her list of unsubstantiated allegations,including that she was forced to have oral sex with jawaid every day she worked at the restaurant between june of and may of,and that she had slept with over men.the district court later noted that norelus testimony was so replete with falsities,misrepresentations and contradictions that no reasonable person could have believed the allegations.
apparently,norelus counsel were concerned as well,because they had her polygraphed,during her deposition,and again afterward.
in june of,three weeks before trial was to commence,the amlongs served an errata sheet on all defendants.this sheet was pages long,and,as the majority concedes,undertook to make corrections to norelus sworn deposition testimony.it explained these changes as the result of her failure to understand what was being asked or poor translations by the interpreter her brothers 
many corrections,however,were not mere scrivener or translation errors.rather,these changes involved the substantive replacement of one sworn answer with an entirely different answer.many of these changes,explained as clarification of response,supplied material details that norelus was totally unable to remember at her deposition.
for example,norelus complaint alleges that hameed kidnapped her and took her by car to his house,where she was restrained and repeatedly raped by both hameed and jawaid.at her deposition,she was asked numerous times but could neither describe the car,nor the route that hameed took when driving to the house.in the errata sheet,however,norelus answer was changed and great detail was provided about both the car and the exact route that hameed took to his house.this new information included many street names and precise ordinal directions for the route.in addition,her deposition testimony regarding an assault by jawaid was almost completely changed to provide much greater factual detail.her testimony that she could not remember the color or material of the hairbrush used to sodomize her,was replaced in the errata sheet with the to medium the.see errata sheet excerpt,norelus,wl,at,attached hereto as appendix 
other corrections the errata sheet sought to make to norelus deposition testimony were the exact opposite of her previously sworn testimony,changing wrong answers to correct answers that were consistent with the allegations of her complaint.her deposition answer no to the question whether she was ever forced to have anal sex,was changed in the errata sheet to yes,as alleged in her complaint.her deposition testimony that she did not remember anything that she told the police about the assaults was replaced in the errata sheet with a recollection that she told the police that the managers sexually assaulted her.id.
after receiving the errata sheet,defendants moved to dismiss the case,arguing that it constituted an attempt to work a fraud on the court.the district court denied the motions,but,due to the obvious inconsistencies and highly suspicious nature of the errata sheet,ordered norelus to resubmit to deposition.
in september of,at the reopened deposition,norelus again had no recollection of the facts the errata sheet had sought to make part of her deposition testimony.in addition,it became clear that some of the language in her new sworn testimony was not even hers at all,because she was unable to explain the meaning of certain words in her changed answers norelus admitted that she had lied in her original sworn testimony,but was again unable or unwilling to testify consistently or provide any credible factual support for her claims 
the district court ordered norelus the amlongs to pay the fees and costs associated with the reopened deposition,and to file an appendix identifying the original testimony,the changes contained in the errata sheet,and detailed explanations for the changes.neither norelus nor the amlongs ever complied with either aspect of the district court order,and,in december of,the court dismissed the case 
b.the sanctions motions 
after the case was dismissed,the defendants moved,under and the inherent power of the court,for the award of sanctions against norelus and the amlongs.section codifies the bad faith exception to the american rule that litigants pay their own fees and costs.roadway express,piper,d avirgan hull,cir.it permits the district court to sanction counsel for the bad faith pursuit of meritless claims.schwartz millon air,cir.such sanctions are especially appropriate where counsel takes frivolous legal positions supported by scandalous accusations.blair shenandoah women center,cir.
defendants motions for sanctions contended that the amlongs conducted this litigation in bad faith by failing to investigate norelus allegations prior to filing any of the complaints,but especially after her deposition revealed her inability to credibly support her own claims ignoring record evidence demonstrating that her claims were meritless and filing an improper errata sheet in order to unreasonably and vexatiously prolong this litigation.
in january of,defendants motions were referred to the magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.karen amlong testified at the hearing to her conduct of the case,her belief in her client and her good intentions in the pursuit of norelus claim.
in february of,the magistrate filed his report and recommendation.he found that norelus claim was frivolous because it was unreasonable and without factual foundation,and always lacked credible evidence,or any evidence other than plaintiff own unreliable recollections.in support of his recommendation that attorney fees and costs be awarded against her,he specifically found that 
here,plaintiff presented only her own changing testimony,without corroboration or support from any other witnesses or sources,which was totally or nearly totally discredited by plaintiff numerous lapses of memory,outright lies,outlandish comments made during her deposition 
with respect to the amlongs,the magistrate found that 
plaintiff counsel accepted and believed norelus allegations based almost exclusively on plaintiff own recollections and initial corroboration from plaintiff brother and a third person,and proceeded to file this lawsuit on that basis almost immediately thereafter,plaintiff allegations began to appear questionable,even to plaintiff attorneys,due to plaintiff several falsehoods during her deposition regarding her name,social security number and other seemingly insignificantly sic matters.more importantly,plaintiff listed witnesses,including her own family members,friends,and coworkers at denny,all testified contrary to plaintiff version of the facts so that plaintiff was soon left with only her own testimony to support her claims.
the magistrate rejected the idea that the polygraph examinations excused the continued prosecution of the case,finding that plaintiff claims were not strengthened in any manner by the polygraph examinations she passed which seemed only to demonstrate her own attorneys lack of trust in the allegations of the client.
the magistrate further found that the preparation of the errata sheet and the procedures used to do so,translation by plaintiff brothers and possible explanations of questions by plaintiff counsel was improper and should have not occurred.furthermore,the numerous changes listed in the errata sheet only illuminated plaintiff difficulty or inability to relate a consistent account of events underlying her claims.
ultimately,however,the magistrate recommended against sanctions for the amlongs.he concluded that their decision to press on with the litigation despite warnings from defendants counsel that the case lacked merit and might result in sanctions was because they genuinely believed that plaintiff claims were meritorious despite plaintiff inability to testify completely and truthfully about several aspects of her case.after hearing karen amlong testify to her good intentions in the conduct of this case,the magistrate concluded that he could find no bad faith,improper motive or reckless disregard of duty that would justify sanctions 
sanctions by the district court 
after its de novo review,the district court held that the magistrate findings of frivolity,lack of investigation,lack of corroborating evidence,and presence of contradictory evidence all militated in favor of the award of sanctions against the amlongs,and that the magistrate recommendation to the contrary was based on an incorrect standard,incorrect interpretation of law,and not based on the record.
the magistrate applied an erroneous legal standard to the amlongs conduct by permitting karen amlong subjective good intentions to trump what he had already found to be her objectively improper conduct.the correct standard for the imposition of sanctions in this circuit,the district court held,is an objective one which evaluates counsel conduct,not her subjective state of mind.
furthermore,the district court held,the magistrate findings should have led him to the conclusion that the amlongs improper conduct was reckless.the magistrate conclusion to the contrary was not,the district court held,consistent with or based upon the record as the magistrate himself had already found it to be.
to demonstrate this,the district court catalogued the magistrate findings of fact regarding the amlongs conduct as outlined in his report and recommendation 
norelus claim was frivolous because it always lacked credible evidence,or any evidence other than plaintiff own unreliable recollections 
norelus listed witnesses,including her own family members,friends,and coworkers at denny,all testified contrary to plaintiff version of the facts so that plaintiff was soon left with only her own testimony to support her claims 
her deposition was filled with numerous lapses of memory,outright lies,and outlandish comments the amlongs accepted and believed norelus allegations based almost exclusively on plaintiff own recollections and 
the preparation of the errata sheet and the procedures used to do so was improper and should have not occurred.all emphases added 
in the context of these undisputed facts,and the magistrate own finding of impropriety,his failure to find the amlong conduct reckless was not,the district court said,based upon or permitted by the record.a correct application of the objective test to these facts,said the district court,results in the following conclusions of law 
the amlongs decision not to investigate norelus allegations,after her witnesses failed to support her claim,and certainly after her own deposition,constituted a reckless disregard for the merits of her claim.
at least after norelus deposition,the amlongs should have known that her claim was very likely frivolous.
the amlongs decision to continue to pursue a frivolous claim by filing the errata sheet was unreasonable and vexatious and multiplied the proceedings unnecessarily.all emphases added 
accordingly,the court imposed section sanctions on the amlongs and their law from june the date of the errata sheet through march,the date of the sanctions order.
the amlongs make three arguments on appeal that the district court erred in applying an objective standard to their conduct that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that the amlongs conduct met this standard and that the award of attorney fees and costs for the sanctions proceedings themselves was also an abuse of discretion 
section sanctions may be imposed for objectively reckless conduct regardless of counsel subjective intent.
section permits the district court to sanction litigation conduct that unreasonably and vexatiously multiplies the proceedings.we have long held that bad faith is the touchstone for the imposition of sanctions under the statute.schwartz,at.recently,we made clear that this bad faith is to be found in counsel objective conduct,not in her subjective state of mind.id.under the objective test,according to the majority,the district court must compare the attorney conduct against the conduct of a reasonable attorney and make a judgment about whether the conduct was acceptable according to some objective standard emphasis added.in this circuit,litigation conduct may be sanctioned if it is reckless by which we have mean a gross deviation from conduct that might be reasonable in the circumstances.schwartz,at.
after having so carefully established that the appropriate test for section sanctions in this circuit is objective,not subjective,with citation to no less than fourteen cases,the majority then proceeds to advance the citation to a single under the objective test 
a district court may impose sanctions for egregious conduct by an attorney even if the attorney acted without the specific purpose or intent to multiply the proceedings.that is not to say the attorney purpose or intent is irrelevant.although the attorney objective conduct is the focus of the analysis,the attorney subjective state of mind is frequently an important piece of the calculus,because a given act is more likely to fall outside the bounds of acceptable conduct and therefore be unreasonabl e and vexatious if it is done with a malicious purpose or intent emphasis added.
quite clearly,this is not an accurate description of the objective test.under the objective test for bad faith,counsel subjective intentions are never frequently an important piece of the calculus in evaluating counsel objective conduct.we have explicitly so held.souran travelers ins,cir the court should determine objectively the propriety of sanctions without conducting an exploration of the attorney subjective intentions quoting debbie wilson,note,the intended application of federal rule of civil procedure an end to the empty head,pure heart defense and a reinforcement of ethical standards,vand.the majority opinion even concedes elsewhere that,it is clear from the statutory language and the case law that for purposes of,bad faith turns not on the attorney subjective intent,but on the attorney objective conduct emphasis added.it is counsel conduct,not her intentions,that is the focus of our inquiry 
the district court determination whether that conduct falls outside the bounds of acceptable conduct is governed by circuit precedent.certain litigation conduct is permissible under our law other conduct is forbidden.sanctions may be imposed where counsel conduct was forbidden.
conduct remains forbidden even if counsel acted with the best of example,helping her client in whom she honestly believed,press a claim contradicted by all the available evidence and supported by none.under the objective test,a district court may not excuse counsel reckless conduct because she acted with an empty head,but a pure heart.souran,at.see also margo weiss,cir the objective standard eliminates any,justification for patently frivolous arguments thornton wahl,cir under the objective test for sanctions,a n empty head but a pure heart is no defense.to excuse objectively unreasonable conduct by an attorney would be to state that one who acts with an empty head and a pure heart is not responsible for the consequences.braley campbell,cir quoting mccandless great atlantic and pacific tea,cir.this is not the law in the eleventh circuit.in our circuit,as in most others,karen amlong pure heart may not excuse her bad conduct,if it was bad.
the district court correctly reviewed the amlongs conduct to determine whether it was objectively reckless.in so doing,it adopted the magistrate findings of and,indeed,defended by the they conducted no independent investigation of the facts underlying norelus claim that there was no evidentiary support for norelus allegations that there was much evidence contradicting her allegations that norelus deposition was replete with falsehoods,contradictory and did not factually support the allegations of her own complaint and,finally,that in response to this set of circumstances,the amlongs did not dismiss the claim but rather chose to prepare and file an item errata sheet that materially changed their client sworn testimony the district court concluded that this conduct is forbidden in our circuit,and,therefore,objectively reckless.
the majority,however,never even discusses these facts or their legal consequences.there is no discussion whatsoever in the majority opinion of whether the amlongs conduct was objectively reckless.there is no case on whether what they did to investigate norelus claim was reasonable under the law.there is no case on whether the amlongs may reasonably choose to rely on their belief in their client story to the exclusion of any other investigation.there is no case on whether the amlongs continued pursuit of norelus claim was reasonable when it became clear there was no evidentiary support for it and much contradictory evidence.there is no case on whether,after a deposition that all agree with riddled with falsehoods,contradictory testimony and which almost completely failed to support the allegations of the complaint,the amlongs decision to prepare and file a item errata sheet materially changing their client sworn testimony was acceptable litigation conduct.there is simply no discussion whatsoever about whether these facts support the award of sanctions.
instead of such a discussion,the majority takes the position that these facts do not exist.according to the majority,the district court rejected the magistrate finding that the amlongs filed the errata sheet in a good faith attempt to,as karen amlong testified,set the record straight.instead,the majority complains,the district court found that they filed the errata sheet to bolster the testimony,repair the damage,and coverup falsities.the majority holds that the district court clearly erred when it rejected the magistrate findings of fact and credibility determinations without a hearing.in the majority view,the case must be remanded in order for the facts to be found.
this view is mistaken.it is rooted in the majority failure to distinguish between findings of fact regarding what the amlongs did and credibility findings regarding their subjective good intentions in doing it.to the extent that the district court reached any conclusions about the amlongs subjective intentions there is no finding of actual bad faith in its opinion,and to the extent that these conclusions conflict with those of the magistrate,the conclusions are dicta and the conflict irrelevant.the statute requires the district court to evaluate karen amlong objective her subjective state of mind.having determined that what she did was reckless,the district court speculation as to why she did it is pure dicta.even the majority recognizes this when it noted that the district court made these factual findings about her subjective intentions because it felt obliged to justify its determination of objective bad faith emphasis added.credibility findings regarding irrelevant testimony do not constitute reversible error.no remand is necessary to resolve a conflict between the district court and the magistrate that is irrelevant to the outcome of this case.
as opposed to its speculation about karen amlong subjective state of mind,the district court holding is that the amlongs objective conduct was reckless.with respect to this conduct,all agree as to the facts.the district court adopted,rather than rejected,the magistrate findings of fact concerning what the amlongs did in their pursuit of norelus claim even the amlongs do not dispute these facts.on the contrary,as we have seen above,they vigorously defend their conduct.therefore,no remand is necessary to find these facts.these facts do not depend upon karen amlong credibility.
the only fact that depends upon karen amlong credibility is her claim to good intentions in doing what she did.since this fact is irrelevant to the determination of her objective conduct,what is the point of remand 
the majority professes to agree that,under an objective test,even fully credited good intentions may not excuse otherwise blameworthy conduct.but implicit in its insistence that karen amlong testimony must be heard is the belief that even if the things she did in pursuit of norelus claim were forbidden,these things are permitted when done with good intentions.this belief is reflected throughout the majority opinion,which contains not one word about the objective recklessness of the amlong conduct,but exhaustively catalogues their good intentions.
but this is not the law.no amount of good intentions can legitimize otherwise forbidden litigation conduct.if what counsel has done transgresses permissible bounds,counsel may not plead good faith in doing it.were that not so,counsel who knows that his client ought,in justice,win the case could claim good faith in suborning perjury to achieve that success.
similarly,in this case,the amlongs knew that norelus story was true and that she should prevail in her claim.they believed her.therefore,they filed her claim without any investigation whatsoever.they chose not to depose a single witness.after the defense depositions,when it became clear that every fact witness identified by norelus had not only failed to support,but,in fact,contradicted her story,they continued their pursuit of her claim.after norelus deposition,which failed to support the allegations of her own complaint,the amlongs chose not to abandon their pursuit of her claim,but instead prepared and filed an item errata sheet that,as the majority itself acknowledges,materially previously sworn testimony.
the law in this circuit,which the majority never even mentions,is that such litigation conduct is objectively reckless and sanctionable.despite karen amlong testimony that she did these things because there usually are not witnesses to such events or the witnesses usually lie,that she believed norelus story,that others believed it too,and that she filed the errata sheet to set the record straight,our cases condemn such litigation conduct regardless of the reasons for it.case after case in this circuit unequivocally holds that an utter failure to investigate does not satisfy counsel duty to the if counsel considers such investigation fruitless.case after case holds that reliance on a belief in one client without more is not enough to satisfy counsel duty to the of the strength with which such a belief is held.our cases are unanimous that an errata sheet that makes wholesale changes to a plaintiff sworn deposition testimony is both improper and an abuse of the judicial of the motive in doing so.
so,having good intentions can not make permissible what is forbidden.the majority offers not one case in which testimony about counsel subjective good intentions was held to be even relevant to,much less determinative of,the objective recklessness of counsel conduct.i suggest there is not one.
if the amlong conduct is forbidden by our cases,as both the magistrate and the district court held,then remand for reconsideration of that conduct in the light of karen amlong good intentions is unnecessary.
we have specifically so held.in direct conflict with the majority opinion,we have held that,under section,no remand to the district court is necessary where the record contains the facts of counsel objective conduct because,under the objective test,we may review the propriety of that conduct without testimony or findings regarding counsel subjective intentions.souran,at the court should determine the propriety of sanctions objectively without conducting an exploration of the attorney subjective intentions.under souran,the findings of fact in the record of this case are more than sufficient to permit our review of the district court decision to sanction.id 
the district court reviewed the undisputed facts regarding what the amlongs did,and concluded that,under our binding precedent,this conduct was objectively reckless.i must respectfully dissent from the holding that it must do so again i believe its job is done.
our job is to review the district court conclusion that the amlongs conduct was objectively reckless.because the majority does not address this issue at all,i have included the following discussion.
b.the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the amlongs conduct was objectively reckless.
in this circuit,an attorney may be sanctioned under section when she litigates in objective bad faith.an attorney litigates in objective bad faith when she recklessly pursues a frivolous claim,delaying its dismissal by unreasonably and vexatiously multiplying the proceedings.schwartz,at.
something more than a lack of merit is required,however,for a claim to be considered frivolous.id.i t is not sufficient that the claim be found meritless the claim must be without a plausible legal or factual basis and lacking in justification.knorr brake harbil,cir cited in torres city of orlando,d,aff.cir.
we have found claims to be frivolous where they were groundless and baseless and predicated upon untruthful,outrageous,scandalous,and slanderous allegations,beard annis,cir,or based upon false and unsupported allegations.footman cheung,cir.other types of frivolous claims are those unsupported by any evidence at all,in re mroz,cir,or those having no reasonable basis in fact.barnes,at.see generally sullivan school bd.of pinellas county,cir district court must focus on the question whether the case is so lacking in arguable merit as to be groundless or without foundation rather than whether the claim was ultimately successful.
additionally,counsel pursuit of the frivolous claim must be more than merely negligent.schwartz,at.only a conclusion of recklessness by which we mean a gross deviation from conduct that might be reasonable in the circumstances will support an award of sanctions under section.id.at.the district court in cordoba stated it well when it said that counsel conduct must have sunk so far beneath a reasonable standard of competence,much deeper than mere negligence,that it became essentially indistinguishable from bad faith.cordoba dillard,cir quoting cordoba,wl at district court opinion.
in this circuit,counsel pursuit of a frivolous claim is reckless in cases lacking credibility from the outset,such as when an attorney fails to investigate adequately the allegations contained in the complaint collins walden,cir affirming sanctions where counsel had neither direct nor circumstantial evidence of claim at time of filing torres,d at aff.counsel sanctioned where he conducted no independent investigation,relying instead on belief in client barnes,at reckless to pursue claim that never had any basis in fact.this is especially true when counsel files an amended complaint that contains baseless allegations,thereby causing defendants to respond to such allegations a second time.footman.at byrne nezhat,cir.
we have refused to excuse the failure to conduct an independent investigation even though counsel had little faith in the conclusions of the official investigators and chose,instead,to rely on his multiple interviews with his client.torres,d at aff.we have made clear that a client good faith belief in a claim does not automatically make that claim meritorious.id.
in addition to claims lacking credible evidentiary support at filing,dogged pursuit of a colorable claim becomes actionable bad faith once the attorney learns or should have learned that the claim is bound to fail.in re tci,at.when plaintiffs own witnesses have no knowledge of the facts alleged in the complaint,avirgan,at,or,worse still,their testimony actually contradicts those allegations,beard,at,counsel is on notice that her claim is without plausible legal or factual basis.when it becomes apparent that discoverable evidence will not bear out the claim,the litigant and his attorney have a duty to discontinue their quest,risking sanctions if they do not.walden,at.see also byrne,at counsel sanctioned for failure to withdraw frivolous claim.see generally christiansburg garment eeoc,d in civil rights cases,sanctions appropriate where claim is frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless,or plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.
finally,the reckless pursuit of the frivolous claim must unreasonably and vexatiously multiply the proceedings.schwartz,at.we have held that the continued litigation of a claim after it becomes apparent from the discoverable facts that no evidence exists to support it multiplies the proceedings in this way.torres,d at aff.we have also held that counsel multiplies the proceedings vexatiously when his conduct requires the court to spend a considerable amount of time dealing with the consequences of that conduct,including in an evidentiary hearing regarding sanctions.malautea suzuki motor,cir defense discovery intransigence required magistrate judge to deal with countless motions,and necessitated an evidentiary hearing regarding sanctions,a page order imposing sanctions,and this appeal.
the district court held that the amlongs recklessly pursued a frivolous claim,thereby unreasonably and vexatiously multiplying these proceedings.this conclusion is reviewed for an abuse of discretion the decision to sanction involves both factual and legal issues.cooter gell hartmarx,d.the district court must determine the factual issue of what the attorney actually did,as well as the legal issue of whether that conduct rises to a sanctionable level.id.both decisions,however,are reviewed merely for an abuse of discretion.id.at.
with respect to the facts,a court of appeals would be justified in concluding that a district court had abused its discretion in making a factual finding only if the finding were clearly erroneous.id.this standard requires us to pay deference to the district court interpretation of the factual record before it.anderson city of bessemer,d.thus,i f the district court account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact,it would have weighed the evidence differently.where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the fact finder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.id.
reasonableness is the yardstick by which we measure the district court ultimate legal conclusion that the amlongs conduct rose to a sanctionable level.in re tutu wells contamination litigation,cir.in tutu wells,the third circuit held that even though sanctioned counsel advanced a plausible explanation for their conduct,there was evidence in the record to support the district court conclusion that they engaged in a pattern of delay,as well.in such circumstances the district court conclusion was reasonable.id.in view of the undisputed evidence,the court concluded,it was not unreasonable for the district court to conclude that the delays in the investigation were willful and in bad faith.id.
finally,the district court decision to impose sanctions is entitled to substantial deference because it is in the best position to review the factual circumstances and render an informed judgment as it is intimately involved with the case,the litigants,and the attorneys on a daily basis.thomas capital sec,cir en banc.thus,although we,of course,review the district court decision,the issue is not whether we would award sanctions,but whether,applying the appropriate,deferential review standard,we must sustain the district court decision.phonometrics,westin hotel,affirming sanctions awarded by a district court in the southern district of florida and applying eleventh circuit law under.
the amlongs recklessly pursued a frivolous claim.
karen amlong testified that because she believed her client,she did not interview any of the people norelus claimed to have witnessed the incidents of abuse prior to filing the amended complaints.even after the witnesses depositions revealed that none supported her version of events at all,counsel admits she did not believe it necessary to order any of the transcripts to evaluate this testimony,nor to conduct any further inquiry.in sum,counsel belief in her client was premised neither on facts nor on any investigation she literally had no evidence,other than norelus story,prior to filing any of the amended complaints to which defendants were obliged to respond again that jawaid or hameed committed any of the acts alleged in those complaints nor was there ever any such independent evidence.
on the other hand,there was much evidence that norelus claims were not credible.the employers remedial investigation revealed no wrongdoing.the police investigation revealed such inconsistencies and contradictions that the state attorney did not prosecute.there was not one witness,as the amlongs concede in their brief,who could corroborate her charges of sexual abuse.on the contrary,the witnesses directly contradicted her story,testifying that they never saw any sexual harassment or improper sexual comment,except by norelus herself when norelus herself was deposed,the inconsistencies and outright lies in her own testimony were apparent even to counsel,causing them to have her polygraphed.nonetheless,counsel continued to press this demonstrably unsupported claim,without engaging in any investigation of norelus allegations.
based upon these undisputed facts,the district court found,as did the magistrate,that norelus claim was frivolous because it always lacked credible evidence,or any evidence other than her own unreliable recollections and that the amlongs undertook no reasonable investigation prior to filing any of the complaints or at any point during the pendency of this litigation,choosing,instead,to continue to rely on norelus unsubstantiated story.the district court concluded that this conduct was reckless.
the amlongs argue that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that their conduct was reckless because they relied on their client belief in her core allegations.we have previously held,however,that i f an attorney has failed to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the matter,then the court is obligated to impose sanctions even if the attorney had a good faith belief that the claim was sound.mroz,at.it will not do to rest upon a gut feeling that one client is a victim.see blue,at.as the fourth circuit warned in blue 
undoubtedly there are instances in which an attorney acts irresponsibly by failing to investigate the facts behind his client claim and by instead relying solely on the client testimony to support his case.counsel can not escape liability,as they attempt to here,by relying solely on their belief that their clients genuinely feel that they were not fairly treated.no longer is it enough for an attorney to claim that he acted in good faith,or that he personally was unaware of the groundless nature of an argument or claim.
id.at citations omitted.thus,the amlongs good faith in their belief in their client does not insulate them from the requirements of the federal rules to investigate the claims they bring to the court.blind reliance on the client is seldom a sufficient inquiry southern leasing partners,mcmullan,cir.
nor did their belief in their client permit the amlongs to ignore the testimony of all norelus own witnesses that indicated that she was lying.in this case,as in blue,the only evidence ever advanced by plaintiffs on their claims were their own unsubstantiated,contradictory,and inconsistent claims of discrimination.id.at internal citations omitted.in the face of such unsubstantiated claims 
c ounsel can not simply rely on a client patently incredible testimony when any reasonable investigation of the factual bases for the client claims or examination of materials obtained in discovery would reveal the paucity and implausibility of the evidence.
similarly,in byrd hopson.cir,the fourth circuit affirmed an award of sanctions where 
b ased on a reasonable investigation of the facts and law,counsel should have quickly recognized that the plaintiff claims were groundless.the court noted that the plaintiff version of events underlying this lawsuit contained numerous inconsistencies and that the witnesses with whom counsel spoke in investigating the case lacked credibility and almost all of the information allegedly known by these individuals was hearsay,rumor,or speculation.
id.at.in this case,norelus witnesses had no knowledge of any improper conduct at all.
on the other hand,we have declined to affirm sanctions where counsel,when hints of problems with the cases arose,promptly made inquiries so that questioned claims could be further investigated and thus acted reasonably or close to reasonably in the circumstances.schwartz,at.in contrast,the amlongs did nothing when hints of problems arose in norelus case 
therefore,i conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the amlongs belief in their client was unreasonable because it was 
p remised neither on facts nor reasonable investigation.counsel had literally no evidence beyond plaintiff incendiary and contradictory descriptions that defendants committed any of the acts alleged in the complaint.
in view of this finding,it was not unreasonable for the district court to conclude that the amlongs pursuit of norelus claim was reckless.although the amlongs protest that they prosecuted this case in a straightforward way and in their usual manner,as the district court said in torres s uch conduct would be fine,if the case was worth prosecuting in the first place.it was not.d at aff.
the filing of the errata sheet recklessly multiplied the proceedings.
as with the failure to investigate,the amlongs do not dispute that they helped norelus to prepare and then filed the errata sheet,nor that the changes described here are in that document.at issue is the reasonableness of the district court legal conclusion that the filing of the errata sheet with those changes recklessly multiplied these proceedings.
the amlongs maintain that rule e in no way limits the types and number of changes that an errata sheet is permitted to make to a prior deposition the majority seems to agree,noting without comment or objection that norelus sworn testimony was changed times by the errata sheet.although early cases may have given the impression that such changes are permissible,the rule is,and was at the time the amlongs filed the errata sheet,to the contrary.
in,when the amlongs submitted the norelus errata sheet,this rule was already clear.four years earlier,in greenway int l paper,the court noted that a deposition is not a take home examination.the court said 
the purpose of rule e is obvious.should the reporter make a substantive error,he reported yes but i said no,or a formal error,he reported the name to be lawrence smith but the proper name is laurence smith,then corrections by the deponent would be in order.the rule can not be interpreted to allow one to alter what was said under oath.if that were the case,one could merely answer the questions with no thought at all then return home and plan artful responses.
similarly,in,the united states district court for the district of columbia noted that 
defendant argues that rule e allows her to make any substantive change she so desires.while older cases appear to support this position,later cases have often limited this blank check perhaps because of the potential for abuse.

the united states district court for the middle district of north carolina,in,sanctioned the plaintiff attempt to correct her deposition with a correction list with over corrections in a deposition,changing yes to no and vice versa.barlow esselte pendaflex.the court inferred bad faith from the manner and number of changes the errata sheet proposed,characterizing the conduct as harassing and causing unnecessary delay and costs.id.
in rios bigler,the district court,citing greenway,held that it would consider only those errata sheet changes that clarified the deposition,and not those that materially altered it.
recent decisions by several courts of appeals,including our own,affirm this interpretation of rule e.the tenth circuit has said,we do not condone counsel allowing for material changes to deposition testimony and certainly do not approve of the use of such altered testimony that is controverted by the original testimony.garcia pueblo country club,cir accord burns board of county com rs of jackson county,cir analogizing to rule that affidavit may not be used to contradict prior sworn testimony.similarly,the seventh circuit has held that a change of substance which actually contradicts the transcript is impermissible unless it can plausibly be represented as the correction of an error in transcription,such as dropping a not.thorn sundstrand aerospace,cir calling such an errata sheet a foolish tactic.
we too have affirmed a district court decision to disregard an errata sheet that attempted to make material changes to a deposition on the grounds that the deponent was confused at the time of the deposition.reynolds ibm,d,aff.cir approving district court decision to disregard errata changes where deponent did not exhibit any obvious confusion during deposition.similarly,norelus initial sworn answers of yes or no do not reflect any confusion that should have been clarified by the substitution of the exact opposite answer,along with great detail.
the amlongs contend that the changes made by their errata sheet did not materially alter the substance of norelus answers.karen amlong testified that the changes were really only immaterial or elaborations,and not really significant.
the district court careful review of the changes,attached hereto as appendix a,led it to find otherwise.for example,norelus deposition answer no to the question whether she was ever forced to have anal sex,was changed in the errata sheet to yes,as alleged in her complaint.her deposition testimony regarding an assault by jawaid was almost completely changed to provide much greater factual detail.her testimony that she could not remember the color or material of the hairbrush used to sodomize her,was replaced in the errata sheet with the to medium the.her deposition testimony that she did not remember anything that she told the police about the assaults was replaced in the errata sheet with a recollection that she told the police that the managers sexually assaulted her.her deposition testimony that she could not remember anything about the car hameed put her in or the route they took when he kidnapped her and drove her to his house where she was restrained and repeatedly raped by both hameed and jawaid,was replaced in the errata sheet with great detail about both the car and the exact route that hameed took to his house,including many street names and precise directions for the route.
rather than simply correcting inaccuracies of transcription or mistakes of translation,the district court found that the errata sheet changes bolstered norelus case by supplying the support for the allegations of her complaint that was glaringly missing in the original deposition.this finding by the district court is not clearly erroneous.
nor do i find unreasonable the district court legal conclusion that the filing of this errata sheet was reckless.the district court concluded that,c oupled with the complete lack of supporting evidence in this case,the nature and quantity of entries on the errata bolstered inconsistencies or covered up falsities,and thereafter the plaintiff inability to factually support the errata changes at the subsequent bad faith and willful disregard for the judicial process by the amlongs.see barlow,at inferring bad faith from a similar errata sheet greenway,at.
the amlongs contend that such a conclusion of bad faith is precluded because the filing of the errata sheet was their good faith effort to set the record straight and because the corrections opened norelus up to potentially devastating.this argument,however,ignores the plain fact that without the errata sheet,norelus had no case at all.the district court found that the errata sheet was an effort to repair the damage to her deposition by providing factual support to an otherwise dismissible case.specifically,the court found 
t he court close examination of the errata changes indicates a concerted effort to provide factual support to an otherwise meritless case.the information included in the errata changes forms the factual backbone of plaintiff case and is unsupported by plaintiff deposition,both before and after the preparation of the errata changes emphasis added.
there is no clear error in this finding.see footman.at rejecting counsel characterization as more truthful and accurate his corrections to sworn interrogatory answers that bolstered case.
the amlongs also contend that it was not reasonable for the district court to conclude that their filing of the errata sheet was in objective bad faith because the magistrate ultimately held that,since they believed in their client,they engaged in nothing more than zealous advocacy.but this reliance on the magistrate legal conclusion is misplaced.as i have pointed out above,in conducting its de novo review of the motions for sanctions,the district court is entitled to make whatever use it sees fit of the magistrate report and recommendation.in rejecting an almost identical argument,the third circuit in tutu wells said 
the sanctioned law firm relies on a report by a magistrate judge concluding that the firm actions during the investigation amounted to nothing more than zealous advocacy in representation of its clients and therefore did not warrant sanctions.the firm submits that the district court had no basis to disagree with the magistrate judge conclusions.however,the district court in that instance did not owe the magistrate judge any deference.further,the undisputed evidence makes it clear that it was not unreasonable for the district court to conclude that the delays in the investigation were willful and in bad faith.
at emphasis added.similarly,in this case,while the amlongs advance an exculpatory explanation for their was ample evidence in the record to support the district court finding of recklessness instead,and,therefore,its conclusion was not unreasonable.
furthermore,the amlongs decision to file the errata sheet,instead of discontinu ing their quest,walden,at,clearly multiplied the proceedings.we have affirmed sanctions for multiplying the proceedings where counsel chose to continue to litigate a claim after he should have known that no evidence even remotely suggested that the claim had merit.torres,d at aff.
based upon these findings,the district court legal conclusion that the filing of the errata sheet was reckless and multiplied these proceedings was not unreasonable.
the district court ultimate decision to sanction the amlongs conduct was not an abuse of discretion.
in sum,the district court found that,despite their good faith belief in norelus story,the amlongs had a duty to investigate her allegations,which had they fulfilled,would have revealed to them the frivolity of her case.in view of the failure of her own fact witnesses to support her story,and especially after her own deposition,in which she too failed to provide evidentiary support for her claim,they were obligated to but did not investigate to determine if there was any evidentiary support at all for her claim instead,they prepared and filed an item errata sheet that had the effect of bolstering norelus deposition testimony by eliminating inconsistencies and outright lies,and providing support for what was otherwise a patently frivolous case.concluding that the amlongs recklessly pursued a frivolous claim and multiplied these proceedings,the district court held their conduct sanctionable,and exercised its discretion to impose sanctions i would affirm this decision.
c.the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding costs and fees for the sanctions proceedings 
section requires a nexus between the amount claimed as a sanction and the sanctionable conduct itself.peterson bmi refractories,cir.the district court awarded fees,costs and expenses from the date of dismissal of norelus complaint through the date of the sanctions order.the amlongs object to the inclusion of fees and costs for the sanctions proceedings themselves.
we review the amount of the sanctions awarded by the district court for an abuse of discretion,and,as we have often said,give great deference to the district court decision to 
i mpose whatever sanctions appear appropriate to combat the expense,inefficiency and backlog which the judicial process suffers because of wrongfully filed complaints and motions.it is the district court judge who sits at this bottleneck and who most accurately perceives the harms which rightful litigants suffer because of rule violations.no one is better situated to perceive the measure of the sanction.
the majority of cases hold that fees and costs in connection with the sanctions proceedings themselves may be awarded as the product of the sanctionable conduct.see tutu wells,at citing kirk capital bailey,cir silva witschen,cir brandt schal,cir in re stauffer seeds,cir.see also chambers nasco,d affirming award of sanctions based in part on the costs associated with the sanctions proceedings themselves,although not directly addressing the issue 
there is no reason to categorically exclude from a sanction award the attorney fees and costs arising from the sanctions proceedings themselves,and i agree with the third circuit that such an exclusion is unwise.tutu wells,at as that court said 
the time,effort,and resources expended in bringing sanctionable conduct to light would have been unnecessary had the sanctionable conduct never occurred.these costs are as much a harm to a party in the litigation as is the delay in the litigation or the substantive prejudice caused by the conduct.if we exclude from a possible award the costs of sanctions proceedings,we would undermine the compensatory goal of a sanctions award.further,if a party is aware ex ante that the costs he incurs in exposing sanctionable conduct will never be recouped,that party may decide to forgo a sanctions proceeding altogether.in so doing,however,that party might allow otherwise sanctionable conduct to go unaddressed.in such cases,the deterrent goal of a sanction award has been lost parties who know that the likelihood of facing a sanction proceeding are low may engage in sanctionable conduct more often.
id.at.therefore,i agree with the district court that it has the discretion to award attorney fees arising from the sanctions proceedings themselves.
in this case,litigation over the sanctions motions has occupied the parties for the past ten years.the time,effort,and resources expended in these proceedings has been as much a harm to these defendants as is the delay in the litigation or the substantive prejudice caused by the conduct.id.i agree with the tenth circuit that when attorneys engage in scorched earth tactics to challenge such a fee award,a refusal to permit recovery of additional fees for defending that award would allow counsel to dilute the value of the original award or force the recipient to abandon that award entirely.glass pfeffer,cir.therefore,i would find no abuse of discretion in the district court determination that sanctions from the date of the errata sheet to the date of sanctions order are appropriate in this case.i believe the award should be affirmed.
for the foregoing reasons,i believe the district court judgment awarding sanctions is due to be affirmed in all respects,and,i must respectfully dissent from the majority conclusion to the contrary.this interminable litigation is now returned to the district court for further proceedings.the district court is told that it must hold yet another hearing to determine the counsel sincerity in the conduct of this case.the majority,however,fails to instruct the district court what place these facts may have in its ultimate decision whether to reimpose sanctions.i suggest that they have no place at all.

the errata sheet 
the errata sheet was pages long and made changes to plaintiff sworn deposition answers,and sought to explain material changes to plaintiff testimony through four broad categories did not understand what was being asked refreshed recollection poor translation by interpreter and clarification of response.see errata sheet at.the following are examples of purported material changes in testimony

judge hill dissent suggests that subjective intent is irrelevant to a determination of objective bad faith,although he appears to agree that subjective bad faith,if proved,can support a finding of objective bad faith.we agree that subjective bad faith is not necessary to a finding of objective bad faith,and that the absence of subjective bad faith does not excuse objectively blameworthy conduct.but a determination of whether an attorney conduct was objectively reckless,or tantamount to bad faith,may be aided by an examination of the attorney state of mind.thus,in this case the lawyer purpose in filing the errata sheet was explored at considerable length both by the magistrate judge,after taking testimony,and by the district judge,who took no testimony herself.indeed,the district court in this case felt obliged to justify its determination of objective bad faith by finding as a fact not just reckless conduct,but also that the amlongs submitted the errata sheet in an effort to bolster testimony,repair the damage,and cover up falsities.as we note later,see infra note,a finding of a or concealment is and was essential to the ultimate legal determination.in schwartz millon air,for example,we reversed sanctions against attorneys who had litigated false claims based on the representations of an ecuadorian attorney.we noted that n o one contends that the appellant attorneys were actually aware of the fraud,thus suggesting that the very same series of litigation maneuvers,if accompanied by a bad purpose,might have been inexcusable and sanctionable.schwartz,at see also miles dickson,cir per curiam reversing a district court imposition of attorney fees based on a conclusion that the plaintiffs attorneys acted in good faith,upon written authorization from their clients and the facts and circumstances do not present such an extreme case as would permit the court to tax the costs against the attorneys dreiling peugeot motors of,cir taking note of a threatening letter an attorney sent to the defendant in the course of determining whether pressing claims against the defendant was unreasonable and vexatious mccandless great atl.pac.tea,cir stating that relevant factors in finding bad faith include reasons for filing the suit and whether the attorney was aware of the meritlessness of the action.an attorney knowledge and intent at each step in the drama may be relevant to the ultimate legal determination that the conduct is objectively reckless,or that bad faith is dissent,citing souran travelers insurance,cir,also argues that our case law categorically bars any consideration of an attorney knowledge,motive,or state of mind in evaluating her objective conduct.we disagree.souran involved rule sanctions.id.at.while many of the same general principles apply to sanctions under rule and sanctions under,rule and are distinct sources of authority.they are aimed at addressing different kinds of misconduct,are different in scope,and are governed by quite different legal standards.see,byrne nezhat,cir noting that rule is aimed primarily at pleadings and addresses the conduct of both parties and attorneys,while addresses dilatory tactics throughout the entire litigation and is focused solely on attorney conduct chambers nasco,d noting that rule permits attorney fees for conduct which merely fails to meet a reasonableness standard,in contrast to a court inherent powers,which require a higher showing.rule cases do not dispose of the issues arising under.moreover,the quoted portion of brief parenthetical quoting language from a vanderbilt law review student was not essential to the court holding it was dicta.in fact,the court in souran reversed the district court imposition of rule sanctions based on a finding that the attorney conduct was objectively reasonable.
b notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary a a judge may designate a magistrate judge to hear and determine any pretrial matter pending before the court,except a motion for injunctive relief,for judgment on the pleadings,for summary judgment,to dismiss or quash an indictment or information made by the defendant,to suppress evidence in a criminal case,to dismiss or to permit maintenance of a class action,to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,and to involuntarily dismiss an action.a judge of the court may reconsider any pretrial matter under this subparagraph a where it has been shown that the magistrate judge order is clearly erroneous or contrary to law.b a judge may also designate a magistrate judge to conduct hearings,including evidentiary hearings,and to submit to a judge of the court proposed findings of fact and recommendations for the disposition,by a judge of the court,of any motion excepted in subparagraph a,of applications for posttrial relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses and of prisoner petitions challenging conditions of confinement.c the magistrate judge shall file his proposed findings and recommendations under subparagraph b with the court and a copy shall forthwith be mailed to all ten days after being served with a copy,any party may serve and file written objections to such proposed findings and recommendations as provided by rules of court.a judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection is made.a judge of the court may accept,reject,or modify,in whole or in part,the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge.the judge may also receive further evidence or recommit the matter to the magistrate judge with instructions b footnote omitted.
in her testimony at the evidentiary hearing,amlong explained that the firm usually has its associates take extensive notes at witnesses depositions so that the firm does not have to pay from all of the witnesses depositions prior to trial.
in bonner city of prichard,cir en banc,this court adopted as binding precedent all of the decisions of the former fifth circuit handed down prior to the close of business on september.id.at.
the dissent nevertheless concludes that the district court adopted the magistrate findings of fact.dissenting op.at.we are unable to read the district court sanctions opinion that way.in the first place,the district court expressly told us in its sanctions order that the magistrate judge determinations were not based on the record,norelus denny,slip op.at,sanctions order.moreover,and more important,the district court plainly found facts dramatically different from those found by the magistrate judge when it wrote that the amlongs had filed the errata sheet in an effort to bolster testimony,to repair the damage,and,most notably,to cover up falsities.norelus denny,slip op.at,wl,sanctions order.this is not language even remotely consonant with the notion that karen amlong proceeded with an empty head,but a pure heart,as the dissent would have it.to file an errata sheet in an effort to cover up a client false testimony quite simply means to file the document knowingly and consciously in order to deliberately convey the false and misleading impression that a client core testimony was true,when in fact the lawyer knew it to be false.see webster third new international dictionary noting that cover up means to conceal something illicit,blameworthy,or embarrassing from notice prevent one from being censured for error,laxity,or omission.indeed,the district court tells us that the amlongs proceeded in willful disregard for the judicial process emphasis added.this kind of fact finding goes far beyond a finding of recklessness.to do so without hearing a word of testimony,and in the face of the magistrate judge contrary findings of fact and credibility determinations,undeniably constituted legal error.
norelus admitted to completing a false immigration and naturalization service employment eligibility form in connection with her denny application,using the name of her cousin,lavictore remy.she also admitted to filing false and income tax returns under the same name.
as to the relevance of this fact,the amlongs state in their brief that v irtually every employment case that we have has a prompt remedial investigation that shows no liability.if that stopped us we would never try a case.
norelus had originally consulted with debra valladares.valladares,who knew little about title vii claims,associated chambrot,an attorney with trial experience.
nor did chambrot rely on any investigation conducted by valladares.valladares testified that,prior to undertaking to represent norelus,she spoke only with norelus,her two brothers,and david hill,a former client who brought norelus to her.valladares testified that she had defended hill against allegations that he committed assault and sexual harassment while a denny employee.hill settled the lawsuit with a monetary payment to the plaintiff.subsequently,valladares spoke with only two potential reed and john green.neither of these two men witnessed any sexual harassment of norelus by jawaid or hameed.green,a regular patron of denny,told valladares that he felt sorry for norelus because she was made to clean bathrooms and jawaid seemed to treat her as a slave.when defense counsel deposed him later with an amlong attorney present,green testified that a female attorney who identified herself as norelus attorney offered him money for false testimony supporting norelus claim,but he refused.green did not remember her name,and he died before the sanctions hearings.
chambrot was familiar with another pending sexual harassment suit against a different denny restaurant filed by karen amlong,and referred the norelus matter to amlong prior to filing the original complaint,but no retainer agreement had been executed,so chambrot signed that complaint.the amlongs commenced their formal representation after receiving the retainer agreement some two months later.
nor was there every any other sort of evidentiary support for these allegations.
the errata sheet was the product of a conference attended by an associate of the amlong firm,norelus and her two brothers also identified by her as fact witnesses.norelus brothers not only translated the deposition,but interpreted and clarified the meaning of the deposition questions and norelus prior answers.
the district court prepared an excerpt from the errata sheet highlighting some of the changes.it is attached hereto as appendix a.the entire page errata sheet was appended to the district court order awarding sanctions.see wl at appendix 
the district court found that many statements in the errata sheet could not fairly be attributed to norelus herself.
the amlongs concede in their brief that t he deposition finally came to an end on the third day when all counsel reached an implicit understanding that little purpose would be served in continuing the process.
at this point,the amlongs withdrew from her representation.
all defendants filed timely objections to the magistrate report and recommendation.the amlongs did not file any objections to the report and recommendation,and they do not now contest the district court findings of fact,with the exception of the ultimate fact that their conduct was reckless,in any material way.

the majority opinion does not address the second or third issue at all.
of course,counsel bad intentions,in a particular case,if proved,may become a factor in the district court ultimate decision to sanction.bu
