the almanor lakeside villas owners association almanor is the homeowner association for the common interest development where appellants james and kimberly carson own properties.almanor sought to impose fines and related fees of on the carsons for alleged rule violations related to the carsons leasing of their properties as vacation rentals.the carsons disputed both the fines and almanor authority to enforce those rules,which the carsons viewed as unlawful and unfair use restrictions on their commercially zoned properties.almanor sued,contending that its enforcement of rules against the carsons was proper under governing law and the covenants,conditions and restrictions cc rs for the development.the carsons for breach of contract,private nuisance,and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage.the carsons contended their properties were exempt based on contract and equitable principles and argued almanor actions amounted to an unlawful campaign to fine them out of business.
following a bench trial,the court ruled against the carsons on their but also rejected as unreasonable many of the fines that almanor had sought to impose.the court upheld a subset of the fines pertaining to the use of almanor boat slips and ordered the carsons to pay almanor in damages.on the parties competing motions for attorney fees,the court determined almanor to be the prevailing party and awarded in attorney fees and costs.
on appeal,the carsons challenge the disposition of their and the award of attorney fees in favor of almanor.the carsons contend that uncontroverted evidence supported a finding in favor of their breach of contract cause of action because they paid almanor in fines that the court ultimately disallowed.the carsons also contend that the trial court abused its discretion when it deemed almanor the prevailing party despite having disallowed a majority of the fines it sought to impose.the carsons also challenge the amount of the attorney fees award in light of almanor limited success at trial.almanor responds that the carsons have waived any appeal of alleged error in the court finding on damages because they failed to raise the issue in response to the trial court proposed statement of decision.as to the award of attorney fees,almanor argues that the court correctly determined it to be the prevailing party and did not abuse its discretion in awarding almanor full fees.for the reasons stated here,we will affirm the judgment as to the carsons,the determination of almanor as prevailing party,and the award of attorney fees.
factual and procedural history 
history of the properties and underlying dispute 
the kokanee lodge and carson chalets are located within the almanor lakeside villa development on lake almanor in plumas county almanor is a homeowners association operating under the davis stirling common interest development act davis stirling act,codified at sections of the civil code formerly.the lodge and two chalets the properties are among only a few lots in the almanor development that accommodate commercial use the development otherwise is strictly residential.the properties commercial designation stems from the historic use of the lodge,which preexisted the subdivision and operated as a hunting,fishing,and vacation lodge.
the carsons purchased the properties in and for use as short term vacation rentals.the properties are subject to the cc rs of the almanor development.as relevant to this appeal,section of the cc rs designated certain lots,including the properties,that could be utilized for commercial or residential purposes.section prohibited owners from using their lots for transient or hotel purposes or renting for any period less than days.section also required owners to report any tenants to almanor board of directors by notifying the board of the name and address of any tenant and the duration of the lease.
in approximately,the almanor board changed composition and began to develop regulations to enforce the cc rs.by way of example,the rules sought to enforce section of the cc rs to limit rentals to a minimum of days.the and rules exempted the commercial lots from the day rental restriction but maintained the requirement to provide a copy of any rental agreement to the association seven days before the rental period.the rules also purported to regulate other aspects of association life affecting the properties,such as parking,trash storage,use of common areas,and issuing decals for any boats using almanor boat slips.and they set a schedule of fines for violations.
the carsons believed their properties were exempt from the use restrictions of the cc rs,including the section restriction on short term rentals and the related reporting requirements.several historic factors supported this belief,including that the carsons had operated the properties as a short term vacation rental business for many years.the carsons similarly did not believe that the rules adopted by the board in,and applied to their properties.
although the carsons initially tried to comply with the renter reporting requirements,they continued to insist that section of the cc rs and the commercial status of the properties exempted them from the use restrictions and related rules.the board issued its first fines against the carsons in september,and continued to fine the carsons throughout and for a wide range of purported violations,which the carsons disputed.
the carsons had stopped paying homeowner association dues on the properties for about two years,for reasons unrelated to the dispute over fines.in june,the carsons paid toward delinquent dues on the properties,instructing that all of the money be applied to unpaid dues,not to the disputed fines.they stated in writing that the lump payment brought them current on dues.at trial,the parties disagreed whether the june payment actually covered the balance of dues that the carsons owed.according to the carsons,almanor improperly applied of the payment toward the fines imposed in.almanor insisted that a balance of unpaid dues remained and was reflected on the following months bills to the carsons,along with the unpaid fines,attorney fees,and accruing interest.
trial court proceedings 
in its trial brief,almanor estimated that the carsons owed about in dues,fees,fines and interest.having for damages and equitable relief based on breach of contract,private nuisance,and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage,the carsons sought to establish that almanor imposition of fines was totally unlawful,arbitrary and unfair,and reflected an effort to try to fine the carson sic business out of existence.they argued that the cc rs clearly do not contemplate the commercial businesses that sit on the subdivision land.in fact,these commercial lots are exempt by contract,based on principles of waiver,and by public policy.the carsons asserted that they have been nearly put out of business and,even if cross defendant conduct halts now,they will have immense lost income for the next years.
after a bench trial,the court issued its tentative decision.it concluded that the day minimum rental restriction imposed by section of the cc rs presented an obvious conflict with section,which expressly allow ed the carsons to use their lots for commercial purposes presumably including lodging,since the properties are,in fact,lodges.citing nahrstedt lakeside village condominium cal th,nahrstedt,the trial court determined that it would be unreasonable to strictly enforce the absolute use restrictions against the carsons.it explained given the conflict between section and,the general rule espoused in nahrstedt,that a use restriction in an association recorded cc rs is presumed to be reasonable and will be enforced uniformly against all residents of the common interest development,should not apply.the court noted,however,that it did not accept the carsons argument that the conflict completely eliminates almanor ability to impose reasonable use restrictions on the carsons lots,consistent with the carsons right to use their lots for commercial lodging purposes.
of the fines imposed in,and,the court concluded only the fines pertaining to the of almanor boat decals were reasonable.those fines amounted to,including late charges and interest.the court did not find adequate support for almanor claim that the carsons continued to owe unpaid dues.as to the carsons,the court found they had not proven by competent evidence that almanor alleged breaches of the cc rs caused damages or resulted in discernible lost profits.
the carsons requested a statement of decision,asking whether they had suffered damages based on a former renter decision not to return to the properties after alleged mistreatment by almanor board members,and whether violations relating to boat slips and decals had been properly imposed.the court issued a proposed statement of decision,to which neither party responded,followed by a final statement of decision and judgment.the final statement of decision was consistent with the tentative decision and repeated the court findings regarding the applicability of reasonable use restrictions to the carsons properties.on the,the court concluded that even assuming almanor had breached the cc rs,the carsons had not proven damages.the carsons were ordered to pay in damages to almanor,and they received nothing on their.
cross motions for attorney fees and costs 
the parties moved for attorney fees and costs pursuant to the fees provision of the davis stirling act,civil code section formerly.civil code section awards attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party in an action to enforce the cc rs of a common interest development.
each side argued it was the prevailing party under the statute.because the statement of decision confirmed that the properties commercial zoning did not preclude reasonable use restrictions in the cc rs,almanor argued that it had achieved one of its main litigation objectives.almanor also argued that having prevailed on a portion of the fines claimed,an attorney fees award was mandatory under the davis stirling act.
the carsons asserted that they had achieved their main objective,which was to deny almanor the financial windfall it sought and to establish that the fines were unreasonable and imposed a severe and unfair burden on their lawful,commercial use of the properties.they also argued that monetarily,almanor had prevailed as to only out of.the carsons asserted that this net monetary recovery was insufficient because they had largely prevailed on the pivotal issue at stake.both sides challenged the other request for fees as unreasonable and excessive.
the trial court held a hearing and took the motions under submission.in a brief written order,it deemed almanor the prevailing party.the court granted almanor motion for in attorney fees and in costs and denied the carsons motion.the court annotated the final judgment to reflect the in attorney fees and costs,in addition to the in damages.
ii.discussion 
the carsons appeal presents three distinct issues.we first consider whether the trial court erred in disposing of the carsons cause of action for breach of contract.we then consider the parties competing claims for attorney fees and whether the trial court erred in deeming almanor the prevailing party.last we consider whether the trial court abused its discretion in awarding almanor its full attorney fees.
disposition of the carsons cause of action for breach of contact 
the carsons challenge the trial court determination that they failed to prove damages for their breach of contract cause of action.almanor argues that the carsons waived any alleged error regarding contract damages by failing to raise the issue in response to the court tentative decision.
standard of review 
on appeal from a determination of failure of proof at trial,the question for the reviewing court is whether the evidence compels a finding in favor of the appellant as a matter of law.sonic manufacturing technologies,aae systems,th,sonic.specifically,we must determine whether the appellant evidence was uncontradicted and unimpeached and of such a character and weight as to leave no room for a judicial determination that it was insufficient to support a finding.id.at quoting in re th.we are also guided by the principle that the trial court judgment is presumed to be correct on appeal,and we indulge all intendments and presumptions in favor of its correctness.in re marriage of arceneaux cal d,arceneaux.
almanor contends the carsons failed to preserve for appeal the issue of damages from fines paid,which according to almanor is actually a claim for offset almanor points to arceneaux,in which the california supreme court clarified the procedural basis for the presumption on appeal that a judgment or order of a lower court is correct.arceneaux,at.the court in arceneaux held that pursuant to code of civil procedure section a litigant who fails to point the trial court to alleged deficiencies in the court statement of decision waives the right to assert those deficiencies as errors on appeal arceneaux,at.because the carsons failed to raise the alleged error regarding damages when the court issued its proposed statement of decision,almanor argues that any assertion of error is waived.the carsons respond that arceneaux and section are inapposite because their appeal is not based on an issue that was omitted or treated ambiguously in the statement of decision.
we agree that arceneaux is of limited application because the carsons appeal as to this issue is premised on an unambiguous factual finding in the statement of decision.a trial court statement of decision need not address all the legal and factual issues raised by the parties it is sufficient that it set forth its ultimate findings,such as on an element of a claim or defense.yield dynamics,tea systems th.here the court statement of decision did not specifically reference the damages claim now asserted by the carsons,but the court did address the element of damages,finding that it had not been proven by competent evidence inasmuch as the trial court stated its finding on damages and did not omit the issue or treat it ambiguously,the carsons failure to identify deficiencies in that aspect of the proposed statement of decision did not result in waiver of the type discussed in arceneaux,supra,at pp.
because the carsons never asked the trial court to make specific findings on the theory of damages they now appeal,the doctrine of implied findings remains applicable.that is,we presume that the trial court made the necessary factual findings in support of its ultimate finding on damages.fladeboe american isuzu motors th,appellate court infers all necessary factual findings in support of prevailing party on issue to support judgment,then reviews the implied findings under substantial evidence standard.we turn to a review of those findings.
the carsons proof of damages 
to support their contention that the trial court erred in finding insufficient proof of damages on their breach of contract cause of action,the carsons draw on the court findings that most of the fines imposed by almanor were unreasonable.the carsons assert that because almanor imposed fines ultimately disallowed by the court,they must have proven a breach of the cc rs.they further assert that evidence of their payment of a portion of those fines was uncontroverted.the carsons point to their june payment of to bring the dues current on their properties and argue that almanor applied to fines the court determined were not owed.they argue that their payment constituted cognizable,measurable damage equivalent to the amount paid,plus interest.the carsons argue that instead of considering this proof,the court focused solely on the carsons evidence pertaining to loss of business income,which the court ultimately concluded was too speculative.
it is uncontroverted that the carsons paid almanor a lump sum of intended to bring current the dues on the properties.however,whether this amount in fact paid the dues in full,or whether some went toward fines that ultimately were disallowed,is difficult to discern from the record.the trial court concluded as much when it reviewed the same evidence in connection with almanor open book stated cause of action.almanor used the same accounting and billing statements to try to prove its position on unpaid dues as the carsons have cited on appeal as evidence that almanor applied toward disallowed fines.the court statement of decision demonstrated a careful review of this evidence and concluded the court can not,with any confidence,discern the amount of dues owed by the carsons at any given time.although it is undisputed that the carsons fell behind at some point on their association dues,and that they made several large payments to almanor to pay off some component of what they owed,the court finds that almanor has failed to carry its burden of proving the amount owed on dues,which is a necessary element of their open book cause of action with respect to the dues component of any damage award.
moreover,the trial record does not reveal that the carsons articulated this theory of contract damages.for example,in the of almanor accountant,who was responsible for almanor billing during the relevant period in,counsel did not raise the issue of being improperly applied to fines.at closing argument on the,the record reflects no mention of this payment as a basis for contract damages.the damages case instead centered on the carsons attempt to show lost profits and loss of business goodwill.at one point the trial court asked,where are the damages,the monetary damages associated with that alleged breach of contract the carsons response referenced attorney fees to enforce the cc rs,interference with quiet enjoyment,and lost customers.
the only mention of the payment appeared in the carsons supplemental written closing argument,in which they argued that almanor intentionally,or recklessly mislabeled rental violations as s pecial a ssessments,resulting in almanor paying rental violations instead of the dues as requested and required.that argument is not evidence sufficient to compel a finding that the carsons suffered financial loss as a result of almanor alleged breach of the cc rs.bookout state of california ex rel.of transportation th,where the judgment is against the party with the burden of proof,it is almost impossible to prevail on appeal by arguing the evidence compels a judgment in that party favor.the documentary evidence,which lacks any corroborating testimony to establish that almanor shifted of dues payment toward disallowed fines,does not satisfy the test for uncontradicted and unimpeached evidence that leaves no room for a judicial determination that it was insufficient to support the finding that the carsons seek.sonic,supra,th at.
on this record,the trial court finding that the carsons failed to establish damages by competent evidence was sound,and the carsons have not shown that evidence presented to the trial court should have compelled a contrary outcome.
determination of the prevailing party and award of attorney fees 
the carsons and almanor both claim to be the prevailing party,triggering an attendant award of fees and costs.the carsons also contend that public policy and fairness require a reversal of the attorney fees award.
statutory scheme 
the davis stirling act governs an action to enforce the recorded covenants and restrictions of a common interest development.civil code section provides that the cc rs may be enforced as equitable servitudes and that i n an action to enforce the governing documents,the prevailing party shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs,subds.a,c.reviewing courts have found that this provision of the davis stirling act reflect s a legislative intent that the prevailing party receive attorney fees as a matter of right and that the trial court is therefore obligated to award attorney fees whenever the statutory conditions have been satisfied.salehi surfside iii condominium owners th,salehi emphasis in original citing hsu abbara cal th,hsu.
the davis stirling act does not define prevailing party or provide a rubric for that determination.in the absence of statutory guidance,california courts have analyzed analogous fee provisions and concluded that the test for prevailing party is a pragmatic one,namely whether a party prevailed on a practical level by achieving its main litigation objectives.heather farms homeowners robinson th,heather farms salehi,supra,at pp.
the california supreme court implicitly has confirmed this test.in villa de las palmas homeowners terifaj cal th,the court affirmed the award of attorney fees in an action to enforce a restrictive covenant under the davis stirling act,stating we conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the association was the prevailing party on a practical level citation,the association achieved its main litigation objective.ibid.quoting heather farms,at and rancho santa fe dolan king th.
determination of the prevailing party 
we review the trial court determination of the prevailing party for abuse of discretion.villa de las palmas homeowners terifaj,supra,at heather farms,at.the appropriate test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason.when two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts,the reviewing court has no authority to substitute its decision for that of the trial court.goodman lozano cal th.as the california supreme court has explained in the related context of determining the prevailing party on a contract under civil code section,the trial court should compare the relief awarded on the contract claim or claims with the parties demands on those same claims and their litigation objectives as disclosed by the pleadings,trial briefs,opening statements,and similar sources.the prevailing party determination is to be made by a comparison of the extent to which each party ha s succeeded and failed to succeed in its contentions.hsu,supra,at.
the carsons urge that they,not almanor,attained their litigation objectives.they argue that but for their success in defeating most of the fines imposed by almanor,they would have continued to face additional fines,making it impossible to continue to operate their business.they also argue that the trial court erred by focusing on net monetary recovery in determining who was the prevailing party.
in support of their position,the carsons cite sears baccaglio th sears,in which the guarantor of a lease sued to recover on a payment that he had made on the guaranty,which he contended was invalidated by a revocation.the defendant for additional money under the guaranty.id.at.the trial court found that the guaranty was valid but that the plaintiff was entitled to recover some plus interest because of payments the defendant had received in relation to the lease.id.at pp.notwithstanding the plaintiff monetary recovery,the trial court deemed the defendant the prevailing party under the applicable fee provision and awarded attorney fees and costs.ibid.the court of appeal affirmed the award,explaining the complaint and record demonstrate enforcement of the guaranty was the pivotal issue.plaintiff received money not because the court found defendant liable for breach of contract.instead,the court ordered defendant to return a portion of plaintiff payment because of the fortuitous circumstances surrounding defendant receipt of other payments related to the lease.sears,at.
whereas the pivotal issue in searswas enforcement of the guaranty,the pivotal issue here was whether almanor fines were enforceable under the cc rs and governing body of california law.it is true that the carsons prevailed to the extent of the fines that the court disallowed that partial success substantially lowered the carsons liability for damages and supported their position that the cc rs and associated rules could not impose an unreasonable burden on the properties.yet by upholding a subset of the fines,the court ruled more broadly that almanor could impose reasonable use restrictions on the carsons properties,despite their authorized commercial use.that ruling echoed almanor stated objective at trial that the association sought to counter the carsons position that because their lot is zoned commercial,they are not bound by the cc r or the rules.
the mixed results here are distinguishable from those in sears,in which there was a clear win by the defendant on the pivotal issue of the guaranty,and the monetary award was fortuitous and unrelated to the determination of liability.sears,supra,at.where both sides achieved some positive net effect as a result of the court rulings,we compare the practical effect of the relief attained by each.hsu,supra,at.here,the trial court findings eliminated many of the alleged rule violations that depended on the carsons being in arrears on dues and rejected those fines by which almanor tried to strictly enforce the absolute use restrictions on the carsons lots.insofar as the court found that some of the fines were enforceable,almanor met its objective and satisfied the first part of the statutory criteria under the davis stirling act to enforce the governing documents,subd.c.the fractional damages award does not negate the broader,practical effect of the court ruling,which on the one hand narrowed the universe of restrictions that almanor could impose on the properties,but on the other hand cemented almanor authority to promulgate and enforce rules pursuant to the cc rs so long as not unreasonable under nahrstedt.thus the trial court rejected the carsons position that the ambiguity in the cc rs completely eliminate d almanor ability to impose reasonable use restrictions on the carsons lots,consistent with the carsons right to use their lots for commercial lodging purposes.the court also ruled entirely in favor of almanor on the carsons by finding that the carsons alleged damages were unsupported by competent evidence and too speculative.
taken together and viewed in relation to the parties objectives as reflected in the pleadings and trial record,we conclude that these outcomes were adequate to support the trial court ruling goodman lozano,supra,cal th at.in reviewing a decision for abuse of discretion,we do not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court when more than one inference can be reasonably deduced from the facts.ibid.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining almanor to be the prevailing party.
public policy 
the carsons argue that the fee award flouts public policy because it creates disincentive for homeowners to defend against unlawful fines levied by the association,and rewards the association for acting in an egregious manner by imposing fines that were,for the most part,unlawful.the carsons suggest that by granting attorney fees to almanor,the court is stating that the carsons should have paid the that respondent claimed was owed,even though only was actually owed,because they would be penalized for defending themselves and,in the end,owe an additional in attorney fees for defending themselves.the carsons offer no direct authority to support their position but contend that this outcome contradicts california public policy which seeks to ensure that creditors do not overcharge debtors for amounts not owed 
this argument runs contrary to the statutory scheme governing the fee award in this case.as the trial court correctly noted at the hearing on the competing motions for attorney fees,the davis stirling act mandates the award of attorney fees to the prevailing party,salehi,supra,th at language of,reflects legislative intent to award attorney fees as a matter or right when statutory criteria are satisfied.after resolving the threshold issue of the prevailing party,the trial court had no discretion to deny attorney fees.salehi,at.any argument concerning the magnitude of the fees award,especially in comparison to the damages awarded or originally sought,is better directed at challenging the reasonableness of the award amount.the amount to be awarded is distinct from whether an award is justified,and the factors relating to each must not be intertwined or merged.graciano robinson ford sales,th,quoting flannery california highway patrol th.
reasonableness of the fee award 
the remaining question is whether the attorney fees award of was reasonable.what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court.plcm group,drexler cal th,plcm group.an appellate court will interfere with the trial court determination of the amount of reasonable attorney fees only where there has been a manifest abuse of discretion.heritage pacific financial,llc monroy th,monroy.
the carsons argue that the trial court abused its discretion by awarding fees which are grossly disproportionate to the monetary award and scale of success on the claims litigated the carsons point to section,subdivision a for the proposition that the court,in its discretion,can disallow attorney fees and costs if a party obtains less than the statutory minimum to be classified as an unlimited civil matter.yet their briefs on appeal offer no case or other authority to support the proposed application of section,subdivision a to a mandatory fees award under civil code section.
the carsons also argue that the trial court should have apportioned the award to reflect the court rejection of all but a single category of fines imposed,representing eight out of fines.again,the carsons fail to cite any authority to support a reduction based on the degree of success in a davis stirling act case.we observe that it is counsel duty by argument and citation of authority to show in what respects rulings complained of are erroneous.wint fidelity casualty cal d.although we will not treat the carsons arguments as waived,we caution that an appellate brief should contain a legal argument with citation of authorities on the points made.if none is furnished on a particular point,the court may treat it as waived,and pass it without consideration.mansell board of administration th,quoting in re marriage of schroeder d.
almanor does not respond to these arguments on appeal,though it argued in its attorney fees motion that when an owner association seeks to enforce cc rs and attains its litigation objective,based on the mandatory nature of the fee award,it is irrelevant that the amount is below.
discretion to reduce or eliminate fees under section 
under section,subdivision a,if a plaintiff brings an unlimited civil action and recovers a judgment within the jurisdictional limit for a limited civil action,the trial court has the discretion to deny,in whole or in part,costs to the plaintiff carter cohen th,chavez city of los angeles cal th,chavez.section relates to the general cost recovery provisions set forth in the code of civil procedure.we briefly consider its applicability to the recovery of attorney fees under the davis stirling act.
in chavez,the california supreme court examined the application of section,subdivision a to an action brought under the california fair employment and housing act feha,which grants the trial court discretion to award attorney fees to a prevailing party.chavez,at pp.the court in chavez held that by its plain meaning,section,subdivision a applies in the feha context and gives the trial court discretion to deny attorney fees to a plaintiff who prevails under feha but recovers an amount that could have been recovered in a limited civil case.chavez,at.the court explained w e perceive no irreconcilable conflict between section a and the feha attorney fee provision.in exercising its discretion under section a to grant or deny litigation costs,including attorney fees,to a plaintiff who has recovered feha damages in an amount that could have been recovered in a limited civil case,the trial court must give due consideration to the policies and objectives of the feha and determine whether denying attorney fees,in whole or in part,is consistent with those policies and objectives.chavez,at.
the reasoning of chavez is of limited applicability here.unlike the fee provision under feha,which is discretionary and thereby not irreconcilable with section,subdivision a,the provision of the davis stirling act is mandatory,salehi,supra,th at.the circumstances in which a court might deny or reduce a fee award under a permissive statutory provision,like feha,such as because special circumstances would render an award unjust,do not apply equally where a statute mandates attorney fees to the
