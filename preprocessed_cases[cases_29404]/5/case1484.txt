this is the second time we have heard an appeal in this case.in the previous appeal,liquid dynamics ld contested the claim construction and summary judgment of entered against it.liquid dynamics vaughan,ld i.in that decision,we found error in the district court claim construction,vacated the grant of summary judgment,and remanded for proceedings based on the revised claim construction.id.
on remand,the district court held a jury trial to determine whether vaughan company,vaughan infringed claims and of patent the patent and whether the patent was valid.on october,the jury returned a verdict that vaughan had infringed the patent,that the infringement was willful,and that vaughan failed to prove that the patent was invalid.the jury awarded damages to ld in the amount of.
subsequently,the district court held a bench trial on vaughan allegation of inequitable conduct,but granted ld motion for judgment as a matter of law on that issue at the close of evidence.final judgment was entered on november,and the district court subsequently denied vaughan jmol and motions on the issues of invalidity,infringement,and willfulness.thereafter,the district court granted,in part,ld motions for enhanced damages and attorney fees.the court trebled the jury damage award based upon the jury willfulness finding and vaughan behavior as a litigant.separately,the court awarded attorney fees amounting to.the court also entered a permanent injunction on february.
vaughan now appeals the district court denial of its jmol motion for,invalidity,no willful infringement,and unenforceability due to inequitable conduct.further,vaughan appeals the district court orders for a permanent injunction,enhanced damages,and attorney fees.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
the patent involves a system of pumps that stir mixtures of solids and liquids in large tanks.the invention is primarily directed to applications for mixing wastewater and manure.because we have already detailed the invention and its background in ld i,we reproduce only a summary of the relevant facts below 
this case involves the structure of slurry tanks.slurry tanks are used to store and process chemicals and organic waste products,manure that retain value as useful inputs,fertilizer into other processes.large storage tanks house these waste compounds in liquid or semisolid form between their production and their subsequent use.the liquid and solid components of these waste compounds tend to separate when stored,with solid particles either forming a crust on the top of the tank falling to the bottom of the tank.productive use of the stored compound requires remixing both to suspend the heavy solid particles within the liquid and to ensure that the resulting suspension is uniform.one standard approach has been to stir the mix continuously to avoid settling.because continuous mixing can be expensive,however,tank designers sought ways to store the mixtures in a still tank,to allow the settling to occur,and to remix only when necessary for use.the patent addressed these concerns.
a.the patent 
claims and are the contested claims in this case.the patent recites a method and apparatus for handling wastewater slurries a storage tank equipped with submerged agitators capable of generating a flow of liquid throughout the tank.with the relevant language underlined,claim reads 
apparatus for storing a slurry having solid and liquid components,comprising 
a storage tank defining a volume for holding a body of liquid and solid slurry components,including a floor of generally circular configuration and having a center,said storage tank further including an outer surrounding wall positioned generally at a radial distance from the center 
at least two flow generating means positioned to be submerged within the liquid and solid slurry components for generating flow of at least one of the slurry components along a rotational direction,each of said flow generating means being disposed at distances from the center ranging between approximately percent and percent of said radial distance 
each of said first and second flow generating means being pointed toward the outer surrounding wall for generating a substantial helical flow path of the liquid and solid components therein with the liquid and solid components traveling outwardly,across the tank floor from the center portion of the tank toward the tank wall and then upwardly along the tank outer surrounding wall to a first point and then inwardly along an upper portion of the body toward the center of the tank and then downwardly toward the tank floor,and then outwardly to a second point spaced circumferentially in the direction of rotation of the entire body of liquid,the liquid and solid components continuing to travel in the helical path as the entire body of liquid and solid components continues to rotate 
a pressure source coupled to the first and second flow generating means to generate directed streams from the flow generating means to rotate the body of liquid and solid components and to cause the flow in the helical path and 
said flow generating means creating a substantially volume filling flow of at least one of the slurry components within said storage tank which mixes the liquid and solid slurry components to form a substantially homogeneous slurry suitable for unloading from said storage tank using liquid handling devices.
patent,emphases added.in ld i,we construed the term substantial helical flow to be all flow patterns that are generally,though not necessarily perfectly,spiral,and that fill much,though not necessarily all,of the tank volume.ld i,at.claim includes the relevant terms from claim.the written description includes the following examples of tank arrangement and helical flow path.
in figure,impellers or pumps that are placed within the claimed radii of and create the substantial helical flow as shown in figures and.
prior art and activities 
the inventors named in the patent,james crump and bruce doyle,were dealers for the smith corporation and sold smith tank agitation system containing a single,rotatable agitator nozzle,known as the slurrystore system.according to crump,in the inventors first became involved with the slurrystore system when smith asked them to help move a tank from a farm to a wastewater treatment plant in plymouth,indiana.
commonwealth engineering,plymouth engineering firm,redesigned the tank for use in the wastewater plant by moving the original agitator away from the tank center and adding a second agitator that was placed on the same radial line on the same side of the tank.the first and second agitators were placed at a distance of approximately and percent respectively,from the tank center to the wall.the nozzles were designed to rotate in position so that the workers could agitate different sections and clean out the tank when needed.according to crump,this new design did not help the mixing because the tank slurry was still only agitated in zones and not throughout the whole tank.at startup,the plymouth tank did not operate properly until flow reducers were installed on the nozzles to impart more energy into the liquid volume.ld presented a video tape made in january of showing that flow occurred in only one section of the plymouth tank and not the entire tank.
in the summer and fall of,crump and doyle designed and sold the next relevant tank system to a hog processing plant called indiana packers.ld claims the indiana packers tank was the same as the plymouth tank and did not embody the invention claimed by the patent.crump diagrams and testimony suggest that the indiana packers tank was similar in layout to plymouth and,like plymouth,only mixed the liquid in zones.
in april of,the inventors submitted a proposal to smith asking that a patent application be filed for their invention for zone mixing within the indiana packers and plymouth tanks.smith declined to develop the proposal because it appeared that the invention,as described,was not patentable.crump testified that in february of,he and doyle began to develop the idea for mixing throughout the entire tank volume instead of just mixing in one zone at a time,as the plymouth and indiana packers designs provided.the patent,incorporating the concept of flow,was filed on may.although the original application did not claim a substantially helical flow path,it was later amended to claim such a flow path.
crump further testified that on may,he offered to sell another system for antibiotic industrial waste to eli lilly just after the critical date.according to crump,the eli lilly system was not only offered after the critical date,its nozzle placement was not even within the limitations of the patent.at the time the patent was filed,the plymouth,indiana packers,and eli lilly tanks had been installed.
infringement evidence 
vaughan business history 
vaughan designs and manufactures chopper pumps,which are used to mix solid materials in large tanks.it claims to have supplied ld with pumps for many years.vaughan also claims that it was in the business of mixing designs,decades before the patent,with its chopper pump design called scumbuster.
vaughan and ld relationship soured when vaughan began manufacturing floor mounted systems and bid on a tank for the city of augusta,georgia.ld claims to have been negotiating with augusta in late to supply augusta with its jetmix system,the commercial product covered by the patent.in december of,ld terminated flichard behnke,a sales engineer who had been intimately involved with the augusta design and negotiations.soon thereafter,behnke was hired by vaughan and submitted engineering drawings for nozzle layouts to augusta,which vaughan presented as its flotamix system.ld claims these drawings were directly copied by behnke from ld previous engineering drawings.ld also includes statements from glenn dorsch,vaughan chief engineer and vice president,stating 
what is planned and requested is for us to remove the ld jetmix nozzles from the drawings and put in our own floor mounts this should be very easy for wade to do,once we get final orientations from rich behnke.
vaughan notes that even though the nozzles were located in the same place,they constituted a special design.thus,whereas the ld jetmix design had six nozzles,vaughan design had twelve.
vaughan business records as infringement evidence.
ld confronted vaughan with allegations of infringement of the patent,and in june of,vaughan consulted with patent counsel to evaluate the patent and vaughan potentially infringing rotamix design.at about the same time,vaughan commissioned aea technology to perform two different computational fluid dynamics cfd studies to analyze the flow patterns in its tanks.the first study,labeled,evaluated a generic tank that was high.the second,labeled,was a study conducted for a proposed tank at merced,california that demonstrated the tank mixing capabilities to the city engineer.dorsch testified that these studies were representative of the flow patterns generated by vaughan rotamix systems.
vaughan provided patent counsel with these studies to assist in forming an opinion relative to infringement.based on the cfd studies and the tank designs,patent counsel rendered an opinion for vaughan concluding that its rotamix design did not infringe the patent because it did not produce substantially helical flow.
ld relies on vaughan cfd studies as evidence of both infringement and willfulness.the report not only shows toroidial flow in the vertical plane with downward velocity in the center of the tank and upward velocity at the walls of the tank,but it also indicates there was a concern over terrodial sic flow.moreover,as ld notes,the author of the report explained that the momentum from the nozzles pushes the fluid to the side walls of the tank and then changes direction and heads up the side walls.ld own expert,lueptow,relied on these same vertical vector plots to express a similar opinion that vaughan tanks generate helical flow.
structure evidence 
next,ld relies on testimony regarding the structure of vaughan designs and their similarity to the patent claims.dorsch,vaughan chief engineer and its technical expert at trial,testified that the vaughan engineering manual included specifications and drawings showing vaughan regular method of installation.vaughan did not keep accurate records of each of the allegedly infringing installations.ld technical expert gillette,a wastewater treatment engineer,reviewed the engineering records for all of the accused systems,prepared a report establishing the parameters of each installation,and testified regarding the systems and any missing installation data.
vaughan correctly points out that gillette report lacks nozzle placement nozzle angle data for of the systems.however,dorsch testified that if records on construction were missing it would be reasonable to assume that the installation was in accordance with the standard procedure described in vaughan engineering manual.
ld cfd analysis 
ld contends that vaughan installations infringe the patent.since some installations are duplicates,there are unique tank designs.of these,vaughan argues that there is insufficient evidence to prove that two contested claim elements are present in the accused tanks,namely substantial helical flow and rotation of the entire body.in addition to vaughan business records and its own cfd analysis,ld relies heavily on lueptow expert opinion.his opinion concludes that each of the installments infringe by recreating the substantially helical flow path.ld supports lueptow conclusions with the following evidence in the record vaughan two cfd studies for the generic and merced tanks ld prelitigation cfd study modeling the merced tank observation of a tank in argos,indiana and lueptow own cfd analysis of nine tank configurations representative of various vaughan installations.
lueptow performed his own cfd analysis of the vaughan systems using the same software vaughan had used in its own cfd studies however,he did not recreate each of the tanks at issue in this case because cfds are very time intensive.instead,he modeled the flows in nine representative tanks with various tank sizes and nozzle configurations depending on different vaughan designs.lueptow based these models on the vaughan engineering manual and gillette testimony.gillette had testified that there was information missing in the record detailing some tank characteristics but that he nonetheless had sufficient information to summarize the tank characteristics for flow modeling.
lueptow cfd work resulted in different graphical plots consisting of and vector plots.the vector plots detailed the overall flow path and magnitude in the horizontal and vertical planes.the plots estimated the path an individual particle travels within the tank.lueptow concluded that the vaughan systems were very robust and would produce the helical flow despite small changes to each tank.he opined that his representative systems and tanks allowed him to render an opinion on all tanks.this opinion,based on the nine cfd models lueptow created,the vaughan data from merced and a generic tank,and ld merced model,was that infringing helical and flow is present in all models.
during trial,vaughan challenged lueptow analysis maintaining that the plots simulated conditions just mere seconds after pump startup and that this could not be sufficient evidence of helical and rotational flow during flow.lueptow,however,testified that his models were sufficient to determine that helical and rotational flow existed despite the fact that only to iterations were performed.

we review the denial of a jmol de novo.juicy whip,orange bang.upon review,we consider whether the jury verdict is supported by substantial evidence.id.in other words,we ask whether the record taken as a whole would support the verdict in the mind of a reasonable person.id.it is not our duty,however,to reevaluate the weight or credibility of the evidence.comark commc ns,harris.

infringement evidence 
vaughan first alleged error is that ld presented insufficient evidence that each of the accused installations infringed.first,it explains that ld did not present sufficient evidence that of the installations met the required nozzle placement and nozzle angle limitations required by claims and.second,vaughan argues that ld computer simulations presented at trial were inaccurate and therefore did not provide evidence of infringement.third,vaughan contends that there is no evidence vaughan knew or intended that of its systems,which are located outside the united states,indirectly infringe.
tank structure limitations 
the patent requires that the tank nozzles be placed within to percent of the tank annular radius and that the nozzle angle be sufficient to generate flows that impart a rotational movement of the entire body of liquid.patent,ll.vaughan explains that the structural data compiled by gillette do not provide nozzle angles for installations and do not provide radial distances and relative nozzle placements for of those installations.further,it points out that dorsch testified to his knowledge of four installations with nozzles located outside the annular regions claimed by the patent.
ld agrees that of the tanks had some missing structural information however,it submits dorsch testimony stating that even where there is missing information,one could generally reconstruct a tank using the specification in the vaughan engineering manual.moreover,it contends that the vaughan engineering manual shows nozzle placement within the claim limitations and that one drawing is almost an exact duplicate of the augusta installation.
our task on appeal is to determine whether the jury could reasonably have inferred from the engineering manual and dorsch testimony that installations infringe even though some structural data is missing from vaughan records.ld argues this was a reasonable weighing of the evidence that is exclusively within the province of the jury.we agree.
a patentee may prove direct infringement or inducement of infringement by either direct or circumstantial evidence.moleculon research cbs.there is no requirement that direct evidence be introduced,nor is a jury preference for circumstantial evidence over direct evidence unreasonable per se.see fuji photo film jazz photo,moleculon research,at noting it is hornbook law that direct evidence of a fact is not necessary see also michalic cleveland tankers,d circumstantial evidence is not only sufficient,but may also be more certain,satisfying and persuasive than direct evidence.though dorsch testified that four tanks were outside the scope of the patent claims,the jury could reasonably have discredited that evidence and given more weight to the circumstantial evidence of the vaughan engineering manual,which was created before litigation began.similarly,the jury could reasonably rely on the engineering manual and complete records for the remaining vaughan designs to infer that the missing information on tanks also had infringing structural components.
both parties argue that the other should have submitted additional evidence regarding the tank parameters.though it is ld burden to prove infringement,it chose to rely on circumstantial evidence for some installations.while direct evidence may have made ld case of infringement stronger,it does not render the case presented to the jury unreasonable as a matter of law.indeed,the jury could have reasonably inferred from the evidence submitted that each of the tanks infringed the claims.thus,we hold that there is substantial evidence that all accused tanks met the structural limitations of the patent.
computer simulations 
next,vaughan challenges the computer simulations used to establish the claim limitations.vaughan maintains that lueptow simulations were insufficient for two reasons because the parameters used to run the nine different modeled simulations were inaccurate and because the simulations do not show the required helical flow and general body rotation.
lueptow model parameters 
first,vaughan argues that the modeling parameters were inaccurate.it notes specifically that the simulated tank a and tank g groupings in lueptow cfds did not match or approximate many of the known tank parameters such as the height,flow rate,and nozzle diameter.lueptow admitted that these parameters did not match the parameters as vaughan points out,but he also testified that the changes in the nozzle design would do little to disrupt the robust helical flow in the tanks.furthermore,lueptow performed a simulation of the tank d parameters with different nozzle spacing and concluded that even though the parameters changed and some aspects of the flow changed,the helical flow was still present.
vaughan appears to challenge the admissibility and reliability of lueptow expert scientific analysis and opinion.ld argues that our previous opinion reversing the district court grant of summary judgment based on the genuine issue of material fact presented by the vector plots makes the evidence admissible under the doctrine.our previous opinion,ld i,did not directly consider the admissibility of the evidence,only that such evidence would be sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact for trial.at.issues not decided by the court in a prior proceeding are not covered by the doctrine.stearns beckman instruments.therefore,the admissibility of lueptow testimony had not been previously resolved.
vaughan challenges to expert testimony and scientific evidence are analyzed under the supreme court daubert factors.see daubert merrell dow,d.when faced with expert scientific testimony,a district court must first determine whether the expert is proposing to testify to scientific knowledge that will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact at issue.id.at.this requires an assessment of the reasoning and methodology underlying the testimony to determine whether it is scientifically valid.id.in daubert,the supreme court set forth four factors for district courts to consider when evaluating the validity and relevance of scientific evidence pursuant to rule of the federal rules of evidence.id.at.these factors include whether the methodology can and has been tested,whether the methodology is subject to peer review,the potential rate of error,and the general acceptance of the methodology.id.at.the court further noted that the focus of a court inquiry into the relevance and reliability of scientific evidence must be solely on principles and methodology,not on the conclusions that they generate.id.at.
here,vaughan argument focuses on the parameters lueptow applied,not on the reliability of cfd analysis in general.indeed,cfd analysis has been previously recognized in the scientific community and has been recognized as reliable by at least one circuit.see quiet tech,uk,cir.in quiet,the appellant challenged the credibility of cfd analysis for modeling aerodynamic properties in a jet engine.id.at.the appellant argued that the expert used incorrect data or was missing data to run the cfd software and used the wrong equations to run his cfd analysis of the engine aerodynamic properties.id.such a flawed analysis,it argued,made the testimony and evidence unreliable.id.at.the court held that such an attack goes more to the weight of the evidence than to its admissibility.the identification of such flaws in generally reliable scientific evidence is precisely the role of.id.at see also in re tmi,cir so long as the expert testimony rests upon good grounds,it should be tested by the adversary expert testimony and active than excluded from jurors scrutiny for fear that they will not grasp its complexities or satisfactory sic weigh its inadequacies.quoting pepsi cola of puerto rico bottling,cir wilmington case,cir virtually all the inadequacies in the expert testimony urged here by the defendant were brought out forcefully at trial these matters go to the weight of the expert testimony rather than to its admissibility.
here,vaughan challenge goes to the weight of the evidence rather than the admissibility of lueptow testimony and analysis.though he admitted that his models did not exactly match the various accused tanks,this fact was fully discussed on cross examination.as in quiet,his models were not the perfect models of each individual tank,but they were based on reliable scientific methodology and subject to cross examination and the proffering of further scientific analysis by vaughan.we conclude that a reasonable juror could consider lueptow testimony explaining the very robust,helical flow in the models and infer that the similar accused tanks will produce flow similar to the modeled flow.therefore,we will not contravene the province of the jury by reweighing lueptow testimony.
alleged flows 
vaughan challenges do not end with allegations of inaccurate data.it also challenges the relevance of lueptow testimony regarding general rotation of the fluid in combination with the helical flow.vaughan argues that lueptow analysis performed only to iterations,a time frame that it suggests is only a few seconds after pump startup and,therefore,was not enough time to rotate the entire body of fluid.
however,such arguments do not overcome lueptow testimony that there was helical flow and general body rotation in his simulation even after iterations.furthermore,lueptow did not rely solely on his cfd plots,but also on those that were admittedly continued for longer periods of time by vaughan and ld when they simulated the merced and generic tanks at aea technologies.any fault within lueptow opinion was properly covered during cross examination.but,sufficient evidence still existed for a reasonable juror to find infringement.
vaughan last contention with the cfd analysis counters ld reliance on the vertical vector plots from the and reports by presenting an argument that they are unreliable.basically,vaughan argues that movement shown in the vector plots represents the movement of a particle flowing in two planes vertical and horizontal.for purposes of determining helical flow,the vector plot is critical.vaughan explains that the vertical plot shows particles with very little movement in the vertical plane,but much more substantial movement in the horizontal plane.it contends that the vertical vector plot in the report is consistent with a rotational vortex,as in the prior art,rather than helical flow.essentially,it maintains that even though the vertical vector plots look helical,the actual particles are moving like a whirlpool around a common center and that even in that configuration there will be flow upward and downward somewhere in the tank.
while vaughan interpretation could be correct,the evidence presented suggests that the vertical vector plot is subject to different interpretations.there was substantial evidence presented to the jury to suggest that this plot represents a helical pattern.the plot appears to show two vortices on either side of the tank center.while these vortices may be aided by the fluid intake sump in the tank center,it appears clear in this figure that the downward speeds increase towards the pumps.furthermore,for both the and reports,their authors acknowledge that flow vortices do exist in the vertical plane.upon consideration of the evidence,the jury may have had a different interpretation than that postulated by vaughan.there is certainly substantial evidence to support this jury findings.
foreign infringement 
vaughan makes one final argument with respect to infringement under f by six tanks located outside of the united states.it argues that under f there was insufficient evidence that it intended for the foreign purchasers to infringe the patent.pursuant to f,a party may be an infringer if it 
supplies in or from the united states all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention,where such components are uncombined in whole or in part,in such manner as to actively induce the combination of such components outside of the united states in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the united states 
a finding of inducement requires both an underlying instance of direct infringement and a requisite showing of intent.fuji photo film,at.here,although vaughan contends that the requisite intent showing is missing,a patentee may prove intent through circumstantial evidence.id.
accordingly,ld identifies evidence in the record that vaughan knew of the patent after its first sale to augusta.moreover,vaughan hiring of behnke,a former employee with knowledge of the patented design,and dorsch statements indicating that vaughan was relying on nozzle orientations from behnke,support the proposition that vaughan intended for its augusta design to infringe the claims of the patent.furthermore,vaughan engineering manual was sent to its customers and is replete with examples that are similar to the augusta designs.this constitutes circumstantial evidence that vaughan intended for its subsequent buyers,including foreign buyers,to install systems that infringe the claims of the patent.vaughan argues that the engineering manual itself expresses an intent to mix by rotation,such that vaughan dissemination of the manual did not intend its customers to create the infringing helical flow.vaughan arguments ask us to reweigh the evidence,a task reserved for the jury,not this court.see teleflex,ficosa am.thus,we hold that there is substantial evidence to support the jury verdict under f.
invalidity of the patent 
vaughan second allegation of error is that the court should have found the patent invalid because the specification did not disclose the inventor best mode of practicing the invention and did not enable the claims.see bj servs.halliburton energy,eli lilly barr.it argues that the inventors failed to disclose the need for reducers on the tank nozzles and that the specification failed to enable the creation of helical flow in the tank.
vaughan argues that the use of reducers on the tank nozzles was the best mode of practicing the invention,that it was known to the inventors,and that they failed to disclose it in their patent application.vaughan presented evidence that the inventors installed reducers on the plymouth and indiana packers tanks in order to increase flow velocity and impart more momentum into the large tanks.
inventors are required by,to disclose the best mode for practicing their claimed inventions.a finding of patent invalidity based on best mode requires clear and convincing evidence that the inventor both knew of and concealed a better mode of carrying out the claimed invention than that set forth in the specification.teleflex,at.this is a factual test inquiring into whether the inventor subjectively considered a particular mode of practicing the invention to be superior to all other modes at the time of filing the application and whether the inventor adequately disclosed that superior mode.accord eli lilly,at.the best mode requirement does not require the disclosure of routine details that would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art practicing the invention.teleflex,at.known ways of performing a known operation can not be deemed intentionally concealed absent evidence of intent to deliberately withhold that information.high concrete structures,new enter.stone lime.
in light of all the evidence presented on this issue,a reasonable jury could conclude that vaughan failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that ld did not disclose the best mode.first,the patent states that t he jet nozzle units are preferably of a type disclosed in pat.herein incorporated by reference the patent and commercially available from smith,as part of its slurrystore systems.patent,ll.the patent describes a nozzle that discharges a high velocity high volume jet,ll,and a nozzle which is concentrically reduced in diameter in its upward extend,ll.second,crump testified that the ply
