introduction 
the trial court in granting defendants request to strike plaintiffs memorandum of costs seeking attorney fees incurred as the prevailing parties in a prior appeal,a law firm and its two partners,by using an associate in the law firm,had,in effect,represented themselves in the prior appeal.in this appeal,plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in granting the motion to tax costs because the attorney who represented them on appeal was not a partner and otherwise had no financial interest in their law firm.also,plaintiffs contend that,even if the law firm plaintiff can not recover fees for the legal services of the associate,the individual plaintiffs can recover fees attributable to that associate services rendered on their behalf.
in affirming the order denying plaintiffs request for attorney fees for services rendered by the associate to the firm and its partners,we hold that substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that the attorney who represented plaintiffs in the prior appeal was doing so as an associate of the law firm and not as an independent contractor,and,therefore,plaintiffs legally are not entitled to an award of attorney fees and the trial court was justified in concluding that based on the record,the individual plaintiffs could not recover attorney fees in connection with the appeal because there was no showing of any distinction between the against the law firm plaintiff and those against the individual plaintiffs.
procedural background 
defendants and respondents paul cohen and personal injury solutions,filed a against plaintiffs and appellants the law firm of carpenter zuckerman,llp limited liability partnership and its partners,john carpenter and paul zuckerman collectively plaintiffs alleging interference with economic advantage and defamation.the trial court granted plaintiffs special motion to strike that pursuant to code of civil procedure section section the strategic lawsuit against public participation statute.defendants appealed from,inter alia,the orders granting the special motion to strike and awarding attorney fees as costs.we dismissed defendants appeal as untimely and awarded to plaintiffs reasonable attorney fees incurred on appeal pursuant to section,subdivision c as prevailing parties on defendants appeal.
plaintiffs submitted a memorandum of costs in the trial court listing a single item of cost in the amount of for attorneys fees including a lodestar enhancement.at a subsequent hearing,however,the trial court could not locate the cost memorandum in the court file.as a result,plaintiffs filed a motion for an order deeming a new memorandum of costs filed nunc pro tunc.the trial court granted the motion,and defendants then moved to tax costs on the ground that plaintiffs were not entitled to attorney fees because they represented themselves on appeal.
plaintiffs opposed the motion to tax costs and submitted two declarations of attorney candice klein in support of their opposition.in the first of those declarations,klein asserted that plaintiffs retained her to represent them in connection with defendants appeal from the orders striking their and awarding plaintiffs attorney fees.according to klein,she was not a partner in the carpenter zuckerman law firm,had no personal interest in the underlying litigation,and provided legal services to that firm on an independent contractor basis.klein also declared that plaintiffs entered into a contingency fee agreement with her under which she was entitled to any attorney fees awarded to plaintiffs in connection with defendants appeal she declared that she had an relationship with each of the plaintiffs that entitled her to charge for her work.she further declared that she expended hours litigating the appeal on behalf of plaintiffs,that her hourly rate for appellate work was an hour,and that she was entitled to a lodestar enhancement of.based on the number of hours expended and her stated hourly rate,klein calculated that her lodestar amount should be,and that when multiplied by a factor of,plaintiffs were entitled to a total of in attorney fees.
at the hearing on the motion to tax costs,the trial court considered a prior declaration filed by plaintiff john carpenter in that declaration,carpenter stated that candice klein was at all relevant times to this litigation and through the present day remains an associate in my firm.the trial court also considered a copy of a page from the state bar of california website that listed klein address of record as carpenter zuckerman,olympic blvd,beverly hills,ca.based on that evidence,the trial court found klein to be an associate of carpenter zuckerman at the time she represented plaintiffs on the appeal from the order striking defendants.the trial court also concluded that although carpenter and zuckerman were named in their individual capacities in the,there was no indication in the record that there was any potential individual liability,separate and apart from the potential liability of their law firm.accordingly,the trial court in granting plaintiffs motion to tax costs ruled that plaintiffs were not entitled to recover attorney fees because attorneys who represent themselves,or a law firm that represents itself,in litigation can not recover attorney fees based on such representation.the trial court considered and rejected defendants assertion that the decision in gilbert master washer stamping,th gilbert applied to the facts of this case.as discussed below,the court in gilbert held that when an attorney who is sued in a matter involving his personal interests is represented by another partner in his law firm,the attorney may recover attorney fees under civil code section for services rendered by that partner.id.at.

the issue on appeal involves a line of cases dealing with attorney fees awards for pro se attorney litigants,beginning with our supreme court decision in trope katz cal th trope.in that case,the individual partners of a law firm,acting in propria persona,successfully sued the firm client to recover unpaid fees pursuant to a retainer agreement.id.at.although the caption of the case lists as the plaintiffs sorrell trope et,id.at,the supreme court opinion states that trope and trope sued the defendants.id.at.the supreme court apparently treated the firm and its individual partners as interchangeable.gilbert,supra,th at,fn.following entry of judgment in their favor,the plaintiffs moved for an award of attorney fees under the attorney fees provision in the retainer agreement.ibid.the trial court denied the motion on the grounds that the law firm had represented itself in the litigation,and the court of appeal affirmed.ibid.
on review,the supreme court in trope,supra,cal th began its analysis by noting that the issue was controlled by civil code section trope,supra,cal th at.according to the court,the issue before it was whether an attorney who chooses to represent himself and therefore does not pay or become liable to pay any sum out of pocket for such representation can nevertheless recover reasonable attorney fees under civil code section as compensation for the time and effort expended and the professional business opportunities lost as a result.ibid.
the court in trope,supra,cal th concluded that to allow pro se attorney litigants to recover fees to compensate them for their time would result in disparate treatment of attorney and nonattorney pro se litigants,and reasoned as follows let us assume for the sake of discussion that an attorney litigant devotes as much time and effort to litigating a matter on his own behalf as he does to litigating a case on behalf of a client,and that his time is equally valuable whether he is acting on behalf of himself or of a client.it does not necessarily follow from this premise,however,that he is entitled to receive compensation from his opponent simply because the time he devotes to litigating a matter on his own behalf has value.the time that a doctor,for example,spends litigating a case on his own behalf also has value,both to the doctor himself and to society generally,for that time could otherwise be spent treating the sick or pursuing medical research for the benefit of all an architect time could otherwise be spent designing or building houses a painter time could be spent creating works of art for future generations to enjoy.however,it is clear that when it enacted civil code section the legislature did not intend to allow doctors,architects,painters,or any other nonattorneys to receive compensation for the valuable time they spend litigating a contract matter on their own behalf.citations.there is no support in either the language or legislative history of civil code section for disparate treatment of pro se litigants on the basis of their occupations.id.at.the court explained that such disparate treatment would conflict with the legislative purpose of civil code section.the statute was designed to establish mutuality of remedy when a contractual provision makes recovery of attorney fees available to only one party,and to prevent the oppressive use of attorney fee provisions.hsu abbara cal th,reynolds metals alperson cal d,see generally,acoba,recovery of attorney fees in actions to enforce contracts california civil code section western.if an attorney who is the prevailing party in an action to enforce a contract with an attorney fee provision can recover compensation for the time he expends litigating his case in propria persona,but a nonattorney pro se litigant can not do so regardless of the personal and economic value of such time simply because he has chosen to pursue a different occupation,every such contract would be oppressive and.id.at.
to ensure that all pro se litigants would be treated equally under civil code section,the court in trope,supra,cal th said that because pro se attorney litigants do not incur an obligation to pay attorney fees when representing themselves,such attorney litigants are not entitled to recover attorney fees under civil code section.the court held that an attorney who chooses to litigate in propria persona and therefore does not pay or become liable to pay consideration in exchange for legal representation can not recover reasonable attorney fees under civil code section as compensation for the time and effort he expends on his own behalf or for the professional business opportunities he forgoes as a result of his decision.trope,supra,cal th at.
the supreme court in plcm group,drexler cal th plcm decided an issue it had left open in trope,supra,cal th whether a corporate litigant represented by counsel,counsel who is an employee of the party,can recover attorney fees under civil code section based on the services of that counsel.in plcm,a claims administrator plcm for an insured attorney malpractice carriers,sued the attorney to recover amounts advanced on his behalf to his defense attorneys in the underlying malpractice action.plcm,supra,cal th at.plcm contended that the amounts it had advanced were within the malpractice policy deductible.ibid.plcm was represented in the collection action by an attorney.id.at.following a verdict in its favor,plcm moved for a fee award based upon the services rendered by its counsel.id.at.the attorney defendant moved to tax costs on the ground,inter alia,that fees could not be awarded for those services.ibid.the trial court awarded plcm the requested fees,and the court of appeal affirmed.ibid.
in affirming the award of attorney fees,the supreme court in plcm,supra,cal th,concluded that none of the factors that supported the denial of the fee award to the pro se attorney litigant in trope,supra,cal th were present in the case before it.there is no problem in this case of disparate treatment attorneys,like private counsel but unlike pro se litigants,do not represent their own personal interests and are not seeking remuneration simply for lost opportunity costs that could not be recouped by a nonlawyer.a corporation represented by counsel is in an agency relationship,it has hired an attorney to provide professional legal services on its behalf.nor is there any impediment to the effective and successful prosecution of meritorious claims because of possible ethical conflict or emotional investment in the outcome.the fact that counsel is employed by the corporation does not alter the fact of representation by an independent third party.instead,the payment of a salary to attorneys is analogous to hiring a private firm on a retainer.plcm,supra,cal th at.
in gilbert,supra,th,the court of appeal applied the holdings in trope,supra,cal th and plcm,supra,cal th to a fee request made by an attorney who had been represented in a litigation by members of his own firm.gilbert,supra,th at.in that case,the tenant,in a consolidated case,sued his landlord and the landlord attorney,gernsbacher,alleging,inter alia,that gernsbacher had wrongfully prevented the tenant from recovering its property from the leased premises.ibid.it is not clear if gernsbacher alleged misconduct had occurred in the course of his firm representation of the client,although the court said that the matter involved gernsbacher personal interests.ibid.gernsbacher obtained a judgment in his favor and filed a motion for an order fixing attorney fees and costs.id.at.the trial court,citing trope,supra,cal th,denied gernsbacher attorney fees motion on the ground that he was represented by his law firm.
the court in gilbert,supra,th reversed the order denying fees.according to the court,the holding in trope,supra,cal th did not support the trial court order denying fees to gernsbacher,who had been represented by other attorneys in his firm.having examined the policy considerations leading to the trope and plcm,supra,cal th decisions,we apply those considerations to the case before us.we hold gernsbacher,as an attorney litigant represented by other attorneys in his firm,is not a litigant in propria persona and thus trope does not bar his recovery of reasonable attorney fees under civil code section.gilbert,supra,th at.in reaching this conclusion,the court in gilbert reasoned that an attorney who is represented by other attorneys in his firm incurs fees within the meaning of civil code section.either the represented attorney will experience a reduced draw from the partnership or a reduced salary from the professional corporation to account for the amount of time his or her partners or colleagues have specifically devoted to his or her representation,or absorb a share of the reduction in other income the firm experiences because of the time spent on the case.this is different from the opportunity costs the attorney loses while he or she is personally involved in the same case,because the economic detriment is caused not by the expenditure of his or her own time,but by other attorneys working on his or her behalf.gilbert,supra,th at.
the distinction made in gilbert,supra,th between lost opportunity costs and a reduced draw or salary or other reductions in income because of time spent on the case is a bit obscure.for example,in trope,supra,cal th,trope and trope,either as individuals or as a law firm consisting of more than one attorney,were represented by partners or associates in the firm.as a consequence,members of the firm would absorb a share of the reduction in other income the firm experiences because of the time spent on the case gilbert,supra,th at,which seems to be comparable to the lost opportunity costs.the supreme court in trope did not draw the distinction made in gilbert.
in witte kaufman th witte,the plaintiff sued,inter alia,a law firm,kla,for interference with contract.id.at.the trial court granted kla special motion to strike under section and awarded that law firm attorney fees.ibid.the plaintiff appealed from,inter alia,the order granting kla attorney fees,contending that kla was not entitled to attorney fees because it represented itself in the trial court.id.at.
the court in witte,supra,th reversed the order awarding attorney fees to kla,citing trope,supra,cal th and distinguishing both plcm,supra,cal th and gilbert,supra,th.here,unlike plcm and gilbert,but like trope,there is no relationship between kla and its individual attorneys.the individual kla attorneys are not comparable to counsel for a corporation,hired solely for the purpose of representing the corporation.the attorneys of kla are the law firm product.when they represent the law firm,they are representing their own interests.as such,they are comparable to a sole practitioner representing himself or herself.where,as in gilbert,an attorney is sued in his or her individual capacity and he obtains representation from other members of his or her law firm,those other members have no personal stake in the matter and may,in fact,charge for their work.not so with a law firm that is sued in its own right and appears through various members.here,kla incurred no attorney fees in bringing its motion to strike,because all the work was done by members of the firm on their own behalf.thus,kla is not entitled to attorney fees.witte,supra,th at.
the court in gorman tassajara development th gorman ruled that trope,supra,cal th did not bar an attorney litigant from recovering fees incurred for the services of other attorneys and paralegals hired by the attorney to represent him,even if those other attorneys and paralegals worked for the attorney litigant law firm.in that case,two homeowners,attorney gorman and his wife,sued a contractor and several others alleging defective construction of the plaintiffs residence.gorman,supra,th at.attorney gorman and his firm represented the plaintiffs.ibid.during the course of the litigation,the gorman firm associated in the law firm of bowman and brooke.the plaintiffs also retained attorney alwaya to render opinions about insurance coverage.in addition,attorney janke appeared at several depositions on behalf of plaintiffs.id.at.several of the defendants,including the contractor,entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs that included a provision that the plaintiffs were entitled to apply for an award of reasonable fees and costs.id.at.in support of their motion for fees and costs,the plaintiffs submitted documentation showing the hours worked by the various attorneys on the plaintiffs behalf,including hours billed by attorney gorman personally,his associate attorney,hansen,and paralegals in gorman firm.id.at.the trial court granted the plaintiffs fee motion,but awarded an amount that was substantially less than the amount they had requested.id.at.the plaintiffs appealed,inter alia,from the judgment awarding them fees and costs.id.at.
the court in gorman,supra,th explained that the plaintiffs could not recover fees for the time attorney gorman personally spent representing himself and his wife.id.at.but,relying on gilbert,supra,th,the court also held that the plaintiffs could recover attorney fees for the time expended by attorneys the plaintiffs hired to represent them,including attorneys and paralegals in gorman law firm.id.at.we do not understand contractor on appeal to renew its efforts to distinguish gilbert.it argues only that nothing in the gilbert case supports the view that appellants in this case are entitled to recover fees for the work performed personally by appellant gorman.we believe that trope supra,cal th does not preclude the recovery of fees for other attorneys and paralegals hired by attorney gorman to represent him,even if they work in his law firm.gilbert,supra,th mix tumanjan development th.gorman,supra,th at.
fee award on prior appeal 
plaintiffs contend that because we awarded them attorney fees on the prior appeal,the trial court erred in refusing to enter such an award.but at the time of the filing of the opinion in the prior appeal,the issue of whether plaintiffs had,as a matter of fact,incurred recoverable fees was not before this court.therefore,the order awarding attorney fees did not determine that issue.rather,the order on appeal left to the trial court the issue of whether and to what extent plaintiffs had incurred reasonable attorney fees.our order established only that plaintiffs were entitled to attorney fees,assuming that they could demonstrate that they had,in fact,incurred such fees that are legally recoverable 
no entitlement to attorney fees 
plaintiffs contend that because klein was not a partner in the law firm and did not have any financial interest in that firm or have any personal liability dependent on the outcome of the underlying litigation,plaintiffs are entitled to recover attorney fees based on the services she rendered on appeal of the order under the statute dismissing the.according to plaintiffs,for purposes of this appeal,it does not matter whether,as they contended below,klein was an independent contractor,or as the trial court found,an associate attorney of the plaintiff law firm.from plaintiffs perspective,klein representation of them in either capacity is not the equivalent of,and they therefore argue they are not precluded under trope,supra,cal th from recovering attorney fees.relying on the recent ruling in gorman,supra,th that allowed an attorney litigant to recover attorney fees for services rendered on his behalf by associates and paralegals of his firm plaintiffs contend that they are entitled to the requested fee award here.
contrary to plaintiffs assertion,the issue of whether klein was acting in her capacity as an associate attorney or as an independent contractor is significant to the disposition of the appeal.and,the trial court found she was an associate,a factual finding that was supported by substantial evidence,including the declaration of carpenter that klein was an associate in the firm of carpenter zuckerman and the page from the state bar website showing the firm of carpenter zuckerman as klein address of record.in accepting the trial court finding that klein was an associate,we examine whether,under these circumstances,plaintiffs are entitled legally to attorney fees a question we review de novo.
plaintiffs reliance on gorman,supra,th is misplaced.as discussed above,the associate attorney in that case represented attorney gorman in connection with a personal matter concerning the defective construction of his home.thus,the associate was not representing the interests of the law firm for which he worked,but rather the personal interests of one of its partners.see id.at.as the court in that case concluded,the associate legal services on behalf of attorney gorman and his wife were analogous to the services rendered to the attorney litigant by other members of his firm in gilbert,supra,th.in that case,the court emphasized that those other members of the firm represented the attorney litigant personal interests,whereas in trope,supra,cal th,the partner represented his law partnership interest in a collection action.
klein was representing the interests of the law firm for which she worked not just the personal interests of individual partners in that firm,such as in gilbert,supra,th.although she was not a partner in that firm,she,as an employee of the firm,acted on behalf of the firm in protecting it from potential liability from defendants.moreover,unlike the counsel in plcm,supra,cal th,who was employed by and represented the interests of the corporation,klein status as an associate suggests that she was hired primarily to represent the interests of the clients of the plaintiff law firm.there is n
