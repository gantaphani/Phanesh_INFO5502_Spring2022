facts and procedural background 
issa chinn and her boyfriend glenn jett had an altercation with the manager of their apartment complex,kenneth grimes.in december,chinn and jett filed an action for assault,battery,and negligence against grimes,the property management company kmr property management,and the property owner cplp the negligence cause of action alleged that kmr and cplp owed a duty of care to chinn and jett to provide for their safety as tenants,which kmr and cplp breached by failing to exercise reasonable care in employing grimes to manage the building.the prayer for relief requested general damages of,noneconomic damages in excess of million,punitive damages,attorney fees,and costs.grimes filed a against kmr and cplp for indemnity and declaratory relief.
kmr and cplp moved to strike the request for attorney fees on the ground that the complaint failed to allege any statutory or contractual basis for attorney fees.the trial court granted the motion to strike and allowed ten days to amend the complaint.chinn and jett filed an amended complaint that requested costs of suit,but not attorney fees 
in march,chinn served kmr and cplp each with section offers to enter judgment in her favor in the amount of,including costs.she served grimes with a section offer for.both offers expired without acceptance.
in june,kmr and cplp served chinn with a section offer containing two separate settlement proposals.chinn could dismiss with prejudice her entire lawsuit against grimes,kmr,and cplp.in return,kmr and cplp would pay her and waive all costs.the dismissal was to be filed with the trial court in lieu of a judgment in favor of cplp and kmr.alternatively,chinn could allow judgment to be taken in favor of defendants,grimes,kmr,and cplp,and against plaintiff.in return,kmr and cplp would pay chinn and waive all costs.the offer stated that if chinn did not accept and failed to obtain a more favorable judgment from kmr and cplp,she would not recover her costs and would pay defendants costs from the time of the offer.
chinn accepted the first offer,agreeing to enter a dismissal of the entire lawsuit.she filed a notice of settlement stating that pursuant to the section offer,chinn action had been settled according to the terms and conditions between the parties.chinn filed a request for dismissal of her action with prejudice.dismissal was entered on august.
on september,chinn filed a memorandum of costs totaling,including service of process costs of,witness fees of,and investigation costs of.chinn also requested attorney fees in an amount to be set forth in another motion.
grimes filed a motion to strike the memorandum of costs on the ground that chinn did not obtain a judgment in her favor.in the alternative,grimes sought to tax costs on the grounds that the service costs were excessive and unreasonable,the witness fees were unclear,and investigation expenses were not allowable.kmr and cplp filed a notice of joinder in grimes motion.
on september,chinn moved for an order finding she was entitled to attorney fees and costs as a prevailing party under section based on an attorney fees provision in her lease agreement.chinn attached a copy of the lease agreement between chinn and cplp,which provided if any legal action or proceeding be brought by either party to this agreement,the prevailing party shall be reimbursed for all reasonable attorney fees and costs in addition to other damages awarded.
kmr and cplp opposed the motion for attorney fees and costs on the grounds that the operative complaint did not contain a cause of action for breach of contract or request for attorney fees chinn tort claims were unrelated to the lease agreement and chinn was not the prevailing party under the terms of the compromise agreement,the statutory definition in section,or as a practical matter,because she settled for an amount far less than she had been seeking in the lawsuit.
chinn opposed the motion to strike or tax costs on the grounds that grimes did not have standing to object to costs requested from kmr and cplp she was the prevailing party and under section,she received a more favorable award from kmr and cplp than the section offers she had made for each.
a hearing was held on the motion to strike or tax costs and the motion for entitlement to attorney fees and costs.on november,the trial court found that grimes was the prevailing party as between chinn and grimes,and granted the motion to strike the memorandum of costs against him.the court granted kmr and cplp joinder in the motion to strike.as to kmr and cplp,the court found the amount claimed for service of process was unreasonable and reduced the amount for service of process to.the court taxed the amounts claimed for expert witness fees and investigative costs,finding that chinn was not entitled to recover expert witness fees under section and investigative costs were not authorized by statute.the court denied chinn motion for attorney fees as to grimes and kmr,because grimes was a prevailing party and neither grimes nor kmr was a party to the lease.the court denied chinn motion for attorney fees as to cplp,finding no sufficient relationship between the tort claim and the lease agreement.in addition,the court noted that the motion failed to state the amount of attorney fees requested or provide competent evidence of the attorney fees incurred in the prosecution of the case.
on november,the trial court entered a judgment stating that chinn was awarded her costs as prevailing party with a net monetary recovery,but no amount was stated.chinn filed a motion for clarification of the judgment.kmr and cplp filed a motion for reconsideration.after a hearing on january,the trial court granted chinn motion and amended the judgment to include costs of.the court deemed the reconsideration motion to be a motion for clarification as well.the court stated that chinn was the prevailing party for purposes of costs as against kmr and cplp because she obtained a net monetary recovery of and the dismissal of the action was pursuant to the acceptance of a section offer.an amended judgment was filed on january,awarding chinn costs of.chinn filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
lease agreement permits recovery of costs and fees in tort action 
chinn contends the attorney fee provision of her lease agreement allows the prevailing party to recover attorney fees in the instant tort action.we agree.
t o determine whether an award of attorney fees is warranted under a contractual attorney fees provision,the reviewing court will examine the applicable statutes and provisions of the contract.where extrinsic evidence has not been offered to interpret the lease,and the facts are not in dispute,such review is conducted de novo.exxess electronixx heger realty th,d.carver chevron,th,d.as the case law makes clear,the test is not whether the cause of action sounds in tort or contract.instead,the sole question is the intent of the parties did they intend to authorize the prevailing party to recover its attorney fees for a tort cause of action.citations.allstate ins.loo th,d.
the attorney fees provision in chinn lease agreement with cplp was exceptionally broad,providing for attorney fees to the prevailing party in any legal action or proceeding brought by either party to this agreement.the attorney fees provision did not require that the action be related to or arise out of the lease agreement.moreover,the negligence cause of action alleged in the complaint,based on cplp duty to protect its tenant from foreseeable harm,clearly related to her tenancy.castaneda olsher cal th,d,andrews mobile aire estates th,d.we conclude the attorney fee provision of the lease agreement encompassed an award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in the instant tort action.
costs and attorney fees under the section compromise agreement 
the statutory scheme governing costs and section offers allows parties to allocate costs and attorney fees in their compromise agreement,subd.c.therefore,we examine the parties section agreement for an allocation of costs and fees.kmr and cplp contend a section offer requiring plaintiff to dismiss her action with prejudice implicitly provides for an award of costs to defendants,because under section,a defendant is entitled to an award of costs as a matter of right after a dismissal.they argue that their right to recover costs is also reflected in their offer to waive their costs.we can not agree that chinn was precluded from recovering her costs under defendants section offer.
in the absence of any conflicting extrinsic evidence,interpretation of a section offer is a question of law that we review de novo.parsons bristol development cal d,ritzenthaler fireside thrift th,d.we apply general principles of contract law where those principles neither conflict with section nor defeat its purpose.cobb superior court cal d.we interpret the intent and scope of the agreement by focusing on the usual and ordinary meaning of the language used and the circumstances under which the agreement was made.lloyd underwriters craig rush,th,d.moreover,where one construction would make a contract unusual and extraordinary and another construction,equally consistent with the language employed,would make it reasonable,fair,and just,the latter construction must prevail.sayble feinman d.in cases of uncertainty not removed by the preceding rules,the language of a contract should be interpreted most strongly against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist.
under section,a party to a civil action may serve upon any other party an offer to allow judgment to be taken or an award to be entered in accordance with the terms and conditions stated at that time,subd.b.if the offer is accepted,the offer with proof of acceptance shall be filed and the clerk or the judge shall enter judgment accordingly,subd.b.if a plaintiff does not accept the offer and fails to obtain a more favorable judgment at trial,then the plaintiff is liable for the offering party attorney and expert witness fees,subd.c.power,mazur th,d.
a judgment entered pursuant to the acceptance of a section offer is a stipulated or consent judgment that is regarded as a contract between the parties and must be construed as any other contract.rappenecker service,d.ritzenthaler fireside thrift,supra,th at,d.section permits the parties to determine the nature of the judgment to be entered and to resolve collateral matters,including costs.the parties may agree that judgment will be entered in favor of plaintiff rappenecker service,supra,d at.or that the action will be dismissed voluntarily goodstein bank of san pedro th,d.section also allows the parties to stipulate to procedures for resolving the matter of costs.goodstein bank of san pedro,supra,th at,d,subd.c.
a section offer that is silent on the issue of attorney fees and costs can not reasonably be interpreted to exclude recovery of fees and costs by the prevailing party.ritzenthaler fireside thrift,supra,th at,d offer for entry of judgment against the defendant in final settlement of all damages and injunctive claims did not waive the plaintiffs right to seek attorney fees under lanyi goldblum d.offer to allow entry of judgment against the defendant for did not waive the plaintiffs right to recover statutory fees under rappenecker service,supra,d at.offer for payment to the plaintiff and entry of judgment against the defendant in full compromise settlement of his claims regarding his service aboard the ss mayaguez did not include costs,and the plaintiff could recover costs under the former version of allowing costs upon a judgment in the plaintiff favor in an action for the recovery of money power,mazur,supra,th at,d offer for payment as full and complete resolution of all of the claims raised by the to be dismissed with prejudice was silent as to attorney fees.a party intending an offer to compromise under section to encompass attorney fees and costs can easily provide in the offer that each side is to bear its own attorney fees and costs.ritzenthaler fireside thrift,supra,th at,d.
kmr and cplp section offer was silent as to chinn ability to recover costs and attorney fees.an offer requiring a plaintiff to dismiss the action is not the same as an offer providing that the defendant is entitled to recover costs,even if certain consequences result from dismissal of the action,such as an award of costs to the defendant under section.kmr and cplp offer to waive their costs does not assume that they were entitled to recover costs,nor does their waiver imply anything about chinn ability to seek her costs.they may have intended simply to assure chinn that in the event they were entitled to recover their costs,they waived that right.
even were we to conclude the agreement was ambiguous as to whether chinn could seek costs and fees,as the parties who proposed the terms of the section offer,kmr and cplp caused any ambiguity concerning costs and fees.kmr and cplp could have provided that they were the prevailing parties for the purposes of an award of costs,a right which they waived,or that the parties would bear their own costs.they caused any uncertainty that exists,and therefore,the agreement must be interpreted against them.because we conclude the agreement was silent as to which party was entitled to recover costs and fees,we turn to the statutory provisions for costs.
award of costs to prevailing party under section 
chinn contends the trial court correctly awarded her costs as the prevailing party under section,because she is the party with the net monetary recovery based on the parties section compromise agreement.however,she contends the trial court abused its discretion by reducing the amount for service of process.in addition,she contends that she was entitled to recover nonstatutory costs under the lease provision namely,investigative costs.although kmr and cplp did not appeal the award of costs to chinn,they contend she should not be awarded any additional amount for costs,because they were the prevailing parties for the purposes of an award of costs under section.we agree with kmr and cplp.

under former section,if the parties had competing claims for damages,then the party with a net judgment in his favor was the sole party entitled to costs.citations.but even without competing monetary claims,a plaintiff who received only partial recovery was still found to be the sole successful party entitled to costs.the defendant was not entitled to any setoff for his partial victory.citations.michell olick th,d.
in,several related statutes were amended as part of senate bill.stats,ch.the cost provisions of sections and were consolidated.section,subdivision b,now provides that a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding,unless another statute expressly provides otherwise.a definition of prevailing party was added,as used in section prevailing party includes the party with a net monetary recovery,a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered,a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief,and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.when any party recovers other than monetary relief and in situations other than as specified,the prevailing party shall be as determined by the court,and under those circumstances,the court,in its discretion,may allow costs or not and,if allowed may apportion costs between the parties on the same or adverse sides pursuant to rules adopted under section,subd.a.
as rewritten,section now declares that costs are available as a matter of right when the prevailing party is within one of the four categories designated by statute,subds.a,b.michell olick,supra,th at,d.generally,when a party falls squarely within one of the four situations enumerated in the definition of a prevailing party under section,that party is entitled to recover costs as a matter of right.great western bank converse consultants,th,d crib retaining walls,th,d.it is clear from the statutory language that when there is a party with a net monetary recovery one of the four categories of prevailing party,that party is entitled to costs as a matter of right the trial court has no discretion to order each party to bear his or her own costs.michell olick,supra,th at,d.in other circumstances,the trial court exercises its discretion to determine the prevailing party,comparing the relief sought with that obtained,along with the parties litigation objectives as disclosed by their pleadings,briefs,and other such sources.power,mazur,supra,th at,d.
construing the term net monetary recovery in context,we conclude that the legislature did not intend to include settlement proceeds received by the plaintiff in exchange for a dismissal in favor of the defendant.the definition of prevailing party provided in section requires the court to award costs as a matter of right in specified situations.by precluding consideration of settlement proceeds as a net monetary recovery when a dismissal is entered in favor of the defendant,only one party qualifies for a mandatory award of costs,consistent with the prior law.
chinn contends that the common sense meaning of the isolated term net monetary recovery includes settlement proceeds.however,chinn interpretation would lead to an absurd result,as both plaintiff and defendants would be entitled to an award of costs as a matter of right.
we recognize that in situations other than specified,the trial court has discretion to award costs under section.however,a net monetary recovery and a dismissal in the defendant favor are not situations other than specified they are both specified situations.if the legislature had intended more than one party to qualify as a prevailing party under the mandatory cost award provision,it easily could have provided for the trial court to exercise discretion to award costs in the event that more than one party qualified as a prevailing party.but see power,mazur,supra,th at,d stating in dicta that when a plaintiff claims prevailing party status based on a payment pursuant to a section offer,and a defendant claims to be the prevailing party based on a dismissal in the defendant favor,both parties are prevailing parties as defined in section,and the situation is arguably one other than as specified,requiring an exercise of the trial court discretion.
the legislative history of senate bill does not indicate any change in the law to consider settlement proceeds or provide costs to a plaintiff after a dismissal.the legislative council digest printed on the bill simply states in pertinent part existing law contains numerous provisions for the prevailing party in superior,municipal,and justice court actions to receive costs this bill would repeal those provisions and instead provide that except as otherwise provided by law,a prevailing party,as defined,is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.this bill would provide for the determination of fees and costs by the court in specified instances.assem.amend.to bill reg.sess.

senate bill was introduced on behalf of the california judges association civil law and procedure committee.on january,judge richard breiner,who was the chairman of the civil law and procedure committee,responded in writing to a telephone call from assembly republican consultant earl cantos.judge breiner stated in pertinent part,the proposed bill merely synthesizes and simplifies the myriad of existing statutes into language which is clear,simple,and located in one place.you expressed concern that the proposal might allow an award of costs against a plaintiff not presently permitted under current law,when an action is dismissed.under present law,costs are allowed to a defendant when plaintiff action is dismissed city of industry gordon d,whether it is a voluntary dismissal with prejudice fisher eckert d,or without prejudice international industries,olen cal d,olen.the proposed bill provides for no different result,but rather simply provides in cases of dismissal,for costs to a defendant on dismissal.

we conclude that kmr and cplp,as defendants with a dismissal entered in their favor,were the prevailing parties for the purposes of an award of costs as a matter of right under section.chinn was not entitled to recover any additional amount for service of process or investigative costs.
recovery of contractual attorney fees in a tort action 
although chinn was not the prevailing party under section,the prevailing party for the award of costs under section is not necessarily the prevailing party for the award of attorney fees.santisas goodin cal th,d,santisas mclarand,vasquez partners,downey savings loan d.therefore,we examine whether chinn may recover her attorney fees in this case.
attorney fees are not generally recoverable as costs unless authorized by statute or agreement.prior to,contractual attorney fees could be awarded only after pleading and proof,and therefore,they could not be recovered after a voluntary dismissal.olen,supra,cal d at.the enactment of civil code section in,which created a reciprocal right to attorney fees in contracts with unilateral attorney fee provisions,was found to have removed the procedural bar to awarding contractual attorney fees after a dismissal,because fees authorized by statute are recoverable as costs.olen,supra,cal d at,citing bearing walter heller d.et however,in olen,the supreme court concluded public policy and equitable considerations required the parties should bear their own attorney fees when the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed an action prior to trial,whether the claim for fees was based on a contract provision or on the reciprocal right provided by civil code section.olen,supra,cal d at.

however,civil code does not apply to attorney fees incurred to litigate noncontract causes of action.santisas,supra,cal th at,d.the santisas court concluded that although a defendant is entitled to an award of costs following a dismissal based on the definition of prevailing party provided under section,the trial court may award attorney fees incurred to litigate noncontract causes of action based on the definition of prevailing party provided in the parties contract,or if none,on a common sense interpretation that requires an assessment of the extent to which each party achieved its litigation objectives.santisas,supra,cal th at,d.

however,the sellers recovery of attorney fees incurred to defend noncontract claims was not subject to the provisions of civil code section.santisas,supra,cal th at,d.the santisas court declined to find that the sellers were automatically entitled to an award of fees simply because they were the prevailing parties as defined under section.the santisas court approved of the reasoning in olen that attorney fees should not be awarded automatically to parties in whose favor a voluntary dismissal has been entered.in particular,it seems inaccurate to characterize the defendant as the prevailing party if the plaintiff dismissed the action only after obtaining,by means of settlement or otherwise,all or most of the requested relief,or if the plaintiff dismissed for reasons,such as the defendant insolvency,that have nothing to do with the probability of success on the merits.santisas,supra,cal th at,d.but we do not agree that the only remaining alternative is an inflexible rule denying contractual attorney fees as costs in all voluntary pretrial dismissal cases.rather,a court may determine whether there is a prevailing party,and if so which party meets that definition,by examining the terms of the contract at issue,including any contractual definition of the term prevailing party and any contractual provision governing payment of attorney fees in the event of dismissal.if,as here,the contract allows the prevailing party to recover atto
