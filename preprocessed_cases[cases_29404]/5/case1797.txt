appellants heidi kasperbauer,kirsten roehler and kimberly haugh are the beneficiaries of a trust.they seek and receive orders substituting a successor trustee in place of respondent william fairfield,who had been the trustee for over years.they also seek an order directing fairfield to provide an accounting.the trial court orders the accounting and withholds from the trust to cover fairfield anticipated attorney fees and costs associated with its preparation.at appellants request,the court terminates the trust and distributes the corpus to appellants even though the accounting has not been completed.
following distribution,fairfield seeks additional funds to pay unanticipated fees and costs incurred in completing the accounting and responding to appellants objections.the court withholds an additional from the proceeds of the sale of real property held by the trust for the possible payment of trustee expenses in completing the accounting.fairfield attorney fees and costs exceed the amounts withheld.on recommendation of the referee to whom the cause was referred,the trial court orders,inter alia,that appellants return of the trust distribution to provide a fund from which to pay fairfield attorney fees and costs in completing and defending the accounting.
the beneficiaries appeal the order contending that pendente lite attorney fees are not authorized by the probate code and that they can not be compelled to pay additional attorney fees and costs because the trust has been terminated and the assets of the trust distributed.they also assert that an award of attorney fees is premature because the court has not yet determined the merits of their objections to the accounting and their claim for surcharges against fairfield.we affirm.
factual and procedural history 
in,johnson and frederick roehler ii roehler,husband and wife,established the trust.appellants heidi kasperbauer,kirsten roehler and kimberly haugh are the adult children of johnson and roehler.johnson died on january.roehler was convicted of her murder and is incarcerated for life without the possibility of parole on october,roehler executed a first amendment to the trust resigning as trustee and naming respondent william fairfield as successor trustee.
upon johnson death,the trust was divided into the decedent trust and the survivor trust.the decedent trust trust provides that the trust shall terminate and its assets be distributed when the youngest beneficiary reaches the age of years.that occurred on july.fairfield made periodic withdrawals from the trust for costs of administration,including trustee compensation and attorney fees.he did not provide a formal accounting or make any distributions of the trust estate to the beneficiaries.
on march,appellants filed a petition requesting that the court order fairfield to prepare an accounting and surcharge him for funds he had withdrawn from the trust for compensation,attorney fees and other costs.appellants filed additional petitions requesting that the court remove fairfield as trustee,appoint janice martin as successor trustee,terminate the trust and distribute the trust corpus to appellants.on december,the court ordered fairfield removed as trustee,appointed martin as successor trustee,and directed fairfield to file an accounting for all trust activity for the period january,through october,on or before january.the court terminated the trust and ordered that approximately million in trust assets be distributed to appellants.the court withheld from the trust distribution to pay attorney fees incurred by fairfield in preparing and defending the accounting.no appeal was taken from the order.
at the december hearing,prior to ordering the termination of the trust,the following colloquy occurred 
the court i do think the proposed trustee would is mandatory,less or whatever the number is.everything are they going to administer anything how are you going to pay your trustee 
reinhardt counsel for appellants i think any questions that the successor trustee has with respect to whether or not my client would agree that her withheld sic can be increased by any set amount so that there no question that too much has been distributed and they have to put it back is something between miss martin and my clients.there no reason the decedent trust has been terminated that miss martin has to retain any assets.
onstot counsel for fairfield these trusts are subject to an accounting involving the new trustee.there will be costs and expenses associated with them.this is a court order that the trustee turn over everything.remember,there no discretion to the trustee.there no authority to retain anything.this is your order telling him everything goes.
the court right.
reinhardt then the liability becomes my client,your honor.
the court i okay with this proposed order.
on january,the court ordered an additional be withheld from the proceeds of sale of real property held by the trust and segregated to be used for payment of fairfield expenses in completing the accounting.
on april,fairfield filed an accounting comprising more than pages.appellants filed objections to the accounting and sought to surcharge fairfield on multiple grounds.on december,the court appointed the honorable melinda johnson ret,as referee for all purposes due to the complexity of the case.the contest over the accounting is pending before her.
on march,fairfield filed a petition seeking,among other things,an order for payment of additional attorney fees incurred in preparing and defending the accounting and a request that the court impose a lien on trust assets to pay the attorney fees he had incurred and would incur in excess of the amounts previously withheld from the trust.
the referee recommended that the court approve attorney fees and costs in the amount of and that the court further order appellants to deposit in a segregated account to pay attorney fees subsequently incurred by fairfield and approved by the court.
the referee further recommended that the trial court deny fairfield request to impose a lien on the distributed trust assets because she could not make a finding that the statutory requirements necessary to impose a lien on distributed trust assets has been met.on may,the trial court adopted the referee recommendation as its order.
on appeal,appellants contend that the court erred in awarding pendente lite attorney fees and ordering appellants to return trust assets to pay attorney fees incurred by fairfield in the ongoing litigation over the accounting.
discussion 
standard of review 
where,as here,a statute provides for an award of attorney fees,we review the trial court award of attorney fees for abuse of discretion.see terry conlan th,d trial court order that attorney fees may be payable from trust income reviewed under abuse of discretion standard see also in re vokal estate d,if statute expressly authorizes fees,the probate court is vested with wide discretion in awarding counsel fees for services to a trust and its findings will not be disturbed in the absence of a showing of a palpable abuse of such discretion.
interim attorney fee awards are authorized by the probate code 
appellants contend the court may not award attorney fees where,as here,no determinations have been made as to the validity of appellants objections to the accounting and their claim that fairfield should be surcharged for amounts he withdrew from the trust.appellants argue that the only statutory basis for an award of attorney fees to fairfield is probate code section,subdivision a,and the award was not authorized because the court did not make a finding of bad faith we disagree.t he probate code is studded with provisions authorizing the trustee to hire and pay or seek reimbursement for having paid attorneys to assist in trust administration.for example,section empowers the trustee to hire persons,including attorneys or other agents to advise or assist the trustee in the performance of administrative duties.section provides,the trustee has the power to pay reasonable compensation of the trustee and of employees and agents of the trust,and other expenses incurred in the administration and pro
