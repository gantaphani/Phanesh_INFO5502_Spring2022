the present action 
employers sued philadelphia and scottsdale for contribution toward the million cost of the brogan action.in particular,employers sought.the trial was bifurcated into a duty to defend phase and indemnity phase.the parties stipulated to various facts,and also to the admissibility of documents,their discovery,and discovery in the brogan action.
after the first phase,the trial court ruled that philadelphia and scottsdale had a duty to defend simpson.
following the indemnity phase,the trial court issued a statement of decision and judgment.the trial court applied the time on the risk method of allocating the costs associated with the brogan action.the relevant time period was to,which placed of the burden on scottsdale and on philadelphia.employers assumed of the burden.
toward the million paid for damages,scottsdale owed employers and philadelphia owed.to calculate these sums,the trial court multiplied million by the time on the risk and the percentage of brogan plaintiffs present at villa park during the relevant policy periods according to the trial court scottsdale and philadelphia had the opportunity to present evidence that portions of these sums were for injuries and damages beyond the coverage of the policies that scottsdale and philadelphia issued to simpson.this future step would have reduced the sums by the amounts that scottsdale and philadelphia proved were paid for claims not covered by their policies with simpson.by unanimous agreement,however,the parties have decided to waive this opportunity.
under the supplementary payments coverage,the trial court ruled that scottsdale and philadelphia owed employers contribution of of the million payment for statutory attorney fees.
though scottsdale and philadelphia argued that the million was not taxed because no court entered an order of taxation,the trial court opined the word taxed does not literally require a court order of taxation.the word taxed properly encompasses this situation,where the settling parties forecasted and compromised their estimates about the sums likely if the matter went to trial and to an eventual court order.neither philadelphia nor scottsdale gave a restrictive definition for this word taxed in their policies.in fact,they did not define the key word at all.courts interpret ambiguities in contracts against the drafter,which here would be philadelphia and scottsdale a dictionary definition of a taxable cost is a cost proper to be taxed or charged up legally chargeable or assessable.citation.nothing in this dictionary definition requires a court order before a cost may be taxed.
the trial court declined to multiply scottsdale and philadelphia share of the million by the percentage of brogan plaintiffs present at villa park during the relevant policy periods.this issue turns on whether the million sum is more like a fixed or a variable cost.from the insurers standpoint,the million cost was fixed.there should be no pro rata reductions to the reimbursements due on this fixed cost.the million cost was fixed because it never varied in any way that philadelphia and scottsdale would have been able to control.this million sum was the parties compromise on the total fees incurred by the plaintiffs counsel.the insurers were on the defense side.defendants and defense lawyers can not control the activity or billing by the plaintiffs lawyers.from the defense perspective,then,the plaintiffs legal bill was a fixed cost because it came in a single undifferentiated lump.the plaintiffs did not care about whether injury or damages was progressive or not the brogan plaintiffs attorneys thus had no reason to explore whether their clients injuries and damages were progressive.with respect to that issue,then,the plaintiffs legal bill did not vary.
next,the trial court concluded that scottsdale and philadelphia each owed employers,which was of the defense costs.because scottsdale and philadelphia did not participate in the defense,they waived the right to complain about legal fees.once again,the trial court declined to multiply scottsdale and philadelphia contribution by the percentage of brogan plaintiffs present at villa park during the relevant policy periods.the trial court reasoned that the defense legal bill was a fixed cost.
finally,the trial court denied employers request for prejudgment interest.it found that the amount of damages depended upon a judicial determination based on conflicting evidence.

discussion 
philadelphia assigns error to the trial court determination of what it must contribute toward the cost of the brogan action.this attack parses into subissues,which we have taken up below.
a.the law of equitable contribution.
multiple insurers on the same risk have reciprocal rights and duties that arise out of equitable principles.signal companies harbor ins,cal d.the loss is distributed in a ratio that reflects the percentage of total coverage provided by each insurer policy.american continental ins.american casualty th,d.there are various methods a trial court may choose for determining an equitable allocation.they include time on the risk,policy limits,combined policy on the risk,equal shares,and maximum loss.centennial,supra,th at,d.
b.the trial court did not err when it required philadelphia to contribute toward the payment of statutory attorney fees.
philadelphia contends that it is not required to contribute to the million employers seeks to recover for attorney fees and costs paid to simpson in the brogan settlement.this contention lacks merit.
the million payment represented a taxed cost.
in the supplementary payments coverage,philadelphia policies provided that it would pay a ll costs taxed against the insured in the suit.the parties dispute the meaning of taxed.
an insurance policy is interpreted according to the plain meaning a layperson would ordinarily give it unless the parties used a word or phrase in a technical sense or it has special meaning due to usage.ambiguities or uncertainties are resolved against the insurance company so that,if feasible,the policy will indemnify the loss to which the insurance relates.these rules exist to protect the insured reasonable expectation of coverage.coverage clauses are interpreted broadly and exclusionary clauses are interpreted narrowly.reserve insurance pisciotta cal d,crane state farm fire cas.cal d,aiu ins.superior court cal d.
the dictionary defines the verb tax as meaning to judicially assess the amount of costs levying a tax on making an onerous demand on.collegiate dict.according to philadelphia,the first definition is the one intended by the parties.but in our view the use of the word taxed in philadelphia policies is ambiguous.it could narrowly refer to a judicial assessment of costs or broadly to any levy of an assessment.following precedent,we are required to interpret taxed broadly if feasible.we find it feasible to do so without perverting semantics.thus,we construe the term broadly.
philadelphia argues the first dictionary definition is the only meaning possible because it coincides with the technical or legal definition of taxed.we are directed to consider california rules of court,rule b.that rule sheds no light on our analysis.it contemplates a motion to strike or tax costs that are objectionable and should be eliminated or reduced.whereas the word tax in california rules of court,rule b refers to a reduction of costs,the word taxed in philadelphia policies refers to an assessment.
in prichard liberty mutual ins.th,d prichard,the court held that a settlement following a judgment included the cost award.in philadelphia view,prichard establishes that costs can only be taxed against a party after a judgment.but prichard did not reach that issue.similarly,insurance of north america national american ins.th,d does not aid philadelphia cause.in that case,an award of attorney fees following judgment was a cost taxed against the insured.this does not establish that costs taxed can not include attorney fees paid in a settlement.
as a matter of policy and equity,our interpretation is sensible.it permits an insured to settle a claim instead of pursuing an action to judgment and risking a greater liability.it also permits one of multiple insurers to settle an action and seek contribution of taxed costs.public policy encourages settlement.great western bank converse consultants,th,d.additionally,if taxed costs did not include anticipated costs in a settlement,insurers would be discouraged from settling cases with high costs because they would be barred from seeking contribution.our holding eliminates that dilemma.
in its reply brief,philadelphia argues that employers is estopped from claiming that statutory attorney fees fall within the supplementary payments coverage of the philadelphia policies.this is so,according to philadelphia,because there is no evidence that employers or evanston paid any portion of the brogan settlement out of their own supplementary payments coverage.philadelphia did not cite any case authority for this proposition,nor did it advance this proposition in its opening brief,so the argument is doubly waived.an appellate court can deem an argument waived if it is not supported by analysis or argument in the appellate briefs.associated builders contractors,san francisco airports com.cal th,fn,d,moreover,abc fails to provide any analysis or argument in support of the assertion,which,for this additional reason,is not properly raised.fairness militates against our consideration of arguments first raised in a reply brief.see varjabedian city of madera cal d,fn.
for the sake of being complete,we reject philadelphia belated argument on the merits.to apply the equitable estoppel doctrine,four elements must be present the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon,or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts and he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.city of long beach mansell cal d.we have not been cited to evidence establishing any of the foregoing elements,including that philadelphia relied to its detriment on employers and evanston disavowing the application of their own supplementary payments coverage.further,it is apparent that philadelphia took no action.it denied simpson a defense.this ends the topic.
also in the reply brief,and also for the first time,philadelphia argues that the obligation to pay costs taxed to the insured arises only after liability is established combs state farm fire casualty th,d combs and liability was never established in the brogan action.we reject this argument because it was raised for the first time in the reply brief,and because it lacks merit.though the brogan settlement stated that simpson was not admitting liability,it established simpson liability for insurance purposes.for example,when an insured has to defend itself and then sues an insurer for reimbursement,the insured reasonable settlement of the underlying action may be used as presumptive evidence of the insured liability on the underlying claim,and the amount of such liability.citations.citations.pruyn agricultural ins.th,d pruyn.additionally,combs did not analyze whethe
