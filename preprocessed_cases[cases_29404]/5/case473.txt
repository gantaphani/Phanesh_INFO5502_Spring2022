facts and proceedings 
on june,dearmore filed a complaint against the city under,challenging the constitutionality of garland city ordinance the ordinance,which related to the maintenance of rental properties in the city.the complaint alleged that various minimum housing standards and inspection procedures contained in the ordinance violated the fourth,fifth,and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution.that same day,dearmore filed a motion for a temporary restraining order,seeking to enjoin the city from enforcing the ordinance.
on june,the district court denied dearmore motion for a temporary restraining order.in response,on july,dearmore filed an amended motion for a temporary restraining order and a motion to reconsider its denial of the temporary restraining order,or in the alternative,a request for an expedited preliminary injunction hearing.on july,the city filed a motion pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b to dismiss dearmore complaint for failure to state a claim.thereafter,dearmore amended his complaint and removed his fifth and fourteenth amendment takings and due process claims.thus,dearmore amended complaint alleged only that the ordinance authorized warrantless searches of private homes,failed to provide a mechanism to notify tenants,property owners,or property managers of their right to refuse a search,and required applicants to disclose personal information,all in violation of the fourth and fourteenth amendments.dearmore amended complaint sought a declaratory judgment,injunctive relief,and attorney fees and costs.
on november,the district court granted dearmore motion for a preliminary injunction in its order,the district court held that in so far as the ordinance allowed inspections and searches of unoccupied property,it violated a property owner fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.as a result,the district court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the city from enforcing section f of the ordinance,which required a property owner who rents or leases a dwelling to allow an inspection of the rental property as a condition of issuing a permit,or penalizes the lessor for refusing to allow an inspection the district court also dismissed dearmore other fourth amendment claims.on the same date,the district court issued a scheduling order establishing discovery deadlines and setting the case for trial on october.
following the issuance of these orders on november,counsel for the city informed counsel for dearmore that he did not need to post the bond necessary to enforce the preliminary injunction because the city planned to amend the ordinance to address the district court order.on november,the garland city council amended the ordinance,removing the provisions related to a nonresident owner consent to the inspection of rental properties and clarifying the circumstances under which the city may seek a warrant to inspect such properties when consent has been refused or could not be obtained.the city notified the district court of this amendment and filed a motion to dismiss dearmore action as moot,which dearmore did not oppose.on november,the district court granted the city motion and entered final judgment dismissing the case as moot and with prejudice.the order granting this motion found that dearmore was a prevailing party and awarded him attorney fees and costs under b.
on december,the city filed a motion to alter or amend judgment pursuant to rule e,requesting that the district court not designate dearmore as a prevailing party and asking that the court costs against the parties incurring them.on december,dearmore filed a motion for attorney fees pursuant to rule d.on august,the district court denied the city motion to alter or amend judgment.on september,following a stipulation by the parties as to the amount of fees only,the district court granted dearmore motion for attorney fees.the city appeals both rulings.

iii.discussion 
in b,congress created an exception to the american rule that litigants pay for their own attorney fees.see sole wyner,d buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human,d.this section provides that the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.b.this appeal presents an issue of first impression in this circuit whether a plaintiff qualifies as a prevailing party under b when he obtains a preliminary injunction after the district court makes an unambiguous indication of probable success on the merits of his claim and the defendant subsequently moots the case before trial in direct response to the court preliminary injunction order.
supreme court and fifth circuit precedent provide general guidance on the qualifications for prevailing party status.the supreme court has noted that t he touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry is the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties in a manner which congress sought to promote in the fee statute.sole.at quoting.state teachers ass garland indep.sch,d see buckhannon,at.explaining that congress intended to permit the interim award of counsel fees only when a party has prevailed on the merits of at least some of his claims internal quotations omitted.such a material alteration must have the necessary judicial imprimatur.see buckhannon,at.the buckhannon court did not expressly define judicial imprimatur but stated that enforceable judgments on the merits and consent decrees are sufficient for prevailing party status.id.at.in so holding,the buckhannon court rejected the catalyst theory,explaining that a defendant voluntary change in conduct in response to the plaintiff lawsuit and not a court order,although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve,lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur to establish prevailing party status.id.at.this court considered such supreme court precedent in energy management and held that,to be a prevailing party,a plaintiff must obtain actual relief,such as an enforceable judgment or a consent decree that materially alters the legal relationship between the parties and modifies the defendant behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff at the time of the judgment or settlement.at.
although an enforceable judgment on the merits and a consent decree have sufficient judicial imprimatur,these examples are not exclusive.see buckhannon,at.referencing the judgment on the merits and consent decree as mere examples dupuy samuels,cir select milk producers,johanns,john.county intermediate unit,cir dubuc green oak,cir watson county of riverside,cir.as a result,lower courts have had difficulties in ascertaining what other forms of judicial action have the necessary judicial imprimatur to create prevailing party status,particularly in the context of preliminary injunctions.the supreme court has never expressed a view on whether,in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a claim for permanent injunctive relief,success in gaining a preliminary injunction may warrant an award of counsel fees.sole.at.without a supreme court decision on point,circuit courts considering this issue have announced standards that are anything but uniform.see planned parenthood of houston se.sanchez,cir.as this court has noted,
several circuits have determined that a preliminary injunction that merely preserves the status quo temporarily will not confer prevailing party status on a party instead,the preliminary injunction must i reflect a decision on an issue involved in the case,see,john.county intermediate unit,cir dubuc green oak,cir taylor city of fort lauderdale,cir ii constitute substantive,indefeasible relief akin to final relief on the merits because,for example,the party claim for a permanent injunction is rendered moot by the impact of the preliminary injunction,cheyenne tribe jackson,cir see also,dupuy samuels,cir iii grant the party concrete and irreversible relief in a decision that vindicates the party claim and is not appealed by the opposing party,see,select milk producers,johanns,or iv incorporate some combination of these factors.
yousuf motiva enters.llc,cir per curiam footnotes omitted citing planned parenthood,at.the ninth circuit has taken a relatively generous approach,at least in principle,stating that a preliminary injunction issued by a judge carries all the judicial imprimatur necessary to satisfy buckhannon.planned parenthood,at quoting watson,at.the ninth circuit,however,did note that a plaintiff would not qualify as a prevailing party if he obtained a preliminary injunction early in the litigation but later lost on the merits and had a judgment entered against him.id.citing watson,at.by contrast,the fourth circuit has expressed strong skepticism that a preliminary injunction could ever serve as the basis for prevailing party status,because the merits inquiry in the preliminary injunction context is necessarily abbreviated.id.quoting smyth rivero,cir.
this court has not yet created or endorsed a particular test.instead,this court has held that a plaintiff who obtains a preliminary injunction is not a prevailing party if he fails to qualify under any of the other circuits tests.in planned parenthood,the plaintiffs alleged in part that rider,a statute that prohibited the distribution of federal family funds to those who performed elective abortion procedures or who contracted or provided funds to those who perform such procedures,violated the supremacy clause.at.the district court granted the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction,enjoining enforcement of rider,and the defendant appealed.id.at.on interlocutory appeal,this court determined that rider did not violate the supremacy clause and remanded the case,with instructions to dissolve the injunction.id.on remand,the district court granted the defendant motion to dismiss the case and denied the plaintiffs attorney fees.id.the plaintiffs appealed the denial of fees.id.this court held that the plaintiffs were not prevailing parties because the preliminary injunction involved an abbreviated inquiry into the merits coupled with a weighing of likely harms,the preliminary injunction only preserved the status quo between the parties,the case was not mooted after the preliminary injunction was granted and the defendant appealed,and on remand,the plaintiffs did not seek to avoid the dissolution of the injunction and eventually lost on the merits.id.at.under these facts,this court had no need to choose between the tests of the other circuits because the plaintiffs clearly failed to qualify under any of them.see id.at.
likewise,in yousuf,this court held that the plaintiff was not a prevailing party because he did not qualify under any test.at.the plaintiff,who leased and operated a shell service station pursuant to a franchise agreement with the defendant,filed suit after the defendant notified him of its intent to terminate the franchise relationship.id.at.after suit was filed,the parties executed a stipulated standstill agreement,where they agreed to maintain the status quo of the franchise relationship pending the district court decision on the preliminary injunction,which the district court adopted as an order of the court.id.as discovery progressed,the parties reached another agreement and filed a joint stipulation and motion for the entry of a consent judgment on the plaintiff preliminary injunction motion.id.the district court,in accordance with the stipulation and motion,issued the preliminary injunction maintaining the franchise relationship,but the order stated that the court made no findings of fact or law on the motion.id.at.before the case could proceed to a jury trial,hurricane katrina destroyed the service station,and the defendant terminated the franchise agreement.id.at.the plaintiff then moved to dismiss the case as moot and filed for attorney fees under the petroleum marketing practices act,et,based on the entry of the standstill agreement and preliminary injunction.id.the district court denied the attorney fees,and plaintiff appealed.id.on appeal,this court affirmed the district court and determined that the plaintiff was not a prevailing party because the preliminary injunction did nothing more than temporarily preserve the status quo,maintaining the parties preexisting franchise relationship until the legal issues surrounding the approaching termination of that relationship could be addressed on the merits,the district court did not consider the merits of plaintiff claim and explicitly noted that it had not made any findings of fact or conclusions of law in its order granting the preliminary injunction per the parties agreement,and the plaintiff claim became moot not because the court orders were so successful for the plaintiff that they rendered any further relief unnecessary,but rather because of the unrelated impact of hurricane katrina.id.at.
unlike planned parenthood or yousuf,this case does not fail every test employed by the other circuits.as noted,the sixth circuit provides that a plaintiff is a prevailing party if the preliminary injunction represents an unambiguous indication of probable success on the merits,and not merely a maintenance of the status quo ordered because the balance of equities greatly favors the plaintiff.dubuc,at internal quotations omitted.likewise,the seventh circuit states that a plaintiff may obtain attorney fees when the district court engaged in a discussion on the merits of the claim when considering a preliminary injunction motion,and the case was mooted after the plaintiffs were granted a preliminary injunction but before they requested attorney fees.see dupuy,at.further,the ninth circuit holds that a plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees if he obtained a preliminary injunction and the case was subsequently mooted.see watson,at.here,the district court considered the merits of dearmore claim and clearly concluded that a provision of the ordinance violated the fourth amendment.in response to the district court grant of this preliminary injunction,the city amended the offending provision of the ordinance,thereby mooting the case.under these facts,at a minimum,it appears that dearmore qualifies as a prevailing party under the sixth,seventh,and ninth circuits tests.as a result,we are not required to reverse the district court grant of attorney fees to dearmore under planned parenthood,at,or yousuf.at.
the city urges this court to hold that dearmore is not a prevailing party because the preliminary injunction simply maintained the status quo until trial,did not provide final relief on the merits,and did not materially alter the legal relationship between the parties.the city contends that it changed its position by amending the offending provision of the ordinance voluntarily,not because the preliminary injunction required it to do so.dea
