opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on an appeal by william rand,a shareholder in cbs corporation,the successor to westinghouse electric corporation,from an order entered on october,awarding plaintiff daniel mogell attorney fees of out of the requested in this derivative litigation upon its settlement.rand objected in the district court to the award of any fee and,in the alternative,objected to the quantum of the fee requested rand repeats those two objections on this appeal.inasmuch as we hold that the district court erred in awarding any fee,we do not consider whether the fee as awarded was excessive.
we only need summarize the convoluted procedural history of this case.the appeal arises from the settlement of derivative litigation against westinghouse electric corporation and its successor in interest,cbs corporation,as well as certain of the corporations directors and officers.as a matter of convenience,we will refer to the corporate defendants simply as cbs even though much of the alleged wrongdoing charged in the litigation took place before cbs succeeded to westinghouse interests.the derivative litigation was related to a shareholders class action commenced in following cbs announcement that it would incur dollar losses on account of certain loans it had made.the class action was based on alleged statutory securities and common law violations,while the derivative litigation was based on allegations that cbs officers and directors grossly mismanaged cbs and had been reckless with respect to its affairs.there is no doubt that the prosecution and defense of both the class action and derivative litigation were time consuming and costly.
in,after extensive pretrial proceedings,the class action parties reached a tentative settlement subject to court approval providing for a cash payment of to the class action plaintiffs to be paid in large part by insurance companies pursuant to liability policies covering cbs officers and directors.the settlement,however,required the termination of the derivative litigation because some of the insurance policies covered claims asserted in both the class action and derivative litigation and the companies were unwilling to pay the amount needed to settle the class action without receiving a release of their obligations in both sets of litigation.but the defendants in the derivative litigation were unwilling to provide those releases unless they,in turn,received a release of all claims asserted against them in that litigation.
ultimately,in the derivative litigation,like the class action litigation,was settled subject to court approval.see.mogell emphasized the relationship between the class action and derivative litigation to the district court in his application for approval of the derivative litigation settlement and allowance of fees as follows 
accordingly,without the release of the defendants in the derivative litigation,cbs can not obtain the substantial funds needed to bridge the gap to settle the class action litigation.thus,by obtaining these releases,which were a material component of the conditions set down by the carriers,cbs was relieved of having to pay many millions more of the settlement of the class action.even more significantly,such settlement,if approved by this court,will relieve it of many hundreds of millions of dollars of potential liability exposure from the underlying claims asserted in the class action.
app.at.mogell then went on to explain the need for the settlement of the derivative action as follows 
cbs also will not release the insurers who wrote those director and officer insurance policies without a simultaneous settlement of the derivative litigation because cbs is financially obligated under bylaws adopted in accordance with pennsylvania law to indemnify the defendants in the class action and in the derivative litigation for any liabilities and for all defense costs that are not covered by insurance.thus,even if the defendants in the derivative litigation would agree to release their insurers without a settlement of the derivative litigation,cbs would not agree to incur liabilities and defense costs in both the class action and the derivative litigation that otherwise would be covered by insurance.the release of the defendants in the derivative litigation is,therefore,an integral element of the settlement of the class action,which can now be concluded with approval by the court.
mogell then summed up what he thought was the benefit to cbs of a settlement of the derivative litigation as follows 
settlement of the class action,which could not be consummated without global releases from the carriers,directly benefits cbs because,as indicated above,cbs is a defendant in that litigation,yet will not be the principal source of funds for the litigation settlement.thus,settlement of the derivative litigation permits cbs to be provided with many millions in funds from the carriers to conclude the class action,which otherwise poses a substantial risk of liability in the hundreds of millions of dollars to cbs if it were not settled.in addition,settlement of the derivative litigation relieves cbs of any obligation to indemnify the defendants,a savings that can not be readily quantified,but which could well exceed many millions of dollars.
the derivative action stipulation of settlement dated may,included a provision by which cbs was to receive certain benefits which included that otherwise would have been paid to settle the class action litigation,to be paid by the insurance companies that had issued the officers and directors policies.id.at.the stipulation also stated that cbs was to receive the benefit that both the class action and derivative litigation would be ended.mogell,however,did not assert in his application for approval of the settlement how the derivative litigation had benefitted cbs,focusing instead on the benefits of its termination.
the stipulation in the derivative action provided that if the court approved the settlement,mogell attorney could submit an application for attorney fees and reimbursement of expenses in the amount of divided between in attorney fees and for reimbursement of expenses.cbs took no position with respect to the allowance of the fees but agreed to pay any award up to.the granting of the fee application,however,was not a condition of the settlement,id.at,and was to be considered by the court separately from the court consideration of whether the settlement is fair,reasonable,adequate and in the best interests of cbs and the holders of shares of cbs common stock.id.of course,if the court denied the fee application,the settlement nevertheless was to stand.as could be expected,mogell applied for the fees as the settlement contemplated.
the district court approved the settlement of both the class action and derivative litigation on october.at that time,however,the court did not rule on mogell fee application.instead,one year later on october,it issued a memorandum order entered on october,on the point.the memorandum recited that i n this case,cbs corporation,westinghouse successor,has derived a benefit from the disposition by settlement of the two new derivative claims and the ability to obtain a global settlement of the underlying securities action.id.at.the court,however,did not indicate that cbs received a benefit from the institution of the derivative litigation,as distinguished from its settlement.the court,after determining that a fee should be awarded,addressed the quantum of the award,pointing out that mogell attorney submitted a lodestar computation of for the value of the legal services.the court concluded,however,for reasons that we need not explain,that a deduction was appropriate and thus it awarded in fees.rand then appealed from the order of october.
ii.discussion 
the district court had jurisdiction in this action under and we have jurisdiction under.rand,as an objecting shareholder,has standing to appeal.see bell atl.bolger,cir.in general,we review the award of a fee for an abuse of discretion,although there are clear error and plenary aspects in a review including examination of factual
