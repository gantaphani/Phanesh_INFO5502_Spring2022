sued transweb for infringement of several patents.transweb sued for declaratory judgment of invalidity and of the patents.a jury found the patents to be invalid based on transweb prior public use of the patented method.in accordance with an advisory verdict from the jury,the district court found the patents unenforceable due to inequitable conduct.the jury also found to be liable for a walker process antitrust violation and that attorney fees were an appropriate antitrust remedy.the district court awarded approximately million to transweb,including trebled attorney fees as antitrust damages.the primary issues are whether sufficient corroborating evidence exists to support the finding of prior public use by transweb,and whether the attorney fees are an appropriate basis for damages under the antitrust laws in this context.we hold in the affirmative on both issues.for the latter issue,we find that transweb attorney fees appropriately flow from the unlawful aspect of antitrust violation and thus are an antitrust injury that can properly serve as the basis for antitrust damages.for these reasons,we affirm the district court judgment.
transweb and are both manufacturers of filters for respirators,such as might be worn by workers in a dirty or otherwise contaminated worksite.the filter media at issue in this case consist of nonwoven fibrous webs,which rely on a web of fibers rather than traditional woven material.both transweb and use a process of melting pellets of a filter material,such as polypropylene,blowing the melted material into a thin film,and then allowing the material to cool and solidify into the nonwoven fibrous web.
it had been known in the art for some time that a filter medium could be improved by imparting upon it an electrical charge.in this way,the filter medium can repel or capture particulates both by mechanical and electromagnetic means.a filter medium on which a semipermanent electrical charge has been imparted is referred to as an electret.
transweb and independently developed a technique for imparting this electret characteristic by using plasma fluorination.fluorination involves introducing fluorine atoms into the chemical structure of the filter web.previously known techniques involved mixing fluorine compounds into the melted filter material,but this proved disadvantageous.instead,transweb and both discovered that it would be advantageous to first form the fibrous web and then introduce the fluorine atoms into the chemical structure.this technique involves exposing a gaseous fluorine compound to the surface of the filter web in the presence of plasma.the intense heat and electromagnetic energy introduced by the plasma cause some of the chemical bonds on the surface of the filter web to break,and the fluorine atoms fill in those bonds to form fluorine compounds on the surface of the filter web.
filter media are particularly effective in oily environments,where other types of filter media might perform poorly or quickly degrade.the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh provides a rating and approval service for oily environment respirators,categorizing them as not resistant to oil resistant to oil or oil proof.the occupational safety and health administration osha provides regulations governing what niosh rating of respirators must be used in certain types of worksites within the united states.
the present appeal focuses largely on the events surrounding a filtration industry exposition that occurred in late april and early may of.it is uncontested that transweb founder,kumar ogale,attended the expo and handed out samples of filter material.the filter material included samples of transweb t melt products,an identifier for the general class of,nonwoven fibrous web,media.the primary dispute is whether ogale handed out,more specifically,samples of the t melt p products,which is the specific class of t melt products.ogale testified at trial that he did in fact hand out t melt p samples at the expo,though no independent documents or testimony evidence this fact.the parties do not contest that if ogale handed out t melt p samples at the expo,then they would serve as prior art to the plasma fluorination technique of the claimed methods.the expo occurred more than one year prior to the priority date of the patents asserted in this case,so any public disclosure of plasma fluorination at the expo would be a statutory bar to patentability,at least based on that feature.
in july of,filed patent application,to which both of patents and claim earliest priority.asserted both the and patents against transweb.in addition to the plasma fluorination of nonwoven fibrous webs described above,the patent family discloses use of,which is a technique that uses water to impart the electrical charge on the filter medium.
initially filed suit in minnesota against transweb for patent infringement.after voluntarily dismissed that suit due to an apparent personal jurisdiction issue,transweb filed suit in new jersey for declaratory judgment.
the district court in new jersey ultimately presented the following issues to a jury infringement of claims and of the patent invalidity for obviousness of claims and unenforceability of the and patents due to inequitable conduct walker process antitrust violation based on fraudulent procurement and subsequent assertion of the and patents sham litigation antitrust violation based on assertion of the and patents entitlement to lost profits damages for antitrust violations and entitlement to attorney fees as damages for antitrust violations.the jury delivered the following verdicts claims and are not infringed claims and are invalid both patents are unenforceable committed a walker process violation but not a sham litigation violation and transweb is entitled to lost profits and attorney fees as antitrust damages.

on appeal,challenges the district court judgment on validity,inequitable conduct,and antitrust liability.we address each argument in turn.
the jury found both claims of the patent invalid,and the district court denied motion for jmol of.contests this judgment based on a purported lack of corroboration of ogale public use testimony and based on alleged of the claims even if there were public use of the material.
oral testimony by an interested party on its own will generally not suffice as clear and convincing evidence of invalidity.see lazare kaplan int l photoscribe,price symsek.rather,such oral testimony must be corroborated by some other evidence.see woodland tr.flowertree nursery.the corroborating evidence can include documents and testimonial evidence.see lazare kaplan,at,adenta gmbh orthoarm,sandt tech.resco metal plastics.circumstantial evidence can be sufficient.see sandt,at knorr pearson.this corroboration requirement for testimony by an interested party is based on the sometimes unreliable nature of oral testimony,due to the forgetfulness of witnesses,their liability to mistakes,their proneness to recollect things as the party calling them would have them recollect,aside from the temptation to actual perjury.lazare kaplan,at quoting washburn moen beat em all barbed wire.
a rule of reason analysis is used to determine the sufficiency of corroboration,under which all pertinent evidence is examined in order to determine whether the inventor story is credible.sandt,at quoting price,at internal quotation marks omitted.importantly,this analysis does not require that every detail of the testimony be independently and conclusively supported by the corroborating evidence.ohio willow wood alps south.such a requirement would indeed be the antithesis of the rule of reason.cooper goldfarb.we have generally been most skeptical of oral testimony that is supported only by testimonial evidence of other interested persons.compare allergan,apotex,and lacks indus.mckechnie vehicle components usa,with adenta,at,and sandt,at.we have repeatedly noted that contemporaneous documentary evidence provides greater corroborative value.see medichem,rolabo,sandt,at finnigan int l trade comm n,woodland,at price,at.but there are no hard and fast rules as to what constitutes sufficient corroboration,and each case must be decided on its own facts.see sandt,at.
we treat the ultimate determination of whether such oral testimony is sufficiently corroborated as a question of fact,which we review for clear error.see fleming escort.
arguments against sufficiency of corroboration can be summed up as follows as a legal matter,transweb must independently evidence all material facts of the purported invalidating public use and as a factual matter,transweb provided no corroborating evidence for one of the material facts,that it was the material that was distributed at the expo.
legal argument attempts to lead us to a legal conclusion that this court has repeatedly rejected.asks us to focus on one particular detail of the oral testimony and determine whether that detail is independently evidenced.but we have repeatedly rejected an attack on corroboration of oral testimony.see fleming,at ohio willow wood,at characterizing as misplaced an argument that a particular claim feature in oral testimony was not separately evidenced,and finding the argument incompatible with the rule of reason lazare kaplan,at adenta,at.we stated this in clear terms most recently in fleming 
fleming is correct that none of the corroborating evidence constitutes definitive proof of orr account or discloses each claim limitation as written.but the corroboration requirement has never been so demanding.it is a flexible,demand for independent evidence that,as a whole,makes credible the testimony of the purported prior inventor with regard to conception and reduction to practice of the invention as claimed.
fleming,at citations omitted.as applied to this case,our rule of reason analysis requires that independent evidence,taken as a whole,makes credible ogale testimony that he distributed the material at the expo.
in any event,factual argument that transweb provided no corroborating evidence that it was the material that ogale distributed at the expo is incorrect.the correspondence with fourth state demonstrates that transweb had produced the material at least three months prior to the expo.transweb own patent application,filed at the same time as the expo,demonstrates that ogale had invented and was seeking patent protection for the material at least by the time of the expo.the correspondence with filtration group demonstrates that ogale was sending out samples of the t melt product shortly after the expo.the numerous correspondences contemporaneous with the filtration group correspondence,each accompanying samples of filter material not specifically identified as t melt,show that ogale was sending out other samples of filter material that may have been.the correspondence with gerson demonstrates that transweb was offering for sale large quantities of the product within two months of the expo.considered in its totality,this body of evidence provides abundant support for the credibility of ogale claim that he distributed the material at the expo.as such,we find no clear error in the district court determination that ogale testimony was sufficiently corroborated.
argues that,even if transweb publicly used material at the expo,the claims are still.argument rests on two contentions for claim,it was not obvious to use hydrocharging on a material and for both claims and,objective indicia demonstrate the of the claims.
admits that hydrocharging was in the art,at least based on patent to angadjivand.but notes that the angadjivand patent counsels against any unnecessary treatment which might increase the filter material electrical connectivity including ultraviolet irradiation.angadjivand patent ll.based on the testimony of both transweb and expert witnesses,the filter material is exposed to some ultraviolet radiation during plasma fluorination.but transweb expert witness also testified that the amount of ultraviolet radiation emitted during plasma fluorination was minimal,refuting the notion that the passage of the angadjivand patent would have significantly discouraged a person having ordinary skill in the art from using hydrocharging on material.the jury was free to credit this testimony and conclude based on the evidence presented that claim was obvious.we see no error in this determination.
further contends that unexpected results and commercial success demonstrate the of the claims.for commercial success,relies on a single,confused exchange between its attorney and transweb expert witness at trial,wherein the witness says that he does not know about the commercial success of products,though maybe he said he did in the past.similarly with unexpected results,relies on a single,annotation in the patent inventor notebook and a corresponding statement at trial.the jury heard and rejected this evidence in concluding that the claims were obvious.none of these arguments as to objective indicia demonstrate that the jury was unreasonable in finding the claims obvious,so we will not disturb that verdict.
the jury reached an advisory verdict that both the and patents were unenforceable for inequitable conduct.the district court reached the same conclusion.contests this judgment on all of the required elements of inequitable conduct.
a judgment of inequitable conduct requires clear and convincing evidence of materiality,knowledge of materiality,and a deliberate decision to deceive.therasense,becton,dickinson,en banc.except in cases of egregious misconduct,the materiality must reach the level of materiality,meaning that the pto would not have allowed a claim had it been aware of the undisclosed prior art.id.at.intent to deceive may be found only if specific intent to deceive is the single most reasonable inference able to be drawn from the evidence.id.at.if more than one reasonable inference is possible,intent to deceive can not be found.id.at.a court may infer intent from indirect and circumstantial evidence because direct evidence of deceptive intent is rare.id.at.
this court reviews the district court ultimate determination of inequitable conduct for abuse of discretion and underlying factual determinations for clear error.star scientific reynolds tobacco.
the expo samples present a definitional case of materiality.during prosecution of the application,the examiner initially allowed all claims.when notified the examiner of one of the transweb samples that it had on hand,the examiner rejected all claims as obvious over that disclosure and the angadjivand patent.only when clarified its dubious assertion that the transweb samples were only received after signing of a confidentiality agreement and thus were not prior art did the examiner allow the claims.because the examiner would not have allowed the claims had the transweb samples been properly disclosed as prior art,the transweb samples are material.
the district court concluded based on a detailed review of the record that marvin jones,an inventor for the asserted patents,and karl hanson,an attorney at,both acted with specific intent to deceive the patent office as to the transweb materials.the jury unanimously reached the same conclusion.while it is not necessary for us to recount the entire treatment of the factual record performed so thoroughly by the district court,see transweb,llc innovative properties,d,we note a few particular details that demonstrate that the district court did not clearly err in finding a specific intent to deceive on the part of jones and hanson.
the record makes abundantly clear that generally and jones particularly were very much aware of the samples transweb was distributing at the expo.a week prior to the expo,a group of six employees was party to a lengthy email coordinating efforts to gather information from transweb at the expo.the email identified two employees as the point people in gathering information from transweb.the other parties to the email and their subordinates were to channel any questions through the point people.one of the point people had already met with transweb and received quite a bit of information and samples.id.the email also included an article from nonwovens industry briefly mentioning transweb t melt products.one of the parties to the email was jones supervisor,and she forwarded the email to jones on the day that the expo began.jones attended the expo.while he professed at trial to have no recollection of visiting the transweb booth,the district court found his testimony simply not credible and noted that his demeanor was one of a witness trying to distance himself from any knowledge of transweb presence and activities at the expo.transweb,d at.jones supervisor again sent him an email within a month after the expo detailing the information and samples received from transweb by the point people.this email noted that transweb production operations were up and running,that it was sending samples to potential clients,that already had a small sample,and that was expecting a larger sample soon thereafter.
further evidence shows that jones knew not only that transweb distributed material at the expo,but that it was material.within a year of the expo,jones was told directly by an employee of racal an independent filtration company at the time of the expo that was acquired by in the following year that transweb had been producing material and that transweb had provided samples of such to racal.the district court noted that the employees seemed to proceed with a newfound earnest in preparing their own patent application and supporting lab notebooks around this same time.the racal employee eventually sent the samples received from transweb to jones,identifying them as being.around the same time,another employee forwarded the original expo planning email to jones and hanson,noting that it did not explicitly indicate plasma fluorination.the district court found that this email indicated a to some sort of oral conversation between jones,hanson,and the other employee regarding what transweb was distributing at the time of the expo.another employee later requested samples of the material from transweb on behalf of jones and hanson,noting that some of the products had been mentioned in the nonwovens industry publication.
the district court found that hanson undertook an intentional scheme to paper over the potentially prior art nature of the samples.the racal employees received the samples from transweb at latest one month after the expo.therefore,these samples were highly relevant to what transweb distributed at the expo.the record casts great doubt on whether racal had received the samples before or after execution of a confidentiality agreement,thereby potentially rendering them public disclosures and prior art to the application.at around the same time that was requesting further samples from transweb and learning of the potential prior art nature of the racal samples,hanson sent a confusing letter to ogale purporting to clarify some issues as to the confidentially agreements between transweb and and between transweb and racal.hanson had never had any communication with transweb,and the district court concluded that the only possible purpose for the letter was to get an admission from ogale that the samples were covered by a confidentiality agreement,even though this point was itself dubious.hanson subsequently did submit this letter to the patent office as definitive proof that the transweb samples were not prior art to the application.
the district court noted other circumstantial evidence suggesting a specific intent by employees to hide the prior art nature of the transweb products.the district court noted that only after hanson met with the racal employee did that employee type meeting notes from his original meeting with ogale after the expo.those typed notes contained additional information regarding patents that had not been in the original handwritten notes.the district court noted that hanson waited several years between learning of the potential transweb prior art and informing the patent office.in fact,hanson did not disclose the transweb material to the patent office until after negotiations for to purchase transweb had broken down.further,hanson waited until the last possible moment,when a notice of allowance had already been mailed,to submit the transweb material in a request for continued prosecution.the district court found hanson testimony at trial attempting to explain this delay wholly incredible.
based on these factual findings,the district court concluded that the only reasonable inference that explains the actions of hanson and jones is that they strategically delayed in disclosing the transweb prior art and then intentionally made an inaccurate disclosure of that material.we can find no clear error in this conclusion,particularly as the district court findings are based in large degree on its determinations that jones and hanson were not credible during relevant parts of their testimony.see in re rosuvastatin calcium patent,this court may not reassess,and indeed is incapable of reassessing,witness credibility and motive issues on review.quoting lnp eng g plastics,miller waste mills.
finding no clear error in the district court determinations on both materiality and specific intent,and finding no other improprieties in the district court analysis,we see no abuse of discretion in the district court ultimate conclusion of unenforceability for inequitable conduct.
the jury found that committed a walker process antitrust violation,and awarded transweb damages of lost profits and attorney fees.the district court denied motion for jmol.contests this judgment based on several purported flaws in market definitions for the antitrust claim and based on the theory that transweb attorney fees are not appropriate antitrust damages for the walker process violation.
in walker process,the supreme court held that a plaintiff could bring an action under of the sherman act based on the alleged maintenance and enforcement of a patent.see walker process equip.food mach.chem,d.in order to prevail on a walker process claim,the must show two things first,that the obtained the patent by knowing and willful fraud on the patent office and maintained and enforced the patent with knowledge of the fraudulent procurement and second,all the other elements necessary to establish a sherman act monopolization claim.see ritz camera image sandisk.
transweb monopolization claim arises under of the sherman act as an attempt to monopolize.the other elements necessary to establish an attempted monopolization claim are that the defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive conduct with a specific intent to monopolize and a dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power.spectrum sports,mcquillan,d.in determining the dangerous probability of achieving monopoly power for element,the courts look at the relevant market and the defendant ability to lessen or destroy competition in that market.id.
in this case,does not contest that transweb inequitable conduct showing,if affirmed,along with bringing of the infringement suit proves the first walker process requirement,as well as elements and of the second walker process requirement.we have previously explained that walker process liability requires a higher,more specific showing of knowing and willful fraud than the more inclusive inequitable conduct doctrine.nobelpharma ab implant innovations,see also dippin dots,mosey.after therasense,the showing required for proving inequitable conduct and the showing required for proving the fraud component of walker process liability may be nearly identical.see,gideon mark leigh anenson,inequitable conduct and walker process claims after therasense and the america invents act.bus.regardless,because does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury walker process fraud finding beyond challenging the inequitable conduct finding,we will accept as admitted that transweb sufficiently demonstrated the walker process fraud component.
instead,challenges whether the district court properly defined the relevant market for determining dangerous probability of monopoly power in element,and whether the award of transweb attorney fees is appropriate even if the walker process case were proven.
the relevant market is defined by both a product market and a geographic market.see brown shoe united states,d.this court applies the law of the regional circuit as to market definition.see nobelpharma,at.under third circuit law,the definition of both the product and geographic boundaries of the relevant market is a question of fact.see gordon lewistown,cir weiss york,cir.
transweb defined two distinct markets an upstream market for fluorinated polymeric material and a downstream market for respirators in the united states.challenges the scope of the relevant products for the former and the geographic scope for the latter.
the relevant product market consists of all products that are reasonably interchangeable by consumers for the same purposes.united states du pont de nemours.see also queen city pizza domino pizza,cir.reasonable interchangeability may be determined by looking at price,use,and qualities of the products.see du pont de nemours,at tunis.ford motor,cir.
argues that the district court erred in limiting the upstream market to fluorinated products.in particular,argues that filter media,such as fiberglass and pleated material,are interchangeable with fluorinated media,and that transweb expert admitted as much.
while points to evidence supporting a conclusion that fluorinated material does not form a distinct market,this does not undermine the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury conclusion to the contrary.evidence demonstrated that fluorinated material has a lower pressure drop while maintaining high filtration,as compared to other filter media fluorinated material has a longer service life than other filter media and customers would pay more for respirators with the fluorinated media.taken together,this evidence provides a sufficient basis on which a reasonable jury could conclude that the price,use,and qualities of fluorinated material render it a distinct market from other filter media.
the relevant geographic market is the area in which a potential buyer may rationally look for the goods or services he or she seeks.tunis,at quoting.dental ass med.serv.ass of,cir.consequently,the geographic market is not comprised of the region in which the seller attempts to sell its product,but rather is comprised of the area where his customers would look to buy such a product.id.at.
argues that the district court erred in limiting the downstream market for respirators to the united states.in particular,argues that buyers look to overseas companies to purchase respirators,and that transweb expert testimony on the relevant geographic market was without basis.
argument is based primarily on an artificial distinction.by repeatedly pointing to the potential for buyers to purchase respirators from foreign manufacturers,implies that the united states market only includes respirators manufactured in the united states.but transweb expert clarified that sales of respirators in the united states by foreign manufacturers were already included in his calculations for the united states geographic market.see j.as such,the flaw proffered by in the definition of the geographic market is not present.
beyond this artificial distinction,there is also no lack of evidence to support the jury verdict.the district court noted that the niosh certifications are relevant to companies operating in the united states,as the united states osha promulgates regulations regarding the use of respirators by employees.as such,the jury could have reasonably concluded that niosh certification is most relevant to buyers in the united states,given that osha regulations are limited to the united states.evidence also demonstrated that itself reviewed sales in the united states market distinct from other markets.finally,while notes that transweb expert did not perform any calculations to determine that the united states is the relevant geographic market,his testimony was still based on expert opinion on which the jury was entitled to rely.therefore,there was a sufficient basis on which a reasonable jury could conclude that the united states was the relevant geographic market for the respirators.
final challenge is to the district court award of attorney fees as antitrust damages.
section of the clayton act provides that any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained,and the cost of suit,including a reasonable attorney fee.a.the jury concluded that transweb was entitled to its lost profits and attorney fees in recompense for antitrust violation.the jury found liable for approximately in lost profits,which the district court awarded to transweb as the trebled amount of approximately.after review by a special master,the district court concluded that transweb incurred approximately million in attorney fees prosecuting the antitrust claim and approximately million defending the infringement suit.the district court awarded the million on a basis as cost of suit fees.the district court awarded the million trebled to approximately million as damages.does not appeal the lost profits or cost of suit fees.
argues that the district court erred in awarding the million of damages,because transweb failed to show any link between those attorney fees and an impact on competition.argues that those attorney fees had no effect on competition because they did not force transweb out of the market or otherwise affect prices in the market.on this basis,argues that those attorney fees are not an antitrust injury and thus can not be a proper basis for antitrust damages.
section of the clayton act does not provide recompense for any injury causally linked to a violation of the antitrust laws,but rather only for antitrust injury.see atl.richfield usa petroleum,d brunswick pueblo bowl o mat,d.transweb of million must be attributable to an aspect of the practice under scrutiny in order to qualify as an antitrust injury.atl.richfield,at.stated another way,transweb must stem from a aspect or effect of the defendant behavior,not from or aspects.id.at.
argument focuses on the fact that the harmful effect on competition proven by transweb at trial never actually came about.transweb proved at trial that increased prices for fluorinated filter media and respirators would have resulted had succeeded in its suit.however,because transweb prevailed,these effects never materialized.
we do not read the antitrust injury requirement from atlantic richfield,brunswick,and similar cases to so narrowly define the scope of antitrust injury.those cases dealt with situations where the actions,though unlawful,would not have actually reduced competition.see,atl.richfield,at rejecting attempt to recover profits lost due to an increase in competition and reduction in prices caused by vertical,arrangement cargill,monfort of,d rejecting attempt to block merger on the theory that the merged companies would increase competition and lower prices brunswick,at rejecting attempt to recover lost marginal profits that were not achieved because an acquiring company purchased a failing company,thus maintaining competition with the.
in this case,however,unlawful act was in fact aimed at reducing competition and would have done so had the suit been successful.unlawful act was the bringing of suit based on a patent known to be fraudulently obtained.what made this act unlawful under the antitrust laws was its attempt to gain a monopoly based on this patent.transweb attorney fee
