coleman jackson appeals the district court order granting in part and denying in part his motion for attorney fees and his supplemental application for attorney fees pursuant to b,and the prison litigation reform act of plra,d.jackson contends that d does not govern his motion for attorney fees and his supplemental application for attorney fees,because his action challenged the length of his confinement and not prison conditions within the meaning of a.alternatively,he contends that d violates his right to equal protection under the due process clause of the fifth amendment the state board of pardons and paroles,contending that the court erroneously awarded jackson,or attorney fees incurred in the course of litigating his petition for attorney fees.these three arguments present issues of first impression in this circuit.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
on august,jackson was convicted of aggravated assault and sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment with five years to serve in prison and fifteen years of probation as of august,the date jackson committed the assault,a prisoner convicted of aggravated assault was required to serve a minimum of of his prison term before becoming eligible for a parole hearing before the board.see f.on december,however,the board amended its policy to provide that a prisoner convicted on or after january,of certain crimes,including aggravated assault,must serve a minimum of ninety percent of his term before becoming eligible for a parole hearing.the board applied its policy is,the board applied the new policy to all convictions entered on or after january,even if the underlying criminal conduct occurred before january.thus,under the new policy,the board postponed the date of jackson initial parole eligibility hearing.
after his requests to reconsider his parole eligibility were denied twice by the board and once by georgia superior courts sentence review panel,jackson filed a joint motion for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to and a complaint for damages pursuant to.he alleged that by applying the new policy to his offense the board retroactively increased his punishment in violation of the ex post facto clause of the united states constitution.the magistrate judge recommended that the district court dismiss his habeas corpus petition without prejudice for lack of exhaustion of administrative remedies,dismiss his claim for damages under,and permit his claim for equitable relief under to proceed.jackson subsequently filed objections to the report and recommendation and incorporated a motion for equitable judgment therein.
the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation and,after conducting an evidentiary hearing,granted jackson motion for equitable judgment,permanently enjoined the board from enforcing the new policy against jackson,and ordered the board to provide jackson with an initial parole eligibility hearing within days of the order.as a result,the board held a hearing and subsequently notified the court that it granted jackson parole 
thereafter,pursuant to b,jackson filed the instant motion for attorney fees in the amount of and costs in the amount of,for a total award of.the board objected to his motion and asserted that because jackson filed a claim with respect to prison conditions,a,the motion for attorney fees and costs should be governed by d of the plra thereafter,jackson filed a reply brief and a supplemental application for attorney fees incurred while litigating the underlying motion in the amount of.
the district court concluded that governed jackson underlying claim and thus his motion for attorney fees,because the underlying claim challenged prison conditions within the meaning of a d fees restrictions do not violate the equal protection component of the fifth amendment and d permits a prevailing plaintiff to recover.thus,pursuant to and d,the court granted in part and denied in part jackson motion for attorney fees and costs and his supplemental application for attorney fees jackson appeals the court application of d to his motion for attorney fees and his supplemental application for attorney fees and the board,challenging jackson supplemental attorney fees award as impermissible.see id.d a prohibiting attorney fees that are not directly and reasonably incurred in proving an actual violation of the plaintiff rights.
discussion 
applicability of d 
under b,a district court may,in its discretion,award reasonable attorney fees to a successful plaintiff.see id.b accordingly,neither party disputes that,as a successful plaintiff,jackson may receive reasonable attorney fees under.see id.the parties disagree,however,on the applicability of d to jackson underlying claim and thus his motion for attorney fees.see id.d restricting attorney fees awards authorized under i n any action brought by a prisoner.jackson contends that d is not applicable to his motion for attorney fees,because his action challenged the length of his confinement and not prison conditions within the meaning of a.the board alleges that because jackson action was brought by a prisoner,d is applicable to his motion for attorney fees.
we begin our construction of section d where courts should always begin the process of legislative interpretation,and where they often should end it as well,which is with the words of the statutory provision.harris garner,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.section d provides,
in any action brought by a prisoner who is confined to any jail,prison,or other correctional facility,in which attorney fees are authorized under,such fees shall not be awarded,except to the extent that 
a the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in proving an actual violation of the plaintiff rights protected by a statute pursuant to which a fee may be awarded under section and 
b i the amount of the fee is proportionately related to the court ordered relief for the violation or 
ii the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in enforcing the relief ordered for the violation.
d a b footnotes omitted emphasis added.here,we must determine the meaning of the phrase any action brought by a prisoner to decide whether d applies to jackson underlying action and thus his motion for attorney fees and his supplemental application for attorney fees.
in the absence of a statutory definition of a term,we look to the common usage of words for their meaning.cbs primetime joint venture,cir internal quotation marks omitted.often,courts look to dictionary definitions to ascertain the common usage of words.id.at.the dictionary definition of the word action is a legal proceeding by which one seeks to have a wrong put right lawsuit.webster new world college dictionary michael agnes et,ed see also black law dictionary bryan garner et,ed defining action as a civil or criminal judicial proceeding.
furthermore,congress chose an expansive word any instead of a restrictive one.cbs,at see also united states gonzales,d read naturally,the word any has an expansive meaning.we previously stated that the adjective any is not ambiguous it has a meaning.lyes city of riviera beach,cir en banc internal quotation marks omitted.therefore,without any language to limit the significance of this modifier,any means all.cbs,at internal quotation marks omitted.hence,the phrase any action covers a lawsuit challenging the length of an inmate confinement.
additionally,we have held that the term brought,as used in subsections a and e of,means filed.see harris,at interpreting the term brought as used in e n o federal civil action shall be brought language to mean filed miller tanner,cir interpreting the term brought as used in a n o action shall be brought language to mean filed.normally,identical words that appear in various parts of the same act are meant to have the same meaning.see atl.cleaners dyers united states.t here is a natural presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.thus,the term brought as used in d i n any action brought language means filed.see d.
finally,we need not resort to common usage to determine the meaning of the term prisoner in d,because
