background 
evans jeff 
this action must be viewed in the context of evans jeff,d.in evans,plaintiffs in a class action suit entered into a settlement that included a waiver of statutory attorney fees under,which permits an award of fees to a prevailing party in a federal civil rights lawsuit plaintiffs argued that the district court should have rejected the fee waiver as inconsistent with.they contended the fee waiver was a product of coercion because it exploited the ethical obligation of plaintiffs counsel to recommend any settlement that was in the best interests of the clients.id.at.concluding that it is not necessary to construe the fees act,as embodying a general rule prohibiting settlements conditioned on the waiver of fees in order to be faithful to the purposes of that act,the court rejected plaintiffs claims.id.at.but the court suggested that might prohibit fee waivers in three specific situations.first,might bar a governmental unit from implementing a statute,policy,or practice precluding the payment of attorney fees in settlements of civil rights cases.id.at.second,a district court might be required to disapprove a fee waiver that was part of a vindictive effort to deter attorneys from representing plaintiffs in civil rights suits.id.at.finally,an action might lie if it were shown that fee waivers have had the effect,in the aggregate and in the long run,of shrinking the pool of lawyers willing to represent plaintiffs in such cases,thereby constricting the effective access to the judicial process for persons with civil rights grievances which the fees act was intended to provide.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.noting that comment on this last issue was premature,the court added that as a practical matter the likelihood of this circumstance arising is remote.id.
then,in willard city of los angeles,cir,the plaintiffs settled a civil rights action in exchange for a lump sum,which included all attorney fees potentially recoverable under.id.at.they nonetheless moved for an award of attorney fees,arguing that the settlement was unenforceable.id.the district court denied the motion.we affirmed,but,following evans,stated that a settlement waiving fees might be unenforceable if the governmental unit had a statute,policy,or practice requiring waiver of fees as a condition of settlement or it has vindictively sought to deter attorneys from bringing civil rights suits.id.at.
bernhardt complaint.
in this case,bernhardt sought to pick up where evans and willard left off.bernhardt alleged that the county of los angeles and county counsel lloyd pellman collectively,the county have,since,had a custom,practice and policy to offer or accept settlements in federal civil rights cases only for a lump sum,including all attorney fees.bernhardt alleged that the policy had deprived her of her implied federal statutory right under section to contract with an attorney for representation in exchange for an assignment to the attorney of the right to seek statutory attorney fees.the county policy,she alleged,violates the supremacy clause by implicitly repealing.see const.art.vi,cl.she sought declaratory and injunctive relief,compensatory and punitive damages and attorney fees and costs.
bernhardt more specifically alleged the county policy deprived her of the opportunity to obtain a civil rights lawyer to represent her in a separate action against county law enforcement officials for use of excessive force the underlying action.between october and january,she said,she contacted eight attorneys or law firms to represent her.none of the attorneys took her case,even though some commented positively about the merits of her claims.one of the attorneys allegedly told bernhardt that it was the county lump sum settlement policy that precluded him from representing her.bernhardt ultimately filed the underlying action in pro per,the case was dismissed and bernhardt appealed.bernhardt complaint alleged that she would be able to obtain a lawyer in the appeal of the underlying action if she obtained injunctive or declaratory relief in the instant action.subsequent to the dismissal of the instant action,we dismissed the appeal in bernhardt underlying action.thus,the underlying action is no longer pending.
c.the district court dismissal.
the district court,looking solely to the allegations in bernhardt complaint,sua sponte dismissed bernhardt action for lack of standing.first,the court noted that bernhardt,unlike the willard plaintiffs,was not a prevailing party in her lawsuit and therefore was not entitled under to attorney fees that she was forced to waive in settlement.thus,the district court reasoned,she did not have standing to raise the issue left open by evans and willard.second,the district court further found that bernhardt factual allegations inadequately established the article iii standing requirements of injury and causation.the court stated,allegations that some attorneys refused to represent the plaintiff for various other reasons,and that one attorney told the plaintiff he would not take her case because of the county alleged lump sum settlement policy,do not show that the county alleged settlement policy prevented the plaintiff from obtaining counsel.finally,the court found bernhardt allegations too speculative.it was pure speculation that a settlement would be offered in her case,or that the county would require her to waive fees in the event of settlement.
standing is a question of law reviewed de novo.myers,city and county of san francisco,cir.
because the district court sua sponte dismissed bernhardt complaint on its face,we will review her standing as if raised in a motion to dismiss.when reviewing motions to dismiss,we must accept all factual allegations of the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party western ctr.for journalism cederquist,cir per curiam quoting tworivers lewis,cir.for purposes of ruling on a motion to dismiss for want of standing,both the trial and reviewing courts must accept as true all material allegations of the complaint,and must construe the complaint in favor of the complaining party.graham fema,cir quoting warth seldin,d.we need not,and do not,speculate as to the plausibility of plaintiff allegations western ctr.for journalism,at.w e consider only the facts alleged in the complaint and in any documents appended thereto.id.at.a plaintiff needs only to plead general factual allegations of injury in order to survive a motion to dismiss,for we presume that general allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to support the claim.lso,stroh,cir quoting lujan defenders of wildlife,d.
as an initial matter,the county contends there was no subject matter jurisdiction in the district court because bernhardt claim was brought under,which does not provide independent jurisdiction.it is true that section does not by its terms confer subject matter jurisdiction upon federal courts,but rather relies upon the provisions of other federal statutes,such as section read in conjunction with,to confer subject matter jurisdiction.branson nott,cir quoting keene cass,cir.but bernhardt complaint was brought under rather than.the phrase section appears in the caption of the complaint.in addition,the language used in the complaint,stating that bernhardt has been deprived,under color of law,of her implied federal statutory right under,closely tracks the language of thus,the district court had subject matter jurisdiction
