yogi berra might describe this case as deja vu all over again.for if the case seems familiar,it may be because we have decided the precise question presented in this appeal twice times under virtually identical most recently,against the same appellant.see speciale seybold,cir blackburn sundstrand,cir.in both of these earlier cases we held that a petition to apportion claims to a settlement fund between an erisa plan subrogation claim and other lienholders was not preempted by erisa civil enforcement provision and the allocation of the funds was a matter for determination in the state court.in the present case,asks us to the issue,this time in the context of an award of in attorney fees,which the district court taxed against under c.after serious consideration mainly of the possibility of sanctioning for bringing this presumptuous appeal,we reaffirm our previous holdings in blackburn and speciale and affirm the order of the district court.
on december,appellee justin hart suffered permanent brain injury in an automobile accident with robert chinn.as a result of his injuries,hart received substantial medical treatment and incurred certain resulting liens.at the time of the accident,hart was an employee of stores.blue shield is the administrator of the stores associates health and welfare plan,an employee welfare benefits plan governed by the employee retirement income security act of erisa.the plan paid out in medical benefits for the treatment stemming from his injuries.
hart filed a tort suit against chinn in the circuit court of rock island county and ultimately obtained a settlement in the amount of.after reaching this settlement,hart filed a petition in the state court to adjudicate the liens of six separate lienholders,including blue shield as administrator of the plan hereinafter.plan included a right to reduction,reimbursement and subrogation provision.br.at.believed that unlike federal law,illinois state law allowed common fund reductions for attorney fees even when the plan terms expressly disclaimed the doctrine.thus,in an apparent effort to take advantage of the more favorable federal law,independently removed the case to the central district of illinois pursuant to a,b and c,arguing that hart claim was completely preempted by erisa.
hart filed a motion to remand on july,arguing that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.in an order dated december,the district court ordered that the case be remanded.the district court relied on our holdings in blackburn and speciale in finding that erisa preemption was not applicable.moreover,the district court noted that the case had not been properly removed under because failed to join the other lienholders in its notice of removal.
thereafter,hart filed a petition pursuant to c,seeking in attorney fees and costs for improper removal.opposed this petition,arguing that hart had not submitted any evidence of a reasonable hourly rate hart counsel claimed tasks were insufficiently documented hart counsel time entries were excessive and hart bill of costs should be denied.in an order dated april,the district court awarded in attorney fees.this appeal followed.
jurisdiction 
an order remanding a case to the state court from which it was removed is generally not subject to appeal.d.the purpose of precluding review is to avoid the delay that might be caused by prolonged federal litigation of jurisdictional questions.see matter of amoco petroleum additives,cir mobile abeille general ins,cir appalachian volunteers,clark,cir in re macneil,cir.however,it is that an award of attorney fees occasioned by a wrongful removal is an independently appealable order not subject to the prohibition against reviewing a remand order.see garbie daimlerchrysler,cir lamotte roundy,cir.
it is equally clear that an evaluation of the merits of a remand order may be required to determine whether the district court award of attorney fees was appropriate.see sirotzky new york stock,cir p laintiff must show the remand order was correct that is,that removal was improper moore permanente med.group,cir s ome evaluation of the merits of the remand order is necessary to review an award of attorney fees roxbury condo.ass n,anthony cupo agency,cir miranti lee,cir.this merits review does not conflict with the purpose of d because the state court action may proceed expediently while the appellate court reviews the award of attorney fees.even if the appellate court determines that it was an abuse of discretion to award attorney fees because the decision to remand was improper,the remand itself may not be disturbed.see dahl rosenfeld,cir roxbury,at 
generally,we review a district court award of attorney fees for abuse of discretion.see tenner zurek,cir.however,a district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law cooter gell hartmarx,d salgado by salgado motors,cir.if removal is found to be improper,the plaintiff is presumptively entitled to an award of fees.see sirotzky,at.
as an initial matter,hart argues that waived its argument by not specifically reiterating it in opposing attorney fees.hart br.at.it is true that in opposing attorney fees below,attacked only the amount of the fees rather than the merits of the remand order.however,hart does not dispute that actively contested and lost the issue whether removal was proper before opposing the award of attorney fees.after had made its position plain and lost the issue on the merits,it would be senseless to require that reiterate its argument in a futile effort to oppose attorney fees.see,dawson new york life ins,cir rejecting a similar waiver argument and noting that at some point further objection became useless dresser indus.v.the gradall,cir same.hart can not claim that he was prejudiced in any way by decision not to beat a dead horse in the district court.nor did decision deprive the district court of a meaningful opportunity to review the issue of subject matter jurisdiction.therefore,we find that did not waive its argument.
attorney fees 
to determine whether the district court award of attorney fees was appropriate,we must decide whether the district court properly found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.when determining whether federal jurisdiction exists,we must follow the complaint rule,which states that federal question jurisdiction exists only when the plaintiff complaint raises issues of federal law.metro.life ins.taylor,d jass prudential health care plan,cir the issues raised in the plaintiff complaint,not those added in the defendant response,control the litigation.the paramount policies embodied in the complaint rule are that the plaintiff is master of the complaint and that the plaintiff may,by eschewing claims based on federal law,choose to have the cause heard in state court.caterpillar,williams,d.
however,there is an exception to the complaint rule,known as the complete preemption doctrine which provides that,where congress has completely preempted a given area of state law,a plaintiff state law claim will be recharacterized as a federal claim so that removal becomes proper.see avco aero lodge int l ass of machinists and aerospace workers,d.the supreme court has determined that all state actions falling within the scope of section a of erisa,a,are preempted under the complete preemption doctrine.taylor,at.section a provides that a civil action may be brought by a participant or beneficiary a for the relief provided in subsection c of this section,or b to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.a.therefore,any claim by a participant or beneficiary to enforce his rights under an erisa plan is completely preempted,and federal subject matter jurisdiction would exist.see jass,at.
argues that complete preemption under a applies here.the problem for is that we have already decided in two nearly identical cases that it does not.see speciale,at blackburn,at.in blackburn,the plaintiffs were injured in an automobile accident with another driver.under their ben
