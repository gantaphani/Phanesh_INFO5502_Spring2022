factual and procedural background 
investigation 
before attempting to arrest at the rodriguez family home on piedmont street in oxnard,california,thompson,the officer in charge of the operation,reviewed the file on maintained by the former immigration and naturalization service ins.the file included identifying information such as a physical description,a driver license number and picture,and social security number.the file also contained two addresses for,neither of which was on piedmont street.in fact,the ins had over fifteen possible addresses for,none of which was on piedmont street.
thompson also searched records maintained by the california department of motor vehicles in an attempt to determine location.in his first search,he entered marisela and her date of birth.the search yielded an address other than the piedmont street address.thompson then entered the name marisela rodriguez with no date of birth and obtained a result for marisela rodriguez v at the piedmont street address.the search also revealed the make,model,and license plate of the car registered to marisela rodriguez but thompson does not recall comparing any of the identifying information he had about with information about marisela rodriguez v,nor did any officer conduct surveillance or attempt to contact the occupants at the piedmont street address to determine if resided there.
b.the operation 
at about on the morning of the operation,thompson met with three other ins officers hoffman,oliver,and vazquez.he showed them a photograph of and told them of the vehicles registered to her.he also told the officers that they were required to obtain consent before entering the home on piedmont street.around approximately,while it was still dark,the four officers approached the front door of the rodriguez family home and woke the family by yelling and pounding on the front door.maria and roberto rodriguez and four children ranging from ages two to were asleep in the house at the time the officers arrived.
when maria arrived at the door,the officers told her it was the police and ordered her to open the door.maria opened the door slightly and saw four armed men.according to maria,the officers did not show their credentials or tell maria or anyone else that they were from the ins or why they were there.thompson believed that maria was thirty or years old,and hoffman thought she was between and years old and had a fairly slender,medium build.based on the information available to the ins,the target of the operation,was years old,five feet tall,and pounds.
maria,who speaks only spanish,testified that she told the officers to wait so she could get dressed and obtain the help of an family member.according to maria,after she told the officers to wait,she turned and the officers followed her into the house.maria testified that she did not explicitly tell the officers they could not come in,but that they did not ask for permission to enter.when maria noticed the men had entered the home,she was too scared and nervous to say anything.according to maria,as she approached her bedroom,she encountered her daughter yolanda who asked what was going on,and thompson ordered yolanda to shut up and go sit down in the living room.
the officers various accounts of whether they had consent to enter are,however,less than clear.according to thompson trial testimony,hoffman requested permission to enter in spanish,maria consented,and yolanda appeared at the door less than a minute later and also consented before the officers entered the house.in an earlier incident report,thompson claimed that maria gave consent to enter.but in a sworn interview,thompson stated that maria answered the door and yolanda consented to their entry he recalled that he spoke to maria in english and she appeared confused.in response to an interrogatory,thompson answered that maria consented to the officers entering her home.at his deposition in,thompson testified that maria answered the door,that hoffman asked for permission to enter in spanish,and then yolanda appeared and gave consent to enter.
at trial,hoffman testified that he asked maria in spanish if the officers could come in and she,not yolanda,gave the officers permission to enter by responding si.in an earlier interview,hoffman stated that it was yolanda that gave consent.vasquez,who is fluent in spanish,testified that hoffman asked for permission to enter in spanish and maria said yes vasquez believed she said yes in english.and oliver testified that maria gave permission to enter by saying si.
litigation 
the rodriguez family sued the united states and the ins officers.the government successfully narrowed the claims against the individual defendants prior to filing for summary judgment,and the district court granted,in part,the government motion for partial summary judgment dismissing certain claims against the four officers and the united states.
the court held a bench trial on the ftca claims,and the united states asserted,among other defenses,that the officers were privileged to enter the home,that they obtained consent to enter,and that the members of the rodriguez family were contributorily negligent based on their actions when the officers arrived.the district court entered judgment against the united states and in favor of the rodriguez family,awarding the family a total of in damages.
the rodriguez family filed a motion for attorney fees under the eaja.the district court first concluded that the government argument that the officers entry was privileged because they had reasonable suspicion to believe that would be at the rodriguez family home was reckless and frivolous.the district court similarly found that the government argument that the officers had consent to enter the home was likewise reckless and frivolous.finally,the district court concluded that the government prelitigation conduct was also in bad faith the court awarded the rodriguez family a total of in attorney fees.
