factual and procedural background 
the improvement of santa monica boulevard 
in the city of west hollywood acquired the stretch of santa monica boulevard located within its city limits from the california department of transportation.after the acquisition the city decided to completely refurbish the boulevard,which had fallen into disrepair,including removal and replacement of the roadway,construction of sidewalks and traffic medians and installation of new traffic signals and extensive landscaping.the city retained willdan,which had previously done work for the city,to,among other things,design the roadway,prepare the construction documents for the street improvements and provide construction management services.the city contracted with other consultants as well,including associated soils engineering,associated soils to test construction materials.the city retained shawnan as the general contractor its bid of was the lowest responsible and responsive bid.the project,including design and construction,ultimately cost approximately million.
the dispute between the city and shawnan over increased construction costs the settlement agreement 
during construction,which primarily took place between and,several serious problems caused projected construction costs to increase by more than million.in particular,the railroad tracks located under a portion of the boulevard proved not to be a single set of tracks buried in the earthen median,as reflected on the plans and specifications prepared by willdan,but two sets of tracks buried under the asphalt roadway,requiring a far more difficult removal process,further complicated by the need to keep traffic flowing.additional difficulties included an approximately two foot grade differential at the boulevard western end,which was not reflected on the construction documents and which required the use of additional asphalt to level the road surface.
shawnan submitted claims to the city for the increased construction costs,which the city disputed.after two months of extensive meetings,the city and shawnan agreed to mediate their dispute.willdan participated in the first mediation session as an advocate on behalf of the city,but was instructed not to return to further sessions.the city and shawnan ultimately agreed to a settlement,and a settlement agreement was executed in july by the city and willdan,on one hand,and shawnan,on the other.in exchange for a payment of million,shawnan agreed to release all claims against the city and willdan with respect to the project,except for claims arising out of enforcement of the settlement agreement,breach of warranties and latent defects.the city and willdan agreed to release shawnan from any liability for the same claims.the settlement agreement specifically provided it would not govern,affect or adjust claims as may exist between the city and willdan

on december,willdan filed a against the city for breach of contract and against associated soils and other project consultants for indemnity and declaratory relief.on january,willdan amended its to name shawnan as a and to allege claims against it for indemnity and declaratory relief.according to a declaration filed by willdan attorney in support of willdan ex parte application for a motion to deem the case complex willdan sought leave to amend its after testing and analysis performed on santa monica boulevard led it to believe that the conditions on santa monica boulevard were not caused by a deep seated structural failure as plaintiff claims but instead a material deficiency.the material was placed by general contractor shawnan and tested by associated soils.prior to these destructive tests,there was no claim or allegation that the condition on santa monica boulevard was related to or caused by a material failure or deficiency,but was purely design related.
the trial court granting of shawnan motion for determination of good faith settlement 
on august,approximately three weeks before trial was scheduled to begin,shawnan moved for a determination pursuant to code of civil procedure sections and that the settlement agreement was a good faith settlement between shawnan and the city,thus precluding willdan indemnity and declaratory relief claims.although the dispute between the city and shawnan had initially concerned shawnan claim for million in change orders and increased construction costs,apparently during mediation the city raised a number of construction defect issues and the settlement agreement purportedly resolved those claims as well.according to the declaration filed by shawnan president,shawn smith,in support of shawnan motion for a good faith settlement determination,prior to and during the mediation process the city made claims and allegations concerning the design,specifications,materials and construction of,among other things,the sidewalks,tree beds,landscape and irrigation,curbs and gutters and the asphalt roadway.willdan opposed the motion in part on the ground its claims against shawnan were for latent defects in the roadway,which were expressly excepted from the release of claims contained in the settlement agreement.
on the first day of trial the court granted shawnan motion and dismissed willdan claims.in response to willdan inquiry whether we have determined that the deficient asphalt issues are within the scope of that settlement agreement,the court stated,counsel,the court has made a determination on everything that was submitted includes everything that is related to sial i c and shawnan.they out of the case.

the jury returned a general verdict in favor of the city for and found against willdan on its against the city.
