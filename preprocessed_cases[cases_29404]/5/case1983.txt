in an earlier lawsuit brought in the prior suit,timothy paulus was sued by his competitor in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent him from developing a ford automobile dealership in morgan hill,california.that prior suit was brought under business and professions code section et the unfair competition law ucl by an established,ford automobile dealership and its bob lynch ford,and scott lynch,respectively,and hereafter,collectively,lynch after filing a series of demurrers,paulus ultimately prevailed in the prior suit after the court sustained his demurrer without leave to amend.
in september,paulus brought this action against lynch for claims arising out of the prior suit,including a cause of action for malicious prosecution.lynch brought a special motion to strike paulus complaint under the strategic lawsuits against public participation statute,code of civil procedure section after granting the motion,the court awarded lynch and in attorney fees and costs,respectively.
paulus appeals from these two orders.he claims among other things that the motion to strike should have been denied because he presented a prima facie case of malicious showing that lynch lacked probable cause to bring the prior suit and that lynch prosecuted it with malice.we conclude that paulus did not meet his burden under section of demonstrating the probability that he would prevail on the merits of any of his claims.specifically,paulus did not show that lynch lacked probable cause to bring the prior essential element of a malicious prosecution malicious prosecution is a disfavored tort that is maintainable only if the underlying suit was one that no reasonable attorney would believe to be objectively tenable,the ucl is a broad statute intended to protect both consumers and competitors against business practices that are unlawful,unfair or fraudulent,and no authority expressly precluded the bringing of lynch ucl claim under the circumstances alleged in the prior suit.in addition,paulus forfeited any challenge to the granting of the motion to strike his claims for abuse of process and intentional interference with contractual relations in any event,he made no prima facie showing below in support of these claims.
we therefore find no error.accordingly,we affirm the order granting the motion to strike.we also affirm the order awarding attorney fees and costs to lynch.
procedural history 
prior suit 
lynch filed suit against paulus and others on july.the complaint named the city of morgan hill city and related city entities and alleged that lynch was a cting as an injured competitor and as private attorney general in bringing suit to enforce the ucl.in general,the complaint alleged that paulus sought to establish a ford automobile dealership in morgan hill on an site dealership the city council approved several applications submitted by paulus for the dealership and that approval of the applications violated the planning and zoning law,et,the city general plan,and the california environmental quality act ceqa,pub,et.lynch sought injunctive relief and mandamus to prevent development of the dealership and to void the approvals.
lynch thereafter filed a first amended complaint.again alleging that it had brought suit both as an injured competitor and as private attorney general,lynch invoked the ucl for alleged violations of planning and zoning law,the city general plan,ceqa,and section,the statu t e requiring written finding s for administrative decisions.the first amended complaint sought injunctive relief and mandamus.
paulus,city,and related city entities filed jointly a demurrer to the first amended complaint.the demurring defendants argued,inter alia,that lynch had no legal standing to challenge the city approval of the applications for the dealership,because it was not a beneficially interested party as required for administrative mandamus proceedings brought under section in general and under section in particular public entities such as the city are immune from potential liability under the ucl and paulus acts taken in obtaining approval of the applications did not constitute unfair business practices under the ucl.the court rejected the first and third arguments of the demurring defendants and adopted the second argument accordingly,it sustained the demurrer of the city and related city entities and otherwise overruled the demurrer.
lynch filed a second amended complaint.lynch again alleged that it had brought the action both as an injured competitor and for the interests of the general public as private attorney general to enforce the ucl for alleged violations of section,the planning and zoning law,the city general plan,and ceqa.the pleading contained a new allegation that the city council authorized the city manager to do everything necessary and appropriate to execute a development agreement with the private defendants which development agreement may result in the city paying the private defendants up to of partial sales tax rebates over a period of years,and that these potential rebates significantly threatened competition between lynch and paulus 
paulus,the city,and the related city entities filed a demurrer to the second amended complaint,arguing that the city and its related entities were immune from liability under the ucl and lynch failed to allege facts that paulus had engaged in unfair competition under the ucl by committing unlawful business allegation was merely that paulus had performed the lawful act of submitting a development application based upon approvals granted by the city the court sustained the demurrer of the city and related city entities without leave to amend and sustained paulus demurrer with leave to amend.
lynch filed a third amended complaint.it contained substantially the same allegations that had appeared in the second amended complaint.the new pleading did allege more specifically that lynch had brought the action under the ucl to address,among other alleged violations,a discriminatory government subsidy significantly threatening competition.the third amended complaint also alleged for the first time that paulus had conspired with,and aided and abetted the municipal defendants through his submission of the applications and by obtaining the application approvals that lynch claimed were unlawful.
paulus filed a demurrer to the third amended complaint,which lynch opposed.paulus argued that lynch had failed to state a claim under the ucl for unfair competition based upon either alleged unfair or unlawful business acts or practices.the court sustained this demurrer without leave to amend.pursuant to the parties stipulation,the court dismissed the action on march,following its order sustaining the demurrer.
lynch filed a petition for writ of supersedeas and a petition for an emergency stay with this court.we denied both petitions on april,no.lynch sought review by the supreme court,which was denied on may.
ii.the present action 
on september,paulus filed the present action against lynch.the unverified complaint contained three claims malicious prosecution,abuse of process,and intentional interference with contractual relations.paulus alleged that the prior suit was filed by lynch against paulus,was concluded in his favor,was brought and prosecuted without probable cause,and was brought and prosecuted by lynch maliciously.paulus also alleged that lynch misused the legal system by bringing and prosecuting the prior suit and that by doing so,lynch interfered with paulus contract to purchase land to establish the dealership.
lynch filed a special motion to strike the complaint under section.it contended that paulus suit arose out of lynch protected activity,petitioning the court through the prior suit paulus bore the burden under the statute of presenting admissible evidence showing a reasonable probability that he would prevail on his claims the malicious prosecution claim was without merit because lynch had probable cause for maintaining the prior action and the abuse of process and interference with contract claims were without merit because they were barred by the litigation privilege 
in his opposition to the motion to strike,paulus focused on the sufficiency of his malicious prosecution claim.paulus argued that the prior suit was undeniably terminated in paulus favor,thereby satisfying one malicious prosecution element the prior suit was founded upon legal theories that were patently without merit and lynch therefore lacked probable cause in prosecuting the prior suit lynch acted with malice in initiating and prosecuting the prior suit and because the motion to strike was frivolous,paulus should be awarded attorney fees and costs.
paulus filed two declarations with his opposition to the motion.paulus declared that he had sustained damages as a result of the prior suit,including lost profits and expenses associated with delay in completing the transaction in which he acquired the property for the dealership lynch ford dealership in gilroy was in direct competition with paulus dealership an existing automobile dealership may challenge the creation of a new dealership within a radius by filing a protest with the new motor vehicle board paulus had established the dealership outside of this radius so that it would not be subject to such a protest by lynch and he believed that lynch had brought the prior suit as a subterfuge because it was unable to challenge paulus dealership through an administrative protest.attached to his attorney declaration were copies of two letters written to lynch counsel requesting that the prior suit be dismissed,along with a copy of one letter in response from lynch counsel.
on january,the court heard argument and took the matter under submission.it thereafter granted the motion to strike the complaint.in striking the complaint,the court reasoned that paulus had failed to meet his burden of showing a probability that he would prevail on his complaint.specifically,the court held that paulus had not established by competent evidence that lynch lacked probable cause and acted with malice in prosecuting the prior action.the court also held that lynch was entitled to its attorney fees and costs associated with the motion pursuant to section,subdivision c.
lynch filed a motion for attorney fees and costs,seeking an award of in fees and in costs paulus filed opposition to the motion,noting that he did not dispute lynch entitlement to an award of attorney fees,but that he objected to a claimed lack of documentation supporting the award.the court granted lynch motion and awarded it in attorney fees and in costs.paulus filed a timely notice of appeal from the orders striking the complaint and awarding attorney fees and costs.
discussion 
issues on appeal 
paulus raises the following issues in this appeal 
whether the trial court erred by granting lynch motion because paulus presented a prima facie case of malicious prosecution.
whether the trial court erred by granting the motion to strike as to paulus abuse of process claim.
whether the trial court erred by granting the motion to strike as to paulus intentional interference with contractual relations claim 
whether the trial court erred by awarding lynch attorney fees and costs as the party prevailing on the motion.
we address each of these claims of error below.
ii.motions 
a slapp suit is a meritless suit filed primarily to chill the defendant exercise of first amendment rights.citation.wilcox superior court th,fn,d,disapproved on other grounds in equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d,equilon.in other words,a lawsuit that is a slapp arises from constitutionally protected speech or petitioning activity that lacks even minimal merit.navellier sletten cal th,d,navellier.
slapp suits may be disposed of summarily by a special motion to strike under section,commonly known as an motion.the statute provides a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.as is relevant to this appeal,the statute defines act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue to include any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law,subd.e.
a motion to strike under section is analyzed and resolved by the court engag ing in a process.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.the moving defendant burden is to demonstrate that the act or acts of which the plaintiff complains were taken in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,as defined in the statute,subd.b.if the court finds such a showing has been made,it then determines whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.equilon,supra,cal th at,d.thus,o nly a cause of action that satisfies both prongs of the,that arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal a slapp,subject to being stricken under the statute.navellier,supra,cal th at,d.

iii.appellate review of order granting motion 
an order granting an motion to strike is a proper subject for appeal,subd.i see also kyle carmon th,d.we review de novo a trial court ruling on a motion to strike under section by conducting an independent review of the entire record.citations.hms capital,lawyers title th,d see also siam kizilbash th,d.
thus,our review is conducted in the same manner as the trial court in considering an motion.in determining whether the defendant lynch has met its initial burden of establishing that the plaintiff paulus action arises from protected activity,we consider the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based,subd.b see also city of cotati cashman,supra,cal th at,d,navellier,supra,cal th at,d.the second,whether the plaintiff paulus has shown a probability of prevailing on the considered under a standard similar to that employed in determining nonsuit,directed verdict or summary judgment motions.computerxpress,jackson th,d.i n order to establish the requisite probability of prevailing citation,the plaintiff need only have stated and substantiated a legally sufficient claim.citations.put another way,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citations.navellier,supra,at,d.
as is true with summary judgment motions,the issues in an motion are framed by the pleadings.church of scientology wollersheim th,d,disapproved on other grounds in equilon,supra,cal th at,fn,d.the plaintiff may not rely solely on its complaint,even if verified instead,its proof must be made upon competent admissible evidence.computerxpress,jackson,supra,th at,d.in reviewing the plaintiff evidence,the court does not weigh it rather,it simply determines whether the plaintiff has made a prima facie showing of facts necessary to establish its claim at trial.ibid.
we review the court order granting lynch motion to strike paulus complaint as a slapp suit with the above standard of review in mind.
iv.the order striking paulus complaint 
paulus malicious prosecution claim 
paulus does not dispute that the malicious prosecution action arose from an act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,within the meaning of the statute,subd.b see also,subd.e.he therefore concedes that lynch met its initial burden of proof in the motion to strike.the burden thus shifted to paulus to establish that he had a probability of prevailing on his claim.equilon,supra,cal th at,d.
a malicious prosecution claim requires that the plaintiff demonstrate that the prior action was commenced by or at the direction of the defendant and was pursued to a legal termination in his,plaintiff,favor citations was brought without probable cause citations and was initiated with malice citations.citations.sheldon appel albert oliker cal d,sheldon appel,quoting bertero national general cal d.the parties do not dispute that lynch prior suit terminated in paulus favor.accordingly,our focus here is upon the second and third elements.
paulus contends that the court below erred in finding that he had not met his burden of establishing a prima facie claim of malicious prosecution.he asserts that he presented evidence sufficient to establish that lynch had prosecuted the prior suit without probable cause and with malice paulus having thus met his burden he argues,the motion should have been denied.
before addressing these arguments,we must first take a brief detour to set forth basic principles concerning malicious prosecution claims and claims brought under the ucl.these principles are essential for us to properly evaluate paulus contentions on appeal.
malicious prosecution claims generally 
it is a fact that claims for malicious prosecution are viewed with disfavor due to their potential to exert an undue chilling effect on the ordinary citizen willingness to report criminal conduct or to bring a civil dispute to court.sheldon appel,supra,cal d at,but see casa herrera,beydoun cal th,d,malicious prosecution claim will not be barred simply because of tort disfavored status.it is for this reason,as our supreme court has observed,that the elements of the tort have historically been carefully circumscribed in california so that litigants with potentially valid claims will not be deterred from bringing their claims to court by the prospect of a subsequent malicious prosecution claim.sheldon appel,supra,at.acknowledging that the flood of litigation in recent years has caused a reassessment of the disfavored status of the malicious prosecution tort ibid,our high court declined the invitation to abandon or relax the traditional limitations on malicious prosecution recovery.id.at,see also wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d,wilson.
with these policy considerations as background,the court in sheldon appel enunciated a definition of the probable cause element of malicious prosecution that the supreme court later characterized as a rather lenient standard for bringing a civil action.wilson,supra,cal th at,d.under this test,probable cause for having brought the prior action will be found where any reasonable attorney would have thought the claim tenable.sheldon appel,supra,cal d at.the issue of probable cause is always one for the court to decide id.at,and resolution of that question of law calls for the application of an objective standard to the facts on which the malicious prosecution defendant acted.id.at.the court explained that this determination requires a sensitive evaluation of legal principles and precedents id.at,and that in evaluating whether or not there was probable cause for malicious prosecution purposes,a court must properly take into account the evolutionary potential of legal principles.citation.id.at.and as explained by the supreme court more recently,under this rather lenient probable cause standard,a litigant or attorney who possesses competent evidence to substantiate a legally cognizable claim for relief does not act tortiously by bringing the claim,even if also aware of evidence that will weigh against the claim.plaintiffs and their attorneys are not required,on penalty of tort liability,to attempt to predict how a trier of fact will weigh the competing evidence,or to abandon their claim if they think it likely the evidence will ultimately weigh against them.they have the right to bring a claim they think unlikely to succeed,so long as it is arguably meritorious.citation.wilson,supra,cal th at,d,citing sheldon appel,supra,at,fn.omitted.
the element of malice in a malicious prosecution contrast to the probable cause element decided by the court under an objective one that relates to the subjective intent or purpose with which the defendant acted in initiating the prior action,and the defendant motivation is a question of fact to be determined by the jury.citations.sheldon appel,supra,cal d at.factors relevant to malice include the defendant subjective belief regarding the validity of the claim,and in the case of malicious prosecution against the attorney the extent of any research or investigation by the attorney prosecuting the prior suit.id.at.malice may not only consist of ill will or hostility toward the malicious prosecution plaintiff,but may also result where the prior suit was instituted primarily for an improper purpose.albertson raboff cal d,see also downey venture lmi ins.th,d malice in malicious prosecution claim consists of suit brought for the intentionally wrongful purpose of injuring another person.it is rare that there will be a smoking gun admission of improper is established by circumstantial evidence and inferences drawn from the evidence.hms capital,lawyers title,supra,th,d.malice can not be established simply by a showing of the absence of probable cause,although the fact that the prior suit was objectively untenable is a factor that may be considered on the issue of malice.ibid.
unfair competition law claims generally 
business and professions code section provides as used in this chapter,unfair competition shall mean and include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising and any act prohibited by chapter commencing with section of part of division of the business and professions code.as our high court has stated,t he legislature intended this sweeping language to include anything that can properly be called a business practice and that at the same time is forbidden by law.citation.bank of the west superior court cal th,d,quoting barquis merchants collection cal d,barquis.the purpose of the ucl is to protect both consumers and competitors by promoting fair competition in commercial markets for goods and services.citation.kasky nike,cal th,d,citing barquis,supra,at.thus,the scope of the ucl bus,et is broad.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.it covers a wide range of conduct.korea supply lockheed martin cal th,d.but an action under the ucl is not an substitute for a tort or contract action.citation.id.at,d.
a ucl action to redress an unlawful business practice borrows violations of other laws and treats these violations,when committed pursuant to business activity,as unlawful practices independently actionable under business and professions code section et and subject to the distinct remedies provided thereunder.farmers ins.exchange superior court cal th,d.the ucl states that u nless otherwise expressly provided,the remedies or penalties provided by this chapter are cumulative to each other and to the remedies or penalties available under all other laws of this state.bus.thus,our supreme court has held that even though a particular act is proscribed by another statute in which no private right of action is specifically provided,this does not preclude the borrowing of a violation of that other statute by a private ucl plaintiff.stop youth addiction,supra,cal th,d,see also kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d.for example,the fact that penal code section criminalized the knowing sale of tobacco to minors was held not to have impliedly preempted the bringing of a private ucl suit against various retailers to enjoin that activity.stop youth addiction,supra,at,d,but see rubin green cal th,d,litigation privilege constituted absolute bar to ucl suit safeco ins.superior court d.ucl could not be used to circumvent prohibition against direct action against insurer under decision in fireman fund ins.companies cal d.
at the time of lynch initiation and prosecution of the prior suit,there was broad standing to sue under the ucl a ucl action could be brought not only by public enforcement officials,the attorney general or county district attorney,but also by any person acting for the interest of itself,its members or the general public.former bus,see stats,ch,as amended by initiative measure,as approved by voters.the ucl defines person to mean and include natural persons,corporations,firms,partnerships,joint stock companies,associations and other organizations of persons.bus.our courts have consistently upheld the right of both individual persons and organizations under the ucl to sue on behalf of the public for injunctive relief as private attorney s general,even if they have not themselves been personally harmed or aggrieved.citations.consumers union of united states,fisher development,d.see also aicco,insurance of north america th,d broad language of bus,permits suit by nonaggrieved parties on behalf of others.
under the broad scope of the ucl,t he statutory language referring to any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent practice italics added makes clear that a practice may be deemed unfair even if not specifically proscribed by some other law.because business and professions code section is written in the disjunctive,it establishes three varieties of unfair or practices that are unlawful,or unfair,or fraudulent.in other words,a practice is prohibited as unfair or deceptive even if not unlawful and vice versa.citations,supra,cal th at,d.t he legislature intended by this sweeping language to permit tribunals to enjoin wrongful business conduct in whatever context such activity might occur.indeed,the section was intentionally framed in its broad,sweeping language,precisely to enable judicial tribunals to deal with the innumerable new schemes which the fertility of man invention would contrive.american philatelic soc.claibourne cal d.id.at,d.and a ucl plaintiff ordinarily need not show defendant intent to injure or harm the ucl imposes strict liability when property or monetary losses are occasioned by conduct that constitutes an unfair business practice.citation.cortez purolator air filtration products cal th,d.
the supreme court has explained that a ucl action is not barred simply because there is no particular law that specifically prohibits the conduct complained of,supra,cal th at,d.rather,a ucl action is barred only if another law specifically bars the subject ucl action or specifically permits the conduct complained of.id.at,d,see also id.at,d,c ourts may not use the unfair competition law to condemn actions the legislature permits.conversely,the legislature mere failure to prohibit an activity does not prevent a court from finding it unfair.plaintiffs may not plead around a safe harbor,but the safety must be more than the absence of danger.fn.omitted.
where the ucl plaintiff alleges that the defendant who is a competitor has committed an unfair act or practice,the test of whether the ucl unfair prong has been satisfied is whether the conduct threatens an incipient violation of an antitrust law,or violates the policy or spirit of one of those laws because its effects are comparable to or the same as a violation of the law,or otherwise significantly threatens or harms competition,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
but where the act or practice under the ucl arises out of a consumer matter,the definition of unfair is less clear,as the test was limited to ucl actions alleging unfair acts or practices against a competitor of the plaintiff,supra,cal th at,fn,d.some cases have applied the test to ucl consumer cases as well.for instance,in schnall hertz th,d,the appellate a ucl class action by a car renter against a rental car noting that the case differed from because it was not an action between competitors,applied the test that any claims of unfairness under the ucl should be defined in connection with a legislatively declared policy,and concluded that the test was satisfied in that instance.see also gregory albertson,th,d.other courts have noted that the court in,while critical of existing standards for determining unfairness in consumer cases under the ucl,declined to provide a definitive test.see walker countrywide home loans,th,d.as the walker court put it no clear test to determine what constitutes an unfair business practice has been established in california.one court has said that an unfair business practice is one that offends an established public policy or when the practice is immoral,unethical,oppressive,unscrupulous or substantially injurious to consumers people casa blanca convalescent homes,d,and another court has stated that to determine whether a business practice is unfair,courts must weigh the utility of the defendant conduct against the gravity of the harm to the alleged victim state farm fire casualty superior court th,d.see also smith state farm mutual automobile ins.th,d.
merits of paulus malicious prosecution claim 
we now apply the above principles to evaluate paulus contention that he made a prima facie showing below to support his claim of malicious prosecution against lynch.we focus first on the element of probable cause.
lynch alleged a ucl claim both on its own behalf as paulus competitor and as a private attorney general.the essence of its claim was that the proposed dealership was based upon unlawful approvals by the city and,further,that paulus would receive,in effect,an illegal public subsidy of over million dollars to establish and operate the dealership.through this public subsidy lynch alleged,paulus would gain an unfair competitive advantage in the marketplace to the detriment of lynch.the proposed dealership allegedly threatened both lynch and competition in general.
as we discuss below,irrespective of whether lynch ucl claim is evaluated under the unlawful or unfair prong,it was objectively tenable.because the prior suit was not one that all reasonable lawyers would agree totally lack ed merit jarrow formulas,supra,cal th,fn,d,the element of absence of probable cause essential to paulus malicious prosecution claim was missing.
first,lynch claim,on its face,appeared to have been consistent with the ucl broad purpose of protect ing both consumers and competitors by promoting fair competition in commercial markets for goods and services.kasky nike,supra,cal th at,d.at least superficially,the prior suit alleged that the proposed dealership threatened competition because the allegedly illegal public subsidy to paulus would promote an unlevel playing field.lynch averred that the public would be harmed by development of the dealership because it would have the effect of eliminating lynch as a competitor as a result of the allegedly illegal public subsidy,paulus would be able to significantly undercut lynch prices.
second,v irtually any law or or state,statutory or common serve as a predicate for a business and professions code section unlawful violation.stern,bus,practice the rutter group.thus,examples of ucl claims properly alleging unlawful conduct,while not boundless,are seemingly so.as may be relevant here,for instance,violations of environmental statutes may serve as predicates for a ucl claim based on unlawful business acts or practices.see,southwest marine,triple a mach.shop,southwest marine violation of hazardous waste control act,health,hewlett squaw valley ski th,d hewlett violations of nejedly forest practice act,pub,et people sakai d.violation of endangered species act.likewise,a ucl unlawful claim may be founded on the allegation of a secret rebate or unearned price discount.saunders superior court th,d.moreover,violations of local ordinances may be borrowed to establish a ucl claim based upon unlawful acts or practices.city and county of san francisco sainez th,d building and housing code violations hewlett,supra,at,d violation of zoning ordinance,specifically,a conditional use permit consumers union of,certified dairy th,d violation of county ordinance regulating sale of unpasteurized milk products.
lynch ucl claim was based upon unlawful conduct with respect to an allegedly illegal public subsidy,and approvals that purportedly constituted violations of ceqa,of section,the zoning variance statute,et,and local city ordinances under these circumstances,we are loath to conclude that lynch claim under the ucl unlawful prong was not objectively tenable.hewlett,supra,th at,d violation of conditional use permit saunders superior court,supra,th at,d allegations that court reporters charged disparate rates for services and that parties charged higher rates were not informed of disparity sufficient to support ucl claim under either the unlawful or unfair prong.
third,t he unfair prong of the ucl citation intentionally provides courts with broad discretion to prohibit new schemes to defraud citation.rushing et,matthew bender practice guide california unfair competition and business torts unfair competition,see also motors,times mirror d.thus,the fact that the challenged practice or act was not previously condemned by statute or case authority presents no impediment to a finding that it is unfair under the ucl.see,allied grape growers bronco wine d.people james d.james.
in james,the liquor store owner and the proprietor of a towing engaged in unfair practices,namely,towing vehicles parked at the liquor store without adequately warning patrons of the possibility that their vehicles would be towed,and charging excessive towing and related fees.james,supra,d at.the appellate court specifically rejected the store owner contention that he could not be held liable for unfair business practices under the ucl because no court had previously denounced the specific practices at issue when we apply the principles enunciated in barquis,supra,cal d,to the instant case,the business practices which defendants were shown to be engaged in were manifestly unlawful,unfair,and fraudulent.vehicles were hoisted or towed away without sufficient warning drivers were subjected to payment of fees to have their cars in the parking lot they were coerced into paying either by physical intimidation or misrepresentation concerning the existence of liens or other rights of the tower they were charged unconscionable fees to retrieve their vehicles from hoisting and impoundment and they were forced to waive claims for damage to their property in order to get it back.there was also evidence that defendant store owner participated in these practices by authorizing the impounds and taking kickbacks on fees.the fact that defendants scheme had never been dealt with by the appellate court does not render it any less fundamentally dishonest,unfair,or unlawful.citation.id.at.
here,paulus contention that lynch lacked probable cause to bring the underlying ucl suit implies the argument specifically rejected in allied grape growers bronco wine,supra,d,and james,supra,d.that,because the alleged conduct of acting on illegally approved applications and accepting improper public subsidies had never been declared unfair under the ucl by any court,it was therefore a legally untenable claim under the ucl.we reject that implicit contention.further,while we can not say definitively that the alleged conduct challenged in the prior suit was unfair under the ucl,we can not conclude that no reasonable any of the various tests for unfairness see pt.iv,sec.a,ante would reach that conclusion.
fourth,no cases have held that matters of the nature alleged by lynch in the prior suit can not as a matter of law serve as a basis for a ucl claim.we find this fact to be also relevant on the question of whether the prior suit was objectively tenable.paulus argues that,to the contrary,saad city of berkeley th,d saad,is direct authority that lynch ucl claim was not maintainable.that case did hold that administrative mandamus under section is the exclusive remedy for judicial review of the administrative action of local level agencies,such as action on a permit or variance.id.at,d.but saad concerned a direct challenge by the permittee to municipal action.it did not involve a claim by a third party alleging that it was adversely affected by a municipality granting allegedly illegal applications.and the plaintiff in saad did not allege that any actions taken constituted a violation of the ucl.accordingly,we disagree with paulus that saad precluded an action under the ucl of the kind filed by lynch 
in evaluating the probable cause element in a malicious prosecution claim,we are mindful that we must render a sensitive evaluation of legal principles and precedents sheldon appel,supra,cal d at,and we must properly take into account the evolutionary potential of legal principles.id.at.because of the disfavored status of malicious prosecution claims,the rather lenient standard of probable cause wilson,supra,cal th at,d,the broad scope of the ucl,and the ucl intended purpose of addressing,among other things,unfair conduct that may run the gamut of human ingenuity and chicanery people ex rel.mosk national research of,supra,d at,we conclude that paulus failed to make a prima facie showing that lynch ucl claim under either the unlawful or unfair prongs lacked probable cause 
in light of our conclusion that paulus did not make a prima facie showing that the prior suit lacked probable cause,we hold that the trial court properly granted lynch special motion to strike the malicious prosecution claim under section 
abuse of process and intentional interference with contract claims 
paulus offered no opposition below to lynch motion to strike the claims for abuse of process and for intentional interference with contractual relations.the court therefore granted the motion to strike as to those causes of action,noting that paulus made no independent factual or legal arguments regarding the strength of these claims.similarly,paulus did not argue in his opening brief that the court erred in striking the abuse of process and interference with contract claims.the opening brief says nothing about these claims beyond the conclusory statement in its penultimate sentence paulus has met his burden to show a prima facie case for malicious prosecution,abuse of process and intentional interference with contract.
we deem paulus to have abandoned any challenge to the order striking these two claims because of his failure to address the matter in his opening brief.courts will ordinarily treat the appellant failure to raise an issue in his or her opening brief as a waiver of that challenge.tisher california horse racing bd.d.paulus conclusory statement at the end of his opening brief does not preserve the issue for appeal.see osornio weingarten th,d,fn.issues do not have a life of their own if they are not raised or supported by argument or citation to authority,we consider the issues waived.and paulus belated attempt to address the abuse of process and interference with contract claims in his reply the respondents brief noted his failure to address the striking of these not salvage these abandoned issues.shade foods,innovative products sales marketing,th,fn,d arguments raised by appellant for first time in reply brief generally not considered,absent good reason for failing to present them earlier reichardt hoffman th,d issue raised for first time in reply brief generally not considered,because s
