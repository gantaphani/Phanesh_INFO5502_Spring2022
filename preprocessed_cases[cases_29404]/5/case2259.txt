this case is before the court on appeal from a decision of the first district court of appeal,massey david,so d dca massey ii,which declared a state statute to be invalid.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.
facts and procedural history 
appellant massey entered into a contract with appellee,attorney david,in connection with injuries allegedly suffered by massey due to his exposure to chemicals released by companies previously known as koppers company and cabot carbon corporation,and which are now collectively known as beazer east,hereinafter the company.see massey david,so d,dca massey i massey beazer east,so d,dca.the contract between david and massey specifically provided 
in the event a dispute arises the client and lawyer shall not make arbitrary decisions,but shall make decisions based on all facts reasonably available.in the event any dispute can not be resolved between lawyer and client,the dispute will be resolved by russell peavyhouse after joint consultation with the client and the lawyer and russell peavyhouse decision as an arbitrator will be binding on both the client and the lawyer.this provision includes all manner of things that could be in dispute,including but not limited to,pleadings,discovery,settlement,trial tactics and all other things related to the representation of the client by the lawyer.
massey i,so d at emphasis supplied when a disagreement arose between massey and david with regard to a possible settlement with the company,david submitted the dispute to the arbitrator.see id.at.the arbitrator decided that massey should accept the settlement.see id.at.
contrary to the wishes of massey,david then filed a motion to approve settlement with the trial court.see id.at.despite the serious conflict of interest,david allegedly appeared on behalf of massey at the hearing on the motion.see id.during that hearing,david advocated on his own behalf but he did not inform massey that he should retain independent counsel.see id.the trial court orally granted the motion to approve settlement and directed massey to sign a written release.see id.the court noted that if massey refused to follow the directions of the court,it would issue a written order.see id.after massey discharged david,massey received a copy of the release by mail with instructions from david which directed him to sign the document.see id.when massey refused,david renewed the motion to approve settlement,which the trial court granted.see id.in accordance with the order of the trial court,the arbitrator in connection with the underlying settlement dispute was appointed to serve in the capacity of guardian ad litem and signed the release on behalf of massey.see id.the settlement required payment of to massey.see id.at.fees and costs were to be paid to david firm and another firm,merkle magri,which massey had retained and then terminated before he retained david.see id.at.david firm received a final fee and cost judgment in the amount of,and merkle magri,received a final judgment in the amount of.see id.at.
massey subsequently initiated a separate action against david in which he alleged legal malpractice.see massey ii,so d at the trial court bifurcated the proceedings,with a phase i trial to be held on negligence and liability issues,and a phase ii trial to be held,if necessary,on the issue of damages suffered by massey.see id.during phase i,the jury found that david was negligent and that the negligence of david caused damage to massey.see id.however,during phase ii,the jury awarded zero damages to massey.see id.massey sought review of the final judgment entered,and the first district affirmed.see massey david,so d dca massey iii table citation.
thereafter,the trial judge entered a separate judgment for costs in favor of david.see massey ii,so d at.massey sought review of that second judgment and alleged,in pertinent part,that the trial court erred when it awarded costs for expert witnesses which he alleged to be contrary to section of the florida statutes.see id.massey contended that the trial court awarded expert fees to david based on the improper conclusion that section was unconstitutional.see id.that subsection provides,in pertinent part 
expert witness fees may not be awarded as taxable costs unless the party retaining the expert witness furnishes each opposing party with a written report signed by the expert witness which summarizes the expert witness opinions and the factual basis of the opinions,including documentary evidence and the authorities relied upon in reaching the opinions.such report shall be filed at least days prior to the deposition of the expert or at least days prior to discovery cutoff,whichever is sooner,or as otherwise determined by the court.
id.at quoting.stat.massey asserted in the trial court that david was not entitled to an award of costs for the experts because he had not timely complied with the written report requirement delineated in the statute.at the same time,massey conceded that the fourth district court of appeal had previously declared section to be unconstitutional in estate of cort broward county sheriff,so d dca.
on appeal,the first district initially noted that the trial court made no findings with regard to the provisions of the statute and that the order awarding costs to david did not mention either cort or the statute.see massey ii,so d at.nonetheless,even if the trial court had relied on cort when it awarded the expert witness costs to david,the first district concluded that the trial court did not err because cort stands as the only appellate decision addressing this issue.id.the first district then stated that from our review,the fourth district correctly found the statute an unconstitutional intrusion on the powers of the judiciary,through the florida supreme court,to determine matters of practice and procedure before the florida courts,and agreed with the fourth district that section does not create a right to recover expert witness fees,but rather sets forth the procedure for recovering under that right.id.emphasis supplied quoting cort,so d at.
massey seeks review of the decision of the first district court of appeal in massey ii in this court.
in,the fourth district in cort expressly held section to be unconstitutional as a procedural statute that unconstitutionally infringed on the authority of this court to determine matters of practice and procedure for florida courts.see so d at.the analysis in cort is much more detailed than that provided by the decision below.the fourth district reasoned 
s ection is unconstitutional because,through it,the legislature creates or modifies a procedural rule of court 
a rule of procedure prescribes the method or order by which a party enforces substantive rights or obtains redress for their invasion.substantive law creates those rights.practice and procedure are the machinery of the judicial process as opposed to the product thereof.
military park fire control tax dist.demarois,so d,dca.in demarois,this court found section,florida statutes,unconstitutional.see id.at.section provided that appeals from certain orders of the public employees relations commission would be expedited in the appellate court and given priority over other civil matters.this court concluded that there was no doubt that a rule creating priorities among types of civil matters being processed by the state courts is procedural rather than substantive.demarois,so d at.
more specifically,we find allstate reliance on knealing puleo,so d,persuasive.in knealing,the supreme court found section b,florida statutes,which allows a party to make an offer of judgment after mediation ends,unconstitutional.see id.at.the court found that the statute did not expressly authorize an award of fees nor did it provide any other independent basis for awarding fees.see id.the court stated r ather than providing for an award of fees,section alters the time limits for making and accepting an offer of judgment.id.therefore,in finding the statute unconstitutional,the knealing court was persuaded by section failure to create a substantive right since section,florida statutes,already created the substantive right to attorney fees based on an offer of judgment.likewise,here,section does not create a right to recover expert witness fees,but rather sets forth the procedure for recovering under that right.
moreover,in knealing,the supreme court noted that in leapai milton,so d,and timmons combs,so d,
w e found sections,florida statutes,and,florida statutes,constitutional despite their procedural aspects because they contained substantive provisions authorizing an award of attorney fees.
so d at footnote omitted.the court held that it could not apply that reasoning to section because of its purely procedural nature.see id.we recognize that the substantive right for recovery of an expert witness fee as a taxable cost finds its basis in statutory law and has existed since at least.see.stat.stat.nevertheless,due to the purely procedural nature of section,we are compelled to find that it intrudes upon the powers of the judiciary,through the florida supreme court,to determine matters of practice and procedure before the florida courts.see art.v,a.const.
on october,the florida supreme court issued an administrative order entitled in re statewide uniform guidelines for taxation of costs in civil actions reeser boats unlimited,so d,dca.these uniform guidelines,adopted by the florida conference of circuit judges and published by the florida supreme court,discuss at length the taxation of costs for expert witness fees and set forth no deadlines or requirements such as those contained in section.moreover,florida rule of civil procedure b a outlines the procedures for discovery of facts and opinions held by experts.there,no mention is made of having to file a report by the expert twenty days prior to the end of discovery or five days prior to the deposition of the expert.
we note that the legislature has graciously requested that the requirements of section be adopted by supreme court rule in the event that any court of competent jurisdiction were to find the provision unconstitutional.this opinion holding the statute invalid will give our supreme court jurisdiction to review our decision and consider that request.see art.v,b.const.
id.at footnote omitted.no party in cort ever sought review of that decision.as a result,section has been in the status of having been declared unconstitutional for five years without the issue having come to this court for approval or rejection after the analysis of the fourth district.further,because the fourth district had been the only appellate court to pass upon the constitutionality of section,all trial courts during that time period were required to follow cort.see pardo state,so d,i n the event the only case on point on a district level is from a district other than the one in which the trial court is located,the trial court is required to follow that decision.it is only now that the first district has agreed with the decision of the fourth district in cort,and massey ii has been timely presented to this court for review,and we now address the constitutional challenge to section.
relevant constitutional provisions and case law 
article ii,section of the florida constitution prohibits one branch of government from exercising any powers appertaining to either of the other branches unless expressly provided herein.art.ii.const.article v,section a provides this court with the exclusive authority to adopt rules for the practice and procedure in all courts.art.v,a.const.generally,the legislature is empowered to enact substantive law while this court has the authority to enact procedural law.see allen butterworth,so d.thus,the issue in the instant case is whether section is a procedural statute that impermissibly encroaches on this court rulemaking authority.a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute is a pure question of law which is subject to de novo review.see city of miami mcgrath,so d.
this court has provided the following guidelines to ascertain whether a statute is procedural or substantive in nature 
substantive law has been defined as that part of the law which creates,defines,and regulates rights,or that part of the law which courts are established to administer.it includes those rules and principles which fix and declare the primary rights of individuals with respect towards their persons and property.on the other hand,practice and procedure encompass the course,form,manner,means,method,mode,order,process or steps by which a party enforces substantive rights or obtains redress for their invasion.practice and procedure may be described as the machinery of the judicial process as opposed to the product thereof.it is the method of conducting litigation involving rights and corresponding defenses.

of course,statutes at times may not appear to fall exclusively into either a procedural or substantive classification.we have held that where a statute contains some procedural aspects,but those provisions are so intimately intertwined with the substantive rights created by the statute,that statute will not impermissibly intrude on the practice and procedure of the courts in a constitutional sense,causing a constitutional challenge to fail.see caple tuttle,so d,see also state raymond,so d.if a statute is clearly substantive and operates in an area of legitimate legislative concern,this court will not hold that it constitutes an unconstitutional encroachment on the judicial branch.caple,so d at quoting vanbibber hartford accident indem.ins,so d.however,where a statute does not basically convey substantive rights,the procedural aspects of the statute can not be deemed incidental,and that statute is unconstitutional.see raymond,so d at.moreover,where this court has promulgated rules that relate to practice and procedure,and a statute provides a contrary practice or procedure,the statute is unconstitutional to the extent of the conflict.see kirian,so d at.finally,where a statute has some substantive aspects,but the procedural requirements of the statute conflict with or interfere with the procedural mechanisms of the court system,those requirements are unconstitutional.see jackson.dep t of corrections,so d.application of these principles can be found in case examples,one where a statute contained procedural aspects but nonetheless we concluded that the statute was valid,and another in which we held the statute to be procedural and therefore invalid.
in vanbibber,this court considered the constitutionality of section,florida statutes supp,nonjoinder of insurers.see so d at.the statute provided that,as a condition precedent to maintaining a cause of action against a liability insurer,a noninsured individual must first obtain a judgment against a person who is an insured under the terms of such policy for a cause of action which is covered by such policy.id.at quoting.stat.the statute also authorized insurers to include a provision in liability insurance policies that precluded noninsured individuals from filing an action against an insurer until the noninsured had secured the entry of a judgment against an insured.see id.although section had an impact on the procedural issue of joinder of parties,this court concluded that the statute primarily created substantive law and was constitutionally valid because it established a condition precedent to maintaining a cause of action against an insurer and accorded insurers the substantive right to include a provision in their contracts that prevented actions until a judgment was entered against an insured.see id.at in upholding the constitutionality of this statute,this court specifically noted that the statute pertained to the regulation and supervision of insurance,a field in which the legislature has historically been deeply involved,and further concluded that the statute operate d in an area of legitimate legislative concern.id.at.
vanbibber can be contrasted with the decision in knealing puleo,so d,in which this court considered the constitutionality of section,florida statutes,a statute which enlarged the time for a party to serve an offer of judgment where a mediation has occurred.see so d at.section provided,in pertinent part 
a when an action is referred to mediation by court order,the time periods for responding to an offer of settlement pursuant to,or to an offer or demand for judgment pursuant to,respectively,shall be tolled until 
an impasse has been declared by the mediator or 
the mediator has reported to the court that no agreement was reached.
b sections and notwithstanding,an offer of settlement or an offer or demand for judgment may be made at any time after an impasse has been declared by the mediator,or the mediator has reported that no agreement was reached.an offer is deemed rejected as of commencement of trial.
id.at quoting.stat.section,offer of judgment and demand for judgment,which was cited in subsection b of section,provided,in pertinent part 
in any action to which this part applies,if a defendant files an offer of judgment which is not accepted by the plaintiff within days,the defendant shall be entitled to recover reasonable costs and attorney fees incurred from the date of filing of the offer if the judgment obtained by the plaintiff is at least percent less than such offer 
id.at emphasis supplied quoting a.stat.this court concluded that section altered procedural portions of section which this court had incorporated into florida rule of civil procedure 
rather than providing for an award of fees,section alters the time limits for making and accepting an offer of judgment.section a tolls the time periods of section as incorporated into florida rule of civil procedure from the date of the order of mediation until the mediation is complete.the result is that a party may have more than the thirty days required by section and rule to accept an offer.section b allows a party to make an offer of judgment after mediation ends.as a result,a party may have less than the thirty days required by section and rule to consider and accept an offer.we have held that the time limits for acceptance of an offer of judgment,like those provided in section,are procedural.accordingly,we read section as setting forth only procedural requirements.
id.at citation omitted.the court,noting that a statute which provides parties with the substantive right to receive fees must do so expressly concluded that even though section referenced section,the former statute did not expressly authorize an award of fees,nor did it provide an independent basis for awarding fees.see id.therefore,the court held that section was procedural in nature and,accordingly,unconstitutional.see id.
the instant case 
the general provision for awarding expert witness fees as costs is located in section,florida statutes,which provides,in pertinent part any expert or skilled witness who shall have testified in any cause shall be allowed a witness fee including the cost of any exhibits used by such witness in an amount agreed to by the parties,and the same shall be taxed as costs.as noted by the fourth district in cort,this grant of authority to tax expert witness fees as costs has existed since at least.see cort,so d at see also.stat.in,section was enacted to provide 
expert witness fees may not be awarded as taxable costs unless the party retaining the expert witness furnishes each opposing party with a written report signed by the expert witness which summarizes the expert witness opinions and the factual basis of the opinions,including documentary evidence and the authorities relied upon in reaching the opinions.such report shall be filed at least days prior to the deposition of the expert or at least days prior to discovery cutoff,whichever is sooner,or as otherwise determined by the court.
under the analysis described by this court in kirian,we hold that section is a procedural statute.
as noted by the fourth district in cort,the right to tax expert witness fees as costs is not at all delineated in section rather,the substantive right was created in section.thus,like the statute that we invalidated in knealing,the statute at issue in this case does not expressly authorize an award of fees,nor does it provide an independent basis for awarding fees.use of the language e xpert witness fees may not be awarded as taxable costs unless at the beginning of section does not actually define a substantive right.rather,the express right was created in section,and this language in section is merely a prelude that attempts to introduce additional procedural elements related to the award of such costs.this prefatory language does not fix or declare any primary rights of individuals with regard to their persons and property,see kirian,so d at,and section is not a substantive statute.we conclude that because section only delineates the steps that a party must fulfill,the proverbial hoops through which a party must jump to be entitled to an award of expert witness fees as costs,this statute is unquestionably a procedural one which conveys no substantive right at all.see raymond,so d at 
moreover,our conclusion is supported by the fact that it is impossible to reconcile massey assertion that section is substantive in nature because portions of the statute with regard to the procedures fall completely to the absolute discretion of the courts,even if there has been a failure of compliance.the statute attempts to set a time for the submission of expert witness reports,but then provides that the time may be otherwise determined by the court.thus,a court remains free to totally disregard the filing times announced in the statute and to set a time period of its own.we can not conclude that a statute establishes or defines a substantive right where it allows courts,by the express terms of the statute,to unilaterally alter those rights.
second,we conclude that section is a procedural statute because the requirements of the statute conflict with the procedural mechanisms that have been clearly established by this court through our rules of procedure.for example,section contains a written report requirement and a time for filing a report.conversely,florida rule of civil procedure b governs discovery of the facts known and opinions held by experts,and nowhere in this provision is there a requirement that an expert prepare a signed written report that summarizes the expert witness opinions and the factual basis of the opinions,including documentary evidence and the authorities relied upon in reaching the opinions.stat.rather,rule provides that information from expert witnesses whom a party expects to call to testify during trial may be discovered as follows 
i by interrogatories a party may require any other party to identify each person whom the other party expects to call as an expert witness at trial and to state the subject matter on which the expert is expected to testify,and to state the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion.
ii any person disclosed by interrogatories or otherwise as a person expected to be called as an expert witness at trial may be deposed in accordance with rule without motion or order of court.
fla civ.b a 
similarly,florida rule of civil procedure,which governs the award of costs,contains no reference to written reports or time periods for filing such reports.see.civ.any party seeking a judgment taxing costs,attorneys fees,or both shall serve a motion no later than days after filing of the judgment.additionally,the statewide uniform guidelines for taxation of costs in civil actions,which were approved by this court,see in re amendments to uniform guidelines for taxation of costs,so d,and are appended to the florida rules of civil procedure,contain no report requirement.rather,the guidelines provide those costs that should be taxed for expert witnesses as a reasonable fee for deposition trial testimony,and the costs of preparation of any court ordered report.emphasis supplied.thus,section contains procedural requirements that do not exist in,and are in conflict with,the rules of practice and procedure that have been delineated by this court for the discovery of expert information and for seeking reimbursement of fees for expert witnesses as costs.see kirian,so d at.
the substantive right to taxation of expert witness fees as costs was created in section,and therefore,we conclude that section,like the statute which was addressed in knealing,is exclusively procedural in nature.further,our ultimate conclusion with regard to the constitutionality of these statutory requirements is not controlled by whether they are listed under chapter or another section of the florida statutes.regardless of location,these requirements would still impermissibly conflict with the rules of practice and procedure that have been adopted by this court.see jackson,so d at.
although not dispositive to our holding today,we further note that the session law which enacted section indicates that even the florida legislature questioned whether provisions of that law violated the separation of powers 
it is the intent of this act and the legislature to accord the utmost comity and respect to the constitutional prerogatives of florida judiciary,and nothing in this act should be construed as any effort to impinge upon those prerogatives.to that end,should any court of competent jurisdiction enter a final judgment concluding or declaring that any provision of this act improperly encroaches upon the authority of the florida supreme court to determine the rules of practice and procedure in florida courts,the legislature hereby declares its intent that any such provision be construed as a request for rule change pursuant to,of the state constitution and not as a mandatory legislative directive.
ch,laws of.although the dissent opines that this language does not question the constitutionality of the session law,see dissenting op.at note,a review of the legislative history of the law indicates that the legislature indeed harbored such concerns.a final analysis prepared by the house of representatives committee on the judiciary provided the following commentary with regard to house bill,the predecessor to chapter,after discussing the separation of powers doctrine 
the courts tend to find certain types of provisions unconstitutional such as those regarding timing and sequence of court procedures,creating expedited proceedings,issuing mandates to the courts to perform certain functions,and attempting to supersede or modify existing rules of court or intrude on areas of practice and procedures.hb contains a number of provisions which could involve matters of judicial practice and procedure.if the court were to strike any of these provisions,it would not invalidate the bill as a whole.
comm.on judiciary,hb staff analysis final june,emphasis supplied.it should be noted that chapter impacted a number of statutes it did not merely create section.see ch,laws of.hence,this cautionary language does not refer exclusively to this newly created statutory subsection.
the dissent quickly focuses on our acknowledgement of this fact,but it is evident that concerns as to the constitutionality of this legislation were very clearly expressed.further,even though the dissent may disagree with use of legislative history,this court has specifically stated that this history is an invaluable tool in construing the provisions of a statute.ivey chicago ins,so d,see also white state,so d,noting that legislative staff analyses are one touchstone of the collective legislative will quoting sun florida,baker,so d,dca.consistent with this precedent,this court has utilized legislative history on numerous occasions in attempting to discern the intent of the legislature.see,gulfstream park racing ass tampa bay downs,so d state goode,so d mays state,so d magaw state,so d roberson.parole probation comm n,so d alford finch,so d.accordingly,the dissenting view is contrary to longstanding florida jurisprudence.
during both briefing and oral argument,it has been confirmed that all of the information that is required to be in the written report pursuant to section was actually provided in this case to the parties through expert disclosures,answers to interrogatories,and affidavits and sworn deposition testimony.this information was provided based upon written court orders with regard to discovery requiring disclosure,and those disclosures occurred within the time frame contemplated by the statute.thus,the spirit of the statute was fulfilled in this case because expert witness information was exchanged.the trial court was bound by the decision in cort,and therefore,it is logical that the trial court did not condition the award of costs on compliance with section.nonetheless,even if the decision in cort did not exist,we could not conclude that a party who fully disclosed expert witness information to the opposing party,but failed to comply with the discovery requirements of the form of disclosure required by a statute,should be completely denied a reimbursement for expert witness fees on this basis.
conclusion 
in conclusion,we hold that section impermissibly encroaches on the rulemaking authority of this court because it imposes procedural requirements with regard to both the discovery of expert witnesses and the taxation of expert witness fees as costs which do not exist under the rules of practice and procedure that have been promulgated by this court.accordingly,we affirm the holding of the first district in massey ii that section of the florida statutes is unconstitutional.
it is so ordered.
i respectfully disagree with the majority conclusion that section,florida statutes,impermissibly intrudes on our rulemaking authority.the issue is whether the statute provides for,or conditions,a substantive right which is within the legislature authority or whether it merely establishes a procedure for enforcing a right which is within our authority.the fair answer is that it does both.the first sentence of section conditions the right to taxation of expert witness fees as costs on the filing of a report.that sentence imposes a condition on a substantive right.therefore,if the statute were limited to that sentence,it would clearly be substantive.the second sentence establishes the deadlines for filing the report.it imposes procedural requirements.therefore,if the statute were limited to that sentence,it would clearly be procedural.the issue,then,is whether the combination of the two sentences renders the statute as a whole substantive or procedural.because the second sentence is necessary to implement the substantive aspects of the statute,and because it does not conflict with existing rules,i would hold that the procedural aspects of the statute are incidental to the substantive ones,and are therefore constitutional.
below i demonstrate why section is constitutional by explaining that i the first sentence of the statute,which conditions the right to taxation of expert witness fees as costs on filing the expert report,is no less substantive because it is contained in a different statute than the one creating the right ii the deadline for filing the report,while procedural,is incidental and necessary to implement the substantive report requirement and iii the procedural aspect of the statute does not conflict with our existing rules.
i.the report requirement is substantive 
we must analyze the statute under the fundamental rule of statutory construction that,if at all possible,a statute should be construed to be constitutional.caple tuttle,so d.thus,we are bound to resolve all doubts in favor of the statute constitutionality.see,id.
the distinction between substantive rights,which are the prerogative of the legislature,and procedure,which is reserved to this court rulemaking authority,is not always clear.see,id.at the distinction between substantive and procedural law is neither simple nor certain.we have defined substantive law,however,as that part of the law which creates,defines,and regulates rights,or that part of the law which courts are established to administer.id.emphasis added quoting haven fed.sav.loan ass kirian,so d.we must therefore decide whether section creates,defines,and regulates rights.
we have recognized that the circumstances under which a party is entitled to costs and attorney fees is substantive.in re amendments to.rules of civil procedure,so d,quoting timmons combs,so d.thus,it is the legislature prerogative to allow taxation of costs on the losing party.see wolf county of volusia,so d,common law provided no mechanism whereby one party could be charged with the costs of the other.cost provisions are a creature of statute and must be carefully construed.quoting bd.of county comm rs sawyer,so d.
since,the legislature has provided for the taxation of expert witness fees as costs.see ch,laws of.the statute allowing the recovery of costs provides,in part,that a ny expert or skilled witness who shall have testified in any cause shall be allowed a witness fee including the cost of any exhibits used by such witness in an amount agreed to by the parties,and the same shall be taxed as costs.stat.
in,the legislature refined this right by enacting the provision at issue 
expert witness fees may not be awarded as taxable costs unless the party retaining the expert witness furnishes each opposing party with a written report signed by the expert witness which summarizes the expert witness opinions and the factual basis of the opinions,including documentary evidence and the authorities relied upon in reaching the opinions.such report shall be filed at least days prior to the deposition of the expert or at least days prior to discovery cutoff,whichever is sooner,or as otherwise determined by the court.this subsection does not apply to any action proceeding under the florida family law rules of procedure.
stat.see ch,at,laws of while the right to taxation of expert witness fees as costs is created in section,florida statutes,the first sentence of section,by conditioning that right,further defines and regulates it.therefore,it is substantive.
we have upheld statutes as substantive when they both create and condition the right.in school board of broward county price,so d,for example,we upheld a statute that waived sovereign immunity for school boards,but prohibited parties from suggesting to a jury that insurance coverage was available.in rejecting the argument that the prohibition was a legislative incursion on our rulemaking authority,we explained 
the plain wording of the statute challenged here shows that the prohibition sets the bounds of a substantive right,the right to sue a school board enjoying sovereign immunity,for liability damages.the statute waives sovereign immunity for school boards,which is within the constitutional power of the legislature under article x,section,florida constitution.but it does so only,provided no attempt shall be made in the trial of any action against a school board to suggest the existence of any insurance the waiver,then,is effective only if insurance coverage is not suggested to the jury.the statute proviso sets the bounds of the substantive right to sue a political subdivision of the state.and it conditions the waiver.thus,the proviso is substantive,in that it delineates a substantive right.
id.at emphasis added see also caple,so d at upholding the constitutionality of a statute that create d the right to petition for receipt of mortgage payments during foreclosure proceedings and establishe d the grounds upon which the petition may be granted emphasis added jackson.dep t of,so d,reiterating that the existence of a right for indigents to proceed without payment of costs is a substantive one and is properly provided for by the legislature and that the right could be properly limited by the legislature emphasis added.
similarly,here,the first sentence of section conditions the substantive right to taxation of expert witness fees on providing the opposing party a report of the expert.thus,while section creates the right to such costs,section conditions it.the report requirement is therefore substantive.contrary to the majority assertion,majority op.at note,this does not mean that the legislature may enact statutes governing procedure simply by prefacing them with the word unless or any other word or phrase,for that matter.what is important is not the particular language used to introduce the condition,but whether it is truly a condition on a substantive right or instead governs the procedure for implementing the right.nor do i suggest that,as to every statute that contains both substance and procedure,the procedural aspects should be deemed merely incidental.ours remains a analysis,and in some statutes the procedural aspects may indeed overwhelm the substantive ones.i merely suggest that such is not the case here.
the majority concludes that the provision is exclusively procedural because the substantive right to taxation of expert witness fees as costs was created in section.majority op.at.but the issue is not whether another statute creates the right.the issue is whether this statute is substantive or procedural.if it is substantive,then it remains so regardless of whether other statutes also inform the right.the placement of a condition on a right in a different statute from the one creating it does not render it procedural.the two and must be read in pari materia.see,mcdonald state,so d,t he doctrine of in pari materia requires that statutes relating to the same subject or object be construed together to harmonize the statutes and give effect to the legislature intent.quoting zold zold,so d,mcghee volusia county,so d,stating that an exception to the waiver of sovereign immunity must be read in pari materia with the general waiver statute.
i recognize that we have found a statute unconstitutional where the substantive right was created in a different statute.in state raymond,so d,we found procedural a statute prohibiting nonmonetary pretrial release at the first appearance.we noted that the provision granting the right to nonmonetary release was fixed in a portion of the statute that is not at issue here.id.however,the provision we invalidated did not condition the right to nonmonetary pretrial release it only changed the court standard practice of granting it at the first a procedural element.we expressly recognized that a ny person entitled to pts nonmonetary release before the amendment is still entitled to it after the amendment.id.the amendment affected only the timing of the release.id.in this case,on the other hand,the report requirement conditions the right to taxation of expert witness fees.the statute expressly provides that such fees may not be awarded as taxable costs unless the report is provided.stat.i repeat a condition on the right to taxation of costs is not procedural merely because it is contained in a different statute than the one creating the right.
the majority nevertheless concludes that this language in section is merely a prelude that attempts to introduce additional procedural elements related to the award of such costs.majority op.at.this assumption is contrary to the requirement that we assume that the legislature intended to enact an effective law,city of pinellas park,so d,statutes are presumptively valid and constitutional,and will be given effect if possible.all doubts will be resolved in favor of constitutionality.it is also contrary to the bill title,which states that the act was intended to provide the criteria under which expert witness fees may be awarded as taxable costs.ch,at,laws of emphasis added see aramark unif.career apparel,easton,so d,the title is more than an index to what the section is about or has reference to it is a direct statement by the legislature of its intent.quoting state webb,so d,
ii.including a time limit does not render the statute procedural 
having concluded that the first sentence of section,the expert report requirement,is a constitutional limitation on the substantive right to taxation of expert witness fees,i next explore the second sentence,which states such report shall be filed at least days prior to the deposition of the expert or at least days prior to the discovery cutoff,whichever is sooner,or as otherwise determined by the court.i agree that this time limit is procedural.i disagree,however,that its inclusion invalidates the statute.
generally,time limits for court filings are matters of procedure.see,amendments to.rules of criminal procedure.rules of appellate procedure,so d,cantero,concurring once a case is filed in a court of law,the decision of when that right may be invoked is quintessentially a matter of procedure,over which this court has ultimate authority.thus,i agree that the time limit for filing the expert report in section is procedural.
that the second sentence is procedural,however,does not end our inquiry.the mere presence of procedural aspects in a primarily substantive statute will not render a statute unconstitutional where they are minimal and are intended to implement the substantive provisions of the law.kalway state,so d,dca see also in re commitment of cartwright,so d,dca t here are also circumstances where a legislative provision which would be deemed procedural if viewed in isolation will nonetheless be upheld because of the connection between that provision and substantive provisions adopted by the legislature.as we noted in caple,so d at,w e have consistently rejected constitutional challenges where the procedural provisions were intertwined with substantive rights.see also smith dep t of,so d,recognizing that the statute had procedural aspects,but finding them necessary to implement the substantive provisions vanbibber hartford accident indem.ins,so d,holding that the statute prohibiting joinder of insurers was within the legislature power despite affecting joinder of parties in courts peninsular props.braden river,llc city of bradenton,so d,dca finding procedural a provision tolling the time to file an action,but nevertheless constitutional because it was intertwined with substantive provisions,review denied,so d in re cartwright,so d at t he challenged statutory provision should be upheld because it is intimately related to and intertwined with the substantive provisions of the ryce act.quoting caple,so d at.
florida courts,including this court,have upheld statutes that contain both substantive and procedural aspects.in smith,so d,we addressed challenges to several sections of the tort reform and insurance act of.we rejected the argument that various sections,in particular a requirement that jury verdicts be itemized,encroached on our rulemaking authority.id.at.instead,we noted that despite procedural aspects that will require immediate examination by this court,the provisions were necessary to implement the substantive provisions.id.emphasis added.similarly,in kalway,so d at,the district court found constitutional a statute requiring a prisoner requesting indigency status to produce his prisoner trust account activity.the court recognized that a decision whether to subject a prisoner trust account to payment of court costs and fees is clearly a subjective determination appropriately made by the legislature.id.the court found,however,that the statute contained directives,which are not binding on the supreme court,concerning the manner in which the substantive objectives are to be reached.id.it concluded that the procedural aspects were minimal and d id not void the statute,because they were intended to implement the substantive provisions of the law.see also raymond,so d at explaining that the minimal procedural aspect of the statute at issue in kalway was proper in order to implement the substantive law.
in this case,the deadline for providing the expert report is minimal and is necessary to implement the substantive report requirement.absent some time limitation,the requirement would be meaningless.a party could simply wait to provide a report until it has prevailed and is seeking costs,at which point the report would be useless.thus,i conclude,as we have in other similar cases,that the suggested deadline in section,while procedural,does not infringe on our rulemaking authority.see,caple,so d at b ecause the statute creates substantive rights and any procedural provisions are directly related to the definition of those rights,we hold that section does not infringe on this court rulemaking authority.smith,so d at we find that all these sections are directly related to the substantive statutory scheme and conclude that these provisions do not violate the separation of powers clause of the florida constitution.therefore,the statute is constitutional.
it is this substantive aspect of the statute here that distinguishes this case from those where we have found unconstitutional purely procedural statutes.see,raymond,so d at knealing puleo,so d.for example,the majority compares this case to knealing.majority op.at.there,we found unconstitutional a portion of a mediation statute permitting an offer of settlement to be made at any time after a mediator has declared an impasse.knealing,so d at.we noted,however,that the statute contained only procedural requirements and we distinguished cases where we upheld statutes despite their procedural aspects because they also included substantive provisions.id.at emphasis added distinguishing leapai milton,so d,and timmons,so d see also raymond,so d at w here there is no substantive right conveyed by the statute,the procedural aspects are not incidental accordingly,such a statute is unconstitutional.citing knealing,so d.unlike the provisions at issue in knealing and raymond,section is not purely also contains the substantive report requirement.the procedural deadline for filing is necessary to implement it.
the majority concludes that section can not be substantive because portions of the statute with regard to the procedures fall completely to the absolute discretion of the courts,even if there has been a failure of compliance.majority op.at.it is certainly true that the second sentence of section,setting deadlines for filing the expert report of five days before the expert deposition,twenty days before the discovery cutoff,or as otherwise determined by the court,leaves discretion to the trial court.but courts do not have discretion to eliminate the report requirement only to adjust the deadline.the statute permits courts discretion to deal with the procedural implementation of the substantive matter properly left to the courts.smith,so d at approving the trial court explanation that,although a provision was procedural,because it was not mandatory it did not encroach on the court rulemaking authority.
iii.absence of conflict with procedural rules 
it is only where the procedural aspects of a statute conflict with a rule promulgated by this court that we have found them unconstitutional.see,jackson,so d at a statute can have both substantive provisions and procedural requirements.if the procedural requirements conflict with or interfere with the procedural mechanisms of the court system,they are unconstitutional haven,so d at where this court promulgates rules relating to the practice and procedure of all courts and a statute provides a contrary practice or procedure,the statute is unconstitutional to the extent of the conflict.in looney state,so d,we rejected a challenge to a statute governing the admissibility of victim impact evidence where it did not conflict with an existing rule of procedure,explaining 
in the instant case,however,this court had promulgated no rule or procedure governing the admissibility of victim impact evidence at the time of the legislature enactment or at any time since.accordingly,the legislatively enacted statute does not interfere with,intrude upon,or conflict with this court own rule.as such,it can not be said that the statute unconstitutionally violates separation of powers.
similarly,here,the deadline for filing the expert report in section does not conflict with any rules of procedure.therefore,this minimal procedural aspect does not render the statute unconstitutional.to the extent the substantive report requirement itself conflicts with a procedural rule,it is the rule,not the statute,that
