in june,a california company,sent purchase orders for cans of hair spray and cartons of hair mousse to kamdar,an illinois limited liability company.kamdar,acting as purchasing agent,forwarded the purchase orders to uk aerosols uk aerosols,an english company,and purchased the goods from uk aerosols.kamdar authorized uk aerosols to ship the goods on behalf of and kamdar.accordingly,uk aerosols requested that apl,a singapore corporation,ship the cargo containing the hair mousse and hair spray from istanbul,turkey to long beach,california.
apl issued a bill of lading governing the terms of carriage.on the bill of lading,apl is listed as the carrier,uk aerosols as the shipper,kamdar as the notify party,and as the also notify party.uk aerosols,and kamdar each accepted and endorsed the bill of lading.the bill of lading contains several provisions at issue in this case.clause provides that the merchant must indemnify apl for any losses caused by the manner in which a container had been packed by a party other than apl or the unsuitability of the goods for carriage.merchant,as defined in the bill of lading,includes the shipper,consignee,receiver,holder of the bill of lading,owner of the cargo or person entitled to the possession of the cargo or having a present or future interest in the goods for carriage.clause provides that express written consent from apl is required for the carriage of hazardous goods,and regardless of whether the merchant is aware of the hazardous nature of the goods,it must indemnify apl for any losses arising as a consequence of the carriage of such goods.clause i of the bill of lading specifies that i nsofar as anything has not been dealt with by the terms and conditions of the bill of lading,singapore law shall apply.
when the goods arrived in long beach,california,apl discovered that one of the containers in the shipment was leaking,dangerous and hazardous.apl spent approximately in assessing,cleaning up,removing,and ultimately disposing of the shipment.
apl subsequently filed a complaint against uk aerosols,kamdar,u,and solutions,llc a party later dismissed from the action,asserting negligence claims and contract claims,alleging that the defendants had breached their indemnification obligations under the bill of lading.uk aerosols failed to answer the complaint,and the district court entered default judgment against it.and kamdar moved for summary judgment,arguing that certain provisions of the bill of lading were void because they violated provisions of the carriage of goods by sea act cogsa.the district court held that clause of the bill of lading would only violate cogsa to the extent that it imposed liability without fault on a party that was a shipper,and because neither party had alleged that and kamdar were shippers,clause was not necessarily void.the district court also held that apl might not be able to prevail under clause if it was on notice of the hazardous nature of the goods,but that the issue of whether it had notice was a factual issue in dispute.consequently,the district court denied summary judgment to and kamdar on the contract claims.it did,however,enter summary judgment for and kamdar on the negligence claims.
subsequently,and kamdar filed a second motion for summary judgment,and apl filed its first motion for summary judgment.and kamdar argued that they were shippers,and therefore,certain provisions of the bill of lading were void as applied to them.apl,on the other hand,argued that and kamdar were contractually liable under the bill of lading for the negligence of uk aerosols,even if they were not negligent.the district court denied and kamdar motion and granted apl motion,holding that and kamdar were not shippers,and thus not entitled to the protection of cogsa rule against liability without fault.the district court held that and kamdar were contractually liable under clauses and of the bill of lading.the district court entered judgment against and kamdar in the amount of.
following the entry of judgment,apl filed a motion for attorneys fees.apl argued that the bill of lading provides that the attorneys fees issue is governed by singapore law,and therefore,the prevailing party is entitled to attorneys fees.the district court denied the motion.it held that cogsa would control the dispute over attorneys fees,that federal law would apply to the issue,and therefore that no attorneys fees would be awarded.it also held that apl did not meet its obligation under federal rule of civil procedure to give reasonable notice that it would raise the issue concerning singapore law.
subsequently,and kamdar filed an appeal from the district court summary judgment in favor of apl,and apl filed an appeal from the district court denial of attorneys fees.

and kamdar argue that section of prohibits them from being held liable under the bill of lading.section provides that t he shipper shall not be responsible for loss or damage sustained by the carrier or the ship arising or resulting from any cause without the act,fault,or neglect of the shipper,his agents,or his servants.clause of the bill of lading requires that where the container at issue was packed by a party other than apl,a merchant must indemnify apl for losses incurred as a result of the manner in which the container has been filled,packed,stuffed or loaded or the unsuitability of the goods for carriage in the container.as defined in the bill of lading,the term merchant includes and kamdar as parties having a future right to receive the goods and the owner of the goods,respectively.
and kamdar argue,however,that they are also shippers entitled to the protection of section of cogsa.therefore,u.and kamdar contend that they are not obligated to indemnify apl for expenses related to the of the leaked materials because the leak did not result from their own acts,fault or neglect rather the leak was the result of uk aerosol negligent packing.
the word shipper is not defined in cogsa.however,the cogsa statutory scheme indicates that,for purposes of section,a shipper is a party separate and distinct from other parties to a bill of lading,including,in this case,the owners of the goods and those who have a future interest in the goods.
first,congress chose to use different terms in cogsa when referring to the shipper in conjunction with other parties,on the one hand,and the shipper alone,on the other.when interpreting a statute,we abide by the principle that w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.russello united states,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in this case,cogsa defines a contract of carriage to include bills of lading and other similar documents,which regulate the relations between a carrier and a holder of the same.b emphasis added.a holder of a bill of lading can be any person in possession of the bill of lading,whether it be the shipper or the subsequent endorsee of the bill of lading.b b holder means the person in possession of a document of title if the goods are deliverable either to bearer or to the order of the person in possession see also interpool char yigh marine panama,cir holding that i n maritime commercial transactions,the uniform commercial code is taken as indicative of the federal common law of admiralty.thus,if congress had intended section to protect both the shipper and subsequent endorsees of the bill of lading,it could have used the term holder as it did in section b.
second,expanding the definition of shipper to include multiple parties to the bill of lading would undermine the underlying policy goals of cogsa.for example,cogsa mandates that,on demand of the shipper,the carrier must issue to the shipper a bill of lading.a bill of lading evidences the receipt of goods for shipment.b.it also operates as a document of title.see pollard vinton.in the hands of the holder the bill of lading is evidence of ownership of the property mentioned in it,and of the right to receive said property at the place of delivery.if each party to the bill of lading,including both the named shipper and the notify parties,was entitled to demand that the carrier issue a bill of lading,multiple parties could possess an original bill of lading.to do so would create competing chains of title,undermining cogsa goal of promoting predictability in the implementation of rules.senator linie gmbh.kg sunway line,cir holding that congress goal with cogsa was to foster international uniformity in rules and allocating risk between shippers and carriers in a manner that is consistent and predictable.
third,the use of the term shipper in other cogsa provisions implies that a shipper is the entity that delivers the goods to the carrier,not the eventual receiver of the goods.section provides that t he shipper shall be deemed to have guaranteed to the carrier the accuracy at the time of shipment of the marks,number,quantity and weight,as furnished by him.therefore,the shipper is the entity that provides the particulars regarding the shipment.section also requires the shipper to indemnify the carrier against losses resulting from inaccuracies in the description of the marks,number,quantity and weight of the shipment.a practical reading of this statute dictates that the entity that delivers the goods to the carrier and provides the particulars is the shipper because the entity that ships the goods is the party most able to verify the specifics of the shipment.
significantly,section also specifies that t he right of the carrier to such indemnity shall in no way limit his responsibility and liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.id.emphasis added.if congress had intended all parties to the bill of lading including the owners and those with a future interest in the goods to be included in the definition of shipper,there would be no need to include a provision making the carrier liable to parties to the bill of lading other than the shipper because there would be no other parties to whom the carrier would be liable.
and kamdar argue that the definition of shipper from the shipping act of shipping act should supply the definition of shipper under cogsa.under the shipping act,a shipper includes a cargo owner or the person to whom delivery is to be made.however,there is no indication that congress intended to merge the definition of shipper from the shipping act into cogsa.accord united states ex rel.chicago,new york boston refrigerator interstate commerce comm n.b ecause words used in one statute have a particular meaning they do not necessarily denote an identical meaning when used in another and different statute.moreover,as discussed above,to do so would be inconsistent with several provisions within cogsa.
case law offers different definitions for shipper depending on the context.compare logistics,v.one pyramid tent arena,cir relying on an admiralty law treatise definition of shipper as the party who supplies the goods to be transported with compagnie generale transatlantique am.tobacco,cir relying on the shipping act definition of shipper as the person for whose account the carriage of the goods is undertaken.there is no need for us to articulate a precise definition of shipper to fill in the definitional gap in cogsa.it is clear,based on other provisions of cogsa statutory scheme,that and kamdar,parties not listed as the shipper on the bill of lading,do not qualify as shippers for purposes of section.for those reasons,we hold that section of cogsa does not shield them from liability under the bill of lading.
and kamdar next argue that they are not obligated to indemnify apl under clauses and of the bill of lading because those clauses are void under section of cogsa.section provides that 
a ny clause in a contract of carriage relieving the carrier or the ship from liability for loss or damage to or in connection with the goods,arising from negligence,fault,or failure in the duties and obligations provided in this section,or lessening such liability otherwise than as provided in this chapter,shall be null and void and of no effect.
the question before us is whether either clause or clause of the bill of lading impermissibly lessens apl liability for loss or damage to or in connection with the goods transported if so,the clauses are void.
and kamdar first argue that clause is void under section to the extent that it lessens apl liability by violating section.as discussed above,section of cogsa prevents a shipper from being responsible for loss or damage sustained by a carrier without the act,fault,or neglect of the shipper,his agent,or his servants.clause of the bill of lading states that if a container not packed by apl causes loss,damage,or liability because of the manner in which the container was packed or loaded,the merchants as defined in the bill of lading must indemnify the carrier for the loss.
we conclude that clause of the bill of lading does not violate section.clause would violate section if it imposed strict liability on the shipper.but in order for liability under clause to set in,a person or entity other than the carrier most likely the shipper must have acted negligently or packed the container in a manner that would cause damage.thus,it does not impermissibly lessen apl liability.furthermore,to the extent that and kamdar also argue that clause relieves apl of liability for loss caused by apl own negligence,they are incorrect.the clause is not triggered if apl packed the containers that caused the damage.therefore,the clause is not void under section.
clause in this case is readily distinguishable from the clause at issue in a district court case cited by and kamdar excel shipping seatrain int l.in that case,the bill of lading included a clause stating that the shipper,the consignee and the goods,jointly and severally,shall be liable for,and shall indemnify the carrier and the ship against damages caused by cargo tendered for carriage.id.at.there was no provision exempting the shipper from liability which stemmed from the carrier negligence.it therefore directly violates section of cogsa by making the shipper liable for acts caused by any party.id.at.in clause at issue here,on the other hand,the parties can not be held liable for any negligence on the part of apl in packing and shipping the goods.
for the above reasons,clause of the bill of lading does not violate section,and it does not attempt to relieve apl of apl liability for loss or damage to goods due to its negligence.clause is therefore valid.and kamdar do not dispute that they fit within the definition of merchant under the bill of lading,and under clause,the merchants must indemnify apl for losses caused by the manner in which a container was packed or the unsuitability of goods for carriage.thus,and kamdar are contractually bound to indemnify apl under clause.
and kamdar also argue that clause of the bill of lading is void under section because the clause violates section of cogsa.because we hold they are liable under clause,it is unnecessary for us to reach the alternative liability issue raised under clause.
