this consolidated appeal concerns the district court refusal to award attorney fees to two attorneys whose clients had their assets frozen as part of a civil case brought by the federal trade commission.after the district court entered an asset freeze order,the two clients paid substantial retainers to their attorneys.in separate orders,the district court ordered the attorneys to turn all or substantially all the funds over to the receiver.the attorneys now appeal those orders.we affirm.
background 
common factual background 
the events leading to these two appeals can be traced to january,when federal trade commission ftc filed a complaint in the united states district court for the western district of texas.the complaint alleged that a variety of corporations and individuals,led by kyle kimoto and his primary operating company,assail assail collectively the defendants,engaged in a telemarketing scheme in violation of a of the federal trade commission act ftca,a,and the ftc telemarketing sales rule,
at the ftc insistence,on the day the complaint was filed,the court issued an ex parte temporary restraining order barring the defendants from continuing their scheme and freezing their assets.the order named certain specific defendants,but it also made clear that the provisions of this order shall be binding upon the defendants and upon their attorneys and all other persons or entities in active concert or participation with the defendants who receive actual notice of this order the court also appointed appellee robb evans associates,llc rea as receiver.on february,the district court issued a preliminary injunction that essentially restated the terms of the temporary restraining order.
factual and procedural background for robert draskovich 
on january,rea took control of assail principal place of business in george,utah.the next day,kimoto retained appellant robert draskovich to defend him in the ftc matter and in any potential criminal matters.the day after that,january,draskovich received a retainer.the funds were wired directly to him by alliance solutions,alliance.on january,draskovich received an additional,which was transferred to him from valdine management valdine.kimoto assured draskovich that the alliance funds were not tainted,the funds had nothing to do with the government allegations of telemarketing fraud.
on september,kimoto,assail,and the ftc entered into a stipulated judgment which brought the proceedings against kimoto and assail to a close.the court issued a judgment against kimoto for million.the judgment was suspended to the extent that it exceeded the sum generated from the liquidation of the assets in which kimoto had an interest.all funds generated from the liquidation were ordered to be paid as consumer redress.the stipulated judgment contained a provision that allowed the defendants attorneys to apply for fees from the receivership estate.on october,draskovich applied to the district court to allow him to retain the funds he received from alliance and valdine.this was in spite of the fact that in april,the ftc had already requested that draskovich return the,arguing that the funds were transferred to him in violation of the court asset freeze order.on october,the ftc and rea filed motions opposing the fee application and requesting that the district court require draskovich to turn over the to rea.on november,the court denied draskovich application and granted the ftc and rea requesting repayment of the entire retainer.draskovich now appeals from the court november order.on appeal,he argues that the district court erred in finding that the fees he received were subject to the initial asset freeze the district court order violated his client sixth amendment right to counsel and the procedures the district court used in making its decision violated due process.
factual and procedural background for dean kajioka 
when rea staff took control of assail on january,an assail employee mentioned that assail was in the process of installing certain joint equipment with valdine.valdine was located in the same office complex as assail.this led rea staff to suspect that even though valdine was not named in the ftc complaint,it was part of kimoto scheme.rea suspicions were confirmed when it visited valdine offices that same day.rea found woody davidson,assail head of technology,in the process of installing worth of equipment to create a telemarketing call center,as well as linking valdine and assail computer and telephone systems so that they would be fully integrated.davidson and other assail employees indicated that valdine offices were to become the control center for assail telemarketing operations.
steven henriksen,valdine president,secretary,treasurer,sole shareholder,sole employee,and sole bank account signatory,was quickly informed of rea actions by his brother,who was the chief financial officer of assail and a defendant in the underlying action.in the two weeks following rea raid,henriksen,at the direction of kimoto,paid out approximately from valdine accounts to secure legal representation for the various defendants during this general time period,henriksen also paid himself approximately in bonuses.
on january,henriksen retained appellant dean kajioka to represent him and valdine for an initial retainer of.the next day,henriksen withdrew from valdine account to pay part of kajioka retainer.the day after that,january,henriksen withdrew another to pay the remainder of the retainer.
on january,kajioka called rea and objected to rea taking possession and control of valdine,taking particular note of the fact that valdine was not named in any court papers.rea informed kajioka that it believed valdine was an affiliated entity of assail,and thus rea would not release valdine assets.kajioka claim that valdine was not named in any court papers was mooted as a result of the court preliminary injunction on february.unlike the initial temporary restraining order,valdine was expressly included within the scope of the temporary injunction.
on june,rea counsel sent a letter to kajioka demanding that he return the full retainer to rea because the funds had been transferred in violation of the court asset freeze order.kajioka refused rea request.this refusal prompted the ftc and rea to file separate motions on august,requesting the court to issue an order forcing kajioka and henriksen to show cause why they should not be held in contempt.on september,the court issued such an order.
on october,the district court held a hearing for henriksen and kajioka to show cause why they should not be held in contempt.henriksen asserted his fifth amendment right as to all substantive questions.kajioka refused to testify under oath,but he did make an unsworn statement in open court.he acknowledged that he had been retained to represent henriksen on january,and had received the retainer.he also stated that he was retained to represent henriksen in any potential criminal actions but had also provided representation in the civil case.
on october,the court issued an order holding henriksen in contempt for dissipating valdine assets in violation of the temporary restraining order and the preliminary injunction.the court declined to hold kajioka in contempt.the court found that because no criminal prosecution commenced,kajioka could not have earned the entire for services rendered in connection with henriksen potential criminal liability.the court did allow kajioka to retain for services rendered and ordered him to return the rest of the funds to rea or show cause why he should not be held in contempt.kajioka filed several memoranda,as well as documentary evidence,with the court in support of his contention that he should be allowed to keep the full amount of the retainer.on november,the court issued its final order on the matter.the court reiterated its earlier determination that kajioka was allowed to keep kajioka now appeals from the court final order,raising on appeal the identical issues as draskovich.
ii.standard of review 
this appeal essentially covers two issues the district court orders concerning assets found to be part of the receivership estate and the district court award of attorney fees.both issues are reviewed on an overall abuse of discretion standard,under which we review underlying factual findings for clear error and issues of law de novo.see united states melrose subdivision,cir reviewing under an abuse of discretion standard a request to amend an asset freeze order in order to pay attorney fees.
iii.analysis 
appellate jurisdiction 
on april,we sent a briefing notice to the parties directing them to address the following issue whether the order s from which appeal is taken in this civil case is appealable based on the termination of the litigation,pursuant to b,fed,or the collateral order doctrine,or whether there exists sic some other bases of appellate jurisdiction.see generally,a,b.
upon reviewing both the parties arguments and the record,we conclude that we do have jurisdiction to hear these appeals.the final section of the stipulated order entered into on september,states the parties hereby consent to entry of the foregoing order which shall constitute a final judgment and order in this matter.the parties further stipulate and agree that the entry of the foregoing order shall constitute a full,complete,and final settlement of this action.this order was entered on september.the order relating to robert draskovich was entered on november.the order relating to dean kajioka was entered on november.thus,both orders were entered after the underlying litigation against kimoto was settled.
with respect to draskovich,this chronology makes it clear that the underlying litigation is final.the same holds true for kajioka.kajioka client,steven henriksen,never was a defendant in the underlying action.however,the true ownership of the funds in his possession,including those he used to pay kajioka,was a question to be determined in the underlying litigation.that question was answered by the stipulated order.thus,in both cases the district court entered a final judgment before draskovich and kajioka initiated their respective appeals.essentially,the stipulated order terminated the liability phase of the case.the instant appeals concern rea efforts to reduce kimoto assets to liquid form and distribute those liquid assets to victims of his fraudulent scheme.accordingly,this court has appellate jurisdiction to hear these appeals.
b.the district court did not err in finding that draskovich and kajioka improperly accepted and maintained possession of the retainers 
draskovich and kajioka argue that their acceptance of the retainers was permissible because the funds they accepted were not subject to the initial asset freeze order.kajioka claims that at the time he was paid his retainer,valdine and henriksen had not been mentioned in any court papers.valdine and henriksen were not specifically mentioned until the february preliminary injunction was issued.until that time,kajioka claims there was no way he could have known that henriksen and valdine were subject to the asset freeze order.kajioka further asserts that in his january call to rea,he was led to believe that the seizure may have been a mistake.similarly,draskovich claims that when he received the funds from alliance and valdine,they had not been named in any court papers.thus,in the appellants view,to say that the transfers violated a court order would be to say that the order was violated before it ever existed.
the appellants alternatively argue that there was no way for them to know that the transfers violated the court order.the appellants argue that their ignorance is a valid excuse because they had no duty to independently investigate whether the parties paying their fees were acting in concert with the named parties.to the extent there was such a duty to inquire,draskovich argues that he fulfilled this duty by securing kimoto promise that the funds with which he was being paid were not tainted.
the appellants fees were subject to the asset freeze order 
the appellants arguments fail to persuade us that the district court erred.as mentioned above,the initial ex parte temporary restraining order stated that the terms of the order covered the named parties as well as all other persons or entities in active concert or participation with the defendants.the district court determination that alliance,valdine,and henriksen were acting in concert with the named defendants,and thus were subject to the asset freeze,is a finding of fact that is reviewed for clear error.portland feminist women health ctr.advocates for life,cir holding that the court of appeals could not review whether the district court determination that a contemptor was acting in concert with a party named in an injunction was clearly erroneous because the failed to provide the necessary hearing transcripts in the record.
the record provides substantial evidence supporting the district court determination.rea investigation established that nearly all of the money flowing into and out of alliance and valdine bank accounts came from,and was sent to,other entities.rea found no business justification for any of these transfers.the incipient joint operation center is also highly relevant because it shows that valdine and assail were essentially operating as one company.thus,we affirm the district court finding that the appellants fees were paid with funds subject to the asset freeze order.
the appellants had a duty to inquire as to the source of their fees 
the next question,then,is whether an attorney has a duty to inquire as to the source of his fee when he is put on notice that his fee may derive from a pool of frozen assets.although this court has yet to confront this issue directly,we hold that for several reasons an attorney does hold such a duty.first,we think that accepting a fee from a pool of assets frozen by a court order is sufficiently akin to accepting a fee from the proceeds of criminal activity to make the principle applicable to the latter situation instructive here.as a general matter of professional ethics,an attorney may not accept the fruits of the crime as a fee,for knowingly accepting the fruits of crime in return for valuable services is simply a form of aiding and abetting crime geoffrey hazard,william hodes,the law of lawyering,at ed.supp.for this reason,an attorney must audit a client sufficiently so as to avoid becoming part of a criminal scheme that includes disposing of gains.id.the instant case did not involve criminal charges,although it bears mentioning that both lawyers were retained for potential criminal representation.even though criminal charges apparently did not materialize,it is clear that kimoto committed multiple,egregious violations of the ftca.further,the fees in question were derived from kimoto fraudulent scheme.thus,it seems entirely appropriate to apply to the instant case this general ethical obligation to audit a client before accepting potentially tainted fees.
additionally,t his court adheres to the well established doctrine that a n attorney,after being admitted to practice,becomes an officer of the court,exercising a privilege or franchise.as officers of the court,attorneys owe a duty to the court that far exceeds that of lay citizens.carroll jaques admiralty law firm,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted second alteration in original.for us to hold that an attorney has no duty to investigate the source of his fees in the instant circumstances would essentially be a statement that an officer of the court has no duty to investigate whether he himself is violating a valid court order.we are not willing so to hold.
in rather similar circumstances to the instant case,the ninth circuit followed this rationale in holding that an attorney did have a duty of inquiry.cftc co petro marketing group,cir.in co petro,the district court appointed a receiver over a firm and permanently enjoined it from transferring or diverting any of its resources.the next day,the firm sent a check to its law firm to cover its existing legal bill and to establish a trust account for future services.the law firm cashed the check before it received a copy of the district court order.the receiver later petitioned the district court
