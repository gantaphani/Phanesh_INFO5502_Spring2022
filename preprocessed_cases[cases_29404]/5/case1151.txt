amended opinion 
factual and procedural history 
on august,amerisourcebergen corporation brought suit against dialysist west,alleging that dialysist west breached a sales agreement concerning the sale of the drug epogen.following its determination that to of the epogen it purchased from dialysist west was counterfeit,amerisourcebergen withheld payments due dialysist west on drug sales.on march,dialysist west filed a counterclaim demanding that amerisourcebergen pay the approximately million it owed for the products dialysist west had shipped to amerisourcebergen.on the same day,dialysist west also filed an,complaint against pharmaceutical distributors amerx,csg distributors,and optia medical.on april,csg distributors filed a complaint against premier medical distributors,and on july,amerx filed a complaint against three more epogen distributors.
on may,amerisourcebergen filed a reply to dialysist west counterclaim conceding that it had not paid for the products including procrit and that these products were genuine.on july,dialysist west filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings and for entry of final judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b on the million counterclaim.on august,amerisourcebergen filed a for leave to amend its complaint and its reply to dialysist west counterclaim,changing its tack by alleging that dialysist west had also sold it counterfeit procrit.on january,the district court granted dialysist west motion for judgment on the pleadings,denied amerisourcebergen motion for leave to amend,and certified the judgment as final under rule b.on march,the district court denied amerisourcebergen motion to stay execution of judgment and amerisourcebergen filed this appeal on march.

iii.discussion 
setoff of epogen claims 
amerisourcebergen claims that the district court erred in finding that it could not the approximately million it owes dialysist west for,pharmaceutical purchases against the estimated million judgment it seeks from dialysist west for selling amerisourcebergen counterfeit epogen.amerisourcebergen bears the burden of establishing that it is entitled to either a legal or equitable setoff of its claims.see newbery fireman fund ins,cir.
amerisourcebergen and dialysist west agree that section of the arizona commercial code applies.the arizona statute,a codification of section of the uniform commercial code,provides 
the buyer on notifying the seller of his intention to do so may deduct all or any part of the damages resulting from any breach of the contract from any part of the price still due under the same contract.
a plain reading of the statute indicates that a party may not a contractual claim against a debt on a separate contract.see itv direct,healthy solutions,llc,d,section is not a general setoff provision permitting a buyer of goods to adjust its continuing contract obligations according to the equities perceived by the buyer.
amerisourcebergen concedes that the contracts for sale of epogen and the other drugs were separate contracts.but because the vendor agreement signed by dialysist west permits amerisourcebergen to return any goods to dialysist west for full credit,amerisourcebergen believes it was justified in applying the credit it held for the counterfeit epogen purchases against its outstanding debts.amerisourcebergen reading of the vendor agreement is strained the vendor agreement does not indicate that amerisourcebergen can offset one deficient transaction against another transaction.rather,as the district court pointed out,t he plain language of the provision links the allowable credit to the specific returned goods.amerisourcebergen dialysist west,no.phx jws,slip op.at.
the contract clause is not ambiguous,as amerisourcebergen argues.the intention of the parties is clear to create a return policy by which amerisourcebergen can fully recover for returned goods that do not meet its standards.see smith melson,stating that a contract should be read in light of the intentions of the parties as reflected in the language and circumstances of the contract see also echo,whitson,cir holding under illinois law that in applying ucc section,purchase orders can not be setoff against damages buyer sustains as result of breach of related distributorship agreement.
furthermore,amerisourcebergen has provided no evidence that it was the pattern or practice of the parties or industry custom to offset deficiencies in one sales contract by giving discounts or credit on other sales contracts.see mohave valley irrigation drainage dist.norton,cir according to the ucc,to determine whether a contract terms are ambiguous,courts may only consider evidence of course of dealing,trade usage,or course of performance.the district court did not err in holding that amerisourcebergen had no legal right to its epogen claims against its other contractual claims.
amerisourcebergen argues that even if it is not entitled to offset its debt under section of the arizona commercial code,dialysist west insolvency affords it an equitable right of setoff under arizona common law.but amerisourcebergen claim to equitable setoff is preempted by.arizona commercial code provides that principles of law and equity apply unless displaced by the particular provisions of this title.see also john deere first interstate bank.although no arizona court has ruled on whether section preempts a common law claim for setoff,several federal courts have indicated that the corresponding ucc section preempts equitable setoffs.see itv direct,d at carlisle uresco const.materials.as the court convincingly reasoned in carlisle,because the ucc specifically provides for in particular circumstances we must conclude that the code drafters,and the state legislatures that have adopted the code,meant to displace common law.carlisle.at.it is apparent that the arizona legislature intended section to supercede the common law of setoff.the district court did not err in denying amerisourcebergen common law claim for equitable setoff.
denial of leave to amend 
amerisourcebergen appeals the district court decision to deny it leave to amend its reply pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a rule a is very liberal and leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires.see bowles reade,cir.but a district court need not grant leave to amend where the amendment prejudices the opposing party is sought in bad faith produces an undue delay in litigation or is futile.id.at jackson bank of hawaii,cir.
amerisourcebergen filed its leave to amend on august,nearly fifteen months after it first learned that counterfeit procrit was in the marketplace and three months after entering a reply where it conceded that the products for which it had not paid dialysist west,including procrit,were genuine.in the dissent,judge tashima emphasizes the district court filing of a pretrial scheduling order on july,which extended the period for filing a motion to amend from june,to december,and the discovery cutoff date from august,to february,because amerisourcebergen motion for leave to amend was filed before the cutoff date set by the court,judge tashima concludes that the motion was presumptively timely and the district court therefore abused its discretion in denying the motion.dissent at citing halbert city of sherman,cir 
by the dissent reasoning,a district court initially has the discretion to determine whether a motion for leave to amend is prejudicial,made in bad faith,would cause undue delay,or is futile under rule a but once the district court sets a schedule for pretrial motions pursuant to rule b,the court must accept all timely motions filed before the deadline even if such a scheme made a pretrial order changed parties expectations regarding the prospect of litigating new facts and legal is no authority stating that rule b preempts rule a in cases like this one.
federal rule of civil procedure has no effect on the operation of federal rule of civil procedure a principles in this case.in johnson mammoth recreations,cir,we held that rule a did not apply,not because rule is trumped by rule once the district court filed a pretrial scheduling order,but rather because the party in johnson had failed to file his motion to join additional parties within the period of time set in the district court scheduling order.id.at.put simply,the party could not appeal to the liberal amendment procedures afforded by rule his tardy motion had to satisfy the more stringent good cause showing required under rule.in this case,amerisourcebergen filed its motion for leave to amend within the deadline set by the district court.accordingly,as the district court correctly recognized,amerisource bergen motion is subject to the limited constraints placed on motions for leave to amend under rule a 
unlike the district courts in halbert and dcd programs the district court in this case provided sufficient justifying reasons for denying amerisourcebergen leave to amend.in a detailed order on january,the district court held that amerisourcebergen motion to amend its reply and allege that drugs procrit that it had purchased from dialysist west were counterfeit was both untimely and prejudicial to dialysist west 
in assessing timeliness,we do not merely ask whether a motion was filed within the period of time allotted by the district court in a rule scheduling order.rather,in evaluating undue delay,we also inquire whether the moving party knew or should have known the facts and theories raised by the amendment in the original pleading.jackson,at see also sierra club union oil of california,cir,vacated on other grounds by union oil of california sierra club,d.we have held that an eight month delay between the time of obtaining a relevant fact and seeking a leave to amend is unreasonable.see texaco,ponsoldt,cir citing jackson,at.
in this case,fifteen months passed between the time amerisourcebergen first discovered the possibility that the procrit was tainted and its assertion of this theory in the motion for leave to amend.even more detrimental to amerisourcebergen motion for leave to amend,however,is the fact that amerisourcebergen had admitted only three months before that the products for which it had not paid dialysist west,including procrit,were genuine.at the time amerisourcebergen filed its reply in may,it had all the information necessary to raise the affirmative defense it now pursues amerisourcebergen knew about the counterfeit procrit on the pharmaceuticals market,acknowledged that it had purchased procrit from dialysist west during that period,and had previously filed suit because it believed that it had purchased counterfeit drugs from dialysist west.although amerisourcebergen vigorously protests the denial of its motion for leave to amend,it has never provided a satisfactory explanation of why,twelve months into the litigation,it so drastically changed its litigation theory.
even though eight months of discovery remained,requiring the parties to scramble and attempt to ascertain whether the procrit purchased by amerisourcebergen was tainted,would have unfairly imposed potentially high,additional litigation costs on dialysist west that could have easily been avoided had amerisourcebergen pursued its tainted product theory in its original complaint or reply allowing amerisourcebergen to advance different legal theories and require proof of different facts at this stage in the litigation would have prejudiced dialysist west and unfairly delayed dialysist west collection of a judgment worth approximately million.jackson,at see also chodos west publ g,cir upholding district court denial of leave to amend fraud claim where plaintiff had facts prior to first amendment and amendment was both prejudicial and dilatory morongo band of mission indians rose,cir upholding denial of leave to amend on the basis of dilatoriness and prejudice where morongo indians introduced new legal theory well into the litigation.amerisourcebergen motion to amend its reply closely followed dialysist west challenge to amerisourcebergen claim for equitable setoff and motion for final judgment under rule b as well as the addition of seven new parties to the epogen litigation.we will not speculate whether amerisourcebergen sudden change in tactics was gamesmanship or the result of an oversight by counsel,but we do conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying amerisourcebergen motion for leave to amend.
certification of final judgment 
amerisourcebergen also appeals the district court certification of final judgment on dialysist west counterclaim under federal rule of civil procedure b.rule b provides that final entry of judgment should be made on individual claims in multiple claim suits upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay.b.review of a district court certification of a final judgment involves a process.see,d.in the first step,we review the district court entry of judgment de novo and evaluate such factors as the interrelationship of the claims so as to prevent piecemeal appeals.see gregorian izvestia,cir.the second step of review requires an assessment of the equities.we apply the substantial deference standard,reversing the district court only if we find the district court conclusions clearly unreasonable.id.
the district court found that there was no risk of duplicative effort by the courts because any subsequent judgments in this case would not vacate its judgment on dialysist west counterclaim.see,at.holding that proper factors for b review include whether the claims for review were separable from the others and whether the nature of the claims already determined was such that no appellate court would have to decide the same issues more than once.we agree.because dialysist west counterclaim to recover for sales was not legally or factually related to amerisourcebergen epogen claim,no court need revisit this judgment.see,archer,cir.
amerisourcebergen contends that,as a matter of equity,the district court certification of its judgment on dialysist west counterclaim should not be upheld because dialysist west is insolvent.we recognize that insolvency is a factor that should weigh against the final entry of judgment on dialysist west counterclaim.see reiter cooper,d acknowledging that even a threat of insolvency of the party seeking separate judgment is a factor weighing against it.but as the supreme court held in reiter w e can not say that insolvency is an absolute bar to certification.see also shintom am.car tels,cir affirming district court entry of final judgment under b despite the precarious financial condition and potential insolvency of the plaintiff.
in weighing the equities of rule b certification,the district court concluded that certification was warranted because this result aligned with the setoff principles of the ucc helped avoid unreasonable delay and because amerisourcebergen owed dialysist west approximately million.see amerisourcebergen,no.phx jws,slip op.at.these factors are a sufficient basis for certifying final judgment in favor of dialysist west.see schieffelin valley liquors,cir permitting certification where defendant filed counterclaims and plaintiff asserted defenses that were at least plausible bard,med.elecs,stating that court saw no reason why plaintiff should be denied use of substantial funds while awaiting disposition of counterclaims.moreover,the district court decision to favor dialysist west creditors as a matter of equity is not erroneous where amerisourcebergen has not shown that the debt it seeks to setoff is related to dialysist west counterclaim.see newbery,at s etoffs run contrary to fundamental bankruptcy policies such as the equal treatment of creditors and the preservation of a reorganizing debtor assets.
the task of weighing and balancing the contending equities of a case is peculiarly one for the trial judge,at.it is not the appellate court role to reweigh the equities.id.at.the district court conclusions for certifying the judgment were not clearly unreasonable.we decline to vacate the certification of judgment.
denial of stay of enforcement 
federal rule of civil procedure h provides that when a court has entered final judgment,it may upon its discretion,stay enforcement of that judgment until the entering of a subsequent judgment or judgments.h.amerisourcebergen argues that the district court erred in rejecting its h motion by conflating rule b and rule h.while it is true that the district court has discretion to grant a stay when it has already certified final judgment we disagree with amerisourcebergen contention that special circumstances warrant a stay in this case.
amerisourcebergen can not show that failure to provide the stay will cause it to suffer greater harm than dialysist west will face should it be denied this judgment pending resolution of amerisourcebergen outstanding claims.see soo line escanaba lake superior,cir courts regularly require the payment of undisputed debts while the parties litigate their genuine disputes.moreover,allowing amerisourcebergen to obtain a stay of the judgment would effectively sanction its tactics.if it does ultimately succeed on its epogen claim,amerisourcebergen will have avoided paying funds it owes dialysist west and would unjustifiably other creditors.see pereira cogan,in fashioning a stay of enforcement,a court looks to general equitable principles.the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying amerisourcebergen rule h motion 
attorney fees costs of appeal 
dialysist west seeks attorney fees and the costs of appeal under arizona revised statute section a.the statute permits an award of attorney fees to the successful party in any contested action arising out of a contract.a.an award of attorney fees under arizona law is permissive,rather than mandatory.see wagenseller scottsdale mem.the arizona supreme court has held that there are six grounds that must be considered in awarding attorney fees to a successful litigant including 
whether the unsuccessful party claim or defense was meritorious whether the litigation could have been avoided or settled and the successful party efforts were completely superfluous in achieving the result whether assessing fees against the unsuccessful party would cause an extreme hardship whether the successful party prevailed with respect to all of the relief sought whether the legal question presented was novel and whether such claim or defense have previously been adjudicated in this jurisdiction and whether the award would discourage other parties with tenable claims or defenses from litigating or defending legitimate contract issues for fear of incurring liability for substantial amounts of attorney fees.
id.at.neither party directly addresses the wagenseller factors in its briefing,but there is sufficient evidence in the record to conclude that these factors weigh against granting dialysist west attorney fees and costs.first,no evidence has been presented indicating that this case could have been successfully avoided or settled.second,the issues in this appeal raise novel questions of contract law.finally,we do not wish to discourage parties like amerisourcebergen from litigating opaque issues of contract law for fear of being saddled with opposing counsel fees and costs.
while i agree with most of the majority disposition of the issues raised by this appeal,i part company on two issues.i believe that the district court abused its discretion in denying amerisourcebergen motion for leave to amend because the motion was made well before the deadline set by the court for the making of such motions and because dialysist west has shown absolutely no prejudice.i further believe that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to stay the judgment pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure h because it failed to perform an analysis separate from its rule b analysis and failed to give adequate consideration to dialysist west insolvency.for these reasons,i respectfully dissent from parts.and.of the majority opinion,and from the judgment of affirmance.
leave to amend.
federal rule of civil procedure provides that leave to amend shall be freely given when justice so requires.a.absent prejudice,or a strong showing of the other factors,such as undue delay,bad faith,or dilatory motive,there exists a presumption under rule a in favor of granting leave to amend.eminence capital,llc aspeon,cir per curiam see also allwaste,hecht,cir stating that,although the denial of leave to amend after a responsive pleading has been filed is reviewed for an abuse of discretion,we strictly review such denial in light of the strong policy permitting amendment.amendments are to be permitted liberally because,as the supreme court observed many years ago,i f the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief,he ought to be afforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits.foman davis,d.
on january,the district court held the scheduling conference,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,and set the trial date and the deadlines for discovery and dispositive motions.on june,the parties filed a joint motion to extend the dates in the pretrial schedule.the district court granted the motion on july,and accordingly filed an order adjusting the pretrial schedule,based on the joint motion of the parties and on a showing of good cause.this order provided that the last date to file motions to amend was extended from june,to december.the order also extended the discovery cutoff date from august,to february,and for expert discovery from october,to april.the court deleted the reference to the pretrial conference,stating that it would address the final pretrial arrangements at a later date.amerisourcebergen motion for leave to amend was filed on august,than three months before the cutoff date for such motions and almost eight months before discovery was to be completed.
a pretrial order controls the subsequent course of the ction unless modified upon a showing of good cause.bjy,cir quoting zivkovic cal.edison,cir,cert.denied,d see also arsement spinnaker exploration,cir it goes without saying that a order controls the scope and course of trial johnson mammoth recreations,cir the scheduling order control s the subsequent course of the action unless modified by the court.quoting.e alteration in original.
we have often affirmed the denial of leave to amend when the motion was made after the cutoff date for such motions,or when discovery had closed or was about to close.for example,in zivkovic,the motion to amend was filed three months after the deadline established by the court and only five days before discovery was to be completed.we concluded that,under those circumstances,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to amend.zivkovic,at see also,lockheed martin network solutions,cir where the motion to amend was made more than four months after the cutoff date for motions to amend,stating that a need to reopen discovery and therefore delay the proceedings supports a district court finding of prejudice from a delayed motion to amend the complaint solomon am.life cas.ins,cir affirming the denial of leave to amend where the motion was made on the eve of the discovery deadline.
our jurisprudence thus establishes that where a motion to amend the pleadings is made within the time established by the pretrial scheduling order for the making of such motions,the motion is presumptively timely.otherwise,it would be a pointless exercise to establish cutoff dates in a rule scheduling order here,the motion to amend was made more than three months before the motion cutoff date thus,on its face,the motion was timely.halbert city of sherman,cir.moreover,eight months remained before the completion of discovery.
the majority has cited no case in which a motion to amend was made within the deadline set by the district court and yet denied as untimely.indeed,such a case would be difficult to find because common sense and rule dictate that a motion filed well within the scheduling order deadline for the amendment of pleadings is timely on its face.id.
contrary to the majority assertion,taking into account the fact that the motion was presumptively timely does not force the district court to accept all timely motions filed before the deadline.op.at.in fact,the remaining factors,including prejudice and bad faith,remain to be assessed.given the undeniable conclusion that the motion was presumptively timely,it remains for dialysist west to establish prejudice sufficient to overcome the presumption under rule a in favor of granting leave to amend.eminence capital,at.
in dcd programs,leighton,cir,we reversed the district court denial of the plaintiffs motion to file a fourth amended complaint.id.at.we rejected the defendant argument that it would be prejudiced by the delay in naming it to the suit,stating that,g iven that this case is still at the discovery stage with no trial date pending,nor has a pretrial conference been scheduled,there is no evidence that the defendant would be prejudiced by the timing of the proposed amendment.id.at.
the eighth circuit similarly has relied on the fact that trial was nearly three months away in concluding that the district court abused its discretion in denying leave to amend an answer.dennis dillard dep t stores,cir see also halbert,at concluding that the district court erred in denying the facially valid motion to amend,where the motion to amend was made four months before the scheduling order deadline.the court reasoned that,although discovery had closed,the district court had discretion to reopen it for the limited purpose of exploring the additional defense raised by the amendment,noting that an adverse party burden of undertaking discovery,standing alone,does not suffice to warrant denial of a motion to amend a pleading.dennis,at quoting united states ex rel.maritime admin.cont l.bank trust,cir.the court further reasoned that the three months remaining until trial was ample time to conduct any further discovery that may have been required.id.
similar to dcd,the trial date in the instant case had not even been set at the time amerisourcebergen filed its motion to amend.the district court already had found that there was good cause to modify the pretrial schedule,giving the parties six additional months to file motions to amend,to complete discovery,and to file dispositive motions.amerisourcebergen motion was filed less than two months after the court had modified the schedule,and well before the deadline established by the modified schedule.thus,this case falls squarely within the reasoning of dcd,dennis,and halbert.
the majority asserts that this case is distinguishable from dcd and halbert because the district court provided sufficient reasons to justify the denial of the leave to amend.op.at.the district court relied primarily on a finding of prejudice to dialysist west in denying the motion to amend,but the court did not explain how dialysist west would be prejudiced.we have noted that b ald assertions of prejudice can not overcome the strong policy reflected in rule a to facilitate a proper disposition on the merits.hurn ret.fund trust of the plumbing,heating piping,cir quoting conley gibson,d see also eminence capital,at a simple denial of leave to amend without any explanation by the district court is subject to reversal.such a judgment is not an exercise of discretion it is merely abuse of that discretion and inconsistent with the spirit of the federal rules.quoting foman,at.
the majority asserts that the proposed amendment would have imposed potentially high,additional litigation costs on dialysist west.op.at.amerisourcebergen disputes the district court statement that the parties agreed that the proposed amendment would require further discovery even if further discovery were required,however,nearly eight months remained before the discovery cutoff deadline based on the parties own stipulation.given that the parties had agreed on this schedule,it is difficult to understand how dialysist west could have been prejudiced,even if further discovery were required.
the reason the majority gives for the potential additional litigation costs is that amerisourcebergen drastically changed its litigation theory.op.at.yet amerisourcebergen alleged in its proposed amendment that it purchased both epogen and procrit from dialysist west,the two are identical drugs,they are manufactured by the same company,although procrit is marketed by a different company,and both drugs were the subject of announcements regarding counterfeit products.the assertion that the addition of the procrit claim constitutes a drastic change in amerisourcebergen litigation theory is thus not supported by the record.
dialysist west bore the burden of showing that it would be prejudiced by the proposed amendment.see eminence capital,at.dialysist west did not contend,and the district court did not find,that any additional discovery that might have been required could not have been completed within the time remaining before the discovery cutoff date.the need to undertake additional discovery can not be classified as prejudice so long as ample time remains,as it did in this case,to complete that discovery before the discovery cutoff date.see,arthur maersk,cir finding no prejudice where the plaintiff proposed amendment was filed eleven months after the original complaint,reasoning that the defendant had not argued that the delay impaired its ability to defend against the suit or that it was unfairly disadvantaged or deprived of the opportunity to present facts or evidence which it would have offered had the amendment been timely quoting bechtel robinson,cir alterations in original dennis,at stating that the mere fact that an adverse party must undertake discovery does not suffice to warrant denying a motion to amend dcd,at reasoning that,because the case was at the discovery stage,there was no evidence of prejudice.after all,discovery is an ordinary incident and burden of litigation sanctioned by the federal rules of civil procedure.i thus disagree with the majority characterization of the need to conduct discovery as prejudicial.the majority simply misunderstands the meaning of prejudice in this willfully misapplies it.
as in dcd and dennis,i would therefore hold that dialysist west has failed to demonstrate any prejudice from the proposed amendment,let alone prejudice sufficient to overcome the presumption in favor of granting leave to amend.see,adam hawaii,cir concluding that the district court erred by denying the motion to amend where the defendants failed to identify any prejudice they would suffer from the amendment and at this point in the proceedings,there has been no discovery,nor has a trial date been set,overruled on other grounds by green city of tucson,cir en banc silberblatt,harlem pilot block hous.dev.fund,cir reversing the denial of the appellant motion for leave to amend,rejecting the appellee argument that it would suffer undue prejudice because of the extensive discovery that would be required,stating that this was insufficient to overcome the policy in favor of permitting amendment,particularly when trial has not yet commenced and is not likely to do so for some time.
the district court also stated that amerisourcebergen proposed amendment sought to contradict established facts of the case.the majority similarly relies on this reasoning.see op.at.but this is the very nature and purpose of an amendment.a n amended pleading supersedes the original.armstrong davis,cir quoting hal roach studios,richard feiner,cir alteration in the original.thus,although a statement in a complaint may serve as a judicial admission,the admission is no longer binding if the party subsequently amends the pleading.sicor cetus,cir see also,llc trinity,cir when a party has amended a pleading,allegations and statements in earlier pleadings are not considered judicial admissions.james moore et,moore federal practice ed stating that,in the more usual scenario,a court may permit a party amending a pleading to withdraw an admission contained in the original pleading.i therefore disagree with the majority that the district court provided sufficient justifying reasons for denying amerisourcebergen leave to amend.op.at.
finally,the majority asserts that permitting the amendment would have unfairly delayed dialysist west collection of a judgment worth over million.op.at.
there is nothing in the record,however,to support the assertion that final judgment would have been unnecessarily delayed.the pretrial conference date had previously been vacated and no trial date had been set,and there was ample time left before the discovery cutoff date to conduct any necessary discovery.thus,nothing in this record supports the majority assertion of unnecessary delay.
the district court abused its discretion in denying amerisourcebergen timely motion to amend in the absence of any showing of prejudice by dialysist west.
stay of the judgment.
i also believe that the district court abused its discretion in denying amerisourcebergen motion to stay the judgment pursuant to rule h.after directing entry of final judgment pursuant to rule b against amerisourcebergen on dialysist west second claim for relief in its counterclaim,the district court denied amerisourcebergen motion to stay the judgment pursuant to rule h.to support its order,the district court stated only that amerisourcebergen motion was based on dialysist west insolvency,and that it had considered the issue in its prior order and found the argument unpersuasive.but the insolvency analysis under rule h is different from the insolvency analysis under rule b,and the district court did not make that analysis.
this case involved several claims and counterclaims.the district court directed entry of judgment on the pleadings with respect to dialysist west second claim for relief in its counterclaim,related to products.still at issue are amerisourcebergen claims regarding epogen and dialysist west first claim for relief.although the district court ruled against amerisourcebergen on the setoff issue,amerisourcebergen claim regarding the counterfeit epogen remains.amerisourcebergen argued below that enforcement of the judgment should be stayed because of dialysist west insolvency.the district court docket indicates that dialysist west had,in fact,filed for bankruptcy as of may.
in general electric,d,the supreme court examined the district court entry of final judgment under rule b,in favor of,on some of the claims in a suit.the district court entry of judgment was based,in part,on the fact that the litigation on the remaining claims would continue for months,if not years,and on the determination that both litigants were financially sound.the supreme court agreed that,although general electric pending counterclaims created the possibility of a setoff against the amount it owed,was financially sound and would be able to satisfy any judgment on the counterclaims.id.at.the court further stated that,if were under a threat of insolvency,that factor alone would weigh against qualifying because the threat alone would cast doubt on ability to satisfy any counterclaims,if general electric were to prevail.id.at.the court noted that rule h would allow the district court to protect the parties by having the losing party deposit the amount of the judgment with the court,such that valid considerations of economic duress and solvency,which do not affect the juridical considerations involved in a rule b determination,can be provided for without preventing rule b certification.id.at.
the supreme court again cited the threat of insolvency in reiter cooper,d,in which the issue was whether,when a shipper defends against a motor common carrier suit to collect tariff rates with the claim that the tariff rates were unreasonable,the court should proceed immediately to judgment on the carrier complaint without waiting for the interstate commerce commission to rule on the reasonableness issue.id.at.the court concluded that the ordinary rules governing counterclaims applied and stated that,i n the ordinary case,where a carrier is solvent and has promptly initiated suit,the equities favor separate judgment on the principal claim.id.at.the equities to be balanced in a rule b consideration change,however,when the suing carrier is in bankruptcy.id.although insolvency is not an absolute bar to rule b certification,the court reasoned that a district court could protect against the threat of insolvency by entering separate judgment but staying enforcement of the judgment under rule h.id.at.and reiter thus indicate that,although entry of a final judgment under rule b may be proper,the district court should rely on rule h to protect the parties when there are valid considerations of economic duress and solvency,at.see pereira cogan,t he supreme court has suggested that where rule b certification is appropriate,courts can protect all parties against the uncertainties posed by the possibility of a large setoff and by the possibility of the insolvency of a judgment debtor by staying enforcement pursuant to rule h and having the losing party deposit the amount of the judgment with the court quoting bowne of new york city,ambase.
the district court here denied amerisourcebergen motion to stay enforcement of the judgment without any discussion,stating only that it had considered amerisourcebergen argument regarding dialysist west insolvency when it granted dialysist west motion for judgment on the pleadings,and citing its prior order.but the discussion cited by the district court regarding dialysist west alleged threat of insolvency was made in the context of amerisourcebergen argument that it was entitled to equitable setoff because of dialysist west insolvency,which is a completely different question from that raised by the motion under rule h.
amerisourcebergen sought a stay of the enforcement of the judgment because of dialysist west undisputed insolvency and the claims that remained to be resolved.the supreme court references to rule h in and reiter indicate that the instant case presents exactly the type of situation in which a stay of the enforcement of the judgment is appropriate.for example,in a case similar to the instant case that involved multiple claims and counterclaims,the first circuit reasoned that,unlike,the plaintiff would likely be left with no way to collect if it established its claims,because the defendant was insolvent.itv direct,healthy solutions,llc,cir.nonetheless,the court affirmed the district court entry of judgment under rule b because the plaintiff had dismissed its claims,but noted that the plaintiff was not compelled to dismiss its claims against the defendant simply because the district court ruled against it on the b certification,citing rule h.see also,schieffelin valley liquors,cir affirming the entry of final judgment under rule b despite a remaining counterclaim,but noting that enforcement might have been stayed under appropriate conditions under rule h,although the party did not make such a claim navajo tribe of indians united states,holding that,although the plaintiff was entitled to entry of a separate final judgment,payment of the judgment should be stayed pursuant to rule h because the validity of the defendant counterclaim had not yet been determined emi music mktg.avatar records,d,directing the entry of final judgment pursuant to rule b but staying enforcement of the judgment because of the claims and counterclaims that remained to be resolved and the possibility that the judgment might be reduced if the defendant prevailed on its counterclaims.
the majority reasons that staying the judgment would effectively sanction amerisourcebergen tactics because,if it succeeds on its epogen claim,it will have avoided paying funds it owes dialysist west and would unjustifiably other creditors.op.at.
amerisourcebergen can not continue to litigate its epogen claim,however,because dialysist west has filed for bankruptcy and,pursuant to a,the case has been stayed
