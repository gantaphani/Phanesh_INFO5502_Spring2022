mercury insurance group mercury appeals an award of attorney fees and costs following a denial of its special motion to strike a petition and complaint as a strategic lawsuit against public participation slapp mercury was not a named defendant but obtained leave to intervene in the action for the express purpose of filing a special motion to strike.the trial court found mercury special motion to strike was frivolous and awarded petitioners their attorney fees and costs.we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
a.the complaint 
on october,the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights,consumers union of the,southern california leadership conference of greater los angeles and national council of la raza petitioners filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint complaint to invalidate senate bill reg.sess.bill the complaint alleged bill was an invalid and unconstitutional amendment of proposition,the insurance rate reduction and reform act,that was passed by the voters in.petitioners sought to enjoin defendants john garamendi,commissioner of insurance of the state of california insurance commissioner,and the state of california state from implementing or enforcing bill.
among other things,the complaint referred to bill as an legislation.although petitioners named only the insurance commissioner and the state as defendants,the body of the complaint contained several references to mercury.
specifically,the complaint alleged that mercury had previously sponsored a bill senate bill reg.sess.bill that had failed to become law.petitioners further alleged despite public controversy,both over the substance of the bill and the campaign cash that its sponsor,mercury insurance,had spent in the period surrounding its introduction,bill passed both houses of the legislature,only to be vetoed by governor davis.under the heading,another infusion of political contributions from mercury underscoring omitted,the complaint alleged that bill was substantially resurrected by a new bill,bill,that was sponsored by mercury,a major campaign donor to sacramento lawmakers.the complaint alleged that bill was passed by the legislature and signed into law by governor davis after mercury poured approximately into political contributions to lawmakers statewide since the governor veto of bill the year before,and an additional into the governor campaign after he signed bill into law.petitioners alleged mercury had contributed a total of to california lawmakers during this period.petitioners further alleged that mercury had decided to sponsor bill and bill after the insurance commissioner issued a regulation limiting persistency discounts.
on october,petitioners filed a motion for an order directing the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate and set the matter under regular notice for hearing on march.petitioners then made an ex parte application for an order advancing the hearing date before superior court judge dzintra janavs,who was assigned the case 
on october,judge janavs advanced the hearing of petitioners motion for peremptory writ of mandate to november,and established an expedited briefing schedule.
mercury insertion in the action as intervener 
on october,after learning of petitioners complaint,mercury filed a request for special notice,in which it stated it intended to intervene in the action.the following day,petitioners counsel offered to stipulate to mercury intervention so long as mercury did not expand the scope of the issues or delay the briefing and hearing schedule previously set by the court.mercury rejected petitioners offered stipulation,asserting it was unreasonable to expect mercury to file an opposition to petitioners pending motion for writ of mandate in the time available.
mercury then filed two ex parte applications with the trial court an application seeking leave to intervene in the case and an application for an order shortening notice time to bring a special motion to strike under the statute.code civ.mercury proposed to combine its motion with a conventional motion to strike those portions of the complaint mentioning mercury.among other things,mercury claimed it would suffer the immediate harm of not being able to strike unfounded bribery allegations in the complaint if it were not allowed to intervene.
on october,mercury presented its ex parte applications to superior court judge david yaffe because judge janavs was unavailable.judge yaffe denied mercury ex parte application to intervene on the ground that mercury was attempting to enlarge the issues.
as a result,mercury filed a petition for peremptory writ of mandate in this court on november,to set aside judge yaffe order denying mercury leave to intervene.
on november,we issued a notice of intention to grant a peremptory writ of mandate in the first instance.palma industrial fasteners,cal d.in issuing the palma notice,we observed that judge yaffe had two concerns in denying mercury leave to intervene.first,the judge was concerned that the briefing schedule and hearing on petitioners motion for a peremptory writ of mandate would be delayed if mercury was granted leave to intervene.we noted,however,that mercury had not asked judge yaffe to extend any dates and mercury counsel had indicated he was prepared to meet the existing deadline second,judge yaffe was concerned that mercury would try to expand the issues in the case by filing its special motion to strike.we observed,however,that if mercury is entitled to file such a motion,it is improper to deny intervention solely because of a desire to prevent the filing of such a motion.we also noted that mercury counsel had stipulated on the record that mercury would not appeal if its special motion to strike were denied 
accordingly,our palma notice expressed our intention to issue a peremptory writ to require the trial court to vacate its order denying mercury ex parte application for leave to intervene and to thereafter enter a new and different order granting the application.we also ordered the hearing on petitioners motion for a peremptory writ of mandate stayed until either the trial court granted mercury leave to intervene and set a new hearing date and afforded mercury an opportunity to file any pleadings it is entitled to file in response to the complaint before the hearing takes place,or the further order of this court.
in the interim,on october,mercury had filed in the trial court a noticed motion for leave to intervene and a notice of a consolidated special motion to strike and ordinary motion to strike petitioners complaint.mercury combined motion to strike was contingent upon mercury being granted leave to intervene.mercury set both of those motions for hearing on november,but judge janavs had no opportunity to rule on the motions at that time because of our intervening stay order.petitioners informed judge janavs of our action and advised her that,although they did not agree with this court tentative conclusions,they had informed mercury counsel they were willing to stipulate to mercury intervening in the case so as not to delay a hearing and conclusion on the merits.
accordingly,on november,petitioners submitted an ex parte application to judge janavs,asking for an order confirming their stipulation to allow mercury to intervene.petitioners asked judge janavs to reset the briefing and hearing schedule for their petition for peremptory writ of mandate.confirming petitioners stipulation,judge janavs granted mercury leave to intervene and deemed mercury combined special motion to strike and ordinary motion to strike filed as of november.judge janavs deemed all the material allegations of mercury complaint in intervention to be denied by petitioners and the insurance commissioner.
judge janavs set a new briefing schedule and set mercury motion and alternative motion to strike for hearing at the same date and time as petitioners motion for peremptory writ of mandate on the substantive merits of the underlying action 
we thereafter dismissed mercury petition for writ of mandate before us as moot.
mercury special motion to strike and court finding motion frivolous 
after extensive hearings on january and,the trial court granted petitioners motion for peremptory writ of mandate and entered a judgment in favor of petitioners.
the trial court granted mercury ordinary motion to strike the references to mercury from the complaint,finding them irrelevant and immaterial.the court denied,however,mercury motion and found the motion frivolous.
in so ruling,the court adopted the reasoning set forth in its tentative decision.in the tentative decision provided the parties prior to argument,the trial court listed a number of grounds upon which it denied mercury special motion to strike.
first,the court ruled petitioners action was exempt from mercury motion under section,subdivision b,for the reasons stated in petitioners opposition 
the court further ruled that even if section did not exempt the action from an motion,under section,subdivision b,the initial burden is on the defendant to show that a claim arises out of the defendant actions in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.once the defendant makes such a showing,the burden then switches to the plaintiff to establish the probability of success on the merits.navellier sletten cal th,d.the court found mercury failed to carry this burden.
the court additionally ruled that mercury lacked standing to bring an motion petitioners had not sued mercury and the petition did not allege any cause of action against mercury,as required under the plain language of section,subdivision b.the court determined that petitioners claims did not arise from mercury campaign contributions petitioners action did not challenge mercury political contributions but rather the constitutionality of bill.the court noted that a cause of action arguably may have been triggered by protected activity does not entail that it is one arising from that activity.city of cotati cashman cal th,d.
citing navellier sletten,the court further ruled that,even if an motion was appropriate here,petitioners claims more than met the minimal merit standard required for them to proceed with the action.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.
having found no basis for the motion,the court ruled that mercury motion was frivolous under the facts and circumstances.
award of attorney fees and costs 
on january,the court entered an order indicating it would award fees and costs if an appropriate motion was set.a judgment issued on february,that provided petitioners were awarded costs and that a ny requests for attorney fees shall be presented by appropriate motion.
on march,mercury appealed from the judgment and all other separately appealable orders in this action.
petitioners subsequently filed a motion for attorney fees and costs in the total amount of under section,subdivision c petitioners claimed they incurred in opposing mercury special motion to strike and requested that the court apply a multiplier of to this amount.petitioners also requested fees of and costs of in bringing their motion for costs and attorney fees.
mercury opposed petitioners fee motion by suggesting that the court apply a rule of thumb law and motion work should be compensated at the flat rate of per page.mercury argued a second year associate,billing at a current market rate of per hour,should produce two pages per hour and therefore could have produced the response to mercury motion to strike in seven and a half hours,at a maximum cost of.
the trial court provided the parties with a,tentative decision on petitioners claim for attorney fees and costs at the hearing of the fee motion.in its tentative decision,the court found petitioners entitled to an award of in attorney fees and in attorney expenses,or a total of in reasonable attorney fees and costs under section,subdivision c,and section.
the court rejected mercury contention that the fees for the ordinary motion to strike should be segregated from the claimed fees because mercury had chosen to file a combined special motion to strike with an ordinary motion to strike,the court found that petitioners properly filed a combined opposition in response to the combined motion.in any case,the court reasoned,petitioners had stated they included only fees in their motion,and only one page of petitioners opposition had addressed the ordinary motion to strike.the court found petitioners had clearly spent most of their time and efforts defeating the slapp motion,rather than the ordinary motion to strike.
the court rejected mercury rule of thumb method of calculating reasonable attorney fees at the flat rate of per page.the court tentative ruling instead examined the hourly rates charged by each of petitioners attorneys and adjusted them in light of market rates and the individual attorney skill,knowledge and experience.the court also scrutinized the billing entries and hours incurred by each attorney in relation to the product generated,the complexity or novelty of the issues and the tasks performed in relation to the special motion to strike taking these factors into consideration,the court reduced the slapp fees claimed,allocating fees to individual attorneys measured by the attorney reasonable hourly rate multiplied by hours reasonably incurred and concluded the reasonable fees for opposing the slapp motion amounted to.
the court determined an enhancement of such fees was not appropriate,considering the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved,the skill displayed in presenting them,the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys,and the contingent nature of the fee award.see ketchum moses cal th,d.
with respect to petitioners claim for fees incurred in making their fee motion,the court determined that the approximately petitioners sought was clearly excessive.the court indicated it had already ruled that mercury motion was frivolous,and no extensive research or analysis was required to bring the fee motion.based on its review of the work performed,the court reduced petitioners award in connection with the fee motion to 
the court declined to apply any multiplier to the claimed fees,finding petitioners had not made a sufficient showing that application of a multiplier was justified in this case.the court further reduced the claimed attorney costs from to,disallowing costs for airfare,meals and lodging.
after hearing argument,the court adopted its tentative decision as its order.the court cut approximately percent of the hours claimed by petitioners counsel to oppose the motion,while disallowing approximately percent of the hours incurred in litigating the fee motion itself.
mercury timely appealed from the order awarding petitioners attorney fees and costs.
discussion 
on appeal,mercury challenges the trial court award of attorney fees and the finding of frivolity upon which that award was based.
the statute allows a trial court to award attorney fees against a party who,in its discretion,files a frivolous motion to dismiss,subd.c visher city of malibu th,d.section,subdivision c,provides that i f the court finds that a special motion to strike is frivolous or is solely intended to cause unnecessary delay,the court shall award costs and reasonable attorney fees to a plaintiff prevailing on the motion,pursuant to section.the imposition of sanctions for a frivolous motion is therefore mandatory.moore shaw th,d.
a determination of frivolousness requires a finding the motion is totally and completely without merit,subd.b,that is,any reasonable attorney would agree such motion is totally devoid of merit.citation.decker registry,th,d decker.
we review an award for attorney fees and costs for abuse of discretion.visher city of malibu,supra,th at,d tuchscher development enterprises,san diego unified port dist.th,d.t he appropriate test for abuse of discretion is whether the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason.dove audio,rosenfeld,meyer susman th,d,quoting shamblin brattain cal d.
a.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling the motion was frivolous 
mercury contends the order awarding attorney fees should be vacated because the trial court did not set forth the justification for its finding of frivolousness,nor is such a finding supported by the record.we disagree.
the trial court order was sufficient 
attorney fees under section are awarded pursuant to s ection,subd.c.under section,a n order imposing expenses shall be in writing and shall recite in detail the conduct or circumstances justifying the order,subd.c.substantively,section does not replace section.the import of section is that a court must use the procedures and apply the substantive standards of section in deciding whether to award attorney fees under the statute.decker,supra,th at,d.in decker,the appellate court found insufficient an order that declared,without more,that defendant motions were frivolous.decker observed that a court written order should be more informative than a mere recitation of the words of the statute.ibid.the conduct or circumstances justifying the imposition of sanctions may be satisfied by incorporating by reference papers setting forth the conduct,circumstances,and legal arguments underlying the court conclusions.childs painewebber incorporated th,d.
the court here did more than perfunctorily recite that mercury motion was frivolous.the court drafted a tentative decision explaining the court tentative ruling and its reasoning to the parties prior to argument,allowed the parties to argue the issues and then adopted its tentative decision after argument.the tentative decision also incorporated the authorities and argument set forth in petitioners opposition to the motion.
to justify a sanctions award,no more is required than a written factual recital,with reasonable specificity,of the circumstances that led the trial court to find the conduct before it sanctionable under the relevant code section.childs painewebber incorporated,supra,th at,d.in denying mercury motion,the court further incorporated petitioners opposition to the motion,which also was sufficient to set forth the conduct,circumstances,and legal arguments underlying the court conclusions.id.at,d.
there was no reasonable basis for mercury motion 
under navellier sletten,the party bringing the motion must first demonstrate that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity once the moving party makes such a showing,the plaintiff must demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the claim.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.only a cause of action that both arises from protected speech or petitioning and lacks even minimal merit is a slapp subject to the special motion to strike.id.at,d.
as the court determined,the complaint in this case was not a slapp.mercury brought the motion even though the complaint was exempt under the public interest exception of section.mercury also failed to carry its burden of proof of showing petitioners claim arose from mercury actions in furtherance of its right of petition or free speech.further,mercury brought its motion even though petitioners complaint contained no cause of action against mercury and did not challenge mercury campaign contributions,its supposed political speech.moreover,petitioners demonstrated the probability of prevailing on their claim under the standards of navellier.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d.after making these determinations,the court ruled mercury motion frivolous,given the facts and circumstances.
mercury contends that the order awarding attorney fees and costs should be vacated because,even though unsuccessful,mercury special motion to strike was not frivolous.we have reviewed mercury arguments and are satisfied the trial court did not err in finding mercury motion frivolous,as we find that mercury unreasonably and unnecessarily employed the motion to challenge petitioners complaint.visher city of malibu,supra,th at,d.
it was clear this case was brought solely in the public interest or on behalf of the general public and that petitioners otherwise satisfied the requirements of subdivision b of section.mercury claims an action defaming mercury is not brought solely in the public interest.as we discuss,post,the complaint did not defame mercury.in any case,an action that satisfies the conditions set forth in subdivision b does not lose its exemption solely because it might contain extraneous allegations not essential to a cause of action.
mercury contends that,even though no case had held it could bring an motion under section at the time of its motion,no case had held it could not do so.section,effective january,was added by the legislature in.stats,ch.although section was not in effect on november,the date that mercury motion was deemed filed,the legislation had been signed into law on september.petitioners opposition specifically drew mercury attention to the passage of section,showed its applicability to the present action and attached a copy of the statute.there is no doubt that mercury was aware of the new legislation.
mercury could not reasonably believe section did not apply to petitioners complaint.existing law established that section merely provided a procedural screening device for determining whether a plaintiff can show sufficient facts to allow a matter to go to a trier of fact.as such,it was clear section could be invoked to strike a lawsuit filed before the effective date of the statute.robertson rodriguez th,d.the passage of section merely created an exception for certain claims from section application.section imposed no new,additional or different liability based on past conduct,nor deprived a defendant of any substantive defense to an action.brenton metabolife,th,d.section,therefore,like section,was properly characterized as a procedural statute applicable to pending actions.brenton metabolife,at,d see also blanchard directv,th,fn,d.because existing law already characterized section as a procedural statute applicable to cases pending upon its effective date,mercury could not have reasonably believed section would be viewed any differently.by filing its motion in face of newly enacted section,mercury took the very real risk that its motion would be deemed frivolous.
not surprisingly,numerous cases have since applied section provisions to pending cases,including those in which orders already had been entered and on appeal before the statute effective date.northern cal.carpenters regional council warmington hercules assocs.th,d public interest exception applied to motion filed before statute became effective blanchard directv,supra,th at,fn,d public interest exception applied to order entered after effective date,but action did not fall within exception brenton metabolife,supra,th at,d commercial speech exception applied to claim arising from conduct occurring before statute effective date metcalf international,th,d applying commercial speech exception to case already on appeal on effective date physicians com.for responsible medicine tyson foods,th,d same.accordingly,it did not matter that mercury brought its motion before the effective date of section since that statute applied to all cases still pending on that date.a reasonable attorney would not agree the motion had merit in face of section.
we also are not persuaded that the action falls within an exception to the exception contained in subdivision d of section,as mercury claims.mercury states subdivision d expressly exempts certain types of speech from its scope,including dramatic,literary,musical,political or artistic work this is an incomplete quotation of the statute,which exempts any action against any person or entity based upon the creation,dissemination,exhibition,advertisement,or other similar promotion of any dramatic,literary,musical,political,or artistic work,including,but not limited to,a motion picture or television program,or an article published in a newspaper or magazine of general circulation,subd.d,italics added.the statute is limited to lawsuits against a person based upon the creation or promotion of work such as a motion picture or television program,or an article published in a newspaper or magazine of general circulation,work of a kind that might be subject to copyright protection.mercury asserts the protected conduct at issue here is political speech and equates a political contribution to political work.even if such an argument were remotely plausible,we need not address it since there wa
