background 
marina point acre development project site is located on the north shore of big bear lake and the east shore of grout bay in the san bernardino mountains.the property extends from the edge of the trees to the lake.the land area,known as cluster pines,had functioned as a tavern,recreational vehicle park,campground,and licensed commercial marina from the early until.marina point acquired the property in in order to develop a residential condominium project upon it.
after acquiring the property,marina point began securing permits.the united states army corps of engineers corps solicited public comment,and ultimately concluded that the planned development could go forward.the corps stated that the united states fish and wildlife service fws had ultimately determined that the upland portion of the site was not a suitable bald eagle habitat,and that a consultation pursuant to was not required.on september,the corps granted a permit to marina point which authorized it to strengthen the existing shoreline.see.
the permit authorized marina point to dredge the adjacent shoreline and the interior of the existing marina,and to use the dredged material as fill for building pads on the land.
marina point was forbidden,however,from placing at elevations below lake bottom contours,from depositing sand below the ordinary high water mark,and from transferring fill or structures to neighboring wetlands.in order to protect bald eagles seasonal behavioral habits,it was also barred from working during the winter months.besides the permit from the corps,marina point secured permits from the county of san bernardino,the california department of fish and game,and big bear municipal water district.in addition,the california regional water quality control board issued a water discharge requirements order.
work began in may,but marina point permit from the corps expired on september,after several extensions.marina point graded the land area before the permit expired.on october,marina point contractor also used a grader to remove trees on the land.moreover,the corps allowed marina point to proceed with dredging without a permit as long as that did not result in more than incidental fallback of soil within the corps jurisdiction,but the corps disallowed any pushing or pulling of materials along the lake bed.
work resumed at the site in june of and went on until about july,when the corps issued a cease and desist order to marina point.the corps stated reasons for the order were that marina point use of a dragline bucket,rather than a clamshell dredge,caused more than incidental fallback of soil,and that the contractor had been temporarily stockpiling material below the ordinary high water mark.
in september,marina point requested interim approval to resume work.the corps then issued an initial corrective measure order icmo on october,which required marina point to complete specific remedial actions by december.that deadline was extended to december,because of unforeseen difficulties,such as a forest fire in the area.
in the meantime,the center had sent a number of notices of intent to commence a citizen action against marina point the center then filed this action on april.
the district court denied marina point motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the case then proceeded to trial,and on june,the district court issued an opinion in which it determined that marina point had violated the cwa and the esa.its ensuing judgment on august,permanently enjoined marina point from any development on the site without the court prior authorization,directed marina point to follow any remedial orders from the corps,and imposed a statutory penalty upon it.marina point appealed on august.
thereafter,the district court awarded attorney fees to the center as the prevailing party under the cwa and the esa.marina point appealed that ruling on february.
still later,on november,the district court determined that marina point was in contempt and issued various orders as a result.marina point appealed that decision on november.
standard of review 
we review issues of the district court subject matter jurisdiction de novo.see satey jpmorgan chase,cir.we also review de novo the question of whether the center notice under the cwa was adequate.see natural res.def.council sw.marine,cir.
jurisdiction 
at the outset,we must consider whether there was federal jurisdiction over this dispute when the complaint was filed,and whether jurisdiction still remains.for the reasons discussed below,the answer is no.
clean water act.
in general,actions can be brought by private persons and entities for the purpose of enforcing many of the provisions of the cwa.see a.that is usually referred to as the citizen suit provision.however,before an action is commenced,the citizen must give a notice of intent to sue.id.b a.in fact,absent that notice,the action is prohibited.id.
the notice serves important public purposes this kind of litigation is not like a mere private dispute.that is underscored by the fact that the notice must be given not only to the alleged violator but also to the administrator and to the state where the alleged violation occurred the supreme court has explicated the purpose behind the requirement of notice in this kind of litigation.as it has pointed out 
t he legislative history indicates an intent to strike a balance between encouraging citizen enforcement of environmental regulations and avoiding burdening the federal courts with excessive numbers of citizen suits.requiring citizens to comply with the notice and delay requirements serves this congressional goal in two ways.first,notice allows government agencies to take responsibility for enforcing environmental regulations,thus obviating the need for citizen suits second,notice gives the alleged violator an opportunity to bring itself into complete compliance with the act and thus likewise render unnecessary a citizen suit.this policy would be frustrated if citizens could immediately bring suit without involving federal or state enforcement agencies.giving full effect to the words of the statute preserves the compromise struck by congress.
hallstrom tillamook county,d citations omitted.that has special relevance here because,as we will explain further,this case is a perfect example of speedy government enforcement action by the corps which,in large measure,obviated the need for a citizen suit regarding marina point alleged violations.
moreover,the giving of a notice is not simply a desideratum it is a jurisdictional necessity.see waterkeepers cal.ag indus,cir natural res.def.council,at.as the supreme court has put it under a literal reading of the statute,compliance with the notice provision is a mandatory,not optional,condition precedent for suit.hallstrom,at.at.and the literal reading is what controls.when a party does not fulfill that threshold requirement,the district court must dismiss the action as barred by the terms of the statute.id.at.at see also waterkeepers,at.that is to say,the notice is not just an annoying piece of paper intended as a stumbling block for people who want to sue it is purposive in nature and the purpose is to accomplish corrections where needed without the necessity of a citizen action.as the supreme court has said in the similar context of claims for past violations 
it follows logically that the purpose of notice to the alleged violator is to give it an opportunity to bring itself into complete compliance with the act and thus likewise render unnecessary a citizen suit.if we assume,as respondents urge,that citizen suits may target wholly past violations,the requirement of notice to the alleged violator becomes gratuitous.indeed,respondents,in propounding their interpretation of the act,can think of no reason for congress to require such notice other than that it seemed right to inform an alleged violator that it was about to be sued.
gwaltney of smithfield,chesapeake bay,d.here,too,if a citizen suit were brought when correction had already been undertaken at the behest of a governmental agency,the notice would become gratuitous.but,as the court went on to say citizen suits are proper only if the federal,state,and local agencies fail to exercise their enforcement responsibility.id.at.at citation omitted.
we must,therefore,keep those overarching public purposes in mind as we approach the controversy before us.to accomplish them,the notice must be sufficient in itself and,perforce,if the desired change has been properly delineated and has been accomplished,that,too,obviates the need or purpose of a citizen suit.that does not exactly say just what a sufficiently detailed notice might be,but we have guidance in that area also.
we start with the requirements adopted by the epa.those are as follows 
notice regarding an alleged violation of an effluent standard or limitation or of an order with respect thereto,shall include sufficient information to permit the recipient to identify the specific standard,limitation,or order alleged to have been violated,the activity alleged to constitute a violation,the person or persons responsible for the alleged violation,the location of the alleged violation,the date or dates of such violation,and the full name,address,and telephone number of the person giving notice.
a.it is from that specific and clear statement that our later cases have proceeded.
we have sometimes been slightly forgiving to plaintiffs in this area,but even at our most lenient we have never abandoned the requirement that there be a true notice that tells a target precisely what it allegedly did wrong,and when.the target is not required to play a guessing game in that respect.in one case,we determined that where the difficulty was a kind of failure to prepare a plan to avoid specific date of wrongdoing could not be given because there was no specific date.natural res.def.council,at.we chose not to demand the impossible.thus,the notice sufficed.
in two later cases in,we also relaxed to some extent.in one of the cases,the plaintiff notice set forth a series of twelve specific violations on specific dates,but the complaint included numerous other violations within the same time frame.cmty.ass for restoration of the env t henry bosma dairy,cir.the defendant complained about the added dates,but we said that the notice certainly alerted the defendant to what it was doing wrong and the inclusion of specific dates was,under the circumstances,enough to allow an action regarding discharges on other dates at or about the same time and of the same ilk as those listed.id.at.as we put it,b ased on the fact that the violations originated from the same source,were of the same nature,and were easily identifiable,we find that the plaintiffs notice was adequate.id.the other case presented the same kind of issue.there,fourteen dates of alleged wrongdoing were listed in the notice,and the notice also stated that while all dates were not available to the plaintiff,the wrongdoing occurred on each date that ships were loaded at the defendant facility.baykeeper,tosco,cir.we found that the detail was sufficient under the circumstances because from the specifics given,the defendants could readily ascertain the nature of the alleged violations,as well as the likely dates of those violations.id.at.
we followed the same general approach in a later case where the defendant was accused in a detailed letter of improper discharges during each and every rain event of a certain intensity,and the days of that rain event intensity were listed.see waterkeepers,at.we declared that to be sufficient detail.id.at.
on the other hand,when a notice told the defendant that it had committed one specific violation,the defendant was not required to speculate as to all possible attacks that might be added to a citizen suit at a later time.onrc action columbia plywood,cir.we found that the notice was insufficient,except as to timeliness,and that the claim was in error.we then explained b ecause timeliness was the sole challenge raised in the notice,it was reasonable to conclude that no action in response to onrc notice was required.id.also,echoing the supreme court concerns,we went on to state 
had onrc notice specified its other theories,either oregon or the epa might well have decided that those theories had sufficient merit to call for agency action.were we to exercise jurisdiction over such claims when they were not disclosed by the citizen suit notice,we would usurp the right of the applicable governmental agencies to evaluate and act upon the merits of the claims prior to judicial review.
earlier on,when faced with a notice that did not list all of the complaining parties,we declared that for purposes of an action by those not listed,the notice was fatally insufficient.trout mccain foods,cir.we did so despite an assertion by the plaintiffs that the error was technical and we should not be overly strict.id.at.we rejected that notion.id.by the way,the notice in that case also had a deficiency regarding dates,but we did not address that.see id.at.
in short,the requirements set forth in a are not to be looked upon as mere technicalities to be accepted with cold reserve and embraced with velleity.they are to be taken seriously as a means of carrying out important public policies.our deviations from their precise language have been minor.
when those authorities and their principles are used as a yardstick,it is apparent that the notices in this case were not sufficient to support district court jurisdiction.an analysis of the notices will explain why that is so.the first of the notices on june,declared that section of the cwa was being violated by activities that began june,which activities were placing enormous amounts of fill into the lake and were accompanied by grading below the ordinary high water mark.the notice did not mention any claims under of the cwa nor did it give any detail whatsoever regarding just what wetlands were allegedly being affected or how it also gave no other specific dates.the second of the notices,dated july,is of the same ilk.it gives little more detail about the activities regarding the lake itself and no more detail regarding wetlands or.those notices are questionable regarding violations and insufficient regarding wetlands and any claimed violations 
moreover,long before any action was filed and,in fact,before days had gone by,the corps issued its cease and desist order on july,and all activity by marina point regarding the lake stopped as it had to.that,in fact,is reflected in the center third notice,on august,wherein it stated that the activities it complained of occurred each day from june,through july.
the third notice then goes on to claim violations in language even less descriptive than that used in the prior notices.it refers only to piles of material that were causing discharges below the ordinary high water mark of the lake,and declares that the situation could be made worse should it rain.as we see it,that level of generality,again,is not really compatible with the purposes of the notice requirements under the cwa.
but,even if it were sufficient in that regard,here again the corps stepped in to obviate and ameliorate any problems.just slightly over days later and before commencement of this action,the corps issued its october,icmo authorizing and directing marina point to perform and complete a number of corrective measures by december,for the purpose of protecting the lake from the kinds of problems alluded to by the august,notice.it is also notable that although the corps icmo was issued nine days after the days had expired,marina point had applied for permission to undertake that work on september,which was before the days had run.of course,marina point could not have been expected to actually begin correcting perceived problems regarding the lake without obtaining permission from the corps.in short,as weak as it was,the notice had done its job,if,indeed,the job was not being done without the notice.
that leaves the december,notice,which is,if anything,even less informative and helpful than the earlier notices.principally,it asserts that marina point was going forward without the coverage of the icmo because that document said that work was to cease by december.however,the center was in error because,due to problems that had developed,the corps,after consultation with fws,extended the date to december.as it was,the work ceased by december.it is difficult to see what marina point was supposed to do about that portion of the notice.probably nothing.see columbia plywood,at.beyond that,the center indicated that it could not really tell if the work was proceeding pursuant to the terms of the icmo.that,too,was hardly the kind of notice that the cwa contemplates.
in fine,the notices were insufficient at their inception regarding wetlands and possible violations,and to the extent that they were sufficient,if barely so,as to possible violations,their efficacy was limited by prompt corps and marina point action.the district court did not have jurisdiction to hear the cwa action,and it should have dismissed the action at the outset.thus,in this respect the district court judgment must fall for lack of jurisdiction,and must be vacated.
ii.endangered species act 
plaintiffs were also required to give notice before bringing an action under the esa.see g.there is no claim that the notice was not sufficient in that respect,and it does appear to be proper.however,there is a different problem.
the esa allows a citizen suit for the purpose of obtaining injunctive relief only.id.at g a.of course,that is forward looking,and is intended to prevent a defendant from taking an endangered or threatened species.see id.a b.that means that a person may not harass or harm a listed species.see.here,the claim was that marina point activities and planned project would harass bald eagles by disrupting their normal behavioral patterns.see.
the problem is that less than a year after the district court judgment was issued and,of course,while this case was still on appeal,the fws delisted the bald eagle therefore,whatever might have been the case previously,marina point can not violate the esa regarding the bald eagle,regardless of any decision we render here.
as we explained in council of ins.agents brokers,cir citations omitted 
to qualify as a case fit for adjudication,an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review,not merely at the time the complaint is filed.a claim is moot when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.the basic question is whether there exists a present controversy as to which effective relief can be granted.
because the bald eagle has been delisted,no present controversy can remain.
in humane society of the united states kempthorne,the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit was faced with a similar situation.in that case,while litigation regarding protection for the gray wolf was on appeal,the wolf was removed from the endangered species list.id.at.that being so,the parties agreed that the case had necessarily become moot,and the court accepted that agreement.id.the specific reason for that was not explicated but,no doubt,it appeared obvious to all concerned that there was no further work to be served by an injunction.ctr.for biological diversity norton,cir stating that where suit brought to force action regarding a frog,once the frog was listed the case became moot.
the same appears here.now that the bald eagle has been delisted,nothing we decide can properly give the center the relief it sought.if the district court erred,the injunction must fall,but if the district court was correct,the injunction must still fall because no activities by marina point could constitute a take within the meaning of the esa.in fact,in a letter to this court,the center has conceded mootness.
thus,there is no further jurisdiction to proceed,and the district court judgment under the esa must be vacated.
other issues 
attorney fees 
the district court awarded attorney fees to the center and against marina point on both the cwa and the esa claims.
it did not segregate the two.as explained below,segregation is now required because the portion of the award based upon the cwa must fall,while the portion based upon the esa must stand.
the cwa provides for an award of attorney fees to any prevailing or substantially prevailing party when the court deems that to be appropriate.d.as we have already discussed,the district court was without subject matter jurisdiction over the cwa claim.therefore,the award of fees must fall to the extent that it is based upon that claim.
the esa provides for an award of attorney fees whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.g.while that is not the typical prevailing party language,it is apparent that it must be taken to mean and be limited to an award of fees to parties who prevail.see marbled murrelet babbitt,cir see also ruckelshaus sierra club,d in a clean air act case,with the same language as that in the esa,absent some degree of success on the merits an award of attorney fees is not appropriate.here,it could be argued that the center has not prevailed because the judgment of the district court in its favor must be vacated as moot.
however,it can not be gainsaid that until the date of delisting,the judgment of the district court had the effect of giving relief to the center and protecting the bald eagle.in short,the center obtained a substantial and direct benefit from that judgment.it is also plain that mootness alone does not preclude an award of attorneys fees.see richard dep t of developmental servs.of state of,cir.
in addition,the weight of authority strongly indicates that when a matter becomes moot on appeal,the court will not,and can not,review the merits of the underlying dispute for the purpose of determining whether an award of attorney fees was proper.that is to say,although it can consider whether the plaintiff prevailed at all,it can not ask whether the district court underlying decision on the merits was erroneous.see diamond charl
