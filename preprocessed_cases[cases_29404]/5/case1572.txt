this matter arises from a dispute between two attorneys over contingent fees generated from the successful prosecution of a client lawsuit against third parties.rule a of the california rules of professional conduct all further references to rules are to these rules,which this court approved to protect the public and to promote respect and confidence in the legal profession,provides in pertinent part that a member of the state bar shall not divide a fee for legal services with a lawyer who is not a partner of,associate of,or shareholder with the member unless t he client has consented in writing thereto after a full disclosure has been made in writing that a division of fees will be made and the terms of such division here,the plaintiff attorney seeks a division or apportionment of fees despite noncompliance with the rule written client consent requirement.we conclude,based on the uncontroverted record before us,that rule a is binding on plaintiff and precludes him from sharing in the subject fees.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
factual and procedural background 
attorneys arthur chambers and philip kay had separate law practices in san francisco.they had individual office letterheads kay listed his home law office on avenue as his professional address,while chambers listed his office address as sutter street,suite.kay also maintained a separate professional liability insurance policy for his practice.except perhaps as otherwise noted below,chambers and kay did not list each other as employees or partners in any official documents.
in and,kay paid chambers per month to use a conference room in chambers office on sutter street for depositions and client meetings.kay used chambers office telephone service,law library,and postage and copy machines.kay also maintained files and a computer in the office,rented a monthly space in the building parking lot,and was listed as a cotenant on the building directory.chambers assisted kay with his work on a few cases.additionally,chambers staff regularly provided assistance to kay with documents.
in,at kay request,chambers began serving as cocounsel in a sexual harassment action that kay had previously filed on behalf of his client,rena weeks,against martin greenstein and the law firm of baker mckenzie hereafter weeks or the weeks case.chambers responsibilities in the case included maintaining the files,conducting discovery that kay assigned to him,conferring with weeks in the office,and appearing as cocounsel on her behalf at pretrial hearings.both chambers and kay were listed in the weeks case pleadings as plaintiff counsel,at the sutter street office address,and chambers advanced costs and expenses of in the case.chambers,however,continued to work on other cases he had at the time.
during discovery in weeks,a dispute arose between chambers and kay over the disclosure of certain documents and chambers alleged efforts to persuade weeks to settle.on september,kay notified chambers by letter that chambers was removed effective immediately from the weeks case with the client approval.kay letter confirmed that chambers would receive the compensation agreed upon,that is in the event the case was settled before depositions,of the attorney fees called for under my agreement with weeks,which is of the monies recovered thereafter,an increase to of the fees specified under the agreement with weeks and reimbursement of the costs chambers had advanced to date.kay sent a copy of the letter to weeks,but never sought or obtained her written or oral consent to the proposed fee division with chambers.
chambers sent a letter to kay accepting his compensation offer.on september,kay filed a notice of association and disassociation of counsel in weeks,stating that alan exelrod had been associated as counsel of record in place of chambers.
on november,kay wrote to chambers complaining of his malfeasance and violation of fiduciary duties to weeks.kay reiterated that chambers would receive the payment as originally agreed upon of of the attorney fees of recovered in weeks upon submission of his time records.unlike the september letter,this letter did not show a copy to the client.
the weeks case eventually was tried to a jury,resulting in a large award of compensatory and punitive damages for weeks and a significant award of attorney fees.counsel for kay then wrote to chambers informing him that his failure to perform legal services in the weeks case,the wholly improper accounting provided in his attorney fees billing statement,and unforeseen changed circumstances all served as a basis for abrogation of any agreement between them as to a fee division.this letter contained an offer to compensate chambers for his services in weeks in the amount of per hour for the total number of hours specified in his prior billing statement.chambers declined kay offer and proposed mediation of their fee dispute.
the judgment in favor of weeks,including the attorney fee award,was affirmed on appeal in.after that judgment was satisfied and kay obtained his attorney fees,chambers initiated this action alleging one cause of action for breach of contract and one common count.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of kay on grounds that the parties alleged agreement for a division of fees violated rule and therefore was unenforceable and the governing statutes of limitations code civ,barred the common count seeking quantum meruit recovery.the court of appeal reversed the judgment in favor of kay on the quantum meruit claim,but otherwise affirmed the judgment.we granted chambers petition for review.
discussion 
as relevant here,rule provides a a member shall not divide a fee for legal services with a lawyer who is not a partner of,associate of,or shareholder with the member unless the client has consented in writing thereto after a full disclosure has been made in writing that a division of fees will be made and the terms of such division and the total fee charged by all lawyers is not increased solely by reason of the provision for division of fees and is not unconscionable as that term is defined in rule.
both the trial court and the court of appeal below determined that chambers can not prevail on his breach of contract cause of action because it is premised on a agreement that failed to comply with rule.chambers challenges those determinations on the grounds that rule governs fee divisions between attorneys only where pure referral fees are at issue and therefore does not apply here even if rule is not limited in application to pure referral fees,the arrangement here falls within the rule express exemption for fees divided between a member of the state bar and a partner of,associate of,or shareholder with the member and in any event,noncompliance with rule does not render the agreement invalid and unenforceable.additionally,chambers contends that the court of appeal erred in concluding that a quantum meruit award could not be predicated on the apportionment of the contingent fee paid to kay.we shall address these issues in order.
applicability of rule 
the interpretation of rule presents a question of law that is subject to our independent review.margolin shemaria th,d margolin.
as noted,rule states that a member of the state bar shall not divide a fee for legal services with a lawyer who is not a partner of,associate of,or shareholder with the member unless the requirements specified in the rule have been met.rule a,italics added.significantly,the rule does not limit its application to pure referral fees hereafter referral fees,in which one lawyer receives a percentage of a contingent fee for doing nothing more than obtaining the signature of a client upon a retainer agreement while the lawyer to whom the case is referred performs the work.moran harris d.nor does it purport to categorically exempt fee divisions among attorneys who work jointly on behalf of a client.rather,rule language,reasonably read,appears to encompass any division of fees where the attorneys working for the client are not partners or associates of each other,or are not shareholders in the same law firm.
the history of rule supports this construction.rule was preceded by former rule,which in turn was preceded by former rule.before,the rules of professional conduct did not specifically prohibit fee sharing among lawyers.breckler thaler d,fn.that changed in november of,when former rule was adopted.notably,former rule forbade attorneys to divide fees unless the division was in proportion to the services performed or responsibility assumed by each,subd.a,the terms of the division were disclosed to the client,and the client consented to them,subd.a,and the total fee did not clearly exceed reasonable compensation for all legal services rendered,subd.a thus,under former rule,dividing a fee on the basis of a referral was absolutely banned,while dividing a fee between attorneys working jointly for the client was permitted if certain conditions were satisfied.former rule was renumbered as rule and was then revised in to eliminate the ban on referral fees.at the same time,the rule retained the client consent requirement and total fee restrictions for fee divisions.it further specified that disclosure to the client and the client consent must both be in writing the amended version of former rule is very similar to current rule on these points.in sum,this history indicates that the rule governing fee divisions among attorneys,from its inception as former rule in to its current embodiment in rule,was never limited in application to fee divisions involving only referral fees.
our construction also is consistent with formal opinion of the state bar standing committee on professional responsibility and conduct state bar formal opinion,which describes criteria relevant to ascertaining whether a fee division falls within the scope of rule.specifically,state bar formal opinion considers various scenarios in which a principal law office periodically might use an outside lawyer to assist the office clients in specific matters,for example,to meet temporary staffing needs or to provide special expertise not available in the office and needed for work on a specific matter.in analyzing the issue,the opinion assumes that the outside lawyer has no formal relationship with the law office or the client other than working on particular matters,and that neither the law office nor the outside lawyer contemplates a permanent relationship.under such circumstances,the opinion concludes,rule requirements apply if the compensation arrangement between the law office and the outside lawyer involves a direct division of the actual fees the client pays to the law office.for instance,the opinion explains,rule applies if the client pays for a project and the outside lawyer receives percent of that amount.state bar formal opn.here,the undisputed facts parallel the cited example chambers and kay neither had nor contemplated a formal or permanent relationship with each other they merely worked together in a few cases and chambers seeks a percentage of the contingent fee that kay and weeks negotiated as compensation for his legal services in the weeks case.
in sum,the language,the history,and state bar formal opinion all point to the conclusion that rule applies to fee divisions where,as here,work for the client is also divided.
rule exemption for partners and associates 
rule,by its terms,does not restrict the division of fees between a state bar member and a lawyer who is a partner of,associate of,or shareholder with that member.we next consider chambers contention that,although he and kay maintained separate law practices when acting as week cocounsel,their arrangement to divide fees in weeks was not subject to restriction because chambers was kay partner or associate.
chambers first argues that,once he and kay put their names jointly on pleadings in the weeks case,made joint court appearances on weeks behalf,and acted as true in the lawsuit,they functioned as partners within the meaning of rule exemption.he additionally asserts that the agreement between kay and him to work jointly,to contribute to the lawsuit costs,and to defer any compensation for work performed for several years removed their agreed fee division from the ambit of rule.we disagree.although rule does not define the terms partner and associate,the rule language and history indicate these terms are not meant to apply in the circumstances established here.
rule b a defines a l aw f irm as two or more lawyers whose activities constitute the practice of law,and who share its profits,expenses,and liabilities.the record in this case indisputably establishes that although chambers and kay shared certain office space and facilities,with kay paying chambers for their use,the two maintained independent law practices with separate identities,separate addresses of record with the state bar,and separate clients,expenses,and liabilities.thus,even though chambers and kay worked together in weeks and a few other cases,they were not members of the same law firm as defined by the rules of professional conduct.
although the rules omit a definition of the term partner,chambers and kay were not in a partnership and were not each other partner as those terms are commonly understood.the corporations code defines a partnership as an association of two or more persons to carry on as coowners a business for profit under section,predecessor law,or comparable law of another jurisdiction,subd.generally,a partnership connotes in partnership property,with a sharing in the profits and losses of a continuing business.nelson abraham cal d.here,no evidence suggests that chambers and kay acted as of a law firm or law office,or that they contemplated sharing in the profits and losses of a continuing business engaged in the practice of law.
in bank of california connolly d,the court of appeal explained that a joint venture exists where there is an agreement between the parties under which they have a community of interest,that is,a joint interest,in a common business undertaking,an understanding as to the sharing of profits and losses,and a right of joint control.id.at.in comparing joint ventures with partnerships,the court commented that the incidents of both relationships are the same in all essential respects,italics added.here,chambers asserts that the weeks case essentially represented a joint venture in which he and kay agreed to work together,share in the costs,and defer any compensation for work performed for several years in the hopes of splitting profits when the case was concluded.in chambers view,rule partner exemption properly applies because,as joint venturers,he and kay functioned as partners for that single transaction.we disagree.
whereas a partnership ordinarily involves a continuing business for an indefinite or fixed period of time,it is commonly understood that a joint venture is usually formed for a single business transaction or enterprise.see weiner fleischman cal d,bunn lucas,pino lucas d,bunn.but while rule expressly exempts fee divisions between attorneys who are partners,it makes no mention of an exemption for fee divisions between attorneys who are joint venturers.
moreover,even though the law generally pertaining to partnerships may sometimes apply to joint ventures weiner fleischman,supra,cal d at,our sole concern here is the proper interpretation of rule.we conclude that,even assuming chambers correctly characterizes his relationship with kay as a joint venture but see bunn,supra,d at,plaintiff attorneys acquiescence in defendant attorneys power to terminate their services in a client matter appeared inconsistent with the plaintiffs claim that their relationship with the defendants was in the nature of a joint venture,it would be unreasonable to construe the exemption for partners as implying an additional exemption for joint venturers.
as discussed,the language and history of rule make evident that its requirements have always applied to fee divisions where work on the client behalf is divided among attorneys from separate law firms or law offices.but were we to imply a joint venturer exemption,we essentially would stretch the rule exemptions so as to cover situations which were not contemplated by the rule jorgensen taco bell th,d,with the effect that the rule exemptions would appear to swallow the rule itself.indeed,not only would the implied exemption severely limit rule application to fee divisions involving attorneys working jointly,but it would seem to eliminate the rule application to all fee divisions,including those involving referral fees.
we next consider whether chambers was kay associate within the meaning of rule.although rule does not define what it means by the term,the rules of professional conduct elsewhere provide that an associate is an employee or fellow employee who is employed as a lawyer.rule b.
here,the record is undisputed that chambers was never kay salaried employee and that chambers did not expect kay to pay him a salary or other wages as compensation for his work in weeks.on the contrary,all of the evidence shows that the parties agreed chambers would be compensated based solely on a percentage of any contingent fee that weeks paid to kay.the evidence also establishes that chambers advanced costs in the weeks case,reflecting additional conduct inconsistent with his claim to have been kay employee.viewed together,these uncontroverted facts establish a division of fees governed by rule,not an agreement to employ chambers as an associate.state bar formal opn.
while kay may have controlled chambers involvement in the weeks case and supervised his work,it remains undisputed that chambers compensation was linked to the client ultimate payment of a contingent fee.that being the case,kay authority over chambers involvement in the case did not transmute the parties compensation arrangement from one based on a division of fees to one reflecting an relationship.accord,aba com.on ethics,formal opn.if the arrangement between the firm and the temporary lawyer involves a direct division of the actual fee paid by the client,such as percentage division of a contingent fee,then rule e of the american bar association model rules of professional conduct requires the consent of the client and satisfaction of the other requirements of the rule regardless of the degree to which the firm supervised the temporary lawyer.
we recognize that sims charness th,d sims came to a contrary conclusion.in that case,one attorney agreed to share contingency fees in several client matters with a second attorney,who agreed to try the matters.sims found that the requirements of rule did not apply because the attorneys agreement did not involve an arrangement for fees on a pure referral basis and because the first attorney continued to work on the client matters while retaining control over the second attorney involvement,just as he would have in the case of an associate or an employee in his office.sims,supra,th at,d.
we are not persuaded by the sims decision,for it reaches a result that is inconsistent with the very authority on which it purports to rely,state bar formal opinion.sims correctly observes the formal opinion explains that the history behind rule and its predecessor,rule,indicate s that the rule was intended to address concerns related to forwarding or referral fees,typically found in contingency fee situations rule and its predecessors were designed to provide consumer protection by regulating the practice of brokering cases through disclosure to the client and a prohibition on increasing a client fee to compensate the referring lawyer who does not work on the matter.citations.there is nothing in the history of rule that indicates it was targeted at compensation arrangements involving outside lawyers functioning on a particular matter essentially on the same basis as an employee of the law office.sims,supra,th at,d,quoting state bar formal opn,italics added by sims.
but unlike sims,we do not read the foregoing passage as authority for the proposition that rule applies only to pure referral fees.state bar formal opinion correctly finds that a primary aim of the rule and its predecessor is to address concerns related to referral fees,but nowhere does it imply that restriction of referral fees is the rule sole aim or that arrangements involving the division of both work and fees fall outside the rule scope.on the contrary,the opinion specifically addresses the rule application to such arrangements.
in acknowledging that rule does not target compensation of outside lawyers who function essentially on the same basis as an employee or associate of the law office,state bar formal opinion determines no division of fees occurs under rule where the following three criteria are met the amount paid to the outside lawyer is compensation for the work performed and is paid whether or not the law office is paid by the client the amount paid by the attorney to the outside lawyer is neither negotiated nor based on fees which have been paid to the attorney by the client and the outside lawyer has no expectation of receiving a percentage fee.state bar formal opn.but in finding rule inapplicable to the fee agreement before it,sims overlooked the fact that the agreement demonstrated none of these three criteria.to the extent sims relies on the formal opinion to reach its contrary views,then,such reliance was misplaced 
as in sims,the arrangement between chambers and kay meets none of the criteria set forth in state bar formal opinion for determining whether a lawyer functions essentially as an employee chambers and kay did not agree that chambers would be compensated for work performed whether or not the client paid kay chambers compensation was both negotiated and based on fees that the client would pay to kay and under the agreed arrangement,chambers expected to receive a percentage fee.the combination of these undisputed facts leads us to conclude that chambers did not render his professional services in the weeks case essentially as an employee of kay and that he therefore falls outside of rule exemption for associates.
chambers next relies on bunn,supra,d,to urge that if attorneys associating on a case do not stand in the relationship of joint venturers,then one is the employee of the other for purposes of rule associate exemption.in bunn,the plaintiff lawyers contended that they had a joint venture relationship with the defendant attorneys,and that,as joint venturers,they were entitled to share equally in whatever fee the defendant lawyers received under their agreement with the client.bunn rejected this contention and determined that the plaintiffs and the defendants stood in an relationship because,among other things the defendants had hired the plaintiffs to provide legal assistance in a probate litigation,and the plaintiffs accepted employment for the sum of,contingent on the litigation success the defendants remained the client only attorneys of record when a new matter not contemplated by the original employment contract arose,the parties spoke in terms of readjusting the existing fee amount rather than sharing or dividing any fee to be received from the client and the defendants retained authority to fire and did fire the plaintiffs after a dispute arose over the fees due.bunn,supra,d at.
bunn fails to aid chambers position.the finding of an relationship in bunn was due in part to the circumstance that the plaintiff lawyers never expected to share or divide the fee that the defendant attorneys were to receive from the client.see bunn,supra,d at.here,however,the evidence uniformly discloses that chambers agreed to compensation based solely on a percentage of any contingent fee the client paid to key factual difference undermines the attempted analogy to the relationship found in bunn.in any event,bunn long preceded the adoption of rule and its predecessors consequently,its analysis did not address the issues posed here finally,because neither the language nor the history of the rule supports an exemption for fee divisions among joint venturers,bunn discussion of joint ventures does not help chambers.
c.the effect of noncompliance with rule 
the record shows that on september,kay wrote a letter notifying chambers that he was being removed from the weeks case with the client approval.that letter,which noted a cc to the client,also confirmed that chambers would receive the compensation agreed upon,namely,in the event the weeks case settled before depositions,of the attorney fees called for under my agreement with the client,which is of the monies recovered thereafter,an increase to of the fees specified under the agreement with the client and reimbursement of chambers costs.
even assuming,for purposes of argument,that kay letter to chambers raises a triable issue of material fact regarding satisfaction of rule requirement that clients be given full written disclosure of fee divisions,the letter furnishes no basis whatsoever for inferring compliance with the rule written consent requirement.notably,nothing in the record contradicts kay evidence that no one ever sought or obtained weeks oral or written consent to the fee sharing,or suggests that weeks was even aware of her right of consent.hence,we now address chambers contention that he is entitled to a division of fees obtained in the weeks case despite noncompliance with the rule written consent requirement.
rule unambiguously directs that a member of the state bar shall not divide a fee for legal services unless the rule written disclosure and consent requirements and its restrictions on the total fee are met.yet chambers,in effect,seeks the aid of this court in dividing the fees of a client without satisfaction of the rule written consent requirement.we decline such aid.
as rule a explains,the rules of professional responsibility are intended to regulate professional conduct of members of the state bar through discipline.they have been adopted by the board of governors of the state bar of california and approved by the supreme court of california pursuant to business and professions code sections and to protect the public and to promote respect and confidence in the legal profession.these rules together with any standards adopted by the board of governors pursuant to these rules shall be binding upon all members of the state bar.see also bus,general dynamics superior court cal th,d,attorneys are bound at all events not to transgress a handful of professional ethical norms that distinguish their work from that of the nonattorney.
margolin,supra,th,d,a case involving a pure referral fee,explained the purpose of rule notice and consent requirements as follows just as a client has a right to know how his or her attorney fees will be determined,he or she also has a right to know the extent of,and the basis for,the sharing of such fees by attorneys.knowledge of these matters helps assure the client that he or she will not be charged unwarranted fees just so that the attorney who actually provides the client with representation on the legal matter has sufficient compensation to be able to share fees with the referring attorney.disclosure of these matters to the client should be in writing because the client should not be expected to mentally retain such information throughout the pendency of the case.margolin,supra,th at,d.moreover,r equiring the client written consent to fee sharing impresses upon the client the importance of his or her consent,and of the right to reject the fee sharing.ibid.
we agree with this statement of rule purpose.we further conclude that the rule written disclosure and consent requirements remain equally important where,as here,the division of fees accompanies or is prompted by a division of the legal services provided to the client.as part of their professional obligations,attorneys are required to keep a client reasonably informed about significant developments relating to the employment or representation,including promptly complying with reasonable requests for information and copies of significant documents when necessary to keep the client so informed.rule see also bus,subd.m attorneys have a duty to keep clients reasonably informed of significant developments in matters with regard to which the attorney has agreed to provide legal services.a division of fees may reflect each participating attorney responsibilities in a case or fees may be charged for multiple attorney participation in the case without regard to the particular services each attorney performs.such information may affect the client level of confidence in the attorneys and is indispensable to the client ability to make an informed decision regarding whether to accept the fee division and whether to retain or discharge a particular attorney.as in the case of referral fees,requiring the client written consent to fee divisions among participating attorneys impresses on the client the importance of consent and the right to reject a fee division.all in all,chambers fails to persuade us that the protection afforded by the rule written consent requirement is any less necessary or beneficial where,as here,attorneys from separate law firms seek to divide both the work and the fees in a particular matter.
were we to hold that the fee obtained in weeks may be divided as chambers and kay agreed,with no indication that the required client consent was either sought or given,we would,in effect,be both countenancing and contributing to a violation of a rule we formally approved in order to protect the public and to promote respect and confidence in the legal profession.rule a,bus.such a result would be untenable as well as inconsistent with the policy considerations that motivated the adoption of rule.
our decision to affirm the importance of written consent is consistent with scolinos kolts th,d scolinos and margolin,supra,th,d,which denied recovery for breaches of referral fee agreements where there was no compliance with the disclosure and consent requirements of rule and its predecessor,former rule.
in scolinos,supra,th,d,the plaintiff attorney sued the defendant attorneys for breach of their oral agreement to pay a referral fee of percent of any attorney fees the defendants received from the referred client.affirming a summary judgment granted in the defendants favor,scolinos found the record uncontroverted that the referral agreement was not disclosed and lacked the client written consent,as former rule required.scolinos,supra,th at,d.in holding the agreement unenforceable on public policy grounds,scolinos reasoned that i t would be absurd if an attorney were allowed to enforce an unethical fee agreement through court action,even though the attorney potentially is subject to professional discipline for entering into the agreement.id.at,d.
in margolin,supra,th,d,the plaintiff attorneys brought a breach of contract action against the defendant attorney,alleging that he had breached an oral agreement to provide them with percent of the attorney fees received from a referred client.in upholding a directed verdict entered in the defendant favor,margolin reaffirmed the rule that noncompliance with the written disclosure and written consent requirements of rule rendered a agreement unenforceable,even though the defendant there had promised the plaintiffs to facilitate fulfillment of the rule requirements and even had obtained the client oral consent to the subject agreement.margolin,supra,th at,d.in rejecting application of equitable estoppel principles against the defendant,margolin emphasized that the plaintiffs,as attorneys,were presumed to have known that rule requires actual written disclosure and written consent.because the plaintiffs assumed the risk that the defendant would not keep his promise to comply with rule,and because the plaintiffs could have protected themselves by providing the client with the required written disclosure and obtaining her consent,the plaintiffs could establish neither unconscionable injury to themselves nor unjust enrichment of the defendant so as to support application of equitable estoppel.margolin,supra,th at,d.
chambers attempts to distinguish scolinos and margolin on the basis that those decisions involved pure referral fee agreements,while in this case the fee division would be among attorneys who each rendered substantial legal services to the client.chambers also emphasizes that here,kay acknowledged the agreement in a letter sent to chambers and copied to the client.neither of these circumstances justifies a different result.
