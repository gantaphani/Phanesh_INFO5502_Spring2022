the next morning,lopez called karen johnson,a territory manager for exxon mobil exxon.johnson went to the station on september and met with lopez about the incident.johnson also reviewed young personnel file,which reflected a number of verbal and written warnings to young concerning absences,problems with customers,and incidents of insubordination lopez had prepared forms for young termination.johnson did not have authority to terminate employees she contacted exxon human resources department in houston and described the circumstances.the department concluded that termination was proper on grounds of insubordination and neglect of duty,based on young conduct during the early morning hours of september,and provided an endorse code demonstrating that young termination was endorsed by the department.johnson thereupon signed the separation form terminating young employment.
a few months later,young filed a charge with the department of fair employment and housing,alleging she was fired,harassed,and retaliated against by lopez and other exxon employees based on a mental disability.she requested and received a notice,and on february,filed a complaint against exxon and lopez.the complaint alleged causes of action against exxon and lopez for disability discrimination and harassment in violation of the fair employment and housing act feha,et and for intentional infliction of emotional distress,as well as causes of action against exxon for wrongful termination in violation of public policy and violation of labor code section,subdivision c the substance of young complaint was as follows.
as a result of a tumor removed from her brain when she was a child,young suffers from a mental disability visual and audio processing deficiencies manic depression and obsessive compulsive disorder.exxon was not aware of young disability when she was hired in april,but on july,young was given a warning for showing disrespect to lopez when lopez reprimanded her for failing to appear for work without calling.young then advised lopez of her disability,telling lopez that she needed to take medication to avoid becoming manic and to control compulsive behaviors associated with her mental and physical disabilities associated with her childhood brain surgery.
young complaint alleged that shortly after lopez learned of young disabilities,young engaged in a continuous,severe and pervasive campaign of harassing young.this consisted of ignoring young physically obstructing her from moving around in the station work area telling customers,vendors and suppliers that they worked with a and showing up late to work so that young would be required to work longer hours.young reported her behavior to lopez and asked lopez to instruct them to stop the harassing behavior.instead of doing so,lopez retaliated against young by telling her this type of stuff just happens cutting young hours refusing to schedule around young school schedule refusing to allow young to train new employees assigned to the graveyard shift telling other employees that she lopez did not know why young was attending college because young was retarded and telling another exxon mobil manager that she lopez was working with a retard.on september,after young made a number of verbal complaints to lopez,young drafted a handwritten letter about her complaints and gave it to lopez along with from websites discussing the laws on disability discrimination.the ultimate act of retaliation occurred when lopez told young her employment was terminated.young sought general,special and punitive damages,as well as attorney fees.
exxon and lopez moved for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication of each cause of action and of young claim for punitive damages.they asserted there was no evidentiary support for young claims even if young could establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination,exxon had legitimate,reasons for terminating young,and young could not establish those reasons were pretextual.as for young harassment claim,exxon contended most of her allegations lacked evidentiary support,and her conduct was not severe or pervasive enough to constitute disability harassment and,as to her claim against lopez,young admitted in her deposition that lopez herself did not harass her.finally,exxon contended the punitive damages claim failed as a matter of law because the alleged wrongful acts were not committed by officers or managing agents of exxon.
the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment,finding exxon showed legitimate,and reasons for terminating young employment,and young presented no facts showing exxon stated reasons were pretextual 
lopez then filed a motion for attorney fees under government code section,contending that exxon,on behalf of lopez,incurred substantial attorney fees defending young unreasonable,frivolous,and meritless claims against lopez individually.lopez sought in attorney fees,approximately one quarter of the total fees incurred in the action.exxon counsel stated this was a fair and reasonable apportionment,as the harassment wrong targeting lopez made up approximately of the case 
the trial court found that young claims against lopez were unreasonable,frivolous,meritless and vexatious,without foundation and brought in subjective bad faith.however,while the fees claimed to be attributable to lopez defense were reasonable in amount,exxon paid for the defense.the court observed that an award to lopez would actually be an award to exxon,which does not claim young claims against it were frivolous.the trial court concluded this does not seem right,and awarded nominal attorney fees of.
on april,judgment was entered in favor of exxon and lopez in the amount of in attorney fees and in costs.exxon admits the amount of costs shown in the judgment was erroneous,and the judgment should have reflected a total amount of in attorney fees and in costs.young appealed,and exxon and lopez the attorney fee award of.
