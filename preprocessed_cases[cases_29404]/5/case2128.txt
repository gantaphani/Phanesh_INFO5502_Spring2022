facts and procedural history 
plaintiff joyce leamon leamon owned a residence located on lydia lane in modesto,california the property.in or she listed the property for sale with a realtor named joe randy.after the listing expired,her next door neighbors,leonard and corrie krajkiewcz collectively,the krajkiewczes,expressed an interest in purchasing the property.with the help of rick denison denison,a real estate agent and friend of leonard krajkiewcz,a sale contract was drawn up and the krajkiewczes put down a deposit.however,the transaction was not completed because the krajkiewczes were not able to come up with the money.
in late july or early august of,the krajkiewczes again expressed an interest in buying the property.leamon told them she wanted to clear on the sale.the krajkiewczes agreed and asked if denison could represent both sides.leamon agreed to this request.as a result,denison first contacted leamon about the proposed transaction a week or two before september.denison told leamon he would do the paperwork and get everything started.
on september,leamon had a conversation with her daughter,karen herrera herrera,and told herrera that she was selling the property.in that conversation,herrera told leamon that she wanted the property.leamon told herrera that,as her daughter,she came first.herrera told her mother she would come by to discuss it.
by coincidence,on september,joe randy contacted leamon to ask her if she was interested in selling the property.randy testified that leamon told him that she wanted to give or sell the property to her daughter.also on september,denison telephoned leamon to make an appointment to come to her home to have the contract signed.leamon told denison that her daughter wanted the property,she did not intend to sell to the krajkiewczes,and she would not make an appointment.
on september,at around to,denison and the krajkiewczes came to leamon door.leamon told them she did not have an appointment with them.denison then told leamon that a verbal agreement was the same as a written one and if she did not go through with the sale he would lose thousands of dollars and would take her to court.at that point,leamon invited them inside and they went to her kitchen table.also present in the kitchen was leamon husband,shawnda webber and gloria vierra.
during the conversation in the kitchen,the krajkiewczes told leamon more than once that they wanted her to sell them the property,the reasons why they wanted the property,and why she should sell it to them.leamon also testified that during the conversation denison threatened her with litigation several times.during the conversation,leamon told them she wanted to wait for her daughter and tried to reach her daughter by telephone.denison responded that he could not wait because he had a doctor appointment in stockton concerning his cancer.
denison had brought with him documents including a standard form california association of realtors residential purchase agreement and receipt for deposit for use with single family residential property the agreement,as well as a disclosure form regarding a real estate agent representing both seller and buyer.just before she signed the agreement and other papers,leamon left the kitchen because she was crying.her eyes were full of tears and she could not see.she washed her face in the bathroom in an effort to calm down.
when leamon returned to the kitchen,denison showed her where to sign the documents.denison and the krajkiewczes left immediately after the documents were signed.
at trial,leamon was asked if but for the threats of denison that you would be sued would you have signed those documents she responded,no.definitely not.leamon also testified that she believed denison when he told her that she was obligated to sign the documents because she had an oral agreement to convey the property to the krajkiewczes.
on september,after speaking with her daughter and,leamon telephoned her attorney.subsequently,her attorney sent a letter dated september,to denison and the krajkiewczes stating that you are hereby notified that leamon has decided to cancel the sale of her home.the letter mentioned the threats of litigation made to leamon and stated her signature on the agreement was procured under duress.
on december,the krajkiewczes filed a small claims action for breach of contract claiming that leamon owed them in damages.on december,leamon filed a complaint against the krajkiewczes and denison to quiet title in the property and for infliction of emotional distress.leamon also moved to consolidate the small claims action with the quiet title action.the cases were not consolidated because the small claims action was dismissed without prejudice.
on february,counsel for the krajkiewczes sent counsel for leamon a letter requesting mediation of the dispute in accordance with paragraph of the agreement.leamon did not comply with this request.
in april,leamon and herrera filed a verified second amended complaint to quiet title and to obtain a judicial declaration that the agreement was void and of no effect.the relief requested in the second amended complaint did not include a request for attorney fees.
in june,the krajkiewczes filed an answer to the second amended complaint and filed a against leamon and herrera alleging causes of action for breach of contract,specific performance,fraudulent conveyance and intentional inference with economic relationship.the answer by the krajkiewczes requested attorney fees pursuant to contract or statute.in addition,the relief requested in the by the krajkiewczes included a request for attorney fees with respect to the causes of action for breach of contract and specific performance.
in july,leamon and herrera filed an answer to the denying the krajkiewczes were entitled to relief and requested a judgment that would include attorneys fees incurred in defending this matter.
a jury trial was held from monday,december,through friday,december.at the start of trial,the krajkiewczes filed a number of papers,including their motion in limine,which sought to exclude certain documents based on the statute of frauds.the trial court granted this unopposed motion in limine.on december,the jury heard closing arguments,received instructions from the trial court,and retired for deliberations at.at they returned into court with a verdict.in response to question of the special verdict,which asked if they found there was a valid contract between the krajkiewczes and leamon,the jury answered,no.judgment in favor of leamon and herrera was entered on january.
on march,the krajkiewczes filed a motion for new trial asserting denison threats of litigation related to his commission agreement and were not evidence of duress affecting the agreement,counsel for leamon and herrera acted improperly by arguing the jury should end its deliberation for reasons outside the evidence,the jury acted improperly by rendering a verdict without deliberation,the trial court erred by reversing its ruling on motion in limine,changing the special verdict form and asking only the foreperson about perceived irregularities in the deliberations.on march,the motion for new trial was heard and denied by the trial court.the krajkiewczes filed a notice of appeal from the judgment.
after the entry of judgment,leamon and herrera filed a memorandum of costs that included a request for attorney fees in the amount of and supported that request by filing a motion to fix attorney fees.the krajkiewczes filed a motion to tax costs that asserted,among other things,that leamon and herrera never offered mediation prior to filing their complaint and therefore failed to comply with the requirements of the agreement for an award of attorney fees,and herrera was not sued as a on the breach of contract cause of action and therefore was not a prevailing party entitled to attorney fees.
the trial court ruled on the motion to tax costs and disallowed the entire request for attorney fees.leamon brought a motion to reconsider and that motion was denied.leamon filed a notice of appeal challenging the taxing of attorney fees as costs and the denial of the motion to reconsider 
discussion 
the krajkiewczes argue that this matter should be remanded for a new trial because leamon failed to offer any evidence of duress in the formation of the agreement,the reporter transcript of the trial is unreliable and deprives them of their right to appeal,the special verdict is tainted with attorney and juror misconduct,and the trial court committed reversible error by admitting a letter in evidence that purported to cancel the agreement.all of these arguments fail.
attorney fees under the agreement 
an appellate court reviews a determination of the legal basis for an award of attorney fees independently as a question of law.sessions payroll management,noble construction th,d.
w hen a party litigant prevails in an action on a contract by establishing that the contract is invalid,civil code section permits that party recovery of attorney fees whenever the opposing parties would have been entitled to attorney fees under the contract had they prevailed.citations santisas goodin cal th,d.leamon,seeking a literal application of the above quoted language to the facts of this case,argues she is entitled to attorney fees because the krajkiewczes would have been entitled to attorney fees if they had prevailed.accordingly,leamon asserts the trial court ruling taxing attorney fees in the amount of,from her memorandum of costs should be reversed.
in response,the krajkiewczes contend the trial court properly taxed the attorney fees because leamon failed to seek mediation of the dispute and thus failed to satisfy a contractual condition precedent for the recovery of attorney fees.the trial court relied upon johnson siegel th,d,which involved the same standard form residential purchase agreement as was used in this case.
the agreement contains two paragraphs relevant to the issues raised concerning attorney fees.paragraph provides attorney fees in any action,proceeding,or arbitration between buyer and seller arising out of this agreement,the prevailing buyer or seller shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs from the buyer or seller,except as provided in paragraph.
paragraph provides mediation buyer and seller agree to mediate any dispute or claim arising between them out of this agreement,or any resulting transaction,before resorting to arbitration or court action,subject to paragraphs c and d below.mediation fees,if any,shall be divided equally among the parties involved.if any party commences an action based on a dispute or claim to which this paragraph applies,without first attempting to resolve the matter through mediation,then that party shall not be entitled to recover attorney fees,even if they would otherwise be available to that party in any such action.this mediation provision applies whether or not the arbitration provision is initialed.
in johnson siegel,supra,th at pages,d,the sixth district interpreted paragraph of the standard form residential purchase agreement to mean that a purchaser who commenced litigation without seeking mediation was liable for the seller attorney fees after the seller prevailed in the litigation.in analyzing the purchaser claim to attorney fees,the sixth district stated that the purchaser forfeited his right to recover attorney fees by filing the action without seeking mediation.id.at,d.based on this statement,which is obiter dictum,the krajkiewczes contend leamon is precluded from recovering attorney fees.
we have not found,nor have the parties cited,any published decision that addresses whether or not contractual conditions precedent to an award of attorney fees apply to a litigant who prevails by establishing the contract is invalid.thus,as recognized by the trial judge,the question presented is one of first impression 
to resolve this issue,we must consider whether or not there is a conflict between the concept of mutuality of remedy embodied in the provisions of civil code section regarding attorney fee claims under contractual attorney fee provisions see santisas goodin,supra,cal th at,d,and the provision in the agreement that allows a party who commences an action to recover attorney fees only if that party first sought to resolve the dispute through mediation.
we conclude that the enforcement of the condition precedent to the recovery of attorney fees does not conflict with the concept of mutuality of remedy under the facts of this case.
first,mutuality of remedy exists because the krajkiewczes could not have commenced their action in superior court and recovered attorney fees without first seeking mediation.in that sense,the imposition of a condition precedent on the recovery of attorney fees is mutual and reciprocal.to hold otherwise would violate the concept of mutuality of remedy by requiring the party who argues the contract is valid to comply with conditions not imposed on the party who asserts the contract is invalid.
second,requiring a party to mediate the question of the validity of contract does not necessarily mean that party concedes the contract is not voidable.a request for mediation can clearly state the party position that the contract is voidable or invalid and that mediation is sought to preserve a claim for attorney fees 
in addition,the public policy of promoting mediation as a preferable alternative to judicial proceedings is served by requiring the party commencing litigation to seek mediation as a condition precedent to the recovery of attorney fees.in this case,had the parties resorted to mediation,their dispute may have been resolved in a much less expensive and manner.instead,in a dispute that entered the court system as a small claims action for in damages for breach of contract,leamon spent over in attorney fees and,as a result of her victory,avoided an order for specific performance that would have required her to accept in exchange for the property.the economic inefficiency of this result may have been avoided if,prior to judicial proceedings,a disinterested mediator had explained to leamon and the krajkiewczes the costs of litigating the dispute through to a judgment or a final resolution by an appellate court.
accordingly,we determine the trial court did not err in taxing all of the attorney fees requested by leamon as costs.
disposition 
judgment in favor of leamon and herrera is affirmed.the order taxing attorney fees as costs is affirmed.because each party partially prevails,no costs are awarded on the instant appeals.
supplemental opinion upon denial of rehearing 
on march,leamon and herrera hereafter leamon,collectively filed a petition for rehearing.leamon argues this court mistakenly concluded the issue concerning attorney fees was one of first impression and we should modify our decision to avoid a conflict in the interpretation of
