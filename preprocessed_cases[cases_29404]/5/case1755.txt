in,the citizens of the city of east palo alto,adopted by popular vote,the rent stabilization and eviction for good cause ordinance palo alto ord.rso.we are asked here to determine whether the rso permits recovery of attorney fees by a landlord in successful litigation against the city the trial court held that it does and awarded fees to the landlord.we hold that it does not and reverse the award.
factual and procedural background 
in,woodland park management,llc woodland park,which manages residential rental properties subject to the rso,filed a petition for writ of mandate,pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure,alleging city had improperly increased a landlord registration fee due under the rso 
woodland park petition alleged that as of january,the registration fee imposed by city was per unit,but that on june,the board raised the fee to.city failed to send registration fee bills by june,as required by board rule.nonetheless,on june,city refused to accept woodland park payment of per unit.therefore,woodland park alleged that city refused to comply with its ministerial statutory obligations by seeking to impose an unreasonable annual increase and refusing to accept woodland park registrations at the rate on the grounds that a future increase was in the works.
after briefing and a hearing on the merits,the superior court entered an order granting woodland park petition for writ of mandate.the order provided rule mandates the board to send a fee billing or invoice by june.that is a duty t he rso lacks a date for the annual adjustment of the fee,but a reasonable person would expect and assume that it must be before june.a nd since the board did not adjust the registration fee of per unit by june,the court finds that that fee was in effect on june,and should have been accepted by the board.accordingly,the trial court issued a writ of mandate,commanding city to process woodland park registrations at the amount in force on june.
woodland park then filed a motion for attorney fees,relying on section.of the rso city opposed woodland park motion on the ground that section.only authorizes the award of attorney fees in actions between landlords and tenants.the superior court granted woodland park motion and awarded woodland park in attorney fees.city appeals from the order granting attorney fees,arguing that section.does not authorize a landlord to recover its attorney fees from city.we agree with the city.
ii.discussion 
city does not challenge the order granting woodland park petition for writ of mandate and appeals only from the attorney fees order.the reasonableness of the amount awarded is also not at issue.rather,city contends that the trial court erred in construing section.of the rso to allow a prevailing landlord to recover fees in these circumstances.

the primary duty of a court when interpreting a statute is to give effect to the intent of the legislature,so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.to determine intent,courts turn first to the words themselves,giving them their ordinary and generally accepted meaning.citation.if the language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,the court then looks to extrinsic aids,such as the object to be achieved and the evil to be remedied by the statute,the legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citation.ultimately,the court must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and it must avoid an interpretation leading to absurd consequences.citation.in re luke th.if the meaning of the statute remains unclear after examination of both the statute plain language and its legislative history,then we proceed cautiously to apply reason,practicality,and common sense to the language at hand.citation.ailanto properties,city of half moon bay th.
statutory construction of the rso 
section.of the rso has not previously been judicially construed and,accordingly,we begin our inquiry with the language itself section of the rso is entitled remedies and provides 
for violation of rent ceilings or failure to register if a landlord fails to register in accordance with section of this ordinance,or if a landlord demands,accepts,receives or retains any payment in excess of the maximum allowable rent permitted by this ordinance,a tenant may take any take sic any or all of the following actions until compliance is achieved.
a tenant may petition the board for appropriate relief.if the board,after the landlord has proper notice and after a hearing,determines that a landlord had willfully and knowingly failed to register a rental unit covered by this ordinance,the board may authorize the tenant of such rental unit to withhold all or a portion of the rent for the unit until such time as the rental unit is brought into compliance with this ordinance.after a rental unit is brought into compliance,the board shall determine what portion,if any,of the withheld rent is owed to the landlord for the period i sic,which the rental was not incompliance sic.whether or not the board allows such withholdings,no landlord who has failed to comply with the ordinance shall at any time increase rents for a rental unit until such unit is brought into compliance.
a tenant may withhold up to the full amount of his or her periodic rent,which is charged or demanded by the landlord under the provisions of this ordinance.in any action to recover possession based on nonpayment of rent,possession shall not be granted where the tenant has withheld rent in good faith under this section.

ambiguity of the ordinance 
woodland park argues that we need look no further than the express language of section.woodland park contends that the language providing for recovery of fees in any civil proceeding that a landlord or a tenant initiates to enforce right under this ordinance in section.italics added is unambiguous and expressly applies to the petition it filed against city.see code civ,statutorily classified as a special proceeding of a civil nature in re head cal d,the petitioners claim is of such a nature that it might have been presented in a purely civil petition for writ of mandate or action for declaratory relief.it is undisputed that woodland park is both a landlord,as defined under section.d of the rso,and a prevailing party,and woodland park asserts that it successfully vindicated its rights under this ordinance,the rso.when this language is viewed in isolation,it is difficult to quarrel with woodland park argument that section.makes no distinction between proceedings initiated against the city and proceedings initiated against all other parties.woodland park relies on the maxim that w here the words of the statute are clear,courts may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.burden snowden cal th,see also code civ.
the flaw in woodland park argument,however,is that the language of the ordinance is clear and unambiguous only if it is read in isolation,apart from the balance of the rso and apart from the context of section.t he plain meaning rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose or whether such a construction of one provision is consistent with other provisions of the statute.the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.literal construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute.the intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.citations.lungren deukmejian cal d,accord,quarterman kefauver th,statutory language may seem clear in isolation,but may be ambiguous or uncertain in context mason retirement board th,neither statutes nor charter provisions are interpreted in isolation.
when section.is read in the context of section and the rso as a whole,we believe it is susceptible to,and consistent with,a more narrow interpretation than woodland park urges.city argues that section.applies to any civil proceeding between a landlord and a tenant to enforce their respective rights under the rso.
section of the rso is titled remedies.section.a is titled for violation of rent ceilings or failure to register.the text following this title addresses various remedies for these violations violations of rent ceilings,failure to register,including civil proceedings,primarily pursued by tenants against landlords,as well as civil proceedings brought by landlords against tenants.rso.what section explicitly does not address,however,are civil proceedings initiated by either landlords or tenants against the board or city.this context provides a strong indication that it was the intent of voters to limit the recoverability of attorney fees,pursuant to section,to proceedings between landlords and tenants we can not ignore the language of the entirety of section.a,as woodland park suggests,by relying on the principle that,in case of a conflict,specific provisions prevail over general provisions.action apartment,city of santa monica cal th,see also code civ.we see no conflict.accordingly,we conclude that the language of section.is ambiguous and susceptible to both city and woodland park constructions.
interpretation of the ordinance 
to resolve the ambiguity,we look to other indications of voter intent.city interpretation is bolstered by the fact a different section of the rso,section,deals with actions by a landlord against the city,providing a landlord aggrieved by any action or decision of the board may seek judicial review in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.section has no provision for attorney fees to the prevailing party.see also rso,permitting the city to seek injunctive relief.the silence on attorney fees in section is an indication that the electorate did not intend attorney fees to be awarded against city.it is a settled rule of statutory construction that where a statute,with reference to one subject contains a given provision,the omission of such provision from a similar statute concerning a related subject is significant to show that a different legislative intent existed with reference to the different statutes.citation.in re jennings cal th,see gikas zolin cal th,expression of some things in a statute necessarily means the exclusion of other things not expressed.
we are not persuaded by woodland park argument that the voters had no reason to include a provision in section because they had already included one that plainly applies in section.italics omitted.this only begs the section.intended to be a provision,as woodland park argues,independent of the balance of section nor do we agree with the position that section lacks significance because woodland park petition for writ of mandate was initiated under section of the code of civil procedure,and not under the authority of section of the rso.section of the code of civil procedure does not provide for attorney fees,and section.can not be construed without reference to the remainder of the ordinance of which it is part.phelps stostad cal th.
in any event,woodland park interpretation is not more consistent with the rso purpose than that suggested by the city given that the board generally finances its expenses through the collection of registration fees that are paid by landlords and indirectly,in part,by tenants rso.l.the electorate would have had good reason to insulate city from attorney fee awards like the one made here.woodland park itself suggests that the increase in registration fees originally at issue in the underlying writ proceeding was caused by the board mounting legal bills from prior litigation with woodland park see fisher city of berkeley cal d.woodland park does not explain how the purposes of the rso would necessarily be better served if the board were required to pass along,through increased registration fees borne ultimately by tenants as well as landlords,not only its own costs in defending litigation,but also the fees incurred by prevailing landlords 
in fact,we find the interpretation of the ordinance that woodland park urges to be unreasonable,because it would serve no readily apparent purpose.under woodland park interpretation,city would be able to recover its attorney fees if it were the prevailing defendant in a civil action,brought by a landlord,that alleges city violated the rso.city would not be able to recover its attorney fees if it were the prevailing plaintiff in an action alleging that a landlo
