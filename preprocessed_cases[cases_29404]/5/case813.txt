background 
heaton,a man of partial hispanic descent,became a journeyman ironworker in.in,heaton became a member of an ironworkers union.in october of,heaton began working for weitz as a journeyman ironworker.heaton was progressively promoted to foreman,general foreman,and finally superintendent ironworker in january of.weitz vice president,michael novy novy,promoted heaton to the superintendent ironworker level.heaton reported directly to novy.
in march or april of,a union affiliated with the teamsters superintendent,noel huber huber,instructed some of the teamsters to go to heaton,tell him he was a fucking spic,and ask heaton if heaton knew what a s pic was.other workers told heaton they heard huber say,the only thing worse than having his daughter marry a fucking nigger would be to have his daughter marry a fucking s pic like that ed heaton.heaton complained to weitz human resources department,specifically chantry devries devries,about huber comment.devries was weitz personnel benefits manager,had attended training on state and federal laws,and was listed in weitz policies as the contact person for making discrimination complaints.heaton asked that weitz take action to stop the discriminatory behavior,and specifically requested that novy not be informed about the complaint because heaton believed novy and huber were friends outside of work,attended the same church,and novy was very defensive of huber.heaton also told devries he was worried he might be retaliated against,by losing his promotion or his job.
despite heaton request,devries assigned the complaint to novy for investigation.novy told heaton that devries had contacted him about the situation.novy also informed heaton that novy had not known about heaton spanish and italian background.when heaton asked if his racial background mattered,novy did not respond.about a week after heaton made the complaint,novy informed heaton that novy let huber go but hated to do so.novy had determined huber made the racially offensive comments,and offered huber a demotion or early retirement.huber chose early retirement.
a few weeks after huber elected to take early retirement,heaton and brian henecke henecke discussed unloading equipment off trucks at a job site for quaker oats,where henecke was project manager.after some disagreement,they agreed a crew composed of ironworkers and millwrights should unload the trucks the next day.henecke instructed heaton to go to the quaker oats job site the next day.on may,at the quaker oats job site,henecke called heaton a spic during an argument about who was to unload the trucks.
such jurisdictional disputes rarely result in termination.when novy learned of the dispute,without waiting to hear heaton side of the disagreement,novy informed heaton he was terminated because henecke wanted him fired and because heaton was acting like a fucking union steward.heaton had never been in trouble before at weitz.novy already had prepared heaton last two paychecks.when heaton asked if he was being fired due to the huber complaint,novy immediately revoked the termination,retracted the checks,and gave heaton a second chance.novy instead told heaton he would not be allowed to work on projects with henecke until heaton apologized to henecke.heaton apologized and was again assigned to a job with henecke.
heaton started another assignment at the quaker oats plant.without advanced warning to heaton,henecke removed two of heaton workers from his two right hand men.henecke stated he removed these men from the job because they could not pass quaker oats background check.however,the two men had worked at the quaker oats job site previously.after being terminated from this job,one of the men successfully obtained security clearance at a nuclear power plant.the removal of these two crew members caused heaton to fall behind schedule.
after heaton completed the quaker oats job,he was supposed to begin working on a project at general mills.novy reassigned the general mills job to a different superintendent.when heaton asked novy about the general mills job,novy told heaton that novy was demoting heaton to journeyman,or heaton could choose to be laid off.heaton asked why he was being demoted,and novy told heaton,things are catching up to you.heaton elected to be laid off,because the demotion would leave him with significantly fewer job protections.novy required heaton to turn in his company truck,tools and cell phone,even though other superintendents typically retained these items while temporarily laid off.other superintendents continued to work,even as a slower period ensued,even if the assignments were just doing busywork.weitz also keeps superintendents working by having them do odd jobs in its warehouses,such as building shelves or organizing equipment at the weitz warehouse.superintendents did not usually do labor,but when the work was slow at weitz,one superintendent traditionally would be with another superintendent,and the former would do labor rather than supervise,in order to avoid layoff.
heaton again contacted devries in weitz human resources department,informing her of the situation and stating he felt he was being retaliated against by novy because heaton had made the discrimination complaint against huber.devries told heaton she had been informed that heaton had been offered work three or four times,but that heaton had declined the work.heaton told devries this was not true,and rhetorically asked,why did mike novy have me return my truck if this is true devries investigated and was told a superintendent named matt kula kula offered heaton the purported work at the cargill project.heaton denied this,and specifically informed devries,henecke is the project manager for cargill,and matt kula is the superintendent.matt kula has told another employee many times that brian henecke would not let me work at cargill.devries did not investigate this claim.
although heaton had only been offered the demotion to journeyman,devries did not look into the matter further because,in her opinion,it was work,so she did get into what kind of work it was.this ignored the fact that,if a superintendent is laid off at weitz,that employee would normally come back to work after the layoff as a superintendent,and the journeyman position provided little job security,because journeymen were the first to be terminated.after the offer to work as a journeyman,management level positions opened up,but heaton was not offered those positions.finally,even though heaton specifically alleged retaliation from novy,devries assigned novy to investigate the complaint.
at trial,heaton testified,following his termination,he felt inadequate and had no sense of identity,and his reputation in his business was harmed.heaton went to a psychologist and to a family counselor for help,and he began taking antidepressant medication,which he continued to take at the time of trial.heaton eventually found work as a skilled mechanic with another company.

retaliation 
weitz contends the district court erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law on heaton retaliation claim,arguing there was insufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find any causal connection between heaton discrimination complaint and either weitz decision to lay heaton off or not to rehire heaton.in support of its argument,weitz points to sims,cir.sims reiterates the proposition that the passage of time between events does not by itself foreclose a claim of retaliation rather,it weakens the inference of retaliation that arises when a retaliatory act occurs shortly after a complaint,id.at internal alterations and citation omitted.in sims,more than one year passed between the time of the protected activity and the time of the alleged retaliation.id.at.sims provided virtually no other evidence of a causal connection.id.the claim in sims was based upon little more than speculation the adverse employment action was related to the protected activity.
in heaton case,weitz essentially asks us to determine the evidence fails to strongly demonstrate causation.we will not substitute our judgment for that of the jury when sufficient evidence exists for the jury to make a reasonable determination.see wilson,at.weitz argues six months passed between the time of heaton discrimination complaint and the time heaton was laid off.but all was not well during this six month period.only a few weeks after huber was let go,a turf dispute arose between heaton and henecke,who used to work with huber.the district court noted such disputes were common in the industry.even though such disputes were common,novy an admitted friend of huber and his family informed heaton he was being terminated,and handed heaton his last two paychecks.heaton asked if he was being fired because of his discrimination complaint,and novy promptly revoked the termination.novy then demanded heaton apologize to henecke,even though henecke was the one who called heaton a spic during the dispute.later,when heaton was laid off,novy told heaton,things are catching up to you.
finally,weitz had a history of allowing superintendent ironworkers,like heaton,to maintain their titles during slow periods,while performing labor instead of supervision,in order to avoid layoffs.this option was not offered to heaton.a reasonable jury could find,as the district court articulated,there was a pattern of adverse actions against heaton beginning shortly after the time he complained and lasting until the time he was laid off.citing hite vermeer,cir explaining,a pattern of adverse actions that occur just after protected activity can supply the extra quantum of evidence to satisfy the causation requirement.citation omitted.
although the temporal proximity between the protected activity and the alleged retaliatory act must generally be very close,see hite,at,the employee may attempt to shorten the gap between the protected activity and the adverse action by showing that shortly after the employee engaged in the protected activity,the employer took escalating adverse and retaliatory action against the employee.id.citation,alterations,and internal quotation marks omitted.weitz argues some of the pattern actions listed by the district court were not particularly strong.for example,weitz notes there was no evidence henecke ever knew heaton had filed a discrimination complaint.however,a reasonable jury could infer henecke knew,given that henecke managed the job site where huber last worked.more importantly,novy certainly knew of heaton complaint,and it was novy who attempted to fire heaton on the basis of the conflict between henecke and heaton.
weitz claims when henecke removed workers from heaton assignment at quaker oats,thus increasing heaton stress and workload,weitz had to do so based upon the requirements of the contracting company.this may well indicate that particular incident was not retaliatory.but these two workers had worked at quaker oats before without disqualification,and one worker later qualified to work at a nuclear plant.regardless,the remaining evidence is sufficient for a reasonable jury to find heaton ultimate layoff was motivated,at least in part,by the fact heaton had filed the discrimination claim,and weitz otherwise legitimate reasons for the layoff were merely pretextual.
the district court properly denied weitz rule motion,particularly in light of the fact rule motions should only be granted when there is a complete absence of probative facts to support the verdict,see wilson,at cir citation omitted emphasis added,and when the record contains no proof beyond speculation to support the verdict.id.at citation omitted emphasis added.because we must give great deference to the jury verdict,id.at citation omitted,the district court denial of weitz motion for judgment as a matter of law is affirmed.
punitive damages 
weitz next contends the district court erred in submitting punitive damages to the jury and in denying weitz rule motion on punitive damages.a plaintiff is entitled to punitive damages in a retaliation case only if the employer retaliated with malice or with reckless indifference to federally protected rights.see christensen titan distribution,cir.malice or reckless indifference exhibited by employees working in a managerial capacity can be imputed to the employer if they were acting in the scope of their employment.dominic devilbiss air power,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.an employer can not be vicariously liable for discriminatory employment decisions of managerial agents where those decisions are contrary to the employer efforts to comply with title vii.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.
weitz argues it made a good faith effort to respond to the discrimination against heaton.weitz notes it responded quickly to heaton original complaint against huber,forcing huber to take early retirement.indeed,weitz initially responded appropriately to heaton complaint as to huber improper remarks even though weitz initially responded appropriately to heaton complaint,its agents thereafter did not react appropriately.novy and henecke,both members of the management team,directly retaliated against heaton,with henecke calling heaton a spic,and novy attempting to fire heaton for the henecke spic confrontation,and then requiring heaton to apologize to henecke.novy was plainly acting within the scope of his employment when he acted to terminate heaton.
it is insufficient for the employer simply to know it is discriminating against an employee.see chalfant titan distribution,cir.the employer must also know it may be violating federal law.see id.evidence supports novy knew he was violating federal law when he eventually terminated heaton.when novy first attempted to fire heaton,with heaton final paychecks already prepared,novy immediately rescinded the termination when heaton asked if the firing were related to heaton discrimination complaint against huber.novy had worked on weitz human resource issues for twenty years,was assigned to investigate both of heaton discrimination complaints,and was therefore inferentially familiar with federal discrimination laws.
a reasonable jury also could find devries actions undercut weitz defense that novy actions contravened weitz efforts.devries actions are plainly imputed to weitz,and devries was familiar with federal law.devries was weitz personnel benefits manager,having attended training on state and federal laws,and was listed by weitz as the contact person for making discrimination complaints.
a reasonable jury could find weitz response to novy actions failed to demonstrate a effort to comply with title vii.when heaton contacted devries the second time,he described t
