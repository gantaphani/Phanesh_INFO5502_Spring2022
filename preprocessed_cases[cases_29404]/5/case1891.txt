facts and proceedings below 
tenants sued their former landlord,appellant shawn ayromloo.the tenants prevailed on multiple causes of action stemming from appellant wrongful refusal to allow the tenants to return to their apartments after the city of los angeles evacuated them because the building was unsafe.all of the tenants prevailed on their claims for forcible detainer,wrongful eviction,and negligent infliction of emotional distress.the court found appellant had not legally evicted the tenants.the court further found,because other low income tenants had in the meantime moved into the building,the tenants could no longer move back into the units.for this reason,the court concluded monetary damages constituted the tenants only remedy.the court calculated appellant additional profit due to the units at higher rates to the new tenants at.based on appellant additional profits because of the wrongful evictions,the court awarded damages in the amount of per unit.the court also awarded individual damages,as applicable to each tenant,for lost security deposits,emotional distress,and loss of personal property.
four of the tenants who prevailed against appellant on their breach of contract and other claims had written leases and are the respondents in this case these written leases included a contractual provision which allowed for the recovery of attorneys fees to the prevailing party in any civil action in connection with the lease.respondents made a motion for attorneys fees pursuant to their leases with appellant the amount of fees sought was.respondents had already excluded attorneys fees for all work which applied exclusively to other families or units.for example,respondents excluded time spent on interrogatory responses for other families and time spent preparing for trial and for trial time regarding these other families issues.
appellant conceded respondents were entitled to attorneys fees under civil code section but only for fees incurred litigating the contract causes of action.appellant challenged the reasonableness of the requested fees,noting the amount sought was times the superior court guidelines for fee awards in contract cases.moreover,appellant argued respondents could not recover fees counsel incurred in representing the other tenants who did not have written leases containing the attorneys fees clause.
the trial court awarded in attorneys fees to respondents.in evaluating the reasonableness of the fees,the trial court reduced the requested fees to half because the trial court thought counsel knew this was a mildly pro bono type of work and because of the relatively small amount at stake.the court noted the legal work had been performed by the law firm of myers in conjunction with the legal aid foundation of los angeles.the court then reduced this amount by another percent to account for issues,which resulted in a figure of in fees.the court further reduced this figure by another percent to account for legal fees incurred for work done specifically for the other tenants,netting an award of on the other hand,the court noted issues relating to the rent stabilization act and the general issues were the same as to all building tenants.

discussion 
standard of review of an award of attorneys fees.
a trial court order awarding attorneys fees is reviewed using the abuse of discretion standard.citation.in reviewing an award of attorney fees,the amount awarded by the trial court will not be set aside absent an affirmative showing of abuse of discretion in that the award is manifestly excessive in the circumstances.an order of a lower court is presumed to be correct on appeal,and all intendments and presumptions are indulged in favor of its correctness.citations.
we review the attorneys fee award at issue in this case with these standards in mind.
ii.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in the amount of attorneys fees it awarded.
a.the trial court did not err in granting fees which were several times higher than the schedule of suggested fees for contested contract cases in superior court rule and higher than the total damages awarded to respondents.
appellant relies on superior court rule in challenging the reasonableness of the awarded fees,noting the amount awarded was times the superior court guidelines for fee awards in contract cases.
los angeles superior court rule provides its fee guidelines apply when a contract provides for reasonable attorneys fees unless otherwise determined by the court.j udges are free to depart from its provisions whenever the interests of justice require.citations.moreover,t o the extent a local rule conflicts with a state statute,the rule is invalid.citations.t he determination of what constitutes reasonable attorney fees is committed to the discretion of the trial court the trial court makes its determination after consideration of a number of factors,including the nature of the litigation,its difficulty,the amount involved,the skill required in its handling,the skill employed,the attention given,the success or failure,and other circumstances in the case.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding higher fees than allowed for in the guidelines for contested contract cases in los angeles superior court rule.as noted,the rule allows the trial court to exercise its discretion to depart from the rule to award a higher fee award.the unless otherwise determined by the court clause gives the trial court leeway to depart from the guidelines and to award a reasonable fee award when warranted in a particular case.
here,the trial court permissibly departed from the guidelines and based its fee award on the lodestar method of calculating attorneys fees civil code section authorizes the trial court to award reasonable attorneys fees i n any action on a contract,where the contract specifically provides for attorneys fees,which are incurred to enforce that contract.also,civil code section mandates reasonable attorneys fees to be fixed by the court.here,the trial court awarded fees consistent with civil code section.civil code section permitted the trial court to award reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection with the lease at issue in this case.
moreover,appellant contention the trial court abused its discretion because the fee award was higher than the overall damages awarded to respondents is without merit.it is not uncommon to award attorneys fees in an amount higher than the total damages awarded to a plaintiff or plaintiffs in a particular case.appellant cites no authority for the proposition an award of attorneys fees must always be less than the award of damages in a given case,and we are aware of none.
b.the trial court did not err in basing its attorneys fee award on more than solely the breach of contract claims.
appellant contends respondents are only entitled to attorneys fees incurred in litigating the contract cause of action for return of their security deposits.
the attorney fees clause in a contract may be broad enough to cover tort as well as contract causes of action.citations.if a contractual attorney fee provision is phrased broadly enoug
