the three consolidated appeals discussed in this opinion arise from the settlement of a long,arduous trial over the validity of two competing trust instruments of garth conlan.the parties to the dispute are ione conlan,garth widow,and garth three adult children from a previous marriage.the first trust instrument,which ione claims is valid,is an inter vivos trust that garth executed in leaving garth community property interests to ione.the second trust instrument was drafted shortly before garth died in,and left all of his property to his children.
at the conclusion of evidence after days of trial,with the assistance of a settlement judge,the parties reached a settlement of their dispute.however,immediately following the initial agreement,the parties began to disagree about the specific terms of the settlement.
ultimately,following the children motion for judgment,the court ordered the settlement enforced on the terms that ione claims were not agreed to in the initial may,settlement.
the three appeals present the following issues in the first appeal,ione challenges the enforceability of the settlement agreement in the second appeal,ione challenges the trial court order that the trustee,who is one of garth children,is permitted to use trust income to pay attorney fees she has incurred in asserting the children position in the dispute in the first appeal,and any attorney fees and costs incurred in the future as a result of the trustee asserting the children position in the dispute in the initial appeal and in the third appeal,ione asserts that in the event we conclude the settlement agreement is binding,and the judgment should be affirmed,that an independent manager of the largest part of the trust,the castroville ranch,should be appointed.
statement of the case and facts 
appellant is ione conlon ione,widow of garth conlan garth.respondents are garth three adult children from a previous marriage shawn conlan,tye conlan and sholly terry children.
during his life,garth owned a beachfront home in capitola worth approximately million dollars,a ranch in castroville that produced strawberries and other produce worth approximately million dollars,and a ranch in marin that was used for cattle worth approximately million dollars.
at the heart of this dispute is a conflict between the children and ione over garth inter vivos trust that left garth community property share of his real property to ione,and a new trust instrument prepared shortly before garth died that left his real property to the children.
the first trust is a revocable living trust,the principal assets of which were garth interest in the two ranches trust.according to the trust,garth was the trustee during his lifetime,and ione was the successor trustee.this trust provided that upon garth death,all tangible personal property and all real property would pass to ione free of trust.garth subsequently amended the trust on february,revising the definition of disability.on february,ione executed a further amendment to the trust making the trust irrevocable and removing the children as contingent beneficiaries second amendment 
during the time of the amendments of the trust in february,garth was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer,and was told that he had between four days and four months to live.
in april,the children took garth to a different lawyer,robert temmerman,who prepared a new trust instrument for him trust.the trust left all of garth personal and real property to the children.
after garth death on may,ione filed a petition to determine the validity of the trust and to obtain confirmation that she was the successor trustee.ione petition alleged that the trust lacked legal force,because the trust was made irrevocable by the second amendment see,ante.in the alternative,ione asserted that even if the trust was not irrevocable,the trust was not valid because it did not reflect garth intent and was procured through undue influence and duress.
garth daughter,sholly terry sholly filed an alternative petition,asserting the trust was valid,and sought compensatory and punitive damages for fraud,financial elder abuse and breach of fiduciary duty.the petition also alleged that the second amendment to the trust was invalid,because it was unilaterally drafted by ione ione refused to grant garth requests to review documents containing the trust and send documents to sholly that as a result of ione actions,garth retained the services of a different lawyer to draft an amendment to the trust and on april,garth executed the trust.
the children filed two motions for summary adjudication prior to trial.the first sought a determination that the second amendment to the trust was invalid as a matter of law on the ground that it was only signed by ione,who was not authorized under the trust to execute an amendment with garth was acting as trustee.the trial court granted this motion,ruling that the second amendment to the trust was invalid as a matter of law.ione does not challenge this ruling on appeal.
the second motion for summary adjudication filed by the children related to certain of ione affirmative defenses to their petition.
the case proceeded to a court trial,which lasted days.during the course of the trial,the parties met periodically with judge catherine gallagher to conduct settlement discussions.
on friday may,the parties rested their cases,and closing arguments were scheduled for the following monday.that morning,the parties again met with judge gallagher to discuss the possibility of settlement.
at on may,after the parties met with their respective attorneys,judge gallagher stated the terms of what she described as an agreement that i believe both sides have reached.judge gallagher stated first and foremost,everyone is going to cooperate to obtain the most favorable tax benefits that everybody can under the framework of the settlement,and i f i misstate something and mischaracterize it that is incorrect,it is going to be stated most beneficial to taxes.
judge gallagher stated the terms of the settlement as follows 
with respect to the capitola and marin ranch real properties ione would receive capitola the children would receive the marin ranch.
with respect to the castroville ranch real property the castroville property is going to be structured so as to take advantage of taxes so that ione receives the income from it,being structured as a qtip pursuant to irs codes and the remaindermen on the castroville ranch would be the children.
the castroville ranch would be run for seven years by an independent trustee or labeled a manager whatever labeling is appropriate 
ione would pay the children in installments over two years.
all future trustees expenses such as appraisal,trustee course the trustee is going to incur attorney to be paid from the trust.
shawn conlan was to reside on the castroville ranch for as long as ione was alive.
temmerman,counsel for sholly in her capacity as trustee was appointed to draft the settlement,with each side contributing approximately for his fees.
after iterating the terms of the settlement,judge gallagher stated this again is a judicially supervised settlement agreement.it can not be changed once you leave this courtroom.
following the may,hearing,temmerman drafted a new trust instrument the first settlement trust,to which ione expressed numerous objections.temmerman then drafted a new version of the trust instrument the second settlement trust.
steven valdes,an attorney representing the children in their individual capacities,drafted and submitted a proposed settlement agreement the first settlement agreement.the first settlement agreement included a promissory note for ione in the amount she owed under the settlement of,to be secured by trust deeds on eight of ione separate properties.
ione refused to sign the promissory notes and deeds of trust.the children in turn filed a motion to enter judgment on the first settlement agreement and the second settlement trust.before the hearing on the motion,the children withdrew the second settlement trust,and submitted a third instrument the third settlement trust.
in september,judge gallagher heard the children motion to enter judgment,and held that the parties had reached an enforceable agreement on may.judge gallagher also rejected the children first settlement agreement as not accurately reflecting the agreement reached on may.judge gallagher further ordered the parties to come to an agreement on the terms,and in the event they could not,they should file separate proposed settlement documents to the court.
the parties could not agree,and ultimately filed separate forms of settlement agreements and trust instruments.the children submitted a second settlement agreement and the third settlement trust.ione submitted a proposed qualified terminable interest property trust qtip trust,that called for a to manage the castroville ranch for seven years.

ione filed a notice of appeal from the order re application for an independent manager entered on february,on april,appeal.
discussion 
ione brings three appeals related to the underlying litigation involving the dispute she has with the children regarding the validity of various trust instruments.each of the appeals is discussed separately.
the issue in this first appeal is whether the settlement agreement entered into between the parties on may,is enforceable.on the children motion to enter judgment pursuant to the settlement,the trial court held that it was,and entered judgment accordingly.
it should be noted at the outset that we are not persuaded by the children argument that ione is equitably estopped from bringing this appeal,because they detrimentally relied on ione agreement to the settlement.although the children may have expended resources and changed their position in reliance on the settlement as they assert they did,they did not do so in ignorance of the true state of the facts,as is required for the doctrine of equitable estoppel.skulnick roberts express,th,d.the record demonstrates that very shortly after the settlement discussions on may,ione objected to the settlement.therefore,the children were fully aware that ione challenged the settlement,and can not now claim she is equitably estopped from challenging the entry of judgment on the settlement in this appeal 
in ruling on a motion to enter judgment the trial court acts as the trier of fact,determining whether the parties entered into a valid and binding settlement.kohn,th,d.trial judges may consider oral testimony or may determine the motion upon declarations alone.fiore alvord d.when the same judge hears the settlement and the motion to enter judgment on the settlement,he or she may consult his memory.richardson richardson d.the standard of review on appeal is whether substantial evidence exists to support the trial court ruling.fiore alvord,supra,d at.
in her appeal,ione claims the agreement entered on may,did not result in an enforceable settlement agreement,because it did not contain all material terms,and the terms it did contain were too indefinite and left too many material issues in dispute.the five points that ione claims are not sufficiently addressed in the settlement agreement,making it invalid are the management of the castroville ranch the qualification of the trust as a qtip trust the payment of attorney fees for the drafting of the settlement documents the securing of ione fiscal obligations on deeds of trust on her separate properties and the compensation of shawn conlan for services to the castroville ranch.
management of the castroville ranch 
the first point upon which ione asserts the parties did not agree was the management of the castroville ranch.there is no question the parties understood and agreed that sholly would serve as trustee of the ranch.the question is whether she would serve as trustee with an independent manager of the ranch.
the settlement agreement that was reached on may,and placed on the record indicated that the parties contemplated an independent manager of the castroville ranch.
specifically,the colloquy in court was as follows 
the court now,on the castroville ranch,it is going to be run for seven years by an independent trustee or labeled a manager whatever labeling is appropriate with sholly terry to manage the ranch if she so desires in seven years.
counsel for the children your honor,to clarify on that,sholly terry being be the trustee of the trust.sholly terry being the trustee of the trust and the ranch will be run by an independent manager agreed upon by the parties or third party if necessary.
after this statement,ione asked whether the trustee was the third party manager,to which judge gallagher responded no,and that sholly was the trustee and that there would be a of the castroville ranch.
after questions were asked and answered,the court specifically asked ione if she understood the agreement and the agreement was repeated to her.ione stated she understood the agreement and that she would be bound by it.
the judge further stated that there is going to have to be payment of fees to an independent manager of the ranch.
these statements among the court and the parties during settlement discussions on may,clearly indicate that the parties contemplated that sholly would serve as the trustee of the castroville ranch and,that there would be an independent manager of the ranch for seven years.however,the iterations of the proposed settlement agreements that occurred after the discussions on may,demonstrate the lack of agreement by the parties on the material term of the management of the castroville ranch.the first settlement agreement stated 
an independent manager shall be hired to manage the conlan castroville ranch for a period of up to seven years after seven years the trustee will be entitled to personally manage the castroville ranch.
the second settlement trust changed the concept of the independent manager as follows 
d the trustee sholly,and only the trustee,shall have all powers necessary or appropriate to carry out the management of such farming and ranching property 
e in order to assist the trustee in the continued operation of the trust farm and ranch operation the trustee shall employ the services of a manager and the manager shall report to and take direction from no one other than the trustee.if at any time the trustee determines it would be in the best interest of the trust,the trustee shall have the power to terminate the manager employment 
after significant wrangling,judge gallagher ultimately approved the children version of the agreement,stating 
sholly terry shall be the sole trustee of the trust during the first seven years after may,terry will be assisted by a manager of the castroville ranch.
ione asserts the problem with this provision is that the concept of an independent manager of the castroville ranch that was agreed upon during the may,settlement discussions is completely abrogated,substituted by the manager serving at the pleasure of sholly.ione further asserts that this provision demonstrates the parties failed to agree on the material settlement term of the management of the castroville ranch,making the settlement agreement unenforceable.
ii.designation of the trust as a qtip trust 
in addition to her claim that the parties failed to agree on the material term of the independent management of the castroville ranch,ione asserts that a material term of the settlement agreement discussed during the may,session was that the trust would be a qtip trust,and therefore,would be framed in a way that is most beneficial for taxes.
in order to qualify as a qtip trust,the internal revenue code requires that the trust must give the surviving spouse a qualifying income interest for life,b b i ii.a surviving spouse with a qualifying interest is entitled to all the income from the property,b b ii i.in addition,the federal tax regulations require that a surviving spouse be given substantially that degree of beneficial enjoyment of the trust property during her life which the principles of the law of trusts accords a person who is unqualifiedly designated as the life beneficiary of a trust.b f.
the treasury regulations reference to the principles of the law of trusts include the uniform principal and income act the upaia.this act,embodied in the probate code in california,requires that attorney fees from a proceeding to construe the trust to protect the trust or its property,be charged to the principal,subd.a.however,in this case,the trial court adopted the children settlement trust,which specifically abrogates the upaia,and provides for the payment of all of the trustee future expenses,including attorney fees payable from trust income.
ione asserts the trial court adoption of the children settlement trust,including its specific provision abrogating the upaia,resulted in a trust that does not qualify as a qtip trust.this result is contrary to the settlement discussions on may,and is further evidence that the parties failed to agree on material terms of the settlement.
at the may,hearing,judge gallagher stated on record 
first and foremost,everyone is going to cooperate to obtain the most favorable tax benefits that everyone came under the framework of this settlement.if i misstate something and mischaracterize it that is incorrect,it is going to be stated most beneficial to taxes.
the castroville property is going to be structured so as to take advantage of taxes so that ione receives t he income from it.it is structured as a qtip pursuant to irs codes.
however,contrary to the requirements of a qtip trust,judge gallagher in approving the children settlement trust,held that the trust specifically abrogated the provisions of the upaia.specifically,judge gallagher stated 
notwithstanding the california uniform principal and income act,the trustee shall charge trust income with all future expenses of the trustee,including but not limited to the cost of appraisals,reasonable trustee fees and attorney fees for the trustee.
ione asserts the problem with the trial court subsequent designation that the trust abrogated the upaia is that it can no longer be qualified as a qtip trust,subjecting her to substantially more tax liability.specifically,failure to qualify as a qtip trust will result in a federal estate tax rate of percent being applied to the castroville ranch,reducing her income by more than one half,c for decedents dying in.this,she asserts,is not what she agreed to during the may,settlement discussions.
we are not persuaded by the children argument that a qtip trust was not necessary according to the settlement discussions,and that the agreement was only that the parties would attempt to accomplish the best possible tax benefits by creat ing a qtip trust.although the children are correct in their assertion that the settlement agreement does not state that it is contingent upon the creation of a qtip trust,this does not diminish the fact that the parties and the court clearly contemplated the creation of a qtip to maximize the tax benefits to ione.the discussions on the record demonstrate to us that the creation of a qtip was a material term of the agreement,and was not a part of the court approved trust.
iii.enforceability of the settlement to enter judgment 
in evaluating whether the trial court erred in entering judgment in this case,we look to the enforceability of the settlement agreement reached between the parties on may.in particular,we evaluate whether a contract was formed in the settlement agreement.the fact that the context was one of settlement negotiation,however,has no analytical impact on the question of whether an enforceable contract was ever formed.weddington productions,flick th,d weddington.the principles of contract formation are the same in both the settlement and the nonsettlement context.see,et.
viewing the settlement negotiations that occurred on may,in light of a contract analysis,we note that the negotiations did lead to an agreement between the parties on the goals of the settlement.among those goals was that ione would receive the capitola property,the children would receive the marin ranch,and the castroville ranch would be held in trust for the benefit of ione during her lifetime and the children after her death.however,the parties mutual assent to the goals of the settlement in this case is not sufficient to demonstrate the enforceability of the settlement agreement 
here,although the parties agreed to the goals of the settlement,they clearly did not agree to the means of achieving the goals.in this case,the means to achieving the goals were material to the settlement,because they had a significant financial impact on the parties.for example,in regard to the management of the castroville ranch,although the parties clearly agreed to the goal that there would be independent management of the ranch,they did not agree on the means of achieving that goal,specifically,whether there would be an independent trustee or a manager,and what specific duties and the extent of power that person would have.this failure to agree to the material means to achieve the goal of the settlement demonstrates the settlement unenforceability.
here,the parties assenting to the goals of the settlement,without agreeing to the means that were material to the settlement,demonstrates the parties never formed an enforceable contract.the facts clearly show there was no meeting of the minds on material terms,most notably what the meaning of an independent manager of the castroville ranch was,and whether the trust should be qualified as a qtip trust.this lack of
