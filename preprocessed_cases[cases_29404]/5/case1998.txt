here we decide the proper method for determining whether california minimum wage law has been violated under labor code section and how to calculate the waiting time penalties under section 
appellant osmose,appeals from the judgment awarding its former employees,respondents,a total of in unpaid minimum wages,liquidated damages under section,waiting time penalties under section,and attorney fees and costs in the amount of and,respectively.
appellant contends the judgment must be reversed because the trial court failed to use an averaging method in determining whether it violated california minimum wage law erred in finding that it had willfully withheld wages under section and in calculating the waiting time penalties and erred by awarding attorney fees to respondents.
we conclude the court erred in calculating the amount of the waiting time penalties.we reverse and remand for recalculation of those penalties but affirm the judgment in all other respects.
factual and procedural background 
appellant business includes maintaining standing wood utility poles for major utility companies.at various times between november of and november of,respondents were employed as union employees of appellant and members of the local union of the international brotherhood of electrical workers.under the terms of the parties collective bargaining agreement,respondents were paid hourly wages ranging between to,depending on whether they were crew members or foremen.
respondents work in the field included maintaining utility poles in rural or extremely remote locations with difficult terrain.appellant provided its crews with a utility truck which carried the tools,chemicals,and equipment needed to perform the work in the field.typically,appellant required the foremen to designate places to meet in the morning and the crew was required to travel from there in appellant vehicle to the job sites.on other occasions,respondents would meet at appellant maintenance facility to pick up necessary supplies and,in the foremen case,to turn in paperwork or download information.the foremen were responsible for keeping daily records of the work performed in the field,including pole information,production statistics,and hourly timesheets for all crew members.
employee hours were classified as productive or nonproductive,depending on whether the hours were directly related to maintaining the utility poles in the field.appellant employees,including the supervisors,foremen,and crew,were eligible for a bonus if they exceeded production norms.the production norm was a standard determined by appellant regional office and varied depending on the size of the crew,the type of work,and the territory covered.the production norm required percent efficiency percent productive time.
at trial,respondents testified that they were not compensated for a myriad of tasks that primarily fell into the following categories travel time in company vehicles time spent loading equipment and supplies into the company vehicle time spent doing daily and weekly paperwork foremen only and time spent in maintaining the company vehicles foremen only.respondents testified that time spent performing these tasks was considered nonproductive time.
in november of,respondents filed the instant action in state court,electing not to pursue recovery for uncompensated time at their contractual hourly wages under their collective bargaining agreement,but instead alleging that appellant failed to pay minimum wages under section.the complaint was styled as a class action and sought unpaid minimum wages under section,liquidated damages under section,waiting time penalties under section,and damages for an unfair business practice under business and professions code section.included in the minimum wage claim were allegations that appellant did not pay overtime wages.
appellant subsequently removed the action to federal court,asserting that the action arose under section a of the labor management relations act and was preempted.a.to avoid removal,respondents stipulated to amend their complaint to strike all references to unpaid overtime wages and to instead seek only unpaid minimum wages under section.the case was then remanded back to state court.respondents filed an amended complaint and unsuccessfully attempted class certification.following an unsuccessful mediation,the case proceeded to a bench trial on respondents claims for violation of the state minimum wage law,liquidated damages,waiting time penalties under section,and an unfair business practice.
at trial,respondents presented lengthy testimony concerning the hours they worked for which they were not compensated.they testified they were not paid for maintaining the company truck,taking the truck to be serviced and waiting for it,washing it,cleaning it out at the end of the day,discarding trash at the end of the day,repairing tools needed for field work,or for their time driving to and from the job site.they testified that it was not practical to drive their own vehicles to some of the job sites because of the terrain or location of some of the poles on roads,highways,or private property.additionally,they presented passages from appellant foreman manual which required the crew to travel together and conduct work during the drive.among the work performed while riding in the company vehicle were safety meetings,planning the day work,training,and reviewing maps.notwithstanding written employment policies stating that foremen would be paid for driving the company vehicle to and from job sites,the foremen testified they were not paid for their driving time.despite written employment policies stating that employees would not be expected to do any work prior to arriving at a job site or after leaving the job site,respondents testified that they were required to load the trucks with steel and other supplies without compensation both before and after work.generally,appellant pay records showed only hours worked by respondents at the actual sites of the utility poles.
respondents testified that the issue of being compensated for driving time was raised at a company meeting,but district managers declined to pay for it,stating that respondents time started when they reached the first pole in the morning.one of the respondents was demoted after being particularly vocal about his desire to be paid for this nonproductive time.others reported the time on their time sheets but were never paid for it.respondents maintained that supervisors instructed them not to report nonproductive time.they testified that reporting nonproductive time would make it difficult to meet production norms and obtain bonuses.supervisors instructed them to do whatever it took to reach production norms.
in response,appellant produced several witnesses to rebut respondents claims,including similarly situated foremen,a supervisor,an area manager,and a district manager.these individuals were in conflict as to whether employees would be compensated for driving time.area manager john brown testified to a one way commute policy,in which he deemed compensation was appropriate one way for drive time.supervisor james bushta testified the crew would not be paid and that compensable time excluded drive time and stopped upon completion of work at the last pole each day.manager kip hughes testified that employees would be compensated for drive time only if they picked up supplies first.other testimony established that crew and foremen were expected to record the same hours per week,despite written employment policies allowing foremen to be paid for driving time.
in written arguments presented to the court,appellant contended that it had not violated california minimum wage law because respondents were compensated weekly at an amount exceeding the total hours worked multiplied by the applicable minimum wage.in other words,because respondents were paid an hourly wage far in excess of the minimum wage,appellant contended that respondents weekly pay check exceeded the product of the total hours worked paid and unpaid and the minimum wage.appellant argued that their average hourly rate in any given pay period was higher than california minimum wage and,therefore,it had not violated section.appellant noted that this averaging method was consistent with the approach utilized by the federal courts.
respondents contended that they were entitled to minimum wage for each uncompensated hour,plus statutory penalties and interest.respondents relied on an opinion letter of the department of labor standards enforcement dlse dated january.appellant contended the dlse opinion letter was not persuasive authority.
after taking the matter under submission,the trial court issued a decision finding in favor of respondents,ruling that appellant had violated california minimum wage law by not compensating respondents for travel time and for time spent on daily paperwork.the court found that respondents had failed to prove nonpayment for time spent loading and maintaining the company vehicles.the court agreed with appellant that the dlse opinion letter was not controlling,but found its reasoning persuasive as to why,under california law,respondents were entitled to compensation for all hours worked.the court noted that section entitles an employee receiving less than the minimum wage to recover in a civil action the unpaid balance of the full amount of this minimum wage.the court stated 
as noted in the dlse opinion,section is susceptible to two divergent readings that the obligation to pay minimum wages attaches to each and every separate hour worked during the payroll period,and that payment must be made for all such hours on the established payday,or that the obligation to pay minimum wages for the total number of hours worked in the pay period is determined backwards from the date that any payment is due,without considering any hour or part of any hour in isolation.
as noted in the opinion letter,federal courts have consistently followed the latter approach.however,california state law differs dramatically from the federal labor standards act flsa sic fair labor standards act.as asserted in the opinion letter,the combined force of california labor code sections,and require a different result under california law.those statutes clearly prohibit an employer from receiving from the employee,withholding from the employee,or secretly paying to the employee,some amount less than the employee actual agreed wages for work performed by the employee.
because respondents were employed at agreed rates substantially in excess of the minimum wage,employers such as appellant could effectively reduce or withhold a portion of an employee agreed wage through the simple device of requiring work in excess of hours without additional compensation,merely by relying upon those standards set forth in the flsa now relied upon by appellant as succinctly and persuasively advanced in the dlse opinion letter,california labor code sections,and prevent appellant herein from using any part of the wage payments that are required under their cba or other contract for activities that are compensated in an amount that equals or exceeds the minimum wage,as a credit for satisfying minimum wage obligations for those activities that are compensated at less than the minimum wage under the cba or contract.
the court concluded that adopting appellant method of averaging would permit it to extract lengthy work weeks from its employees without paying them for all hours worked,in violation of our state policy of liberally construing california wage and hour provisions for the benefit of employees 
the trial court awarded liquidated damages to respondents under section in an amount equal to the wages owed the court concluded that liquidated damages were appropriate given that appellant knew or should have known that it had an obligation to pay for driving time,the foreman manual provided for such compensation,and the supervisors created a climate that strongly discouraged or disallowed the recording of time for daily paperwork processed by foremen in their evening hours.the court concluded that waiting time penalties under section were also appropriate.
the court rejected respondents claim for damages for an unfair business practice and ordered that judgment be entered in favor of respondents for a total of,representing minimum wages owed,liquidated damages under section,and waiting time penalties under section.
thereafter,respondents moved for an award of attorney fees and costs in the amount of pursuant to section.appellant opposed the motion,arguing that the court should reduce the fees requested to.following a hearing,the court awarded respondents attorney fees and costs in the amount of.
discussion 
violation of california minimum wage law 
appellant contends the judgment must be reversed because the trial court used the wrong method to determine whether it had violated the state minimum wage law under section.appellant agrees that if an employee is compensated at minimum wage,section is violated if the worker is not paid for even a single hour.appellant argues,however,that this same principle should not apply to workers,like respondents,whose hourly rate is negotiated under a collective bargaining agreement and is substantially higher than the minimum wage set by the government.rather,when an employer pays a higher hourly rate,appellant argues it should be entitled to divide the total number of hours worked into the amount the employee was paid to arrive at an average hourly wage and then determine whether the employee compensation complied with the minimum wage law.appellant urges us to adopt the averaging formula utilized by federal courts in assessing minimum wage law violations.
