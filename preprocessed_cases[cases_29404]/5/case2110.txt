the appeal and in this case arise out of a judgment in the amount of plus costs in favor of marie against general star indemnity company general star for breach of an insurance contract but not bad faith.the insurance policy at issue is a dentist professional liability policy issued to david phipps,liability of general star is predicated on the company refusal to defend or indemnify phipps in an action for damages brought by marie against phipps for the sexual misconduct of phipps,and related claims.phipps assigned his rights against general star to marie,who then brought the instant action,which resulted in the judgment from which general star appeals.
we shall conclude that general star breached its duty to defend phipps but that general star never had a duty to indemnify phipps,and,indeed indemnification is barred by insurance code section section consequently,we shall reverse the judgment and remand to the trial court to award marie damages only for the amount of reasonable attorneys fees and costs incurred by phipps in defending marie action.
marie has from the trial court order taxing costs.since our reversal of the judgment includes reversal of the trial court cost award,marie is moot the question of costs must be determined anew on remand.

phipps insurance policy 
general star issued phipps a dentists professional liability policy for the period july,to july,carrying a coverage limit of for each dental incident.the policy insuring agreement provides in part we will pay all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of any claim that is first made against the insured arising out of a dental incident taking place on or after the retroactive date and before the expiration of the policy period in the practice of the profession of dentistry by the insured or by any person for whose acts or omissions the insured is legally responsible.bolding omitted.
the policy defines dental incident in part as any act,error,omission,or mistake in the rendering of or failure to render services in the profession of dentistry by an insured or any person for whose acts or omissions an insured is legally responsible.the policy defines the profession of dentistry in part as services performed in the practice of the profession of dentistry as defined in the business and the professional codes of the state where you practice.bolding omitted.

the events of april,
marie testified under oath in the underlying action,and in related criminal and disciplinary proceedings against phipps,as follows 
she went to phipps office for dental treatment on april.he administered nitrous oxide to her.it made her extremely relaxed,with her muscles and eyelids heavy during the session,her eyes were closed and she did not speak.
during the procedure,marie felt phipps hand go underneath the dental bib to give her breast a sudden squeeze or caress,putting his hand completely over it he squeezed her right breast three times and her left breast once.she did not consent to these touchings and considered them inappropriate.phipps then put his hand under marie shorts and slid it four inches up her right thigh to the panty line.he also put his hand on top of hers as it rested above her pubic area.
according to the testimony of kimberly altenburg fisch,phipps chairside assistant,in deposition in the underlying action and in the disciplinary proceeding against phipps,he asked her to leave the room and bring a tray of instruments to the sterilization room.she turned and saw him with his hand under marie dental bib,making circular motions.when fisch walked back into the room,he jerked his hand away.
later in the procedure,phipps asked fisch to take marie chart to the reception area.as fisch went that way,she asked robin stevens,another chairside assistant,to keep an eye on phipps.according to stevens testimony in deposition and in the disciplinary proceeding,she saw phipps slip his hand under marie dental bib,then move his hand in a circle for about seconds she did not intervene.
the original complaint 
on august,marie filed a complaint for damages against phipps,mark phipps,and robert shorey as individuals and dba family dentists of roseville,a partnership,and doe defendants the complaint stated counts labeled cause s of action of negligence,battery,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and negligent infliction of emotional distress.
marie alleged phipps conduct in touching marie breasts and pubic area was improper,unprofessional and totally void of a legitimate diagnostic motive as to the battery count,phipps acted with the intent to cause a harmful and offensive contact with plaintiff breasts and pubic area in that he put his hands on her breasts several times and rubbed her pubic area with his hand,and sexually offensive contacts with plaintiff directly resulted.marie alleged defendants mark phipps and robert shorey,who knew of phipps past misconduct with female patients,were negligent in evaluating,supervising,and controlling phipps.in addition,marie alleged does through were dental assistants,nurses,technicians employed by the named defendants,but did not state any factual basis for their liability.
general star initial response 
phipps counsel at the time,robert zaro,tendered the complaint to general star,requesting a defense and indemnity.in november,general star replied that it would not indemnify phipps,but would defend him under a reservation of rights,specifically including the right to withdraw coverage in its entirety pending the results of discovery and the pending criminal proceeding.its letter states in part our investigation indicates that the claim of marie involves improper and unacceptable,sic physical contact of a sexual nature by phipps during a dental exam conducted in his office.we have also determined that your client admitted to the board of dental examiners that this did,in fact,occur.
on april,marie made a settlement offer to general star under code of civil procedure section section for an amount within the policy limits.general star declined the offer.
the criminal proceedings 
in december a criminal complaint was filed against phipps in placer county superior court alleging attempted sexual battery by restraint,a felony penal code,subd.a,and misdemeanor sexual battery,subd.d see fn,ante as to marie y.the complaint also alleged misdemeanor sexual battery as to patient 
the case went to trial in.marie testified there as indicated above.
on november,phipps entered a plea of nolo contendere to two counts of misdemeanor sexual battery.he served days in placer county jail as a result of his plea.
the dental board proceedings 
after the chairside assistants told robert shorey what they had seen,shorey reported phipps conduct to the dental board on april.in june,the dental board began new disciplinary proceedings against phipps.
administrative law judge alj keith levy heard the matter in a contested proceeding beginning in december.phipps and the dental board were represented by counsel witnesses testified under oath.
marie,fisch,and stevens testified as indicated above.a psychologist retained by phipps counsel testified that phipps admitted he felt marie breast and experienced some arousal although he knew he should not have done it,he saw himself as a pleaser who wanted to please marie in a bizarre way,and it made him feel good that he could make patients feel good sexually.dental board investigators lynn thornton and gayle betzing testified that during an interview in may,phipps admitted touching marie breast with the intent to please her and without any therapeutic purpose he felt guilty and remorseful afterward.phipps also admitted to the investigators that he had inappropriately touched other patients between june,when his probation ended,and april.
alj levy issued a proposed decision on may,which included an order revoking phipps license.on june,the dental board adopted the proposed decision,effective july.the decision included the following material findings of fact and law 
on april,female patient went to respondent office for a dental appointment.it was her fourth visit to respondent office and since she had always been very nervous previously,respondent decided to administer nitrous oxide to.this caused muscles to feel heavy and she was relaxed.she was conscious and aware of what was going on in the treatment room and what respondent was doing to her.while under the influence of nitrous oxide and when the dental assistant was requested by respondent to take some instruments to the sterilization room,respondent placed his hand under bib and squeezed her right breast three times and her left breast once.respondent also attempted to put his hand up the patient shorts and touched pubic area over her clothes.
the board found that phipps committed acts of sexual abuse,and sexual misconduct toward marie on april,while she was under the influence of nitrous oxide but conscious and aware of what was going on in the treatment room and what phipps was doing to her.these acts were also crimes of which he had been convicted on a plea of nolo contendere,and which are substantially related to the qualifications,functions or duties of a dentist,as defined in title,california code of regulations section,by evidencing present or potential unfitness of a dentist to perform the functions authorized by his certificate in a manner consistent with the public health,safety or welfare.furthermore,phipps had admitted to dental board investigators that he touched other patients inappropriately between the end of his probation and the marie incident.although he had been undergoing treatment for a psychiatric disorder,there was no evidence that the treatment would guarantee his good behavior in the future.the seriousness of his misconduct and his record of discipline,combined with the lack of a consistent successful treatment record and the substantial potential risk to the public,required his license to be revoked.bus,subd.e.
general star withdrawal of defense to marie suit 
on march,after phipps nolo plea,but before the dental board decision,general star withdrew its defense.general star letter to attorney zaro reads in part in its reservation of rights letter,general star stated that coverage would be withdrawn if phipps was guilty of a criminal act,including sexual contact or other activities which do not qualify as a dental incident associated with the profession of dentistry.general star has discovered that phipps has pled nolo contendere to a sexual battery charge.this plea has the similar legal effect as pleading guilty.sexual battery does not meet the definition of dental incident nor the definition of profession of dentistry.likewise,the claims made by marie in her civil action do not meet the definition of dental incident nor the definition of profession of dentistry.
based upon the above,it is clear the criminal acts of phipps are not covered by the general star policy.bolding omitted.
attorney zaro wrote to general star in april,seeking reinstatement of its defense.zaro asserted phipps nolo plea did not bar coverage,and marie complaint alleged negligence,which triggered coverage.
on april,blaise curet,general star outside coverage counsel,replied that both the insuring agreement defining dental incident and profession of dentistry and the policy exclusion h excluding liability for damages arising out of a dental incident which is also a willful violation of a statute imposing criminal penalties barred coverage.curet rejected coverage for negligence on the ground that only gary,who was not phipps patient,had alleged negligence.
the first amended complaint 
on or about june,after the dental board had adopted the alj proposed decision in the disciplinary proceeding against phipps,marie filed a first amended complaint.it stated c ause s of a ction for negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of nondelegable duty,battery,intentional infliction of emotional distress,negligent infliction of emotional distress,fraud and deceit,and j oint e conomic e nterprise.
as to negligence,the amended complaint made some new allegations.it alleged phipps partners failure to protect his patients,given the partners knowledge of his past misconduct,made defendants,and each of them,vicariously liable under the unique facts of this case.it alleged phipps administering nitrous oxide to marie was done in part for therapeutic motive and his touchings of marie were partially without legitimate therapeutic motive.italics added.it also alleged a chairside assistant,kimberly altenberg sic,who was an agent and employee of fdr family dentists of roseville,observed phipps sexually touching marie during the course of dental treatment,and did nothing to stop him nor did she immediately report the incident or seek aid from defendant shorey,who was present in another operatory of the same office,in order to safeguard the plaintiff.however,it did not name her as a defendant.nor did the later second amended complaint.finally,it alleged defendants mark phipps and robert shorey were negligent inter alia for failure to properly instruct and train fdr staff in procedures should they observe phipps sexual sic molesting a patient.
on june,zaro tendered the first amended complaint to general star,asserting that unspecified new allegations therein created coverage.on july,curet replied that general star position was unchanged because the first amended complaint was based on phipps sexual misconduct and contained no claims independent of that conduct.
the second amended complaint 
on october,marie filed a second amended complaint,unchanged from the first amended complaint in any way material to this case.on november,zaro tendered the second amended complaint to general star,again demanding a defense.
on november,marie offered to settle the claim against phipps alone within the policy limits.general star declined the offer.
on december,phipps new counsel,craig farmer,wrote general star to make a final demand for a defense.though farmer argued extensively against general star position,he did not suggest that coverage might exist based on phipps vicarious liability for the chairside assistants negligence.
on january,curet replied to zaro and farmer that general star position was unchanged.in addition to restating his previous points,curet cited phipps admission to the dental board investigators that he intentionally molested marie as noted,the dental board decision relied on phipps admissions to the investigators as one of the grounds for revoking phipps license.
the trial of marie action 
on september,the scheduled first day of trial,marie submitted a trial brief arguing all causes of action pleaded in the second amended complaint as against all defendants.as to phipps negligence,marie argued he touched her inappropriately without a legitimate medical purpose,administered nitrous oxide in part for purposes unrelated to legitimate medical treatment,treated a female patient under nitrous oxide without a chair side assistant present,failed to give marie prior notice of his history of sexual misconduct with female patients,and failed to disclose that history to his dental plan.she did not argue phipps was vicariously liable on any ground.
also on september,defendants mark phipps and robert shorey settled with marie y.the trial court approved the settlement.
on september,marie offered to settle the claim against phipps within the policy limits.general star declined the offer.
on september,the case came on for bench trial against phipps alone.marie dismissed all intentional tort allegations and proceeded only on negligence.marie also submitted a s upplemental t rial b rief which stated the new claim that phipps was vicariously liable for the chairside assistants negligent failure to protect marie against him.the brief asserted regardless of who employs or pays the dental assistant or chairside who takes part in the performance of dental services incidental to the dental treatment being rendered,if while engaged in such service the dental assistant is under the direction of a certain dentist so as to be the dentist temporary servant or agent,then any negligence on the part of any such dental assistant is in fact the negligence of the dentist.italics added.
at trial,phipps counsel conceded that inappropriate touchings may have occurred,that if they did phipps conduct fell below the standard of care,and that marie had suffered trauma.he question ed only whether phipps conduct was point no longer at issue.
marie testified,as before,that phipps touched her repeatedly on the breasts and pubic area during her treatment on april.she also testified extensively about the immediate and emotional trauma the incident caused her.
phipps testified that he administered nitrous oxide because marie was a very nervous patient.some patients under nitrous oxide are prone to distortion and fantasizing.he became concerned when marie did not respond to questions.when other patients under nitrous oxide were unresponsive,he would pat them on the hand or shoulder,jostle them in the shoulder,or put a knuckle into their ribs.he touched marie similarly.he admitted,however,that some of his touchings may have been inappropriate and without a dental purpose.
marie counsel asked phipps whether his assistants inadvertence would also be his inadvertence he said,that my understanding.phipps counsel did not object to this question and answer.
the parties stipulated to admit the depositions of kimberly altenburg fisch and robin stevens.they also stipulated to admit the depositions of expert witnesses who opined that fisch and stevens conduct fell below the standard of care for dental assistants.
phipps insurance policy was not presented in evidence.no witness testified as to general star conduct toward phipps.
the trial court judge michael virga presiding found that phipps negligently touched marie and negligently failed to ensure that the effects of nitrous oxide did not cause her to misperceive his touchings.under the captain of the ship doctrine,the court also imputed to phipps the negligent failure of his chairside assistants to intercede to protect marie y.the court entered judgment against phipps in the amount of plus interest and costs.
in august or september,phipps assigned his rights against general star to marie in exchange for her covenant not to execute on the judgment against him.
the present action 
the complaint 
in her first amended complaint,marie as phipps assignee alleged that general star breached its contract with phipps and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by withdrawing its defense to the underlying action on or about march,before marie filed her first amended complaint in that action and by refusing to reinstate its defense thereafter.general star answered,raising affirmative defenses which included lack of coverage under the express terms of phipps policy and section.
general star motion for summary judgment 
in its motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication,general star asserted in part 
molesting a patient is not the rendering of services in the profession of dentistry capitalization omitted within the meaning of phipps policy.as phipps assignee,marie was collaterally estopped by the dental board finding that phipps molested her even if collateral estoppel did not apply,ample evidence showed phipps intentionally molested marie and phipps alleged negligent supervision of his assistants did not provide a ground for coverage because it was an integral part of the molestation.
section precludes coverage under phipps policy because his conduct was willful.
even assuming phipps acts constitute a dental incident under the policy,the policy expressly excludes a duty to indemnify for damages arising out of a dental incident that is also a willful violation of statute imposing criminal penalties.
coverage can not be based solely on the alleged negligence of the dental assistants or the partnership because they were not parties to the underlying action.
the underlying action did not decide any coverage issues.
marie opposition 
marie argued 
when general star withdrew its defense and refused reasonable settlement offers,it forfeited its right to challenge coverage and is bound by the judgment.because the trial court did not break down the verdict as between phipps and the chairside assistants,general star is liable for the entire judgment.its refusal to settle exposed it to a judgment in excess of policy limits which was not the result of fraud or collusion.
collateral estoppel does not apply to the dental board findings and marie is not bound by them.
phipps alleged conduct with other patients can not be considered as evidence he intentionally molested marie phipps previous alleged admissions are unreliable.any evidence or testimony regarding nolo contendere pleas must be excluded under penal code section,evidence code section,and supporting case law 
the dental board findings in the most recent disciplinary proceeding are inherently unreliable to prove phipps intentionally molested marie,both because of the lower standard of proof in administrative hearings and because licensure statutes are interpreted broadly to protect the public.
the judgment is valid against the partnership as well as phipps.as a partner of family dentists of roseville,phipps is liable for the negligence of its employees under the captain of the ship doctrine and respondeat superior.
section does not preclude coverage or a duty to defend on the facts of this case.the statute does not preclude coverage for negligent acts of the insured agents.the chairside assistants negligence and liability therefore do not arise out of phipps alleged willful violation of statute.general star has failed to prove that the incident did not arise out of or constitute the rendering of professional services.
general star reply 
general star asserted marie had not rebutted general star showing that the molestation which could be proved in these proceedings with all the evidence general star had adduced was not a dental incident under the policy.the dental board findings collaterally estopped marie because she brought this action as phipps representative and therefore stood in his shoes for all purposes,the factual issues in the board proceedings and in this action were identical,and the record of the board proceedings established the reliability of its findings.the chairside assistants negligence did not create coverage because public policy precludes offsetting one person intentional wrongdoing by another negligence,and because phipps vicarious liability was predicated on his own improper supervision,not the assistants acts or omissions.marie had not shown any ground for coverage based on the partnership alleged liability.even if phipps conduct constituted a dental incident under the policy,exclusion h would bar coverage.the judgment in the underlying action did not bind general star as to issues not necessarily determined there,coverage questions.
the trial court ruling 
the trial court judge john lewis presiding denied general star motion on the ground that the amended complaints allegations of chairside assistants negligence created potential vicarious liability for phipps,thus raising a triable issue whether general star had a duty to defend after phipps tendered the amended complaints to it.
marie motion for summary adjudication 
general star moved to amend its answer to add the affirmative defense that phipps materially misrepresented his history of sexual misconduct when applying to general star for insurance.judge lewis denied the motion.
marie then moved for summary adjudication of four issues general star breach of its duty to defend general star liability to marie for the judgment in the underlying action general star duty to indemnify marie for the full amount of the judgment because it refused reasonable settlement offers within policy limits and the inapplicability of section to preclude indemnity.
judge lewis granted marie motion on all four issues.judge lewis found general star had a duty to defend once it learned of the amended complaints allegations against the chair side assistants and the assistants deposition testimony substantiating those allegations general star breached that duty general star refusal to defend and to accept reasonable settlement offers rendered it liable for the entire judgment against its insured section did not preclude vicarious liability in this case and marie and phipps did not litigate the underlying action collusively.
the trial of the bad faith claims 
following judge lewis summary adjudication order,judge anthony decristoforo conducted an court trial of marie bad faith claims.marie contended general star acted in bad faith,disregarding its insured interests,in that it failed to consider potential grounds for coverage ascertainable from the amended complaints,failed to investigate the facts thoroughly,and refused reasonable settlement offers within policy limits.general star,though conceding for the moment under the compulsion of judge lewis ruling that its withdrawal of a defense was wrongful,maintained all its acts were reasonable and done in good faith.
after considering the evidence and the parties briefs,judge decristoforo issued a statement of decision which reads in part as follows 
the court finds that general star did not breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in its handling of claims made following the alleged sexual battery giving rise to this litigation 
judge lewis,in ruling on plaintiffs motion for summary adjudication,already determined that general star owes the entire amount of the underlying judgment in plaintiffs favor.accordingly,plaintiffs are entitled to for the judgment,plus in costs awarded in the underlying action,minus a credit for the amount recovered by the plaintiffs from david phipps,for a total of,plus interest at per annum from september,the date specified by the judgment in the underlying action.in light of judge lewis finding that a duty to defend was present,general star is also liable for unpaid attorney fees in the defense of the underlying action,which amount to for services rendered by robert zaro and for work performed by frank ferris,for a total of.general star has stipulated that plaintiffs are entitled to prejudgment interest on the defense costs from september,the date the trial of the underlying action was completed.
nonetheless,after considering the evidence presented at trial as well as briefing,the court does not believe that general star conduct was unreasonable so as to give rise to additional bad faith.although failure to provide a defense automatically renders a carrier like general star liable for the entire judgment if it is later determined,as judge lewis found,that a defense should indeed have been forthcoming citation,that does not necessarily mean that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing has been breached.an erroneous failure to extend policy benefits constitutes bad faith only if such refusal was unreasonable.citations.
general star initial withdrawal of defense was not unreasonable in light of the allegations made in plaintiffs original complaint and the results of general star investigation into those allegations.no compelling authority has been identified that precludes an insurance carrier,as part of its investigation,from considering a misdemeanor nolo contendere plea to two counts of sexual battery under penal code d in determining whether to deny coverage,especially where,as here,there was other evidence supporting the company decision to deny the defense.
the novel theory of liability ultimately adopted by judge virga in the underlying liability action was not presented by anyone prior to the day of trial of that case.the theory that the chair sides sic might be negligent for failing to stop phipps from sexually molesting a patient,which negligence could thereupon be imputed back to phipps himself and thereby provide him coverage for his own intentional misconduct,was a theory not previously advanced by phipps own coverage counsel,craig farmer,nor his defense attorneys,robert zaro and frank ferris.nor was it a theory recognized by general star coverage counsel,blaise curet.nor was it a theory given much credence,even in retrospection,by judge lewis who characterized it as a slim thread of potential coverage.failure to weave a warm and fuzzy blanket of insurance coverage from a slim thread can hardly be deemed an unreasonable decision and an act of bad faith.
further,the fact that everyone who looked at the conduct of phipps and all the surroundings sic circumstances did not recognize this novel theory until long after coverage decisions had been made should come as no surprise in light of california law which precludes the recharacterization of intentional sexual misconduct in negligence terms so as to trigger insurance coverage.citations.california law also indicates that negligence claims can not give rise to coverage where such claim sic are inseparably intertwined with allegations of sexual misconduct citation,and here any damage from the chair side assistants alleged conduct occurred virtually simultaneously with the purported sexual battery itself.where there is a genuine issue as to an insurer liability under california law,bad faith liability can not be imposed.citation.it therefore follows that no additional investigation by general star would have revealed any additional pertinent information that should have reasonably affected it sic decisions.
in view of the court findings that general star did not act in bad faith,plaintiffs can not recover attorney fees and costs incurred to obtain benefits due under the general star policy pursuant to brandt superior court cal d.
judge decristoforo thereafter entered judgment for marie for the sum of,plus prejudgment interest at the rate of ten percent per annum from september,through june,in the amount of,plus additional prejudgment interest in the amount of per day from june,until entry of judgment,together with costs to be added to the judgment later.
general star motion to tax costs 
after the judgment was entered on june,marie submitted a cost memorandum on june,claiming total costs of.
general star filed a motion to tax costs on july,asserting that marie was not entitled to claimed for retaining and deposing the parties bad faith experts because she had not prevailed on her bad faith claim therefore those costs were not reasonably necessary under code of civil procedure section,subdivision d marie filed opposition to the motion on august.
after a hearing held on august,the trial court granted general star motion on september,on the ground that general star prevailed on the bad faith cause of only matter tried after the section offer that involved the expert witnesses whose costs marie was seeking.the judgment thus allowed marie costs in the amount of.notice of entry of the order was filed on january.
after costs were added to the judgment in the foregoing amounts,general star filed a timely notice of appeal and marie filed a timely notice of,contesting the granting of the motion to tax costs.
discussion 
general star appeal 
general star contends it never had a duty to defend or indemnify phipps.as we shall explain,general star never had a duty to indemnify phipps but did breach a contractual promise to defend him.

general relevant principles of insurance law

when interpreting a policy provision,we must give its terms their ordinary and popular sense,unless used by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage.aiu,supra,cal d at,quoting.we must also interpret these terms in context bank of the west,supra,cal th at d,and give effect to every part of the policy with each clause helping to interpret the other,see also holz rubber,american star ins.cal d.palmer truck ins.exchange cal th,d.
in most policies of insurance,the insurer agrees to defend an insured against any claim for which the policy affords coverage.see,la jolla beach tennis club,industrial indemnity cal th,d.in such a situation,an insurer duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify.the duty to defend exists if there is any potential for coverage under the policy,while the duty to indemnify exists only if the insured conduct is actually covered.whether a duty to defend exists is initially determined by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy however,facts extrinsic to the complaint can either give rise to or defeat the duty.montrose chemical superior court cal th,d,montrose.where any of a plaintiff claims is potentially covered,the insurer has a duty to defend the action in its entirety where none is potentially covered,the insurer has no duty to defend.buss superior court cal th,d,buss.
however,an insurer,in its contract,may agree to defend an insured against claims for which there is no coverage.see,downey venture lmi ins.th,d.in such a case,whether there is a duty to defend depends upon the language of the insurance contract and whether it created an objectively reasonable expectation on the part of the insured that a defense would be provided in the circumstances.id.at,d.
original.general star had no duty to indemnify phipps while the original complaint was operative.
as we now show,general star did not incur a duty to defend or indemnify phipps at any time when the original complaint was operative.both the express terms of phipps policy and section precluded coverage for his willful sexual misconduct,and general star did not agree to defend him in the circumstances then known to them.
as noted,phipps policy provides coverage for any claim that is first made against the insured arising out of a dental incident which,in turn,means any act,error,omission,or mistake in the rendering of or failure to render services in the profession of dentistry by an insured or any person for whose acts or omissions an insured is legally liable.italics added capitalization omitted.the profession of dentistry means services performed in the practice of the profession of dentistry as defined in the business and the professional codes of the state where you practice.
marie points out that the expression arising out of in an insurance policy must be construed broadly,especially when it appears in the coverage section of the policy.see,reserve insurance pisciotta cal d,coverage language construed broadly acceptance ins.syufy enterprises th,d acceptance.the expression does not import any particular standard of causation or theory of liability into an insurance policy.rather,it broadly links a factual situation with the event creating liability,and connotes only a minimal causal connection or incidental relationship.acceptance,supra,th at,d.however,this still leaves the question whether the original complaint alleged that marie injury arose out of a dental incident.the answer is no.
a dental incident within the meaning of the policy necessarily entails the rendering of or failure to render services in the profession of dentistry,as that profession is defined by the applicable statutes of the state where the dentist practices.italics added.such service must involve the diagnosis or treatment of diseases and lesions and the correction of malpositions of the human teeth,alveolar process,gums,jaws,or associated structures,including all necessary related procedures as well as the use of drugs,anesthetic agents,and physical evaluation.bus.however,it can not involve t he commission of any act of sexual abuse,misconduct,or relations with a patient bus,or t he committing of any act or acts of gross immorality substantially related to the practice of dentistry bus,subd.e,because such acts by dentists constitute unprofessional conduct and grounds for disciplinary action.see also bus,crimes substantially related to the qualifications,functions,or duties of a dentist.
marie original complaint in the underlying action,even in its negligence count,specifically alleged that phipps engaged in sexual abuse and sexual misconduct toward marie and that his behavior was unprofessional and totally void of a legitimate diagnostic motive.italics added.such behavior,even if performed during a dental procedure which included the use of drugs and anesthetic agents bus,can not reasonably be construed as rendering services in the profession of dentistry within the meaning of phipps policy.therefore,his alleged acts can not be considered a dental incident covered by the policy,or arising out of such an incident.
indemnification of phipps,based on the allegations of the original complaint,was also barred by section.

in light of these precedents,sexually molesting a dental patient after rendering her unable to resist by giving her nitrous oxide is a wilful act under section.such conduct is at least as heinous as the noncriminal sexual harassment committed by the adult plaintiff employer in coit,supra,th,d.as this is the precise conduct originally alleged against phipps,the original complaint on its face demonstrates that section bars coverage for his conduct.
it is immaterial under section that marie pleaded phipps intentional misconduct in the alternative as negligent we are required to interpret section so as to give effect and meaning to all its provisions just as we can not allow insurers to recharacterize negligent conduct as intentional,we can not allow the insured to recast intentional conduct as merely negligent.coit,supra,th,d.
the parties dispute whether general star could properly use phipps misdemeanor nolo contendere plea to sexual battery as a ground for denying coverage or a defense to the original complaint.general star points out that a misdemeanor nolo contendere plea is a conclusive adjudication of guilt in the criminal justice system,subd.marie points out that,unlike a felony nolo contendere plea,a misdemeanor nolo contendere plea can not be used as an admission in a civil suit.see county of los angeles civil service com.th,d administrative proceedings where no specific statute permits use of plea insurance coverage not discussed compare ins.glenn th,d interinsurance exchange flores th,d felony nolo contendere pleas usable by insurer to deny defense.
we need not decide this question.first,as we have explained,general star properly concluded there was no coverage under the original complaint because it did not allege any conduct by phipps arising out of a dental incident.second,by alleging conduct which fell within section,the complaint necessarily alleged conduct for which coverage is precluded by law.third,by the time phipps tendered marie amended complaint alleging the assistants negligence to general star,there was further proof that phipps committed a wilful act precluding a finding he committed a dental accident and barring coverage under section the dental board factual and legal findings that he committed acts of sexual abuse and sexual misconduct because he molested marie there is no such thing as negligent or even reckless sexual molestation.penney,supra,cal d.
the dental board made its findings before marie served her first amended complaint,and general star was entitled to rely on them in refusing coverage.moreover,by the time marie filed the present action,the dental board findings and decision had become final.as we shall explain,the dental board findings that phipps molested marie collaterally estops her now,as phipps assignee,from asserting that his conduct was merely negligent.
when an administrative agency acts in a judicial capacity to resolve disputed issues of fact properly before it which the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate,its decision will collaterally estop a party to the proceeding from relitigating those issues.people sims cal d,sims.we conclude the sims rule applies here.
the dental board held an adversary proceeding on the accusations against phipps,presided over by an alj.as required by statute bus,subd.f,the dental board proceeding was judicial in nature phipps and the accuser,represented by counsel,called witnesses who testified under oath,subject to,at a transcribed hearing,and deposition and discovery were available to both parties.the factual issue in the phipps inappropriate touchings of marie were intentional and sexually identical to the core issue in the present action.phipps had every opportunity to litigate that issue there.after hearing all the evidence,the alj produced a formal proposed decision resolving the issue adversely to phipps.the dental board adopted that decision.its proceeding satisfied all the sims criteria for collateral estoppel.see sims,supra,cal d.thus,its findings of sexual abuse and misconduct have collateral estoppel effect.
collateral estoppel applies not only to parties to an action or proceeding,but also to those in privity with the parties.sims,supra,cal d.here,marie has brought suit as phipps assignee.as such,she stands in his shoes for all purposes,possessing all his rights against general star,but subject to all defenses general star could have raised against him.smith state farm mut.auto.ins.th,d witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.thus,she is in privity with phipps for purposes of collateral estoppel.because the dental board decision would estop phipps to deny his molestation was intentional and hence precluded from coverage under section,it likewise estops marie as his assignee.
conclusion 
for all the above reasons,general star never incurred a duty to indemnify phipps based on the allegations in the original complaint.put differently,there was no coverage,nor potential for coverage,under the original complaint.
general star had no duty to defend phipps under the original complaint.
because there was no coverage,nor potential for coverage under the allegations of the original complaint,and the extrinsic facts then known to general star,the insurer had no duty to defendant phipps under the general defense obligation to defend phipps against a claim for damages because of a dental incident,to which this policy applies ante,at.where there is no potential for coverage,there is no duty to defend.buss,supra,cal th,d,montrose,supra,cal th,d.
nor was there a duty to defend under exclusion h,which provides this insurance does not apply 
h to liability for any damages arising out of a dental incident which is also a willful violation of a statute,ordinance or regulation imposing criminal penalties however 
we will defend any civil suit against the insured seeking amounts which would be covered if this exclusion did not apply and 
in such case we will pay only the fees,costs,and expenses of such defense any payment made under this provision will reduce the limits of insurance by the amount of such payment.capitalization and bolding omitted.
in removing the exclusion for the purpose of promising a defense,this language refers to amounts which would be covered if this exclusion did not apply.this latter language necessarily then requires resort to the basic coverage provision of the policy,in order to determine amounts which would be covered.that basic coverage provision,in turn,requires that there has been a dental incident,as we have discussed.
because neither the original complaint nor the extrinsic evidence then known to general star suggested a dental incident had occurred,there was no duty to defend under this policy provision.
it is immaterial to general star duty to defend that marie ultimately obtained a negligence judgment against phipps.an insurer that has reserved its right to assert noncoverage is not bound by a judgment against the insured.penney,supra,cal d,horace mann,supra,th,d.thus,where an insurer has reserved its right to deny coverage,an underlying judgment in litigation between the insured and a plaintiff to which the insurer was not a party does not collaterally estop the insurer from asserting that the insured conduct was intentional rather than negligent.penney,supra,cal d at,horace mann,supra,th at,d.general star repeatedly and forcefully denied coverage in this case.
the effect of the amended complaints 
marie contends general star breached its duty to defend by refusing to reinstate its defense after phipps tendered marie amended complaints,which suggested the possibility of vicarious liability for the chairside assistants negligence.we agree.
for reasons we have explained,general star had no obligation to defend or indemnify phipps based on his personal conduct as alleged in the amended complaints.
however,as we have noted,on june,phipps counsel tendered to general star marie first amended complaint that alleged,a chairside assistant,kimberly altenberg sic,who was an agent and employee of fdr family dentists of roseville,observed phipps sexually touching marie during the course of dental treatment,and did nothing to stop him nor did she immediately report the incident or seek aid from defendant shorey,who was present in another operatory of the same office,in order to safeguard the plaintiff.
plaintiffs have contended that this pleading invoked coverage,or at least the potential for coverage,on two theories phipps could be liable as the captain of the ship see fn,ante or as a partner in family dentists of roseville,phipps would be liable on a theory of respondeat superior for the negligence of the dental assistant.see generally farmers ins.group county of santa clara cal th,d.
we are of the view that section continued to bar indemnity or coverage based upon the claims involving the dental assistants.as we explain,it would violate the public policy underlying section which is to discourage willful torts to create coverage for phipps based on the assistants conduct,because their negligence was inextricably intertwined with phipps intentional wrongdoing and marie resulting harm.
a theory of liability,and an insurer duty to defend and indemnify therefor,which would only flow from,and be inseparable from,an intentional and willful act for which coverage is legally barred coit,supra,th,d is untenable.thus,where harm is alleged to result from negligent conduct which is so intertwined with intentional and willful wrongdoing as to be inseparable from the wrongdoing the alleged negligence does not give rise to an insurer duty to indemnify.ibid.
the assistants alleged negligence harmed marie,if at all,only as part and parcel of phipps design to commit misconduct.see horace mann,supra,th,d.their negligence consisted only in failing to stop him from continuing the molestation he had already begun.without phipps acts of molestation,there was nothing wrongful for the assistants to report.this,in and of itself,shows that the negligence of the assistants was inextricably intertwined with phipps molestation.
moreover,according to marie amended complaint,fisch saw the molestation in progress before committing any allegedly negligent act or omission.according to the assistants testimony,phipps sent fisch out of the room on an errand before beginning to touch marie inappropriately,and immediately stopped when fisch returned then,after sending her out of the room again on another errand,he resumed his misconduct as stevens,alerted by fisch,looked on without intervening.
obviously,phipps intended and counted on such negligence by the assistants to facilitate his design.as such,it was inextricably intertwined with that design,and any harm it caused was inseparable from phipps willful misconduct.see coit,supra,th,d.to allow insurance indemnity for vicarious liability on this basis would flout section clear purpose of discouraging willful torts.penney,supra,cal d.
general star therefore never had a duty to indemnify phipps.
it follows that general star never had an obligation to accept any of marie offers to settle.from the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied by law in all contracts,and from the liability insurer duty to defend and indemnify covered claims,california courts have derived an implied duty on the part of the insurer to accept reasonable settlement demands on such claims within the policy limits.citation.hamilton maryland casualty cal th,d,italics added.as this passage from hamilton indicates,the insurer has a duty to accept a reasonable settlement offer only with respect to a covered claim.it is true that an insurer who refused a reasonable settlement offer,on the ground of no coverage,does so at its own risk,so that the insurer has no defense that its refusal was in good faith if coverage is,in fact,found.johansen california state auto.bureau cal d.however,where the kind of claim asserted is not covered by the insurance contract and not simply the amount of the claim,an insurer has no obligation to pay money in settlement of a noncovered claim,because the insurer does not insure the entire range of an insured,outside the scope of and unrelated to the insurance policy,with respect to paying third party claims.it is an insurer,not a guardian angel.camelot by the bay condominium owners scottsdale ins.th,d.here,because there was no coverage for the kind of claims asserted by marie,general star had no obligation to accept any of marie offers to settle those claims.id.at,d.therefore,to the extent the trial court,in its summary adjudication order,ruled that general star refusal to accept marie settlement offers rendered general star liable for the entire judgment against phipps,the trial court erred.
this leaves the question whether general star had a duty to defend phipps upon its receipt of the first amended complaint even though coverage indemnity was precluded by section.s ection precludes only indemnification of wilful conduct and not the defense of an action in which such conduct is alleged.citation.
e ven though public policy or section precludes an insurer from indemnifying an insured in an underlying action the duty to defend still exists so long as the insured reasonably expect s the policy to cover the types of acts involved in the underlying suit.citation.republic indemnity superior court d.put another way,if the reasonable expectations of an insured are that a defense will be provided for a claim,then the insurer can not escape that obligation merely because public policy precludes it from indemnifying that claim.ohio casualty ins.hubbard d.b e convalescent center state compensation ins.fund th,d followed in downey venture lmi ins,supra,th,d mez industries,pacific nat.ins.th,d.
at issue is exclusion h of the general star policy that provides for a defense of a claim arising out of a dental incident even though the insured has committed a willful criminal act.see discussion,ante,at.the question is thus posed is the failure of a dental assistant to report sexual misconduct by a dentist a dental incident 
we conclude
