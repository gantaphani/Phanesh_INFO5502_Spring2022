under certain circumstances,a trial court must award costs and even attorney fees in favor of a prevailing party in an action.code civ,subd.b.prevailing party,as relevant here,includes the party with a net monetary recovery,subd.a hereafter,section a.in this case,the plaintiffs settled with several defendants and later obtained a damage award against nonsettling defendants in an amount less than the settlement proceeds.by statute,an award in favor of a nonsettling defendant is offset by the amount the plaintiff has received from the settling defendants,subd.a.if the settlement amount is greater than the damage award,the award is entirely offset,resulting in a zero judgment.syverson heitmann d,syverson.
based on the plain language of these statutes,we conclude that the plaintiffs here,ordered to take nothing against the nonsettling defendants due to the settlement offset,did not obtain a net monetary recovery.as we explain further below,we disapprove of wakefield bohlin th,wakefield,which reached a contrary conclusion.we also distinguish the following cases that suggest otherwise great western bank converse consultants,th,great western zamora shell oil th,zamora pirkig dennis d,pirkig see also syverson,supra,d at interpreting prior version of section ferraro southern cal.gas d,ferraro same.
factual and procedural background 
in march,randall goodman and linda guinther collectively,plaintiffs contracted with jesus and natalia lozano to purchase a newly constructed house in laguna beach for million.the house was built by ampm construction,a company formed by alberto and patricia mobrici in.the mobricis were equal partners with the lozanos on numerous residential construction projects jesus lozano provide d the money to build,and alberto mobrici was the construction arm of the venture.
in,plaintiffs sued the lozanos,alberto mobrici,ampm construction,the architect,and the real estate brokers,based on construction defects in their new house.plaintiffs sued several of the defendants for various causes of action including negligence,fraud,breach of warranties and negligent misrepresentation,but sued only the lozanos for breach of contract.in,alberto mobrici and ampm construction settled with plaintiffs for,and other for the with plaintiffs for a total of over.the trial court found these settlements were made in good faith.plaintiffs subsequently rejected the lozanos section settlement offer of.
in,a bench trial was held on plaintiffs action against the lozanos.the trial judge,who was not informed of plaintiffs settlement with the other defendants,found in favor of plaintiffs and calculated a total damage award of just under,of which went to plaintiffs contract claim.after learning that the prior settlements totaled over,the judge determined that the lozanos should receive credit for the settlements.because the settlement amount easily surpassed the awarded to plaintiffs,the trial judge found that plaintiffs should receive nothing by the action.exercising his discretion under section a,the trial judge determined that the lozanos were the prevailing parties because they paid nothing under the judgment.he awarded the lozanos in attorney fees and in costs.plaintiffs appealed from both the net zero judgment and the order finding the lozanos to be the prevailing parties and awarding them fees and costs.
the court of appeal affirmed.it expressly disagreed with the majority in wakefield,supra,th at page,which held that a party who receives a damage award against a defendant but whose judgment is reduced to zero by operation of section,categorically qualifies as a prevailing party with a net monetary recovery under section a.construing what it found to be the plain language of section a,the court of appeal here reasoned a litigant can not actually recover or gain anything without an order or a judgment.an award or verdict without a judgment is merely symbolic.the fact that the litigant may have had an award or verdict prior to a zero judgment is meaningless for purposes of whether that litigant qualifies as the party with a net monetary recovery if the award or verdict produces nothing tangible.recovery,not award,is the word chosen by the legislature.rejecting plaintiffs claim that they were categorically the prevailing party under the reasoning of wakefield,supra,th,the court of appeal concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the prevailing party were the lozanos.
we granted review to resolve the conflict

generally,a trial court determination that a litigant is a prevailing party,along with its award of fees and costs,is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see villa de las palmas homeowners terifaj cal th,plcm group,drexler cal th.however,the issue here involves the interpretation of a statute,a question of law that we review de novo.see california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d,california teachers.
in interpreting a statute,our primary goal is to determine and give effect to the underlying purpose of the law.people valladoli cal th.our first step is to scrutinize the actual words of the statute,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.ibid.if the words of the statute are clear,the court should not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.california teachers,supra,cal d at.in other words,we are not free to give words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the terms used.california fed.savings loan city of los angeles cal th,see.however,the plain meaning rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose or whether such a construction of one provision is consistent with other provisions of the statute.county of san bernardino city of san bernardino cal th.to determine the most reasonable interpretation of a statute,we look to its legislative history and background.doe city of los angeles cal th,doe.

unless otherwise provided by statute,a prevailing party is entitled to recover costs in any action or proceeding as a matter of right,subd.b,subd.a a c allowable costs under include attorney fees authorized by contract,statute,or law.prevailing party for purposes of section a is defined as including the party with a net monetary recovery,a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered,a defendant where neither plaintiff nor defendant obtains any relief,and a defendant as against those plaintiffs who do not recover any relief against that defendant.if a party recovers anything other than monetary relief and in situations not specified above,a trial court shall determine the prevailing party and use its discretion to determine the amount and allocation of costs,if any.michell olick th,prevailing party is entitled to costs as a matter of right the trial court has no discretion to order each party to bear his or her own costs.we are concerned with the first category of section a,the party with a net monetary recovery.
also relevant to the issue here,section,subdivision a,provides that if a party gives a release to one or more other mutually subject to contribution rights,that party claims against the others may be reduced by the amount of the prior settlement,subd.a.section establishes that a good faith settlement bars other defendants from seeking contribution from the settling defendant,subd.b,but at the same time provides that the plaintiff claims against the other defendants are to be reduced by the amount of consideration paid for the settlement,subd.a.thus,while a good faith settlement cuts off the right of other defendants to seek contribution or comparative indemnity from the settling defendant,the nonsettling defendants obtain in return a reduction in their ultimate liability to the plaintiff.abbott ford,superior court cal d,wade shrader th,wade.as noted above see ante,if a plaintiff settlement completely offsets a damage award against a nonsettling joint tortfeasor or,it reduces the judgment to zero by operation of law.syverson,supra,d at.
