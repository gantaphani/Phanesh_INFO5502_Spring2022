plaintiff and appellant hogar dulce hogar hogar successfully and substantially altered defendant and appellant community development commission of the city of escondido the agency contributions to a state mandated fund for low cost housing.although hogar did not succeed in obtaining all of the relief it sought,the trial court found that it achieved its primary goal.this determination is supported by substantial evidence in the record.hence hogar was entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees under code of civil procedure section.
in calculating the amount of attorney fees awarded to hogar,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding an amount based on the hours spent on the case and the trial court determination of a reasonable hourly rate for the work provided by counsel.contrary to the agency argument,the trial court was not required to reduce this lodestar amount to account for the fact that hogar did not recover all of the relief it sought.on the other hand,contrary to hogar argument,the trial court was not required to multiply the lodestar to account for hogar perception of the complexity and difficulty of its case.
the trial court did err in failing to award attorney fees incurred prior to filing of suit.the record shows this work was necessary to the success of hogar claim.we also find the trial court erred in failing to award hogar for all the work counsel performed in successfully prosecuting hogar attorney fee motion.hence we reverse the order appealed from with instructions that the trial court award hogar attorney fees for the period before it filed the underlying complaint and for counsel work in recovering its fees.
factual and procedural background 
in our opinion in hogar dulce hogar community development commission th,d hogar i,we summarized the circumstances giving rise to the parties underlying dispute.under the community redevelopment law health,et crl,local redevelopment agencies receive tax increment funds generated by redevelopment projects they have initiated.the crl requires that percent of such tax increment funds be placed in a low and moderate income housing fund housing fund.the legislature has directed that,in general,housing fund proceeds should be used to increase,improve or preserve a community supply of housing affordable to,and individuals and families.
in this case an unincorporated association,plaintiff and appellant hogar dulce hogar hogar,challenged the manner in which defendant and appellant community development commission of the city of escondido the agency calculated payment to its housing fund.in its complaint which by virtue of a tolling agreement was treated as filed in,hogar alleged that in calculating the amount it paid into the housing fund,the agency had unlawfully deducted from its gross tax increment receipts amounts it had agreed to pay the county of san diego the county and then paid the housing fund percent of its net tax increment receipts.hogar asserted the crl requires that percent of gross tax increment funds be placed in the housing fund as opposed to the percent of net tax increment funds the agency paid into the fund.
the trial court agreed with hogar.the trial court found that under the crl the agency was required to pay the fund percent of its gross,rather than net,tax increment receipts.the trial court ordered that the agency reimburse the fund the amounts which should have been paid into the fund from the time the fund was established in until the date of the judgment.hogar i,supra,th at,d,fns.omitted.
in hogar i,we reversed the trial court judgment in part.we found that under the applicable statute of limitations,the trial court could only order reimbursement of the housing fund for a period commencing three years before hogar complaint was filed.hogar i,supra,th at,d.
proceedings on remand 
on remand the parties entered into a stipulation with respect to costs and hogar expected motion for attorney fees.the stipulation stated the time for making a motion for attorney fees and serving a memorandum of costs would be extended to the time permitted for filing a memorandum of costs following entry of judgment on remand.
on remand the agency argued it should not be ordered to reimburse the housing fund for any period before the date hogar complaint was filed in august.the trial court rejected this defense and ordered the agency to reimburse the housing fund a total of million for the period between december,and the date of judgment,october.the agency did not challenge the judgment.
hogar failed to file its motion for attorney fees within the time limit set forth in the stipulation,and on that basis the trial court denied hogar initial motion for attorney fees.hogar applied for relief from its failure to timely file its motion,which the trial court granted.the trial court then heard hogar motion on the merits.the trial court found that,although hogar did not achieve all of its goals,it was successful in attaining its primary goals.in particular,the court found that by virtue of its litigation,hogar not only obtained the judgment which required the agency to transfer million to the housing fund,it caused the agency to reach an agreement with the county of san diego county in under which,in future years,percent of the agency gross taxes,plus interest,will be paid into the housing fund.the agency acquiescence in hogar demands with respect to future taxes will,by the year,provide the housing fund with an additional million.
based on its determination that hogar had been successful,the trial court found hogar was entitled to a total of in attorney fees.this figure represented attorney time spent after hogar filed its complaint in august.the trial court did not make any award for fees incurred before hogar complaint was filed or any additional award based on the difficulty or complexity of the case.
discussion 
an award of attorney fees under section requires the applicant to meet three criteria the action resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest a significant pecuniary or nonpecuniary benefit was conferred on a large class of persons and the necessity of private enforcement and the attendant financial burden thereof make the award appropriate.whether the applicant has proved each of these criteria is a matter primarily vested in the trial court.citation.
on appeal,our review of the trial court decision under section is circumscribed.the experienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his court,and while his judgment is of course subject to review,it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.citations.citation.thus,we may not disturb the ruling here absent a showing that the court abused its discretion,the record establishes there is no reasonable basis for the ruling.citation.ciani san diego trust savings bank th,d.
in its principal argument on appeal the agency contends hogar was not a successful party within the meaning of section.in particular,the agency argues that it agreed to most of the relief hogar sought when in june the agency amended its agreement with the county so that in future years the housing fund would receive percent of the agency gross tax receipts.the agency contends hogar complaint,which was not filed until after the agency had made its agreement with the county,did not cause it to alter its allocation to the housing fund.the agency further contends it did not dispute hogar contention the housing fund was entitled to reimbursement for the three years preceding initiation of this litigation.
the agency arguments fail largely because they are not supported by the record.rather,the record clearly supports the trial court finding that hogar litigation in fact prompted the agency to amend its agreement with the county.moreover,the record refutes the agency contention that it was willing at all times to reimburse the housing fund for years prior to the initiation of hogar litigation.
legal principles 
in determining whether a plaintiff is a successful party for purposes of section,t he critical fact is the impact of the action,not the manner of its resolution.citation.graham daimlerchrysler cal th,d,graham.under this broad,pragmatic view of what constitutes a successful party id.at,d,within the meaning of section,a plaintiff need not obtain a judgment in its favor to be a successful party.see godinez schwarzenegger th,d godinez.rather,a plaintiff is a successful party whenever it obtains the relief sought in its lawsuit,regardless of whether that relief is obtained through a voluntary change in the defendant conduct,through a settlement,or otherwise.graham,supra,cal th at,d.
a party is successful within this pragmatic approach if the lawsuit was a catalyst motivating the defendants to provide the primary relief sought the lawsuit had merit and achieved its catalytic effect by threat of victory,not by dint of nuisance and threat of expense,as elaborated in graham and the plaintiffs reasonably attempted to settle the litigation prior to filing the lawsuit.city of los angeles cal th,d,see also graham,supra,cal th at,d,see also godinez,supra,th at,d wallace consumers cooperative of berkeley,d.folsom butte county of governments cal d,folsom.
under the catalyst theory,a plaintiff is a successful party and entitled to attorney fees if its lawsuit motivated the defendant to voluntarily provide the relief sought by hogar.see graham,supra,cal th at,d,folsom,supra,cal d at,county of colusa california wildlife conservation bd.th,d belth garamendi d.importantly,the catalyst theory does not require that hogar litigation be the only cause of a defendant acquiescence.rather,hogar litigation need only be a substantial factor contributing to the defendant action.see chin daimlerchrysler d,summarizing california catalyst precedent graham,supra,cal th at,d.
when,after litigation is initiated,a defendant has voluntarily provided the relief a plaintiff is seeking,the chronology of events may raise an inference that the litigation was the catalyst for the relief.see californians for responsible toxics management kizer d.chin,supra,d at.the appropriate benchmarks in determining which party prevailed are a the situation immediately prior to the commencement of suit,and b the situation today,and the role,if any,played by the litigation in effecting any changes between the two.folsom,supra,cal d at,fn.
b.the results of hogar litigation 
as we noted in hogar i,at the time it adopted its redevelopment plan,the agency agreed with the county as to a division of the tax increment funds produced by the agency redevelopment activities.such agreements giving counties a portion of tax increment receipts were designed to protect counties from the loss of revenue needed for services provided by counties.see hogar i,supra,th at,fn,d.at the heart of the parties underlying dispute was that portion of the agency agreement with the county under which the agency paid its housing fund percent of the net amount it received from the county rather than percent of the gross amount of tax increment receipts to which the fund was entitled.in the agency was advised by its own counsel that this method of calculating the amount due the housing fund was improper and that it was required to pay the housing fund percent of the gross tax increment.the underfunding issue was discussed at a public meeting and the agency contacted the county in an effort to amend the tax sharing agreement.the county responded by stating that in the event the validity of the tax sharing agreement was challenged,the county would assist the agency in defending the agreement.however,the county was unwilling to amend the tax sharing agreement or otherwise provide the agency any relief from the provisions of the agreement.
in the agency sued the county and argued provisions of the tax sharing agreement had to be modified so the agency could comply with provisions of section,subdivision a.in the trial court in that action granted the county motion for summary judgment.the court found that the agency,notwithstanding its obligations under the crl,was bound by its agreement with the county until a third party had obtained a judgment invalidating it.because no third party had challenged the agreement,the trial court found the agency was not entitled to any relief.hogar i,supra,th at,d.
hogar became the challenger required by the earlier judgment.in november hogar sent the agency a letter demanding it commence paying the housing fund percent of its gross tax receipts and reimburse the fund for amounts the fund should have received in prior years.in response to the demand letter,the agency advised hogar it would commence negotiations with county to amend the tax sharing agreement.because it appeared those negotiations would not be concluded quickly,the agency entered into a tolling agreement with hogar on december.under the terms of the tolling agreement,the agency agreed any complaint which hogar eventually filed would be treated as if it were filed on the date of the tolling agreement.
following hogar demand letter and the tolling agreement,the agency commenced negotiations with the county.on june,the agency and county amended their tax sharing agreement so that it provided in the future the housing fund would receive percent of the agency gross tax receipts as required by the crl.however,the agency and the county made no provision for reimbursement of amounts due the fund in prior years.
on august,hogar filed a complaint against the agency in which it sought reimbursement to the housing fund for the period from through the effective date of the amendment to the agency tax sharing agreement with the county.as we have indicated,initially in the trial court hogar was successful in obtaining a judgment that required the agency reimburse the housing fund a total of million.because we determined the statute of limitations did not permit such a large award,on remand hogar obtained the eventual judgment that required the million reimbursement to the housing fund.
given this chronology of events,the trial court could reasonably conclude that overall hogar litigation was successful.first,the record makes it clear that in the absence of a claim such as hogar,the agency and the county would not have amended their tax sharing agreement.indeed,the judgment protected the county from any such amendment in the absence of a claim such as hogar.in this regard the agency reliance on correspondence it received from a staff member of a state senate committee reporting the state controller office did not approve of the method employed by the agency to compute its obligation to the housing fund is unpersuasive.the agency own counsel had reached the same determination in.given these circumstances,the trial court was not required to believe a staff member report of the views of a state agency would have prompted either the county or the agency to give up the protection provided by the judgment.rather,it was far more likely that hogar november demand,which represented the claim which would require an amendment under the terms of the judgment,prompted action by the agency and the county.
we also reject the agency contention that for purposes of determining hogar overall success we must treat the litigation as commencing in august when hogar complaint was actually filed.for purposes of applying the statute of limitation,under the tolling agreement the action commenced as of december.in the particular circumstances presented here we think that is the appropriate point in time in which to measure,in part,the impact of hogar litigation.given the judgment,hogar november demand letter,and the agency willingness to enter into a tolling agreement as of december,it is clear that as of that date the agency and the county were operating as if they were in fact engaged in litigation which they needed to resolve.thus for purposes of measuring the overall impact of hogar litigation,that is the point in time when the lawsuit began.
in sum then the record fully supports the trial court conclusion hogar litigation was the catalyst for the agency agreement with the county to amend the tax sharing agreement.however,apart from its success in obtaining an amendment to the tax sharing agre
