introduction 
appellant nicholas honchariw filed a vesting tentative map application with the county of stanislaus that proposed subdividing a acre parcel into large residential lots.the board of supervisors of the county of stanislaus board disapproved the application.honchariw sued the board and won on the ground that it disapproved his proposed housing development project without making the written findings required by government code section,subdivision j honchariw county of stanislaus th.our decision ordered the superior court to issue a writ of mandate directing the board to reconsider honchariw application and make written findings where appropriate.the board compliance with the writ resulted in its approval of honchariw application.
this appeal concerns honchariw motion for attorney fees under subdivision k of section section k,which states that the court shall award reasonable attorney fees and costs of suit to the plaintiff or petitioner who proposed the housing development italics added.the superior court concluded that the phrase the housing development was ambiguous and was intended to include only affordable housing developments because honchariw project was not an affordable housing development,the superior court denied the motion for attorney fees.
in honchariw county of stanislaus,supra,th,this court held that honchariw project was a proposed housing development project for purposes of subdivision j of section.that interpretation is not controlling in this appeal because the attorney fees provision in section k uses different language,the housing development.this slight difference in language is important because the phrase housing development project is defined by section,subdivision h.honchariw county of stanislaus,supra,th at.in contrast,the phrase housing development is not defined by the housing accountability act.
we conclude that the attorney fees provision in section k is ambiguous and,therefore,we must adopt the interpretation that best effectuates the legislature purpose.the legislative history for the bill that added the attorney fees provision to section k states that the bill strengthens current law by requiring a court to award attorney fees to an affordable housing developer that has had a project unfairly denied by a local agency.see fn,post.based on this and other legislative history,we interpret the attorney fees provision in section k to authorize an award of attorney fees only when the housing development in question contains affordable housing.
from a textual perspective,we conclude the term the housing development contained in section k refers to the housing development that is the subject of the order or judgment mentioned earlier in that section.that order or judgment is issued only in cases where a local agency has rejected an affordable housing project or emergency shelter without making the required findings or without substantial evidence to support its findings.because the order or judgment referred to in the statute reaches only affordable housing and emergency shelters,it follows that the term the housing development used in the attorney fees provision is limited to affordable housing developments.
we therefore affirm the superior court order denying attorney fees.
honchariw proposed to divide a acre parcel in the knights ferry area of stanislaus county into eight parcels that would be used for residential purposes and one remaining parcel that would contain acres of undeveloped land.in connection with this proposal,honchariw submitted vesting tentative map application to the county planning commission.
in february,the planning commission considered honchariw application and his request for an exception to the county rule requiring that all subdivision lots be connected to a public water system whenever such a system is available.the county planning commission voted to deny honchariw application and the request for an exception.
honchariw filed an administrative appeal.in march,the board voted to disapprove the subdivision project application and to deny the request for an exception to the rule requiring connections to an available public water system.the board did not make any of the findings specified in subdivision j of section.
honchariw challenged the board disapproval by filing a petition for writ of mandamus.honchariw,in his capacity of trustee of the honchariw family trust,acted as the petitioner in the lawsuit he also acted as counsel of record for the petitioner under a contingent fee arrangement.
the superior court denied the petition,concluding that the board was not required to make written findings under subdivision j of section when it denied the application.
in november,we reversed the superior court judgment and ordered the court to issue a writ of mandate directing the board to vacate its denial of honchariw subdivision project application,reconsider the application,and make certain determinations and findings in the event that it again denied the application.honchariw county of stanislaus,supra,th at.
in january,the superior court issued the writ of mandate and directed the board to file a return to the writ within days 
in february,honchariw filed a motion for attorney fees that proposed an award of to cover the time he had acted as the attorney for.honchariw calculation of the award was based on hours spent on the litigation multiplied by an hourly rate of and adjusted except for hours by a multiplier of.honchariw declaration stated he discounted his hourly fee to and compared the discounted rate to a billing rate of per hour he had in the early in a matter involving ernest young.
in march,the board filed its opposition to the motion for attorney fees.the board argued that section k applied only to litigation involving certain or affordable housing projects and,therefore,the motion should be denied.to support its interpretation of the statute,the board requested the superior court to take judicial notice of three items of legislative history concerning section.
the board also argued that honchariw could not recover attorney fees because he simultaneously acted as the and as the attorney for the trust.as to the amount claimed,the board asserted the fees were grossly inflated based on the lack of specificity in the hours claimed,the excessive hourly billing rate,and the request for a multiplier.
in late april,the superior court held a hearing on the motion for attorney fees and a motion to tax costs filed by the board.
on june,the superior court filed its written ruling on the motions.the court denied honchariw motion for attorney fees,concluding that the attorney fee provision of government code section k is inapplicable in this case.as a rationale for the statute inapplicability,the court stated that the wording of section k seemed to limit the recovery of attorney fees to cases involving affordable housing and emergency shelters and the legislative history confirmed such an intention.
later in june,the board filed a supplemental return stating that in may it approved honchariw application in a vote and no findings were required under subdivision j of section because of the approval.
in july,honchariw filed a notice of appeal from the order denying the motion for attorney fees.
discussion 
standard of review 
this appeal concerns the scope of the attorney fees provision in the housing accountability act and whether,properly interpreted,reasonable attorney fees are required in cases where the proposed development does not include affordable housing.
it is well established that questions of statutory construction present issues of law subject to independent review on appeal,twedt franklin th.therefore,we will conduct an independent review of this appeal.
ii.principles of statutory construction 
a reviewing court fundamental task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.honchariw county of stanislaus,supra,th at,citing wilcox birtwhistle cal th.this task begins by scrutinizing the actual words of the statute,giving them their usual,ordinary meaning.garcia mccutchen cal th,honchariw county of stanislaus,supra,at.
statutory language with a plain meaning 
when the statutory language,standing alone,is clear and unambiguous that is,has only one reasonable construction courts usually adopt the plain or literal meaning of that language.hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,lungren deukmejian cal d.
the plain meaning rule,however,does not require courts to automatically adopt the literal meaning of a statutory provision.goodman lozano cal th.for example,when a literal construction would frustrate the purpose of the statute,that construction is not adopted.arias superior court cal th,nonliteral construction of proposition adopted based on evidence of underlying purpose and voter intent bob jones university united states,a canon of statutory construction provides that literal language should not defeat the plain purpose of the statute.also,courts will not adopt a literal construction when it produces absurd consequences.provigo alcoholic beverage control appeals bd.cal th,court of appeal plain meaning approach to constitutional provision rejected to avoid absurdity see generally,manning,the absurdity doctrine harv.
faria san jacinto unified school dist.th,set forth the foregoing exceptions to the plain meaning rule by stating 
the plain meaning of the words of a statute may be disregarded only when the application of their literal meaning would inevitably produce absurd consequences which the legislature clearly did not intend or frustrate the manifest purposes which appear from the provisions of the legislation when considered as a whole in light of its legislative history.
ambiguous statutory language 
when statutory language is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation hoechst celanese franchise tax bd.cal th,it is regarded as ambiguous and there is no plain meaning.when statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.honchariw county of stanislaus,supra,th at.
courts determine the apparent intent of the legislature by reading the ambiguous language in light of the statutory scheme rather than reading it in isolation.lungren deukmejian,supra,cal d at.in other words,the ambiguous language must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.ibid.in addition,courts may determine the apparent intent of the legislature by evaluating a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved by the statute,the evils to be remedied,the statute legislative history,and public policy.honchariw county of stanislaus,supra,th at.
iii.legislative history of attorney fees provision 
ordinarily,we would begin our analysis by setting forth the words in the attorney fees provision contained in the third sentence of section k and then would set forth the remaining text of that subdivision to establish the context for the attorney fees provision.here,because of the length and complexity of the language used in section k,we will take a chronological approach to section k and begin by describing the bills and legislative history relevant to its enactment.
original subdivision k of section 
section did not contain a subdivision k until,when it was added by senate bill reg.sess.the initial version of subdivision k did not contain an attorney fees provision.stats,ch.instead,it addressed the relief a court was required to implement if it found that a local agency failed to make certain findings supported by substantial evidence in connection with the disapproval of a project for affordable housing.
amendment adding attorney fees provision 
two years later,the legislature enacted assembly bill reg.sess.ab,which added an attorney fees provision to section k.stats,ch.
report to committee on judiciary 
three items of legislative history were included in the request for judicial notice that the board filed to support its opposition to the motion for attorney fees.one of the items was the report on ab prepared for the assembly committee on judiciary hearing on may,which included a synopsis that began 
this measure requires a court,when it finds that a local agency has disapproved a housing development project for very low,low or moderate income households without making sufficient findings supported by substantial evidence,to award reasonable attorney fees,actual damages,and costs of suit to the plaintiff.assem.com.on judiciary,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended april.
this statement supports the conclusion that the attorney fees authorized would be limited to situations where a wrongful denial of approval involved affordable housing.the report also contains comments from the author of ab,which refer to prior amendments that strengthened the anti nimby law and then stated 
unfortunately,the law still is in need of improvement.low and moderate income housing is still being denied or saddled with so many conditions that it is effectively denied,despite the applicant compliance with the local government general plan,zoning and development requirements while an applicant is empowered to sue,it is extremely costly to litigate and current law does not permit recovery of litigation costs.too many appropriately zoned and desperately needed housing developments are not getting built because the applicant can not afford the cost of litigation.
the intent of the bill is to hold governments accountable for their actions if the following is true the low and moderate income housing development application is in compliance with current local government standards and the local government denies the application.to help put some teeth into the affordable housing law,ab provides that a prevailing plaintiff who is wrongfully denied warranted approvals for affordable housing construction to receive reasonable attorney fees,actual damages,and costs.assem.com.on judiciary,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended april.
the author statement about the intent of ab specifies that one of the conditions for the recovery of attorney fees is that the low and moderate income housing development complies with local standards.this statement of intent creates a strong,but not conclusive,inference that the attorney fees provision was intended to apply onlyto affordable housing the author use of if leaves open the possibility that attorney fees might be recoverable under conditions other than those specified.in contrast,had the author used the phrase if and only if the following is true,there would be no ambiguity of an intention to limit the award of attorney fees to cases involving affordable housing developments 
the report also states that the author and sponsor argue that the measure is an attempt to hold local governments accountable for improperly denying housing projects.they argue that many projects are often denied because of nimby fears,and state that the bill provides an effective remedy for applicants who otherwise can not afford to sue and eat their costs assem.com.on judiciary,on assem.bill reg.sess.as amended april.the report description of the opponents view of ab indicates that they,like the bill proponents,believed the attorney fees award was limited to developments involving housing for very low,low or households.the opponents believed the attorney fees proposed were too broad because they included housing projects and,as a result,could allow a fortune home developer of such a project to recover costs and attorney fees from a small city if the developer prevailed in a lawsuit.neither side took the position the bill attorney fees provision covered housing for persons with incomes above the range.
honchariw contentions regarding ab 
honchariw discussion of the legislation that added the attorney fees clause to section k is limited.his opening brief did not mention ab or the contents of any legislative history for that bill.
honchariw reply brief mentions ab and the report to the assembly committee on judiciary relied upon by the defendants.his reply brief asserts that the report elaborates statements of the sponsor expressing concern about housing generally and then quotes parts of two different paragraphs from the sponsor statement.implicit in honchariw argument is that the sponsor statements of concerns about housing generally justify inferences that override the inferences drawn from the portions of the report that directly address the conditions for an award of attorney fees.this type of argument that general statements are a better indicator of intent than specific statements turns the usual approach to determining intent on its head.see,particular expressions qualify those that are general.
analysis for assembly concurrence 
in addition to the legislative history presented by defendant,we will consider the last report or analysis for ab available on the legislative counsel official website.that analysis was prepared for the assembly concurrence in the senate amendments to ab and summarizes the bill as follows strengthens the state affordable housing law by requiring a court to award attorney fees to an affordable housing developer that has had a project unfairly denied by a local agency.assem.bill analysis,conc.in,assem.bill reg.sess.as amended july,italics added.subsequently,the analysis stated that,as passed by the assembly,this bill required a court to award attorney fees and cost of suit to a developer if the court determined that a local agency disapproved housing for very low,low or families or imposed conditions that made the development infeasible without making sufficient findings based on substantial evidence,italics added.
the comments in the analysis reiterate the supporters position that the bill is an attempt to hold local governments accountable for improperly denying housing projects.assem.bill analysis,conc.in,assem.bill reg.sess.as amended july,italics added.the comments also include the statement that the senate amendments are consistent with assembly actions and clarify what the extraordinary circumstances are that allow a court to not award attorney fees.ibid.
the foregoing items of legislative history make clear that when the legislature enacted the attorney fees provision in section k,it was concerned with the wrongful disapprovals of affordable housing projects and intended to address that problem by authorizing developers of affordable housing projects to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs of suit.
next,we turn to the words of the statute to see if those words are compatible with the conclusions we draw from the legislative history.
iv.text of section k 
sentence by sentence 
section k contains four sentences.the most important sentence is the third because it authorizes the award of reasonable attorney fees.next in importance is the second sentence because of the parties disagreement about its affect on the meaning of terms used in the attorney fees provision.the first and fourth sentences are not directly involved in the interpretation of the attorney fees provision 
the second sentence of section k addresses judicial relief available for violations of the housing accountability act and requires courts to issue certain orders with a day deadline when the conditions specified exist 
if in any action brought to enforce the provisions of this section,a court finds that the local agency disapproved a project or conditioned its approval in a manner rendering it infeasible for the development of an emergency shelter,or housing for very low,low,or households,including farmworker housing,without making the findings required by this section or without making sufficient findings supported by substantial evidence,the court shall issue an order or judgment compelling compliance with this section within days,including,but not limited to,an order that the local agency take action on the development project or emergency shelter.k.
this sentence length it contains over a hundred words and structure present complexities,a few of which we must resolve to decide this case.the most important complexity concerns whether the project referred to in the phrase disapproved a project means the disapproval of any housing development or,alternatively,is limited by the subsequent prepositional phrase to projects for the development of an emergency shelter,or housing for very low,low,or households k.
retained jurisdiction and attorney fees 
the third sentence of section k addresses two topics.first,it directs the court to retain jurisdiction so that it can enforce the relief granted in its order or judgment.second,it directs the court to award reasonable attorney fees unless it finds that extraordinary circumstances justify denying the award.the text of the third sentence reads 
the court shall retain jurisdiction to ensure that its order or judgment is carried out and shall award reasonable attorney fees and costs of suit to the plaintiff or petitioner who proposed the housing development or emergency shelter,except under extraordinary circumstances in which the court finds that awarding fees would not further the purposes of this section.k,italics added.
in this appeal,the question is whether honchariw qualifies as the plaintiff or petitioner who proposed the housing development italics added.there is no dispute that honchariw was the applicant for a proposed residential development and was the petitioner who filed and prevailed on the petition for a writ of mandamus consequently,the dispute ultimately concerns whether the statutory phrase the housing development covers honchariw development project,which proposed subdividing land into residential lots and did not include affordable housing.
analysis of attorney fees provision 
the attorney fees provision states that the court shall award reasonable attorney fees and costs of suit to the plaintiff or petitioner who proposed the housing development or emergency shelter,except under extraordinary circumstances k.our consideration of how the term the housing development should be applied in this case leads us to discuss some general points relevant to the interpretation of the attorney fees provision before reaching more specific textual issues.
use of undefined term 
the third sentence of section uses the term housing development,which is not defined by the housing accountability act.in contrast,the term housing development project is expressly defined by subdivision h of section to mean a use consisting of a residential units only,b developments containing residential and certain nonresidential uses,or c transitional or supportive housing because the legislature had the housing development project available and chose not to use it in the third sentence of section k,an inference is created that the legislature did not intend the term housing development to be interpreted to mean housing development project.see code civ,in construing a statute,judges should not insert what the legislature has omitted.consequently,we will not regard the definition of housing development project as controlling.instead,we will treat it as one possible way to interpret the statutory term the housing development.
use of the definitive article the 
the third sentence of section k states that the court shall award reasonable attorney fees and costs of suit to the plaintiff or petitioner who proposed the housing development italics added.the legislature use of the definitive article the is significant because the definite article the refers to a specific person or thing.pineda bank of america,cal th.in contrast,use of the indefinite articles a or an signals a general reference.ibid.
the legislature two uses of the indicate it was referring to a specific type of petitioner and a specific type of housing development.to illustrate this point,the attorney fees provision would have had a different,broader meaning if it awarded fees to a petitioner who proposed a housing development or a petitioner who proposed any housing development.the identity of the specific type of petitioner and the specific type of housing development is not revealed in the language of the attorney fees provision itself.for instance,this is not
