facts and procedural history 
this case arises out of a request for attorney fees and costs in a wrongful death action.respondents leslie reid and keichan lewis filed a wrongful death action as personal representatives of the estate of joan bryan against petitioner saia motor freight line.see saia,so d at.the trial court entered a first amended final judgment on january,in the amount of in favor of respondents and reserve d jurisdiction to award the plaintiff costs and to consider plaintiff claim for attorneys fees upon a determination of entitlement thereto.reid saia motor freight line,ca at cir.order filed.
on march,more than thirty days after entry of the judgment,respondents filed a verified motion to tax costs.the trial court awarded respondents attorney fees in the amount of and costs in the amount of.saia appealed the award of attorney fees and costs however,only the award of costs is at issue in this case because the award of attorney fees was reversed by the third district 
the certified conflict issue involves the interpretation of the court rules and is a question of law subject to de novo review.see smith smith,so d,dca the standard of review regarding the trial court construction of the rules of civil procedure is de novo.it is well settled that the florida rules of civil procedure are construed in accordance with the principles of statutory construction.see generally brown state,so d,our courts have long recognized that the rules of construction applicable to statutes also apply to the construction of rules.
we resolve the conflict by approving the decisions of the second district in gulf landings,the fifth district in wentworth,and the first district in southtrust bank.we quash the decision of the third district in the present case and disapprove that of the fourth district in fisher in respect to the conflict issue.in resolving the conflict,we apply the plain language of florida rule of civil procedure.
the civil procedure rules committee of the florida bar recommended the adoption of rule in.we adopted that rule,effective january.amendments to.rules of civil,so d.rule provides 
any party seeking a judgment taxing costs,attorneys fees,or both shall serve a motion within days after filing of the judgment,including a judgment of dismissal,or the service of a notice of voluntary dismissal.
the committee note to the rule states adoption.this rule is intended to establish a time requirement to serve motions for costs and attorneys fees.in adopting the proposed rule,we stated 
rule is adopted,establishing the time for serving motions for attorneys fees and costs.we add a court commentary clarifying that this rule only establishes time requirements for serving such motions,and in no way affects or overrules the pleading requirements outlined by this court in stockman downs,so d.
amendments to.rules of civil,so d at.
in,before the adoption of rule,we decided gulliver academy,bodek,so d.at the time that we decided gulliver academy,the florida rules of civil procedure did not have a rule setting time requirements within which motions for costs and attorney fees were required to be served.in gulliver academy,we held that a reservation of jurisdiction in a final judgment allowed the trial court to consider further proceedings on the issue of attorney fees even though a motion for fees was filed more than thirty days after the entry of the judgment.we further held that the reservation of jurisdiction in the final judgment was an enlargement of time pursuant to florida rule of civil procedure b.
the third district in the present case and the fourth district in fisher relied on gulliver academy in deciding that when the final judgment contained a reservation of jurisdiction,the time requirement of rule did not apply.fisher,so d at.we do not agree.
when we adopted rule,effective january,we established a time requirement for motions for costs and attorney fees which the rules of civil procedure had not previously contained judge altenbernd correctly made this point stating,in diaz bowen,so d,dca,that r ule was created to establish a rule to resolve the uncertainty surrounding the timing of these posttrial motions,and in gulf landings,so d at,it is no longer enough for parties to plead a basis for fees in their pretrial pleadings.we agree.rule provided the time requirement which the rules did not have at the time gulliver academy was decided,and the rule applies to all cases pending on or filed after january.
conclusion 
we therefore quash the third district decision in this case and remand for further proceedings in accord with this decision.
it is so ordered.
i respectfully dissent.by holding that a reservation of jurisdiction in a judgment to consider attorneys fees and costs is not the procedural equivalent of an order extending the time to file a motion for attorneys fees and costs pursuant to florida rule of civil procedure b,the majority has reached a conclusion contrary to gulliver academy,bodek,so d.
in gulliver academy,we held that a reservation of jurisdiction in a final judgment is procedurally an enlargement of time under rule b,and observed that a ny other interpretation would make the trial court reservation in the final judgment not only a nullity but a procedural trap.id.at.the majority holding in this case has the effect of transforming a reservation of jurisdiction into the nullity and procedural trap we condemned in gulliver academy.id.and to what end in this case,neither party was surprised and neither party was prejudiced by the filing of the motion for attorneys fees and costs beyond the time period set forth in florida rule of civil procedure if the majority concludes that it is best to recede from the reasoning of gulliver academy and strictly interpret the civil rules in all circumstances,this interpretation should be applied prospectively to ensure that all litigants are put on notice.we have on occasion determined that our interpretation of the rules of procedure applicable to the appeal of a civil action filed in this state should be applied prospectively.see employers fire ins.continental ins,so d,t he time for taking an appeal should be governed by the rendition of a formal document of judgment by the trial judge,pursuant to.rule,rather than by the signed entry in a minute book,but the application of this decision with respect to the time for taking appeals shall be prospective only,and it shall not affect appeals pending on the date this decision becomes final.see also boyett state,so d,unless we explicitly state otherwise,a rule of law which is to be given prospective application does not apply to those cases which have been tried before the rule is announced therefore,it was error in coney state,so d,for the court to apply the definition of presence articulated therein to the facts of that case coney,so d at clarifying that presence as used in florida rule of criminal procedure means that a defendant has a right under rule to be physically present at the immediate site where juror challenges are exercised,but stating that our ruling today clarifying this issue is prospective only.
it is not surprising that both the third district in this case and the fourth district in fisher john carter associates,so d dca,believed that the reasoning of gulliver academy applied in determining
