like a contentious corporate merger or a sizable family inheritance,a large contingency fee in a successful lawsuit sometimes leads to nasty controversy over who gets what.this case is a fine example.
from to,recent law school graduate kagy worked as an attorney for solo practitioner steven perles.among her other work,kagy assisted perles with two wrongful death actions brought by perles clients against the government of iran the flatow and eisenfeld cases.perles clients eventually obtained verdicts of more than million in each case.congress used frozen iranian assets to compensate the victims for the compensatory portions of the damages awards more than million in each case.as a result,attorney perles received millions of dollars in contingency fees.perles and kagy had no written contract on how kagy would be paid for her work on these two cases,but kagy claims they had an oral contract entitling her to a share of perles fee in each case.after a bench trial,the district court concluded that the parties had an express oral contract entitling kagy to of perles ultimate fee with respect to the flatow case meaning more than million for kagy for her work on that case,but not with respect to the eisenfeld case.we conclude that perles and kagy did not enter into a contract with respect to kagy work on either case.
during the period relevant to this case,steven perles,an experienced attorney in private practice,owned and ran a law firm in the district of columbia.while she was in law school,kagy earned academic credit as an unpaid clerk for perles.after she graduated in,kagy worked for perles as a paid employee for about five years.during that time,perles and kagy occasionally discussed the terms of kagy compensation.notwithstanding numerous conversations,however,they never put those terms in writing.
before kagy work on the two matters at issue here,her compensation varied from case to case.if the client paid perles by retainer or based on attorney hours worked,perles would pay kagy an hourly rate of up to an hour.kagy work on such matters included,among other things,legal research,drafting pleadings,and preparing exhibits.kagy also assisted perles with about administrative claims matters before the foreign claims settlement commission.in those administrative proceedings,perles represented jewish americans enslaved by the nazis during world war ii.pursuant to statute,perles clients sought to recover certain compensation from a fund administered by the commission.the sums awarded in those proceedings were modest under federal law,moreover,perles maximum fee was only percent of the award.see f.perles in turn paid kagy of his fee in nine successful claims,which earned kagy about from those matters over a period of three years or just over per successful case.
kagy also worked for perles on a contingency fee case,flatow islamic republic of iran.beginning in,perles represented stephen flatow in that matter under a typical arrangement in which perles would receive of any eventual recovery by flatow.perles eventually was joined by thomas fay.flatow claimed that terrorists with ties to the iranian government murdered his daughter.in a tort action filed under the foreign sovereign immunities act,a,flatow sought to recover compensatory and punitive damages from the government of iran.
kagy worked on the flatow case for several years.among other things,she helped prepare the complaint oversaw service of process on iran wrote a comprehensive memo in which she anticipated and analyzed possible defenses and helped draft proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.
as with other cases on which kagy worked,she and perles never put the terms of her compensation for her work on flatow in writing.in march,kagy drafted a written agreement that would have entitled her to of perles fee in the flatow case.as kagy admits,perles told her the draft was all wrong and refused to sign it.district court op.at kagy br.at trial transcript.after perles refused to sign kagy proposal in march,kagy repeatedly but unsuccessfully asked perles to reduce their alleged fee arrangement to writing.district court op.at see also kagy br.at.according to kagy,she and perles discussed the issue while speaking on the telephone in may.during that conversation,kagy asked to be paid more than of perles fee in the holocaust administrative matters.kagy asserts that perles responded that a share of his fee would always be appropriate in his contingency fee cases,including flatow.district court op.at.perles claims that he said no such thing with respect to the flatow case rather,he contends that he planned to pay kagy an elevated hourly rate meaning more than per hour for her work on flatow if they won the case and received a fee.kagy testified that she did not try to prepare a writing to reflect the may telephone conversation because she was concerned that perles would not sign it,just as he had refused to sign the draft she composed in march,and because she did not want to go through that experience again.kagy nonetheless asserted that on numerous occasions after the may exchange,she tried to persuade perles to sit down and work it out,but that perles always refused to do so.
two subsequent developments in the flatow litigation brought perles a huge.first,in march,the trial court entered a default judgment against iran and its because the defendants did not enter an appearance to contest the suit.the court awarded flatow almost million,including million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages.see flatow islamic republic of iran.second,in october,congress enacted legislation to use frozen iranian assets to pay the compensatory damages portion of the flatow judgment.see victims of trafficking and violence protection act of,stat.in january,the treasury paid flatow million,of which perles firm earned about million in attorney fees which perles in turn split evenly with his fay in the case.
in,perles took on a new case,eisenfeld islamic republic of iran.as in flatow,the plaintiffs in eisenfeld sought damages from the iranian government for terrorist attacks against their family members.kagy assisted perles on the eisenfeld case.as with flatow,perles and kagy did not reach a written agreement for kagy compensation on this case.kagy left the firm in,before the eisenfeld case was tried or concluded,although she apparently continued to do some work for perles at a rate of per hour.in july,the trial court found iran liable and awarded damages in excess of million,including million in compensatory damages meaning about million in fees for perles firm to be divided with fay.see eisenfeld islamic republic of iran,d.
upon learning that perles would recover millions of dollars in fees for his work as a result of the legislation freeing up frozen iranian assets,kagy contacted perles by telephone in october to secure her share of the money.the conversations did not go well to put it mildly.shortly thereafter,perles filed suit against kagy in the district court.perles sought a declaratory judgment that he should pay kagy on an hourly basis for her work on the flatow and eisenfeld cases.kagy filed a counterclaim in which she asserted that she and perles had an oral contract entitling her to of perles fees in flatow and eisenfeld.both parties agreed,as they do on appeal,that district of columbia law governs their respective claims.
after a bench trial,the district court found that perles and kagy had an express oral contract entitling kagy to of perles fee in flatow,meaning kagy would recover more than million for her work on that case.in the court judgment,the oral contract did not cover kagy work on eisenfeld nor did the parties have any enforceable contract on eisenfeld.instead,the court ruled that kagy would receive only equitable compensation for her work on the eisenfeld case.the court determined the amount of kagy recovery for her work on eisenfeld by multiplying the number of hours kagy worked on the case by an hourly rate of which was perles average hourly rate.applying this formula,the district court awarded kagy about for her work on eisenfeld.
on appeal,perles contends that the district court erred in concluding that the parties had an enforceable contract on the flatow case.perles further argues that the district court did not apply a correct formula for assessing kagy equitable recovery for her work on eisenfeld.for her part,kagy seeks affirmance of the district court judgment in flatow and as to eisenfeld,kagy claims that the district court erred in concluding that the parties did not have a contract entitling her to of perles fee.
we turn first to the question whether perles and kagy had an enforceable contract for kagy work on the flatow case.relying on kagy testimony about the parties may telephone conversation,the district court found that the parties entered into an oral contract entitling kagy to of perles fee in that case.we review de novo the legal question whether the facts as found by the district court demonstrate the existence of an enforceable contract.see hershon gibraltar loan ass n.we accept the factual findings underlying the district court contract determination unless they are clearly erroneous.id.
under district of columbia law,a valid and enforceable contract requires both intention of the parties to be bound and agreement as to all material terms.see simon circle,see also jack baker,office space dev,georgetown entm t district of columbia.the party asserting the existence of an oral contract has the burden of proving both requirements.see new econ.capital,llc new mkts.capital group.
applying those principles to this case,we conclude for either of two alternative reasons that kagy failed to prove that the parties entered into an enforceable oral contract as to kagy work on the flatow case.first,even assuming that the district court properly credited kagy testimony concerning the may telephone conversation,the evidence presented by kagy does not show that both parties intended to create an enforceable oral contract.second,again accepting kagy own version of the facts,the parties did not agree on two essential elements of the contract how long kagy would have to work on the case and what kind of work she would have to do.
to create an enforceable oral contract,both parties must intend to be bound by their oral representations alone.see new econ.capital,at jack baker,at.an otherwise valid oral agreement does not constitute a contract if either party knows or has reason to know that the other party regards the agreement as incomplete and intends that no obligation shall exist until the whole has been reduced to written form.restatement second of contracts cmt.b osborne howard.physicians,relying on restatement of contracts stansel am.sec.bank,same.the fact that parties contemplate a writing is evidence,therefore,that they do not intend to bind themselves by an oral agreement.see jack baker,at edmund flynn lavay.another factor in determining intent to be bound is the parties conduct after they reach an alleged oral agreement.see duffy duffy,edmund flynn,at see also novecon.enter.fund.under district of columbia law,courts determining whether parties intend to be bound by oral representations consider other factors as well,including whether the amount involved is large or small.jack baker,at.
applying the above principles to this case,we conclude that kagy has not met her burden of proving that she and perles intended to create an oral contract in their may telephone conversation.three considerations support that conclusion the fact that the parties clearly contemplated a written agreement the conduct of the parties after their may telephone conversation and the potentially large amount of money at issue in the alleged oral agreement.
first,the evidence establishes that kagy and perles discussed and contemplated a written agreement.in march,kagy drafted a proposed written contract providing that she would recover of perles fee in flatow.by kagy own admission,perles refused to sign kagy proposal on the ground that it was all wrong.district court op.at.kagy testified that she repeatedly asked perles to reduce their alleged fee arrangement to writing after perles refused to sign kagy proposal in march.about a month after their may telephone exchange,moreover,the parties had a serious altercation arising out of kagy frustration at not having a written fee agreement in place.id.at.the evidence indisputably establishes,therefore,that the parties at various points contemplated a written contract.under settled principles of district of columbia contract that were not addressed by the district court in its fact that the parties contemplated a written agreement suggests that the parties did not intend to be bound by oral representations alone.new econ.capital,at see jack baker,at no oral contract found where i t was unquestioned that a written contract was contemplated as part of the transaction edmund flynn,at parties did not intend to be bound by preliminary oral representations where,among other things,a written contract embodying the completed contract was contemplated arthur linton corbin,corbin on contracts joseph perillo,ed.the fact that the parties contemplate the execution of a document is some evidence,not in itself conclusive,that they intend not to be bound until it is executed.
second,the parties conduct after the may telephone conversation is a separate factor suggesting that the parties did not intend to create an oral contract.perhaps most telling,the trial evidence does not reveal any conduct of the parties after the may conversation that supports kagy assertion that they created a binding contract in that conversation.in fact,kagy testified that she did not draft a written agreement reflecting the terms of the may telephone conversation because she was concerned that perles would not sign it.kagy also testified that on numerous occasions after the may exchange,she tried to persuade perles to sit down and work it out,but perles always refused to do so.the context of kagy statement makes clear that what had to be worked out was kagy compensation in flatow,which suggests that no final agreement had been reached in the may telephone conversation.in short,the evidence of the parties conduct after the may conversation does not indicate that the parties intended to be bound by the conversation.see duffy,at assessing intention to be bound by letter agreement by considering appellant actions during the year and a half after the parties signed the letter edmund flynn,at subsequent negotiations about drafts of a written sales commission agreement reflect the parties intention not to be bound until a formal writing was executed see also novecon.at noting that the subsequent actions taken by both parties is relevant and should be taken into consideration to determine whether a binding contract existed.
third,the potentially large fee award in the flatow case further suggests that perles and kagy did not intend to be bound by their oral conversation.perles client in flatow was eventually awarded more than million in damages from the iranian government.perles has received several million dollars so far in fees and could receive far more in the future if additional assets become available to cover the punitive damages awards.it strains credulity to suggest that perles and kagy,both of whom are attorneys,intended a single,undocumented telephone conversation to give rise to a mutually binding agreement giving a junior attorney the potential right to millions of dollars in compensation for her work.see jack baker,at whether the amount involved is large or small is one factor to consider in determining whether parties entered into an enforceable oral agreement oral representations did not create binding contract where subject of the alleged agreement was a major project,involving a considerable amount of money see also restatement second of contracts cmt.c whether the amount involved is large or small is factor which may be helpful in determining whether a contract has been concluded corbin on contracts the greater the importance of the transaction,the more likely it is that the informal communications are intended to be preliminary only.
to recap,three considerations support the conclusion that the parties did
