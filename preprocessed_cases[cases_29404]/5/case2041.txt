discussion 
pow contends the trial court abused its discretion by finding as a matter of law that pow was not a prevailing party in pow mandamus action.pow maintains that it was the successful party because it achieved a disposition on appeal that required the setting aside of the county approval of the project,even if only temporarily,and there was a significant benefit to the public because the county was forced to prepare an adequate record of the environmental review process.
section provides that 
a court may award attorneys fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if a a significant benefit,whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary,has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons,b the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement,or of enforcement by one public entity against another public entity,are such as to make the award appropriate,and c such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery,if any.

the trial court here concluded there was no prevailing party in pow mandate proceeding.see deane gardenhome denktas th,d typically,a determination of no prevailing party results when both parties seek relief,but neither prevails,or when the ostensibly prevailing party receives only a part of the relief sought.generally,the question of whether a party is a prevailing party is best left to the trial courts.schmier supreme court th,d whether one is a prevailing party for purposes of section is a factual pragmatic inquiry generally left to the trial court nestande watson th,d whether a party has met the statutory requirements for an award of attorney fees is a question best decided by the trial court in the first instance.under the circumstances here,however,we are in as good a position as,and perhaps in a better position than,the trial court to decide the issue because its resolution turns on the import of this court opinion.leiserson city of san diego d.appellate court evaluates public significance of own opinion los angeles police protective league city of los angeles d.appellate court is as well positioned as the trial court to determine if its earlier opinion vindicated an important right affecting the public interest and yielded a significant benefit.
we agree with pow that it was the prevailing party in the mandate proceeding.the case did not result in a stalemate between the parties.reduced to basics,the county was the loser.pow sought an order setting aside the county approval of the project.our opinion directed exactly that result.pow also sought on order setting aside the county certification of the eir.although this court did not direct that result because we did not reach the merits of the issue on appeal,and although the trial court concluded our opinion did not require such a result,we did state that the administrative record as it stood was inadequate to support the certification.this was tantamount to a determination that the certification could not stand on the then current record.on this topic,we pointed out that the final step in the eir process is certification,which affirms that the agency has reviewed the eir and such review complies with ceqa protect our water county of merced,supra,th at,d,and we concluded that the inadequate record made it impossible to confirm that the county made the key findings required by ceqa,let alone confirm that any such findings were supported by substantial evidence id.at,d.we ultimately ordered that the county approval of the project be vacated unless and until this requirement was satisfied.had pow not challenged the county noncompliance with ceqa,albeit on other grounds,we would not have been required to consider the adequacy of the record and therefore would not have rendered the opinion we did.we did not reach the merits of pow claims because there was another ground upon which to grant the requested inadequate substantive record 
for two reasons we disagree with the county that,because pow never complained about the state of the administrative record,there was no causal connection between pow lawsuit and the public benefit incurred.maria riles,supra,cal d at,successful party status requires a causal connection between the plaintiff lawsuit and the relief obtained schmier supreme court,supra,th at,d accord planned pare
