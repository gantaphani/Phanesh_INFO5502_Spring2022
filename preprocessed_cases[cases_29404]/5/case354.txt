opinion of the court 
rule of the federal rules of civil procedure mandates that district courts set forth a judgment on a separate document,apart from any accompanying opinion.the precise definition of that requirement is important because the docketing of a judgment in correct form triggers the beginning of the time period within which an appeal must be filed.misapprehension of rule can be jurisdictionally fatal to an appeal.
the disposition of this appeal turns on precisely that jurisdictional issue.appellant,the okonite company okonite,argues that appellate rule a s period to file an appeal never began to run because the district court failed to comply with rule separate document requirement.for the reasons set forth below,we disagree with okonite interpretation of rule.we find that okonite has not timely appealed the district court original rulings.accordingly,we have no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal of those rulings.the only ruling properly before us is okonite timely appeal from the district court more recent judgment awarding plaintiff attorneys fees.we will vacate that judgment and remand for further proceedings.
in,plaintiff local of the international brotherhood of electrical workers local brought suit against okonite under the worker adjustment retraining and notification act warn act,claiming that okonite failed to provide the notice of a plant closing that the statute requires on june,the district court granted summary judgment for local and awarded it reasonable attorneys fees.we reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings.local union okonite,cir.
back before the district court,the parties renewed their for summary judgment.the district court denied them,and the case went to trial.after a jury returned a verdict in its favor,local filed motions for attorneys fees,costs,and prejudgment interest.okonite opposed local motions and for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure b or,alternatively,a new trial under federal rule of civil procedure.
the district court issued an opinion,dated may,in which it denied okonite rule and motions for judgment as a matter of law or a new trial denied local motion for prejudgment interest granted in part and denied in part local motion for attorneys fees and costs and referred local application for attorneys fees and costs to a magistrate judge to determine the total amount of fees and costs that was reasonable.the comprehensive opinion was accompanied by a order,dated may.the clerk of the court separately entered the opinion and order on the docket on may,
after the referral by the district court,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation on september.she recommended that the district court a award local in attorneys fees for the period since july,and b deny,without prejudice,local request for costs for failing to comply with local civil rule a.local objected to the magistrate judge report and recommendation on the grounds that the magistrate judge wrongly excluded the time local attorneys spent working on okonite appeal from the initial decision granting local summary judgment.
in papers filed on october,okonite opposed local objection.in addition,also on october,okonite filed a motion requesting that the district court enter what okonite termed three separate final judgments,pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure,for the denial of okonite rule and motions,the denial of local motion for prejudgment interest,and the partial denial and partial grant of local motion for attorneys fees and costs.okonite also urged the district court to exercise its discretion under rule and order that local motion for attorneys fees have the same effect under rule a of the federal rules of appellate procedure as a timely motion under rule.
on november,the parties motions were pending before the district court and days after the district court may filed a notice of appeal from several of the district court orders from before,during,and after the trial.okonite principal argument in that appeal is that the district court erred by denying its rule motion for judgment as a matter of law.
local filed a motion with this court,arguing that we should dismiss okonite appeal as untimely.local also protectively the district court denial of prejudgment interest,but acknowledged that its appeal is also untimely if we dismiss okonite appeal.
meanwhile,in a january,opinion,the district court rejected the magistrate judge recommendation to exclude the hours local attorneys spent working on the appeal from the initial summary judgment decision,and the court accepted the magistrate judge recommended hourly attorneys fees rate.the district court further denied okonite motion for separate judgments under rule and declined to order that local motion for attorneys fees be treated like a rule motion for purposes of extending when the time to file a notice of appeal would begin to run.okonite timely filed a notice of appeal from the january,decision on february.
to summarize,we have before us okonite november,appeal,local motion to dismiss the november,appeal,local,and okonite february,appeal.both parties agree that okonite appeal from the district court final attorneys fees determination decided in the january,decision is properly before us,and we address it below.the primary question we must decide,however,is the timeliness of okonite november,appeal,which okonite filed more than six months after the district court may opinion and order.that issue underlies both local motion to dismiss okonite november,appeal and okonite appeal from the district court january,order denying okonite motions for separate judgments and for an order extending the time for appeal.
federal rule of appellate procedure a requires that a notice of appeal be filed with the district clerk within thirty days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.fed.a a with regard to an appeal from a jury verdict,the thirty days does not begin to,entry of judgment has not the judgment is set forth in a separate document pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure and the clerk of the court enters the judgment into the civil docket pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a.see fed.a united states fiorelli,cir diamond mckenzie.
but the matter is not so simple.certain a and rule motions,for example,as well as rule attorneys fees motions if the district court extends the time to appeal under rule postpone the time to appeal from a jury verdict.see fed.a a.when such motions are timely filed with the district court,the thirty days begins to run upon entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.fed.a a 
here,judgment was entered from the jury verdict on february,and the parties timely filed motions.local rule motion for attorneys fees did not toll the time for appeal,because the district court never extended the time to appeal pursuant to rule consequently,the time to appeal began to run upon entry of the order disposing of the parties remaining motions.
the parties dispute when that occurred indeed,they dispute if that occurred.as we explained above,the district court issued its opinion rejecting the motions on may.the opinion was accompanied by the order also described above,and the clerk of the court entered them separately in the docket on may.if these series of events constituted entry of the order disposing of the motions,then appellate rule a period for filing a notice of appeal began on may,and ended june.see fed.and if the deadline for filing the appeal was june,then okonite notice of appeal,filed on november,was woefully untimely and we lack jurisdiction to hear the appeal 
okonite argues,however,that entry of the order disposing of the motions never occurred.to maintain this position,okonite seizes upon rule separate document requirement,which provides that a judgment is effective only when set forth on a separate document.the district court failed to do so,okonite contends,and appellate rule a time period therefore never began to run.
a necessary predicate to okonite argument is that rule separate document requirement applies to motions,and not just to the underlying verdict.th
