the opinion filed november,is hereby superseded by the amended opinion below.
pursuant to bankruptcy code section b appellant creditors petitioned the bankruptcy court to recover legal fees incurred in connection with filing an involuntary chapter petition against the debtor.the bankruptcy court denied the fees,but the bankruptcy appellate panel of the ninth circuit bap reversed,ruling that the creditors attorneys were eligible under section b for compensation for their services in connection with the involuntary petition.the trustee appeal of that decision was voluntarily dismissed.the instant appeal is from the bap subsequent order denying the creditors motion for fees on appeal.the creditors argue that section b entitles them to attorney fees for the successful appeal of the lower court decision.we agree,and hold that it was error for the bap to deny the fee motion without explaining that the denial was without prejudice to filing the appropriate section b fee request in the bankruptcy court.
d grants us jurisdiction to hear this appeal.we vacate the bap denial of the fee award and remand with instructions to clarify that the bap denial of the fee request is without prejudice to the creditors seeking a section b award from the bankruptcy court in compliance with proper procedures.
factual background and procedural 
in december,salomon north america,north sports,and nitro collectively the petitioning creditors filed an involuntary chapter petition against the debtor,wind n wave.an order for relief was entered by the bankruptcy court in march of the next year,and a trustee was appointed.in april,the attorneys for petitioning creditors,the law offices of david bloom,filed an application for payment of their fees under section b of the bankruptcy code.the bankruptcy court denied the request.it declined to follow the ninth circuit bap opinion in in re sedona institute,cir.bap and held that a creditor was not entitled to attorney fees under section b when it has not incurred an allowable expense under section b.
the petitioning creditors appealed to the ninth circuit bap.the bap,reversing the bankruptcy court decision,held that sedona was controlling and that an independent allowable expense claim under b is not a prerequisite to an award of reasonable fees under b.in re wind n wave,at quoting sedona,at.the bap remanded to the lower court to determine appropriate fees.id.at.in a motion decided a month later,the bap summarily denied the creditors request to have the bap award fees incurred in the bap appeal it did not explain that its decision was without prejudice to the creditors filing a fee application in the bankruptcy court.the creditors now seek the attorney fees incurred in appealing the fee award to the bap,as well as their fees and costs incurred in bringing the instant appeal.
discussion 
though this court generally reviews bap decisions de novo,in re am.wagering,cir,a bap finding regarding an entity eligibility for attorney fees is reviewed for abuse of discretion,in re del mission,cir.an erroneous interpretation of a statute is an abuse of discretion,see,koon united states,d,and we review de novo questions of law presented by a bap statutory construction.see in re nucorp energy,cir in re sedona,at.
this appeal presents an issue of first impression and turns on the interpretation of bankruptcy code section b,which governs compensation for creditors attorneys in bankruptcy cases.section is entitled allowance of administrative expenses and subsection b provides for certain priority expenses to be paid out of the debtor estate.section b a,in combination with b,grants creditors costs incurred in connection with filing an involuntary bankruptcy petition.see b a b.subsection b specifically allows compensation for services rendered by a creditor attorney,and sets forth compensation standards that mirror those governing fee awards for debtors attorneys under section a of the bankruptcy code.
the statute is silent regarding expenses incurred by a creditor in appealing or defending a lower court award or denial of fees however,we do not find,as respondents urge us to,that statutory silence forecloses a fee award here.along with other circuits,we have granted compensation for litigation over a fee award under fee shifting statutes even when those statutes did not expressly allow for it.see,southeast legal defense group adams,cir holding that authorizes the grant of attorneys fees for services on appeal though statute does not specifically so provide relying on hutto finney,d manhart los angeles dep t of water power,cir holding that plaintiffs are entitled to attorney fees for time spent litigating the fees issue on appeal under title vii attorney fee provision citing williams alioto,cir hairston r r apartments,cir remanding for fees for services performed on appeal under the attorney fees provision of the fair housing act c,which only allows for reasonable attorney fees in the case of a prevailing plaintiff prandini national tea,cir a ttorneys are entitled to be compensated for time spent successfully appealing the first fee award under title vii.
we have applied the logic from these cases in the bankruptcy context and held that,in certain situations,debtors attorneys are entitled to compensation from the bankruptcy estate for fee award preparation and litigation,notwithstanding statutory silence on the subject.see in re smith,cir,abrogated on other grounds by lamie united states,d nucorp.the same rationale applies in the instant case,and leads us to conclude that the bap erred by not clarifying that its action in denying creditors motion for fees incurred on appeal was without prejudice to petitioning creditors filing the appropriate application under section b in the bankruptcy court pursuant to proper procedures 
ii.nucorp and smith 
in in re nucorp energy,we held that the bankruptcy court erred in concluding that services related to the preparation and presentation of attorney fee applications were not compensable under section a.the bankruptcy court had awarded debtor counsel compensation and reimbursements in the full amounts requested,with the exception of fees incurred in preparing the fee applications.the court reasoned that time devoted to fee application preparation should not be compensable because such efforts benefit only the law firm and not the estate.nucorp,at.
we disagreed,and reversed,holding that a fee award was necessary to adequately compensate bankruptcy counsel.focusing on the language of the statute,which provides that counsel be compensated based on the time,the nature,the extent,and the value of the services and the cost of comparable services in cases,id.at,and citing legislative history,we explained that the purpose of section a was to ensure adequate compensation for bankruptcy attorneys so that highly qualified specialists would not be forced to abandon the practice of bankruptcy law in favor of more remunerative kinds of legal work.id.at.accordingly,we found that it was both inconsistent with the policy of the bankruptcy reform act and fundamentally inequitable to demand that counsel prepare and present extensive fee applications and yet simultaneously deny compensation for the efforts necessary to comply with those requirements.id.at.moreover,in dicta,we stressed that litigation over a fee award should also be compensable,otherwise fee awards would be diluted if an attorney is required to expend time litigating his fee claim,yet may not be compensated for that time,the attorney effective rate for all the hours expended on the case will be correspondingly decreased.id.at quoting prandini,at.dilution is precisely the result that statutory fee award provisions are designed to prevent.id.at.
in in re smith,cir,we again endorsed the rationale and applied it in a case involving litigation over a fee award.in smith,the debtor challenged fees awarded to attorneys for services arising out of the successful defense of the initial fee award.id.at.relying on nucorp,we affirmed the award.id.at.while recognizing that section a was silent as to the issue of compensation for litigation of fee applications,we noted that nuc
