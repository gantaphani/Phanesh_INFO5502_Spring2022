factual and procedural background 
charnley purchased tracts and,both in templeton,for the purpose of subdividing them.michelle smith,a licensed real estate agent with country real estate,was charney exclusive real estate agent.she assisted charnley in purchasing tract and buying or selling approximately other properties.a standard california association of realtors car purchase agreement was used for his purchase of tract.
in december of,smith entered into two exclusive authorization and right to sell agreements with charnley to sell lots,and in tract and townhome units to be constructed on tract.charnley instructed her to list the three lots and the homes to be constructed on tract for a sales price of each,and the townhome units in tract for a sales price of.when smith signed the exclusive listings for these properties,charnley did not tell her that he did not have the department of real estate approval for these subdivisions,as evidenced by a final public report.charnley did not receive the final public report until december.
in february of,the blackburns contacted smith and discussed the three lots available in tract.smith provided them with a sheet describing the standard features of the homes to be constructed on the three lots,the site plans,the floor plan callouts,and elevation plans.the blackburns decided to make an offer on lot at the purchase price of.the home was to consist of square feet,with three bedrooms and two bathrooms.the blackburns offer asked that the seller pay closing costs and include rain gutters.with smith assistance,the blackburns made their offer on a standard preprinted purchase and sale agreement used by car.smith then communicated the offer to charnley,who countered with an increased purchase price of.chris blackburn testified that she and her husband agreed to that price,inserted it into the preprinted purchase and sale agreement,and the couple and charnley signed the agreement.the purchase agreement provided that the couple would deposit into escrow once construction begins,seller would pay of the buyers closing costs,and escrow would close upon completion of construction.
a few days later,the parties executed a document entitled amendment to real estate deposit receipt,which refers to the contract dated between charnley as seller and the blackburns as buyers.this amendment provided in part that the buyers were aware that they were purchasing a to be completed spec home and not a custom home and plans were provided to the buyers for information purposes only and changes in detail specific layouts and dimensions of the residence may be necessitated during construction.
in march of,william and patti van orden not parties to this action submitted an offer to purchase lot for,the price advertised in the standard features sheet.they were assisted by sheryle machado,a licensed real estate associate of country real estate,and received a site plan for lot,floor plan callouts,elevation callouts,and a map of the lots.the van ordens purchase agreement was identical to the blackburns and was written on the same standardized form used by car.machado inserted as a contingency of the sale that,upon receipt of the public report,a deposit of would be paid by the buyer,contingent upon the buyer approval of the public report.she received a copy of the offer back from michelle smith signed by andrew charnley.ultimately,the van ordens paid for their house,due to nearly in upgrades and extra landscaping.these adjustments appear on change orders,dated january,which reference the march car form purchase contract.
in march of,respondents jeffery and laurie thomas submitted an offer for lot on tract with the assistance of sheryle machado.the thomases were also given charnley standard features sheet,site and elevation plans,and floor plans for the house to be built on lot.their purchase agreement consisted of the same standardized car form used by the blackburns and the van ordens.in april of,the thomases received a counteroffer from charnley,increasing the purchase price to.they executed the agreement at the increased price.their purchase agreement states that charnley agreed to sell them real property in templeton described as lot,old country road,that the thomases would deposit into escrow upon receipt and approval of the public report and the closing date would be determined once construction began.the agreement incorporated by reference the standard features sheet provided to the thomases.
michelle smith testified that she ultimately sold all but one of the townhomes on tract.pursuant to charnley request,she delivered the car purchase agreements to the bank for his use in obtaining a construction loan.she testified that charnley never discussed taking reservations on tracts or and she has never taken a reservation in her career.she sold other developments for charnley prior to selling the instant lots.one such development was on delores lane in templeton.she used the same documents for that development as in the instant case,a standard features sheet,site and floor plans,and elevation plans.
over the next year,construction did not start on any house in tract.the blackburns contacted smith frequently for the status of the start date for construction and the reason for the delays.smith testified that,in june of,charnley gave her a letter indicating that he could not perform the contracts on lots,and.he stated that due to construction costs and delays,he could not build the homes at the prices for which he sold them.
at the end of june,charnley called a meeting with the blackburns and smith.at that meeting,charnley told the blackburns that he had failed to obtain a public report for tract from the department of real estate before entering into the purchase agreement and,therefore,the agreement was neither valid nor binding.he asked the blackburns to renegotiate the purchase price to or,alternatively,offered to buy them out of the transaction.the blackburns refused to renegotiate the purchase price and the meeting ended.at that time,charnley did not mention that he believed the purchase contracts were in reality nonbinding reservations.
charnley then asked smith to contact the thomases to buy them out of their contract.a settlement was attempted with the thomases but failed after charnley refused to complete a provision concerning confidentiality of the transaction.
construction finally began on the homes in approximately september of.evidence presented at trial demonstrated that,during the construction delay,the real estate market appreciated significantly.the homes were completed in approximately february of.renters were ultimately placed in the homes on lots and in july of.
in october of,the blackburns initiated this action,and the thomases filed suit in march of.the couples concomitantly recorded notices of a pending action lis pendens on the properties.charnley answered and filed a against country real estate and michelle smith.the trial court consolidated the actions,severed charnley against the real estate broker and agent,and conducted a trial on the complaints.
jeffery thomas testified that when construction did not begin as expected on their home,he and his wife purchased a smaller,older home for a higher price.he did so for the tax advantage of owning a home.he stated that he and his wife always intended to move into their new home on lot and to sell the older one.
stanton mcdonald,a real estate appraiser,conducted an appraisal of the thomases home on lot.as of march of the time of purchase,he appraised the square foot home at.in december of,he appraised it at.lisa marrs,a licensed real estate associate employed by bjerre and garcia realty,testified that she conducted a rental analysis for the homes on lots and.she opined the fair rental value of each home was between and per month for the entire year of.
james donegan,testified that his law firm obtained the final public report for tract in december of.he testified that a reservation instrument is routinely used to reserve a lot for future purchase until the final tract map is approved.unlike the car purchase agreement executed by the parties,the reservation instrument clearly states,this is not an offer or contract to purchase or sell.
at trial,charnley maintained that he had simply entered into reservations for the homes on lots and,and there was,consequently,no mutual assent or meeting of the minds between the parties.he also maintained the agreements could not be specifically enforced because the terms were not sufficiently certain.he testified that michele smith proposed taking nonbinding reservations for the lots on tract.he acknowledged giving her an exclusive listing to sell the lots and that she brought him offers.he testified that she told him it was a nonbinding agreement,as long as we did take any money and we did open up an escrow.he testified that construction delays led to increased construction costs and he could not go through with the agreements for either tract or without losing too much money.
charnley testified that in june of,he felt the lots on tract were valued at to.he believed the house on lot at the time of its completion was worth,and the square footage had increased from to.he believed the house on lot was worth.
after taking the case under submission,the trial court ordered specific performance of the agreements with the blackburns and thomases.the court found that charnley entered into purchase contracts with these couples without first obtaining approval from the department of real estate,the contracts were voidable only by the aggrieved purchasers pursuant to government code section,and the buyers elected not to rescind them.the court found that the motivating factor for charnley listing the property and obtaining residential purchase agreements was to obtain construction financing.the court disbelieved charnley claim of mistake concerning the effectiveness of the purchase agreements,reasoning that charnley knew what he was doing and he did not believe the car purchase agreements were reservations or nonbinding agreements.the court found that he knew it was illegal to sell subdivided lands without first obtaining a final public report from the department of real estate commissioner,and he believed he could take unfair advantage of his own failure to comply with business and professions code section if he subsequently elected at his whim to avoid the agreements in order to make a larger profit.he was wrong.
the court further found that charnley had not relied on any representation of michelle smith or her supervisor,thomas erskine,that the purchase agreements were not binding.the court reasoned that charnley signed exclusive listing agreements with smith to sell the property months before he applied for approval from the department of real estate,he had the ability to seek legal advice,he chose not to do so,and allegedly relied upon a salesperson a layperson,which was not reasonable.the court reasoned that under the objective test for contracts,charnley undisclosed intention of avoiding the contracts,if he chose to do so,did not prevent the formation of enforceable contracts.
the court rejected all of charnley defenses to the request for specific performance.the court found the contracts were sufficiently certain to support a decree of specific performance in that they were for a specified lot in a specified tract.although the lots were not specifically delineated by metes and bounds,they were sufficiently identified.this was open ground the fact that a lot boundary might be a few feet one way or another was irrelevant.smith obtained floor plans and elevations.these,along with the standard features sheet,which was given to both sets of plaintiffs when they executed the agreements,gave enough detail.these were not custom homes.plaintiffs were satisfied to accept the general specifications given them.moreover,the court reasoned,the homes were fully constructed at the time of trial and the couples were willing to accept them as is.
the court found the consideration for the purchases adequate at the time of contracting as demonstrated by the testimony of the appraiser.the court found that a balance of the hardships caused by granting specific performance favored the buyers,that charnley should bear any loss caused by the delay in construction,and that the buyers were not unjustly enriched by the increased value of the real estate,because,had the sale been completed on time,they would have received the same benefit.
the court further found that the blackburns and thomases had tendered performance of their obligations under the purchase agreements,but charnley had refused it.the court noted that charnley had never notified the blackburns or the thomases that construction had commenced,he never asked for the deposits,he never provided the thomases with the public report,and when the blackburns and thomases offered their deposits,charnley refused to accept them.
finally,the court determined that the blackburns and thomases were entitled to the lost rental value of the homes per month per home from the date they were rented out july of through the date of trial,a total of to each couple.
the blackburns and thomases subsequently moved for an award of attorney fees under the terms of their agreements.the court granted the motion,awarding the blackburns and the thomases as attorney fees.
discussion 
availability of a decree of specific performance 
charnley contends the trial court erred in entering a decree of specific performance because the legal descriptions in the purchase agreements were not sufficiently certain and definite to be enforceable.charnley argues that no legal description for the properties existed at the time the agreements were executed,there was no metes and bounds description,and the square footage and precise location of the lot lines could not be determined.
