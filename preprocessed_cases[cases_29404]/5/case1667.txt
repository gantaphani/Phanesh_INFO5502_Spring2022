plaintiffs joe and marieanne cullen stated alternate that alleged defendants paul and geraldine corwin acted either negligently or fraudulently in failing to disclose the defective condition of the garage roof when the corwins sold a vacation home to the cullens 
the corwins moved for summary judgment on the ground that the statute of limitations had expired.the trial court granted the motion and entered judgment in their favor.it subsequently granted their motion to recover in legal fees as costs,pursuant to a provision in the standard form purchase agreement.the cullens filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment and order.
the cullens contend there are triable issues of fact regarding the accrual of their cause of action,and assert the trial court abused its discretion in any event in failing to grant leave to amend their pleading to state a theory of breach of a written contract.they also assert among other arguments that there is a procedural bar to the recovery of legal fees because the corwins failed to agree to mediation,which is a condition precedent under the purchase agreement for recovery of legal fees.we shall affirm the judgment for the reasons stated in the unpublished part of the opinion and reverse the order awarding legal fees.
factual and procedural background 
the cullens filed a form complaint in september.they filed a first amended complaint by form pleading in january.in the count asserting general negligence,they alleged defendants failed to properly investigate and disclose the condition of the garage roof at the property it was not until plaintiffs were in possession of the property that the deficiency was revealed.their discovery of the true defective condition of the roof and a portion of its history was not complete until less than three years from the filing of this action.italics added.the cullens reiterated this delayed discovery in the count asserting fraud based on the failure to disclose the defect despite a duty to do so,adding that before december,plaintiffs did not have an understanding of the nature and extent of the damage to the garage roof and had not discovered a portion of the history of the defective condition of the roof.italics added.
the pleading artfully omits any other facts regarding the actual date of the transaction,and therefore the issue of the limitations period does not appear on the face of the complaint.this absolved the cullens of the obligation to plead the factual basis for the claim of delayed discovery.witkin,supra,pleading.the corwins answer,however,made the customary boilerplate allegation of the affirmative defense of the statute of limitations,which frames it as a material issue in the case.
the parties posit a statute of limitation for the claim of negligence,though misidentifying the nature of the actual cause of action.the cullens characterized it below as an action for injury to real property,and the corwins agreed in reply that such causes of action are subject to a limitations period citing code civ,subd.b however,the cullens are not alleging that the corwins injured the property in some manner.they are alleging that the corwins negligently failed to identify and disclose a defect in the property.this is a negligent misrepresentation,which is a species of fraud oakland raiders oakland alameda county coliseum,th,and thus subject to the same statute of limitations as the cullens claim of fraud three years from discovery of facts that constitute the fraud,subd.d witkin,supra,actions.
a plaintiff ignorance of the facts constituting the fraud or negligent misrepresentation of itself is insufficient to prevent the accrual of the cause of action.a plaintiff must establish facts showing ignorance and the inability to discover the true facts earlier u nder this rule,constructive and presumed notice or knowledge are equivalent to knowledge.so,when the plaintiff has notice or information of circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry,the statute commences to run.witkin,supra,actions,subd.
the cullens bought the subject property in april.at the time,the corwins provided a disclosure statement that noted there were cracks in the decking on the garage roof resulting in leakage.a home inspector that the broker had commissioned also noted unspecified water damage in the ceiling.however,when the cullens asked about patching in the garage ceiling,the corwins attributed this to the need to keep the caulking around the railing posts on the deck in good order and did not indicate any ongoing problem with leakage.the cullens disregarded the disclosure as a result.
in march,the cullens began to notice water pooling on the garage roof,which leaked a lot and damaged the sheetrock on the ceiling and the walls.they filed a claim with their insurer,who agreed to pay for replacement of the sheetrock.the cullens were not aware of the cause of the leaks.they received about on their insurance claim.they found it difficult to get a contractor to come and evaluate the roof,but in the summer of one finally gave them an opinion that the roof was bowing because it lacked a beam to support the weight of the concrete deck.
in august,an attorney representing the cullens sent a letter to the corwins.in the letter,the attorney asserted,at the time of the purchase,cullen was told that the patching on the garage ceiling was not the sign of any serious water intrusion,but that he simply needed to keep caulking material around the wooden posts.this has proved to be completely false it now develops that water stands on the roof it appears that this problem has been going on since the deck was built.in fact,the builder had to replace a beam in the garage.the beam is now bowed.the net result is that repairs are necessary to the property.the cost is estimated to be in the range of in any event t he corwins had to have been well aware of the defect and did not disclose it.italics added.
in parallel declarations in support of their opposition to the summary judgment motion,the cullens make the murky allegation that i t was not until substantially later,toward the end of,that they learned the nature of the corwins issues with the garage roof while they owned the subject property.italics added.in his deposition testimony,joe cullen stated he had spoken with a neighbor about the problems he was having with the roof,though he could not recall the exact month.the neighbor told him that the corwins had ongoing problems with the roof from its original construction.they had forced the builder to make repairs,and contrary to the builder recommendation insisted that he reconstruct it as a flat roof.the neighbor also had repeated the secondhand hearsay from a couple of carpenters who were residents of the community and had worked on the roof they said that it was not properly engineered to support the weight of a concrete deck.the cullens completed their repairs in august.
the trial court cited the august letter from the cullens attorney in granting summary judgment in favor of the corwins.it pointed to the assertions that the cullens were then aware of a history of leaks since the home was built,and thus they were aware at that time of the undisclosed defect.
this is the extent of the record pertinent to the issue of the statute of limitations.we include facts pertinent to the appeal from the order awarding legal fees in part iv.of the discussion.
standard of review 
under our de novo review of a motion for summary judgment rio linda,supra,th at,we first identify the material issues as framed in the pleadings.we then determine whether the evidence of the moving parties entitles them prima facie to judgment in their behalf on these issues.finally,we consider whether any of the opposing evidence creates a factual conflict with respect to any of these issues,which only a trier of fact can resolve.ibid.we can merge the latter two steps in this case,because even if the parties dispute their legal significance,they do not claim there are any disputes about material historical facts.
ii.statute of limitations 
the reasoning of the cullens boils down to this it was not until substantially later,toward the end of,that t
