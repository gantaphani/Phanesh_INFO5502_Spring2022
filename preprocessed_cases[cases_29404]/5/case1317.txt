factual procedural background 
in,in preparation for the summer olympic games,the department formulated a plan to regulate the sale of newspapers through newsracks in atlanta airport.had it been implemented,the plan would have governed the placement and allocation among publishers of newsracks in the airport,required use of newsracks that displayed advertising,and charged the publishers rent of per newsrack per month.the publishers filed a lawsuit in federal district court challenging the plan on first amendment grounds,and they were granted a preliminary injunction against its implementation.the preliminary injunction was subsequently clarified,modified and extended in duration.
in july,the department moved to dissolve the preliminary injunction and filed a new plan to be implemented once the injunction was dissolved.the plan proposed a rent of per month for the use of newsracks and per month for placement of newsracks.in october,while the preliminary injunction was still in force,the parties filed for summary judgment concerning the plan.in june,the district court denied the department motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction and declined to consider the plan because it found that the plan was not properly at issue in the litigation.ajc i,d at.in finding that it could not properly review the plan,the district court found that the pleadings had not been amended to put the plan at issue and that discovery on the constitutionality of the plan might be necessary.id.
in july,after mediation and other settlement negotiations failed to resolve the case,the district court ruled on the for summary judgment.the district court declared the plan unconstitutional and issued a permanent injunction that barred the department from 
forcing publishers to use newsracks bearing advertisements for other products 
requiring publishers to pay a fee that was not tied to the department costs in administering the newsrack plan but was instead and 
vesting unbridled discretion in the person or persons responsible for selecting which publications may be placed in newsracks or which publishers may continue to maintain newsracks at the airport.

the department appealed,contending that the plan was constitutional in all respects.a panel of this court affirmed the district court but noted that its holding on the second prong of the injunction dealing with the fees charged publishers was dictated by circuit precedent that the court might consider revisiting en banc.atlanta journal constitution city of atlanta dep t of aviation ajc iii,cir.
the court did rehear the case en banc.in february,the en banc court affirmed the district court on the first and third prongs of the injunction but reversed as to the second prong,holding that the department could charge licensing fees that were because the department was acting in a proprietary capacity,rather than a regulatory capacity.ajc iv.the en banc court decided that the department can impose a fee on the use of newsracks in the airport,but the discretion surrounding such fee must be restrained through procedures or instructions designed to reduce or eliminate the possibility of viewpoint discrimination.id.at.the cases were remanded to the district court for formulation of a plan incorporating these restrictions.the court said upon remand,the district court should not be precluded from considering the city claim,if any,for lost revenues from enjoined fees that we have determined were constitutionally permissible id.
on remand,the department submitted a new newsrack plan to the district court.the district court found that this new plan was not violative of the permanent injunction,as modified by the eleventh circuit en banc opinion.the district court then addressed the department request for restitution and the publishers requests for attorneys fees and costs 
the district court granted the department restitution for the rent it was prevented from collecting because of the injunction,calculated at per newsrack per month the rental fee in the plan minus a cost recovery fee because the publishers provided the newsracks themselves rather than using racks provided by the department,plus simple interest at per annum.atlanta journal constitution city of atlanta dep t of aviation ajc v,d.the restitution ordered was from the atlanta journal constitution from the new york times and from usa today.id.

ii.issues on appeal contentions of the parties 
the department raises two issues on appeal whether the district court committed reversible error in ordering restitution calculated at per month per newsrack and whether the district court committed reversible error by awarding the publishers of their attorneys fees and costs.
the department argues that both the restitution and attorneys fee awards rest on an erroneous factual finding by the district,during the course of the litigation,the department could have withdrawn the plan and implemented a new plan that addressed the constitutional problems with the plan.the department contends that this factual finding is clearly erroneous because it fails to account for the restrictions placed upon the department by the preliminary and permanent injunctions themselves,in particular the restriction against implementation of a plan that would charge a fee.the department further argues that the attorneys fees and costs awarded to the publishers were not discounted sufficiently to account for the department success on what it now argues was the main issue in the the department could char
