eddie jordan,district attorney for orleans parish,louisiana,appeals the jury verdict and damages awarded against him,in his official capacity,for intentional discrimination on the basis of race against staff in his office,in violation of title vii of the civil rights act,et and.ann.louisiana employment discrimination law.primarily at issue is whether sufficient evidence supports the verdict and compensatory damages.plaintiffs seek attorney fees for this appeal.affirmed and remanded for determination of attorney fees.
in november,jordan was elected district attorney da for orleans parish,which primarily consists of new orleans,louisiana.shortly thereafter,he appointed a transition team,which compiled a report of its recommendations for jordan in his new position.the report included a report recommending,within days of his taking office,jordan hiring a staff reflective of new orleans racial composition.this recommendation was based on a jordan campaign promise.
the transition team also formed a staff development and retention committee,with stephanie butler serving as chairperson.in early december,before jordan took office,the staff in the da office were instructed that,if they wanted to continue working there during jordan tenure,to schedule an interview and submit a current resume.plaintiffs did so.
butler,other members of her committee,and volunteers she selected,all of whom are black,conducted the interviews.materials prepared for the process reflected interviewees were to be told t he interviewers want ed to review their background,hear about their qualifications and skills,and anything else they like to tell them,and to basically get a feel for them and their work ethic.the interviewees were evaluated through a numeric system based on their responses to the same seven questions.
butler recommendations,however,were not based on the interview evaluations.they resulted in the termination of plaintiffs,all of whom are white,except one who is hispanic.in response,plaintiffs filed charges with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,claiming jordan fired them,inter alia,because of their race.in responding to the eeoc,jordan asserted butler committee had not considered race,but had considered,among other things,performance,employee efficiency,and previous experience in its determination of which employees would be retained.after investigating the claims,the eeoc found there was reasonable cause to believe jordan,through his termination decisions,had discriminated against plaintiffs because of their race.as a result of the eeoc issuing a letter,plaintiffs pursued their claims in district court.
at trial in,the jury returned a verdict for plaintiffs,finding jordan,in his official capacity,had discriminated against plaintiffs on the basis of race,in violation of title vii,and the louisiana employment discrimination law and jordan would have terminated eight plaintiffs even if race had not been a motivating factor.the judgment included monetary damages,including compensatory damages,for those plaintiffs terminated solely because of race.decorte jordan,amended judgment see also decorte jordan,no,wl may.
at issue are whether sufficient evidence supports the verdict the district court erred in both admitting eeoc determinations and ruling a report constituted an plan admission of testimony is reversible error and sufficient evidence supports those damages statements in plaintiffs closing argument are reversible error and plaintiffs should be awarded appellate attorney fees.
jordan first contends plaintiffs failed to prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,a violation of title vii,or the louisiana employment discrimination law.claims of racial discrimination in employment,pursuant to and the louisiana employment discrimination law,are governed by the same analysis as that employed for such claims under title vii.anderson douglas lomason,cir motton lockheed martin,so d,writ denied,so d louisiana law.
accordingly,plaintiffs were required to establish,by a preponderance of the evidence,a prima facie case of racial discrimination by showing they were members of a protected group they were qualified for the positions they held they suffered an adverse employment action,such as termination and they were replaced by individuals outside the protected class.see manning chevron chem,llc,cir.upon doing so,the burden shifted to jordan to rebut plaintiffs prima facie case by articulating a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for his actions.id.if jordan met this burden,it shifted to plaintiffs to show his proffered reason is a pretext for discrimination.id.
on appeal,a verdict must be upheld unless,pursuant to de novo review,a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find as it did.fed.civ.a.the reviewing court draws all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant,disregard ing all evidence favorable to the moving party that the jury is not required to believe.reeves sanderson plumbing,d.credibility determinations,the weighing of the evidence,and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions,not those of a judge.id.at.quoting anderson liberty lobby,d.
it goes without saying that,when a claim has been fully tried,as has this one,this court need not parse the evidence into discrete segments corresponding to a prima facie case,an articulation of a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the employer decision,and a showing of pretext.bryant compass group usa,cir quoting vaughn sabine county,cir,cert.denied,d.rather,review is to determine only whether the record contains sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to have made its ultimate finding that jordan stated reason for terminating plaintiffs was pretext or that,while true,was only one reason for their being fired,and race was another motivating factor.see id.
as a threshold matter,plaintiffs contend jordan waived the right to contest the sufficiency of the evidence because his rule motion at trial was insufficiently specific.rule a requires a movant for judgment as a matter of law jmol to specify the judgment sought and the law and facts that entitle him to the judgment.jordan rule a motion falls far short of that.instead,after plaintiffs presented their case,he moved to dismiss all the plaintiffs,stating a ll they have as far as evidence of discrimination are the numbers based upon what they saw in the room when they received their papers and their subjective active belief that it was discrimination that motivated those decisions.the court characterized this as a motion to dismiss all claims based on insufficient evidence to show a prima facie case of racial discrimination.in responding,plaintiffs did not challenge jordan lack of specificity under rule a.before the case was submitted to the jury,jordan reurg ed what the court described as his rule motion,without adding any supporting facts or legal contentions.
jordan submitted a renewed jmol motion,pursuant to rule b,which was fully articulated.moreover,plaintiffs opposition did not claim jordan was raising issues for the first time.see unitherm food,d a motion for judgment can be granted only on grounds advanced in the motion.quoting amendments to federal rules of civil procedure.as a result of this fail ure to raise th e forfeiture claim in opposition to the rule b motion plaintiffs are preclude d from raising it on appeal.arsement spinnaker exploration,llc,cir.we caution that rule a motions should be far more specific,as required by rule a.
jordan challenge fails.sufficient evidence was produced upon which a reasonable jury could have found discrimination.
all of the plaintiffs are white,except one who is hispanic but who was described as white in exhibits.jordan does not dispute plaintiffs were qualified for the positions from which they were terminated.the evidence showed that,within the first days jordan was in office,the racial composition of the da staff changed from whites and blacks to whites and blacks.of those terminated were white one was hispanic and two were black.jordan does not dispute plaintiffs were replaced by blacks,except an investigator,whom he claims was replaced by one of the white investigators he hired.the evidence shows,however,that after terminating that investigator,one of the investigators fired all white,jordan retained five black investigators and hired ten blacks into investigator positions.
attempting to show a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the terminations,jordan presented evidence that his hiring goal was to staff his office with persons,regardless of their race,he knew supported him,felt strongly in favor of him,and were eager to work for him.he emphasized his attempt to recruit a number of white attorneys his promotion of several incumbent whites to positions and his decision to retain all of the former da attorney staff,which was majority white.furthermore,butler and jordan testified the interview evaluations were not used when making hiring decisions because the interviewers had not received descriptions of the positions until after the interviews had been completed.instead,hiring decisions of new employees were based on financial considerations,minimum qualifications,recommendations from jordan,shared philosophy,and work on jordan campaign and transition into office,while the retention and termination of incumbent employees were random.jordan claims this use of a patronage system in making staffing decisions is permissible under rutan republican party of illinois,d.despite these claims,for the hiring recommendations,butler was able to identify only approximately that were made for political reasons.
a reasonable juror certainly may infer discrimination when an employer offers inconsistent explanations for the challenged employment action,as occurred at trial.nichols lewis grocer,cir.as for butler methodology,jordan stated in his response letters of position to the eeoc,admitted into evidence,that butler committee considered,inter alia,performance,employee efficiency,and previous experience,in making recommendations for incumbent employees retention.butler testified,however,that she did not consider these factors in making her employment recommendations.she explained that most of her recommendations regarding incumbent employees were just random.
butler also testified,and jordan asserts on appeal,that financial considerations drove her recommendations and,because whites tended to be in positions,they were more likely to be terminated.jordan testified at trial,however,that his office was not necessarily concerned in reducing the total amount of money for nonlegal employees,and did not cite such financial reasons in his letter to the eeoc.furthermore,butler testified that her recommendations did not result in a budget for personnel that was much,if at all,lower than that of the previous da.
additionally,plaintiffs presented statistical data from which the jury could have further based its finding that race was a motivating factor in jordan staffing decisions.see plemer,cir an employee may use statistics to show that an employer justification for a discriminatory act is pretext.see also walther lone star gas,cir per curiam we have recognized that gross statistical disparities may be probative of discriminatory intent,motive or purpose.plaintiffs statistics showed that,as noted,on the date jordan took office,the racial composition of the staff was whites,blacks,two hispanics,and one asian but,days later,that composition had changed to whites and blacks.
of the employees jordan terminated,were white,one was hispanic,and two were black.plaintiffs statistician testified that,according to his analyses the probability that out of terminated employees would be white if the terminations were was less than one in and the probability of the racial composition changing as it did in jordan first days,if the decisions had been made randomly,was less than one in one million.
jordan claims the court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence eeoc determinations stating the evidence it had reviewed supported plaintiffs claims.he relies on federal rule of evidence,claiming their relevance was far outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.jordan contends the jury could have given the determinations weight because they had the imprimatur of government approval.

as a general rule,eeoc determinations and findings of fact,although not binding on the trier of fact,are admissible as evidence in civil proceedings as probative of a claim of employment discrimination.mcclure mexia indep.sch,cir.jordan has not shown,pursuant to rule,how the eeoc determinations at issue were unduly prejudicial.accordingly,there was no abuse of discretion.
as noted,jordan transition team created a report cdr as part of its report,which provided that,within the first days of jordan administration,the staff racial composition should reflect that of orleans parish.in instructing the jury,the district court stated it had found the cdr constituted an invalid affirmative action plan aap.jordan objected to such a characterization in a motion in limine and in his jmol motion.he contends the district court instructing the jury that the cdr was an aap requires a new trial.
we review de novo the district court,as a matter of law,characterizing the cdr as an aap,water craft mgmt.llc mercury marine,cir.jordan does not contend that,if the cdr is held to be an aap,the district court erred in finding it an invalid aap.
our court has not defined the precise contours of an aap.nevertheless,case law reveals aaps have common characteristics.an aap usually gives preferential treatment to historically disfavored and minorities.doe kamehameha schs.bernice pauahi bishop estate,cir,cert.dismissed,d see also blow city of san antonio,cir aap at issue established departmental goals for job groups with significant minority or female underutilization internal quotation marks omitted.an aap may promote hiring workers from an race to eliminate racial imbalances in the employer work force and the local work force.see united steelworkers of,weber,d.an aap may focus on ensuring diversity there is no requirement that it contain quotas or give preference to minority applicants for jobs or promotions.see mlynczak bodman,cir see also messer meno,cir aaps at issue expressed the goal of achiev ing a workplace balanced with a proportionate number of minorities and women in the workforce internal quotation marks omitted.
jordan claims the cdr is not an aap because it does not meet the requirements for aaps established by the office of federal contract compliance.those requirements apply,however,only to nonconstruction contractors.a.
the cdr has characteristics aaps generally have,as described above.it compares the racial composition of several divisions within the da office with that of the city of new orleans.it then recommends within the first days of jordan taking office,t he racial composition of staff at levels sic should be more reflective of the parish population and his office should c reate culturally diverse staff reflective of the ratios of the current population.this recommendation mirrors jordan campaign promise to make his office reflect new orleans diversity.furthermore,jordan referred at trial to the cdr as a plan.
the district court did not err in instructing the jury that the cdr was an aap.despite the cdr lack of specific means for achieving the desired race ratios,it sufficiently evidences,for the purpose of its being considered an aap,a plan to focus on race in employment decisions and an intent to achieve a desired racial balance.
jordan next contends damages testimony should have been excluded,pursuant to federal rules of evidence and,until after plaintiffs proved discrimination.he claims the district court failure to do so resulted in prejudicial error.plaintiffs respond that jordan failed to object to the testimony admission at trial and,because he cites no authority for his claim,basically concedes the issue.
jordan did not object at trial.as a result,our review
