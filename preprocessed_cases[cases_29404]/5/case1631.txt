background 
this is yet another of the numerous appeals arising from the morass of litigation between the parties that has now spanned nearly a decade.we set forth the history of this litigation in our opinion in consolidated appeals in related cases.see rosen cook,nonpub.opn.we do not repeat that history here,but set forth only those facts necessary to the resolution of the present appeal which were recited in large part in our opinion affirming the judgment against the sureties rosen legacyquest,nonpub.opn.and from which we quote.
in july,the rosens filed suit for breach of contract against cook and legacyquest.the case went to trial in february,and the jury returned a verdict in favor of the rosens,and against cook and legacyquest,for.judgment was entered on march.
after unsuccessful posttrial motions,cook and legacyquest appealed from the judgment in april case no.shortly thereafter,cook and legacyquest filed undertakings by personal sureties to stay execution,and filed an amended undertaking more than a year later,in november.the amended undertaking states the sureties obligate themselves,jointly and severally for double the amount of the judgment of,to the plaintiffs mike and stephanie rosen.
after cook and legacyquest sought and received a day stay of their appeal on the ground settlement efforts were under way,and then sought and were granted numerous extensions of time to file their opening brief on appeal on other grounds,this court ordered counsel to personally appear on august,to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed.at that hearing,cook and legacyquest orally requested dismissal of their appeal.this court granted their request and issued an order on august,dismissing the appeal.remittitur issued on october,and was filed with the trial court two days later.
on december,stephanie demanded payment of the march judgment from the sureties.the sureties did not comply.
eight months later,on august,stephanie served cook,legacyquest,and the sureties with a motion under code of civil procedure section for entry of judgment against the sureties in the amount of the original judgment as modified by later court orders,credits,costs,and interest.stephanie filed her motion one week later,on august,and noticed a hearing for september.cook and legacyquest filed opposition,but the sureties did not nor did the sureties join in cook and legacyquest opposing papers.six months later,on march,the trial court granted stephanie motion.judgment was entered against the sureties two months later,on may,in the amount of reflecting additional postjudgment interest.
cook,legacyquest,and the sureties all moved to vacate the judgment and for a new trial under sections and.the trial court denied the motions on june.cook,legacyquest,and the sureties then filed a timely notice of appeal from the may,judgment against the sureties and the june,order denying their posttrial motions.rosen legacyquest,supra,nonpub.opn.as indicated,we affirmed the judgment and order in a nonpublished opinion filed january,case no.
one month later,on february,stephanie moved for costs and attorney fees incurred in enforcing the judgment against the sureties.she sought in costs,and in fees,which included fees incurred in defending against the sureties appeal of the judgment against them,fees incurred in trying to collect the underlying judgment directly from cook,fees incurred in defending judgment liens in cook bankruptcy,and fees incurred in prosecuting a fraudulent conveyance action.stephanie noted in her moving papers that shortly after she obtained the judgment against the sureties,she recovered in attorney fees against them incurred in making demand for payment and seeking the judgment against them.
the sureties opposed stephanie motion for costs and fees on several grounds.because the motion was filed while their petition for review of this court opinion affirming the judgment against them was pending,they maintained the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the motion for costs and fees.observing stephanie notice of motion referenced only sections and,they next claimed section only provided for fees incurred in obtaining a judgment against a surety and did not provide for postjudgment fees incurred in enforcing a judgment.acknowledging stephanie memorandum of points and authorities specifically sought fees pursuant to section which does,indeed,authorize an award of fees incurred in enforcing a judgment,they argued that statute only authorizes fees in contract cases,cases in which prejudgment fees were awarded to the judgment creditor pursuant to a contractual fee provision.the sureties further asserted the amount of fees stephanie sought was outrageous and not supported.
on may,the trial court filed an order entitled,order denying motion for attorney fees against sureties filed by plaintiff stephanie rosen.the court denied fees on the ground the last sentence of section limits the statute to contract cases.the following month,by letter dated june,counsel for stephanie advised the court its order did not address costs.the court responded by letter dated july,indicating it could not recall why costs had not been addressed and allowed the parties to submit briefs on the issue.stephanie recapped her request for costs,and asked the court to issue an amended order addressing both costs and fees.the sureties argued the court had,in fact,denied costs and stephanie inquiry about a ruling was a violation of section.they also argued stephanie had not identified any proper basis for costs,and her request was,in any event,excessive.on september,the trial court issued an order entitled,amended order denying plaintiff stephanie rosen motion for attorney fees and granting motion for costs against the sureties,reiterating its denial of fees but awarding in costs.stephanie filed a notice of appeal on october.
in the interim,pursuant to the directive in the january,opinion affirming the judgment against the sureties that stephanie was entitled to reasonable fees incurred on appeal,stephanie filed a motion for fees incurred on appeal.the trial court granted this motion on october,awarding her.stephanie acknowledges this award commensurately reduces the amount fees she seeks to recover in connection with enforcing the judgment against the sureties.
ii.discussion 
appealability 
the sureties assert stephanie appeal is untimely,claiming the operative order was that filed may,entitled,order denying motion for attorney fees against sureties filed by plaintiff stephanie rosen.the order was served on the parties by the court clerk,and as the sureties point out,stephanie did not file a notice of appeal until october well beyond the day period set forth in california rules of court,rule a a.
however,the may order did not fully dispose of stephanie motion,which was a motion for both costs and attorney fees.the order was,thus,akin to a partial judgment that does not fully dispose of the issues between the parties and,thus,is not a final,appealable judgment.not until the court issued its september order entitled,amended order denying plaintiff stephanie rosen motion for attorney fees and granting motion for costs against the sureties,was stephanie motion fully resolved,leaving no further issues between
