plaintiff geoffrey radvansky appeals from a jury verdict rendered for defendant police officers ralph saxer and thomas telegdy in his action against them.radvansky appeals to the sixth circuit for the second time in this case,as he successfully sought a reversal of the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendants on this claim in radvansky city of olmsted falls radvansky i,cir.he now seeks a reversal of the district court denial of his motions made pursuant to,and challenges the court jury instructions as prejudicially erroneous and requests a grant of fees due to his previous success in this court.because the jury verdict was reasonable,the instructions not prejudicial,and radvansky not a prevailing party,we affirm.
geoffrey radvansky was arrested for burglary on the night of may,by olmsted falls,ohio,police officers ralph saxer and thomas telegdy the officers.a grand jury indicted him,but the prosecutor eventually dismissed the charges,apparently after radvansky agreed to pay the owner of the burgled home in restitution.radvansky then sued officers saxer and telegdy,along with the city of olmsted falls,the olmsted falls police department,and several other police personnel involved in the incident.radvansky asserted myriad claims,including a fourth amendment false arrest claim under.the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants on all claims.this court reversed the district court judgment on the fourth amendment claim but affirmed in all other respects in radvansky i,concluding that a material issue of fact remained whether the officers had probable cause to arrest radvansky.
a jury then heard the case and rendered a general verdict for the defendants,with interrogatory answers confirming that the officers arrested radvansky with probable cause.radvansky moved for a directed verdict or a new trial and also for relief under,complaining that the jury answers to the interrogatories were incorrect and inconsistent.he failed,however,to raise the interrogatories issue before the court discharged the jury.the district court denied each motion.radvansky now appeals.
for at least some of the time between june and may,radvansky lived at redwood drive in olmsted falls under an oral agreement with derrick rosemark,the home owner,who apparently lived there as well.around the end of april or the beginning of may,rosemark called the olmsted falls police department and spoke with detective caine about problems he was experiencing with radvansky,who,he told caine,had left for florida without paying him all the rent he was due.depending on one view of radvansky status at the he had abandoned the premises or remained a may have given rosemark erroneous legal advice,telling him that he could lock radvansky out of the house.the extent to which caine told other officers in the department about this conversation remained in dispute at trial both saxer and telegdy testified that they did not know about this conversation prior to arresting radvansky.
on may,radvansky sought to reenter the house.finding the locks changed,he walked across the street and asked neighbor ken winland for a butter knife or something he could use to break in,because he had some guns in there,and he wanted to get his personal stuff.winland testified that he gave radvansky nothing and instead told him to call the police.radvansky testified that winland gave him an implement.either way,radvansky departed and winland told his wife to call the police,which she did.officer telegdy and officer dan gilles responded to the call,canvassed the area for a suspicious person and,finding no one,left.
the next evening,may,radvansky returned to try again.armed with a curtain rod or shower pole and a towel,radvansky was again spotted by winland,who again told his wife to call the police.shortly thereafter,winland heard the sound of breaking glass coming from the back of the house.according to radvansky,he was at the back of the house trying to tilt the the glass door sideways,but he could get the rod in there to lift up the wooden piece,so he started panicking.he was nervous about getting those guns,because he did not want them to fall in the wrong hands.so,he panicked and kicked the window that goes into the lower living room.he crawled through the window and retrieved a stun gun that he had hidden up in the rafters in the utility room.he apparently went to his bedroom to find his lock destroyed and his belongings strewn about.he claims he cut his hand while attempting to unlock the door.
when officers saxer and telegdy arrived,they approached the house cautiously,moving towards the rear of the house with weapons drawn.the officers noticed that the window was broken and the window screen was cut.radvansky then emerged quickly from the building.they noticed that his hand was bleeding and ordered him to the ground.the officers asked if he was armed,and he responded that he had a stun gun.the stun gun was later found inside the house near the broken window.he protested to the officers that he lived at the house,and when the officers removed his wallet,his driver license and several paychecks listed redwood as his address.he offered a note from rosemark,which the radvansky i court interpreted to read as follows 
geoff,i have locked the door for my own security.i am informing you not sic break in.a lso there is a matter of partial rent you owe of partial rent.none of these belongings until this is settler sic.otherwise i am kicking you out of this house.d o not attempt to enter the premises.you can call me at work to settle this.
i also informed the o lmsted f alls police department of you leaving the property and not to enter the house.
at.he also told the police that he had merely lost his keys.the officers called in his social security number to the police dispatcher to run a leads report,which collects the individual address and his traffic offense history.the leads indicated the same address as the driver license,though the officers were unsurprised because the leads information comes from the bureau of motor vehicles.
the officers handcuffed him and arrested him.they then took him to the hospital in an ambulance,where doctors treated his hand wound.other officers showed up to investigate the scene,and,during this investigation,sergeant gilles called the olmsted falls prosecutor to discuss whether to charge radvansky with burglary.radvansky was later booked and spent the night in jail.

radvansky challenge turns on the legitimacy of the jury finding that the officers had probable cause to arrest him.if no reasonable jury could so conclude,we must reverse.thus,we must examine the facts presented to the jury to assess whether a reasonable juror could conclude that they satisfy the probable cause standard.briefly,the fourth amendment requires that a law enforcement officer may not seize an individual except after establishing probable cause that the individual has committed,or is about to commit,a crime.williams ex rel.allen cambridge bd.of,cir citing beck ohio,d.probable cause is defined by asking whether at that moment the facts and circumstances within the officers knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the petitioner had committed or was committing an offense.beck,at.probable cause is assessed from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene,rather than with the vision of hindsight.klein long,cir quoting kostrzewa city of troy,cir.ohio burglary statute prohibits a person,by force,stealth,or deception to t respass in a permanent or temporary habitation of any person when any person other than an accomplice of the offender is present or likely to be present.ohio ann.a.the code also prohibits such a trespass with purpose to commit any criminal offense therein.id.a.our inquiry,then,is whether a reasonable jury could conclude that the officers had probable cause to arrest radvansky for burglary.
the district court denied radvansky.b and motions because it concluded that the jury reasonably found that the officers arrested radvansky with probable cause.the court pointed to several facts 
there was evidence presented at trial that plaintiff forcibly entered the residence at night,was carrying a weapon at the time,and that a neighbor identified plaintiff as the person who had attempted to gain access to the home on the evening prior.
there was also evidence presented that plaintiff was dishonest about why he had broken into the home.the court explained in a footnote that plaintiff told police officers that he broke into the residence because he had lost his keys.
regardless of plaintiff protests and documentary evidence that he lived at the residence,it would have been reasonable for the jury to infer that he was not being truthful with the officers and that the officers were reasonable in discrediting his statements and documents.
it would also be reasonable for the jury to find that there was a fair probability that plaintiff had committed,or was about to commit a crime.
it is also noted that because plaintiff testified at trial,the jury had the opportunity to listen to his testimony and observe his behavior on the stand.the jury could have found plaintiff lacked credibility and discredited his entire testimony and the evidence he presented.
our review confirms that the district court correctly identified key facts heard by the jury supporting its conclusion that the officers acted with probable cause.
the jury answers to interrogatories also address and allay the concerns articulated by this court in radvansky viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to radvansky,the earlier panel was troubled by the possibility that the police arrested radvansky based solely on rosemark statement to detective caine that radvansky had abandoned the property.citing a seventh circuit case and a ninth circuit case for the proposition that i n the criminal context courts have held that statements made by landlords and tenants about domestic disputes are by themselves insufficient to establish probable cause,the court opined that a reasonable jury could find that the officers had done just that.radvansky i,at citing seminara city of long beach,wl cir,and hebron touhy,cir.the court also reasoned that a jury could conclude that the officers ignored substantial exculpatory evidence by disregarding radvansky repeated protestations that he lived at the residence,the note to him from the landlord,and the documents in his wallet,including his driver license,which indicated the redwood address as his residence.id.at.
the jury that heard the evidence at trial,however,came to contrary conclusions about each of the radvansky i court concerns.although the court viewed the evidence as suggesting that the officers had knowledge about the dispute between radvansky and rosemark,id.at,the jury concluded otherwise,answering no to interrogatories that asked whether they found by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants had prior knowledge of the existence of a dispute between plaintiff radvansky and rosemark concerning plaintiff radvansky privilege to live at the redwood residence.underscoring this finding,the jury answered no to interrogatories that asked whether the defendants were aware of derrick rosemark statement to detective caine that plaintiff radvansky no longer lived at the redwood residence.redundantly but sensibly,the jury also answered no to interrogatories that asked whether it found by a preponderance of the evidence that the officers relied solely on rosemark representations in making the arrest and ignored substantial exculpatory evidence to the contrary.this was also,of course,contrary to the court concern that the officers ignored radvansky protestations and evidence.id.at.
the jury also viewed the evidence establishing radvansky residence at the home differently than the radvansky i court,answering yes to an interrogatory that asked whether it found by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff radvansky abandoned the redwood residence prior to the time of arrest,and no to an interrogatory that asked whether plaintiff radvansky was a tenant at the redwood residence at the time of the arrest.the jury conclusion can be summed up by its affirmative answers to interrogatories and,which asked whether the jury concluded by a preponderance of the evidence that the officers at the time of the arrest had reasonably reliable information,independent of rosemark allegations,that there was a fair probability plaintiff radvansky had committed,was committing,or was about to commit a crime.in short,the jury concluded the officers acted with probable cause.see beck,at.
moreover,examining the radvansky i court main concern in the context of the officers trial testimony,the testimony suggests that the officers were not aware of rosemark statements to detective caine,and thus rosemark statements did not motivate their actions.officer telegdy testified at trial that he had never heard anything about rosemark conversation with detective caine prior to arresting radvansky or,for that matter,prior to the day of the trial.he also testified that he had no idea who radvansky was prior to the arrest,despite the fact that he investigated the incident on may officer saxer had no recollection at trial about what was said to him the night of may and gave no indication that he was aware of the conversation between rosemark and caine at the time of the arrest.he provided only a vague recollection that officer telegdy mentioned something about possibly there might be a problem on redwood drive,and he could not remember what officer gilles told him before he left for patrol the night on may.
in sum,the jury heard testimony sufficient to support its conclusion that the officers arrested radvansky with probable cause.thus,we affirm the district court denial of radvansky.b motion.for the same reasons,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying radvansky.motion.

radvansky complains about the district court instruction regarding the officers required state of mind in carrying out the arrest,as reflected in a set of interrogatories that asked the jury whether it found by a preponderance of the evidence that each officer intentionally or recklessly committed acts that violated plaintiff radvansky federal constitutional right not to be arrested or seized without probable cause a separate question asked whether the officers individually negligently committed the same acts.
