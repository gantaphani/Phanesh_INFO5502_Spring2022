upon learning that area developers defendant had violated the subdivided lands act bus,et,james smith plaintiff sought to rescind his real estate contract with defendant and to recover moneys he had paid to defendant on the contract.after losing in the trial court,plaintiff prevailed on appeal.the judgment against plaintiff was reversed,and the case was remanded to the trial court with directions to calculate the reimbursement to which plaintiff was entitled and to enter judgment in his favor.yuba cypress housing partners,area developers may,nonpub.opn.
on remand,plaintiff moved for an award of attorney fees and costs pursuant to an attorney fee clause in the real estate contract.as the prevailing party,he sought to recover the fees and costs he incurred at trial and on appeal defendant opposed the request and moved to tax fees and costs.among other things,defendant argued that having obtained rescission of the contract on the ground that it violated the subdivided lands act,plaintiff could not rely on the attorney fee clause because the entire contract was void due to its illegality,and even if plaintiff is entitled to attorney fees via the contract,his claim for fees incurred on appeal was untimely.
the trial court ruled that the attorney fee clause of the contract was enforceable.however,relying on rule c of the california rules of court,the court held plaintiff request for attorney fees on appeal was untimely,and thus denied that request.the court also taxed a portion of the fees plaintiff incurred at trial.further rule references are to the california rules of court.
plaintiff appeals again.defendant,claiming plaintiff is not entitled to recover any fees because the contract was illegal,therefore making its attorney fee clause unenforceable.
we shall reverse the judgment to the extent that it denies plaintiff recovery for the attorney fees he incurred on appeal.as we will explain in the published portions of this opinion,defendant is estopped from asserting that its violation of the subdivided land act voided the entire contract,including the attorney fees clause otherwise,defendant would benefit from its own wrong.and,since the initial judgment was reversed on appeal and the trial court was directed to enter a new judgment in favor of plaintiff,his request for attorney fees on appeal was governed not by rule c,but by rule b because he incurred those fees before the rendition of judgment in the trial court on remand.plaintiff request was timely under rule b.
in the unpublished part of our opinion,we uphold the trial court apportionment of attorney fees incurred at trial because plaintiff attorneys also represented the partnership that did not prevail against defendant since it did not suffer any damages as a result of defendant violation of the subdivided land act.
discussion 
plaintiff disaffirmed his contract with defendant when he discovered that the contact was unlawful because defendant violated the subdivided lands act.barrett hammer builders,d.when a real estate contract is void for failure to comply with the subdivided lands act,the purchaser can either affirm the agreement and perform according to its terms or disaffirm the agreement and recover the sums he has paid less any allowable offsets.
it follows,defendant argues,that the trial court erred in awarding plaintiff any fees based on the attorney fee clause of the contract that,in defendant words,had been voided due to illegality.we disagree.
ordinarily,in an action on a contract providing for an award of attorney fees,civil code section entitles the prevailing party to attorney fees,even when the party prevails on the ground that the contract is inapplicable,invalid,unenforceable,or nonexistent,if the other party would have been entitled to attorney fees had it prevailed.hsu abbara cal th,d.this general rule serves to effectuate the purpose underlying section,which was enacted to establish mutuality of remedy where a contractual attorney fee clause makes recovery of fees available for only one party.ibid.
however,as noted in bovard american horse enterprises,d.hereafter bovard and geffen moss d.hereafter geffen,a different rule applies where a contract is held unenforceable because of illegality.bovard,supra,d at.geffen,supra,d at.a party to a contract who successfully argues its illegality stands on different ground than a party who prevails in an action on a contract by convincing the court the contract is inapplicable,invalid,nonexistent or unenforceable for reasons other than illegality.bovard,supra,d at.because courts generally will not enforce an illegal contract,there is no need for a mutual right to attorney fees since neither party can enforce the agreement.id.at.
bovard and geffen are distinguishable from this case because they involved contracts that were entirely unenforceable by either party due to their illegal objects.bovard,supra,d at.contract to manufacture paraphernalia for use in facilitating the consumption of marijuana geffen,supra,d at.contract to purchase the good will of a law practice.
where the object of the contract is illegal,courts generally will not enforce it or lend assistance to a party who seeks to benefit from an illegal act.lewis queen ball sons cal d.the reason for this refusal is not that the courts are unaware of possible injustice between the parties,and that the defendant may be left in possession of some benefit he should in good conscience turn over to the plaintiff,but that this consideration is outweighed by the importance of deterring illegal conduct.knowing that they will receive no help from the courts and must trust completely to each other good faith,the parties are less likely to enter an illegal arrangement in the first place.ibid.
but in some cases effective deterrence is best realized by enforcing the plaintiff claim or allowing some other remedy because the forfeiture resulting from unenforceability of the contract is disproportionately harsh considering the nature of the illegality.lewis queen ball sons,supra,cal d at,witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.
in each such case,how the aims of policy can best be achieved depends on the kind of illegality and the particular facts involved.lewis queen ball sons,supra,cal d at.thus,for example,when the legislature enacts a statute forbidding certain conduct for the purpose of protecting one class of persons from the activities of another,a member of the protected class may maintain an action notwithstanding the fact that he has shared in the illegal transaction.id.at.the protective purpose of the statute is realized by allowing the plaintiff,who is not in pari delicto,to enforce the contract or maintain his action against a defendant within the class primarily to be deterred.ibid.witkin,supra,contracts.
here,the purpose of the subdivided lands act is to protect members of the public who purchase lots or houses from developers.drake martin th,d.hence,when a plaintiff purchased land under a contract that does not comply with the act,courts will allow the plaintiff to enforce the contract against the seller or to disaffirm the contract.barrett hammer builders,supra,d at.in other words,the contract is voidable not void since it does not have an illegal object,it is not one which neither party may enforce such that an attorney fee clause contained therein also is unenforceable.
although plaintiff chose to void the contract,this does not preclude him from recovering attorney fees via the attorney fee clause in the contract.rather,defendant,who violated the subdivided lands act,is estopped from asserting the invalidity of the contract.barrett hammer builders,supra,d at,fn.otherwise,the court will have assisted defendant in profiting from its own wrong.to deny plaintiff the attorney fees to which he is entitled as a result of the contract would permit defendant to benefit from the illegality that it created,thus disserving the goal of deterring illegal conduct.homestead supplies,executive life ins.d.
accordingly,the trial court properly concluded that the attorney fee clause of the contract was enforceable.
when a party prevails in litigation regarding a contract which contains
