this appeal arises from an unsuccessful title vii action brought by the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc against great steaks.the eeoc accused great steaks of subjecting female employees to a sexually hostile work environment.although at the start of the case the eeoc asserted its claim on behalf of multiple claimants,that number diminished to one by trial.after a trial,the jury rendered a verdict in great steaks favor.great steaks subsequently moved for an award of attorneys fees,maintaining it was entitled to such an award under the following three statutory provisions title vii provision,u.k the equal access to justice act eaja mandatory fee provision,d and.the district court denied the motion for attorneys fees in its entirety.on appeal,great steaks contends that the district court erred in doing so.we affirm.
on february,dorathy carter filed a charge of discrimination against austin restaurant with the eeoc.carter,a former employee of austin restaurant,claimed that during her employment the owner,john pantazis,sexually harassed her.the harassment,she alleged,began on january,and lasted until february.she mentioned specifically that he subjected her to sexual comments and touching,and that he persisted even after she advised him that she did not welcome his advances.the day after carter filed the charge,thomas colclough,the acting director of the eeoc local office,issued a notice of charge of discrimination on behalf of the eeoc.he provided pantazis with a copy of the charge and requested a position statement and certain relevant information from austin restaurant.
bessie pantazis,pantazis daughter,submitted a position statement dated march.in the position statement,she asserted that she austin restaurant with her father.she indicated that the name of the restaurant was actually great steaks,but that it did business as austin restaurant.she also mentioned that austin restaurant had two locations,one in high point,north carolina,and another in greensboro,north carolina.but,when listing an address,she provided only the address of the greensboro restaurant.according to pantazis,carter worked one day in the high point location before transferring to the greensboro location when it opened on january.throughout the statement,pantazis denied that pantazis subjected carter,or anyone else,to sexual harassment and insisted that carter was fired for calling in too many times at the last minute.pantazis hypothesized that a desire for money and for revenge for the firing motivated carter charge.
colclough subsequently conducted an investigation on behalf of the eeoc.an affidavit that the eeoc filed with the district court describes his efforts.during the investigation,he visited austin restaurant in greensboro and interviewed pantazis.he also interviewed a number of female waitresses and hostesses who claimed pantazis had sexually harassed them.according to colclough,his investigation revealed that either pantazis or pantazis directly hired the majority of these women.most of them,colclough stated,were hired for the greensboro location,but they trained in high point,and some worked in the high point location before transferring to greensboro.he also noted that pantazis managed and helped supervise the waitresses at the high point location before the greensboro location opened.
on may,colclough issued a letter of determination on the merits of the charge of discrimination.in it,he concluded evidence existed establishing that pantazis sexually harassed carter and a class of similarly situated female employees.colclough also noted the existence of evidence indicating that several female class members were forced to resign because of the sexual harassment.as a result,he determined evidence existed that established violations of title vii.he therefore invited the parties to enter into the conciliation process.in his affidavit,colclough attested that he informed the attorney representing austin restaurant that conciliation would be on a class basis and would include both of the restaurant locations.
the parties held a conciliation conference on june.pantazis and the attorney for austin restaurant attended on behalf of the restaurant.conciliation was unsuccessful,and the eeoc issued a notice of conciliation failure on june.according to the eeoc,it subsequently discovered that clipper seafood restaurant,was the corporate entity that owned austin restaurant high point location.
the eeoc instituted this action in federal court by filing a complaint on august.the complaint named two defendants great steaks and clipper seafood,doing business as austin restaurant.the eeoc maintained great steaks did business in greensboro and that clipper seafood did business in high point.it asserted,however,that they jointly operated austin restaurant two locations as joint employers or an integrated business enterprise.the eeoc alleged that great steaks and clipper seafood,through their male,subjected carter and other similarly situated female employees to a sexually hostile work environment and that the employment conditions caused some of the female employees to resign.it sought injunctive relief,monetary relief for the aggrieved claimants,and its costs in bringing the action.
great steaks and clipper seafood answered on december,and simultaneously moved to dismiss the complaint.in their motion,they asserted that the district court lacked jurisdiction over great steaks.they further claimed that the complaint failed to state a claim of relief against clipper seafood,insisting that clipper seafood and great steaks were separate entities and that the eeoc had failed to identify any employees of clipper seafood who were harassed.the eeoc filed a response opposing the motion and provided colclough affidavit in support.
the district court referred the motion to dismiss to a magistrate judge,who subsequently held a hearing.at the hearing,the magistrate judge granted a motion for discovery made by the eeoc and stayed the motion to dismiss.he then entered an order bifurcating discovery into two phases.the first phase dealt with the substantive claims and the issues raised by the motion to dismiss.the order expressly prohibited the parties from deposing unnamed class members without the court leave during the first phase.it required,however,that the eeoc disclose the identity of all individuals on whose behalf it was seeking relief at the conclusion of the first phase.the second phase of discovery,which was not to begin until the court had ruled on the motion to dismiss,would address the remaining discovery.
the parties proceeded with the first phase of discovery.great steaks attempted to depose carter,but was unsuccessful.she ultimately ceased participation in the lawsuit during the summer of.at the end of the first phase of discovery,the eeoc notified great steaks and clipper seafood that it was seeking relief on behalf of three individuals stephanie jones,alea lovett,and tricia allen.this number of claimants was down from the seven or eight class members that the eeoc originally estimated.allen soon thereafter ceased participation in the lawsuit as well,leaving jones and lovett as the only claimants.
following the first phase of discovery,on december,the eeoc,great steaks,and clipper seafood filed a joint stipulation requesting dismissal of the claims against clipper seafood with prejudice.that same day,great steaks withdrew its motion to dismiss.as a result,at this point of the litigation,the case involved the eeoc asserting claims on behalf of jones and lovett against only great steaks.
the second phase of discovery then commenced.in august,great steaks deposed jones.during her deposition,she recalled her employment at austin restaurant as a hostess and alleged that pantazis made unwelcome sexual comments to her and touched her on her lower back and buttocks.she asserted that on multiple occasions he commented on her breasts while looking down her shirt,and she recounted that he once asked her if she wanted to have sex with him.she alleged various other sexually charged comments and solicitations made by pantazis.throughout the deposition,great steaks attorney pressed her on purported inconsistencies within her testimony as well as inconsistencies between her testimony and earlier statements.
that same month,great steaks deposed lovett,but the deposition ended prematurely when lovett,in response to questioning,announced she was finished.in december,the eeoc notified great steaks that lovett had ceased participation in the lawsuit,leaving jones as the sole claimant on whose behalf the eeoc sought relief.
great steaks then moved for summary judgment.it included a memorandum of law in support of its motion and also attached affidavits from pantazis and heather smith,jones coworker at austin restaurant.in his affidavit,pantazis disputed the allegations against him.similarly,smith attested to working with jones and asserted that she never saw any of the advances or heard any of the comments that jones described in her deposition.
the eeoc opposed the summary judgment motion and moved to strike great steaks supporting memorandum for using a font size smaller than the local rules allowed.the motions were referred to a magistrate judge,who denied the motion to strike and recommended denying the motion for summary judgment.in addressing the summary judgment motion,the magistrate judge recognized troubling aspects of jones testimony,including her foggy memory regarding dates and details,but noted that these were issues of credibility and weight for a jury to decide.the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation and denied the motion for summary judgment.
the district court scheduled a jury trial to begin on october.about a month before trial,great steaks filed its pretrial disclosures,which were vast.in response to the pretrial disclosures,on september,the eeoc filed twelve motions in limine.great steaks failed to file written responses to them.
trial began as scheduled on october.before impaneling the jury,the district court granted four of the motions in limine and deferred ruling on the others.the trial lasted three days.the eeoc offered jones as a witness in its.at the close of the eeoc case,great steaks moved for judgment as a matter of law,which the district court denied.great steaks renewed its motion at the close of its evidence.the district court again denied the motion and allowed the case to go to the jury.on october,the jury returned a verdict in great steaks favor.
two months later,great steaks moved for attorneys fees pursuant to title vii provision in k the eaja mandatory fee provision in d and.the district court denied great steaks motion for attorneys fees on all grounds.in refusing an award of attorneys fees under title vii provision,it determined that the eeoc case was not frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation.the court specifically noted that the eeoc case raised justiciable issues of fact for a jury to decide and that it survived motions for summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law.the district court also determined that the eeoc case was substantially justified and therefore great steaks was not entitled to an award under the eaja.finally,the court concluded that an award under would be improper because the eeoc did not act in bad faith or vexatiously multiply the proceedings.great steaks timely noted this appeal of the district court order.
we first address great steaks contention that the district court erred by denying its motion for attorneys fees under title vii provision.we review the district court denial of attorneys fees under title vii for abuse of discretion.eeoc cent.wholesalers,cir.
title vii contains its own provision that allows district courts,in their discretion,to award reasonable attorneys fees to prevailing parties in actions brought under it.k.this provision provides as follows 
in any action or proceeding under this subchapter the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the commission or the united states,a reasonable attorney fee including expert fees as part of the costs,and the commission and the united states shall be liable for costs the same as a private person.
id.notably,this provision,by its terms,does not distinguish between prevailing plaintiffs and prevailing defendants.see id.both may recover.see eeoc clay printing,cir.but the supreme court,in christiansburg garment eeoc,established a different,more stringent standard governing when prevailing defendants may recover as compared to prevailing plaintiffs.see clay printing,at.
prevailing plaintiffs in title vii actions ordinarily are entitled to attorneys fees unless special circumstances militate against such an award.christiansburg garment,at.this generous standard effectuates congress intent for plaintiffs to serve as private attorney s general,vindicating a policy that congress considered of the highest priority.id.at quoting newman piggie park,internal quotation marks omitted.it promotes the vigorous enforcement of title vii by making it easier for plaintiffs of limited means to bring meritorious actions.id.at.furthermore,when a court awards attorneys fees to a prevailing plaintiff in a title vii action,it renders this award against a violator of federal law.id.at.these policy considerations,however,do not apply in the context of prevailing defendants,so defendants may not avail themselves of the same generous standard set for prevailing plaintiffs.see id.
separate policy considerations drove congress decision to allow prevailing defendants to recover attorneys fees.see id.at.congress desired to protect defendants from burdensome litigation having no legal or factual basis.id.at.although congress sought to encourage the vigorous prosecution of meritorious title vii actions by making it easier to bring them,it also wanted to deter frivolous lawsuits.see id.to accommodate these competing considerations,the supreme court held in christiansburg garment that prevailing defendants may obtain attorneys fees in a title vii action only if the district court finds that the plaintiff claim was frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless,or that the plaintiff continued to litigate after it clearly became so.id.at.it clarified,however,that this standard did not require the defendant to demonstrate that the plaintiff brought the action in subjective bad faith.id.at.
a finding of frivolousness,unreasonableness,or groundlessness can not obtain simply because the plaintiff did not ultimately prevail.id.at.such post hoc reasoning would discourage all but the most airtight claims,for seldom can a prospective plaintiff be sure of ultimate success.id.at.ultimately,it would undercut congress efforts in promoting the vigorous enforcement of title vii by substantially increasing the risks inherent in bringing such claims.id.at.for this reason,we have recognized that awarding attorneys fees to a prevailing defendant is a conservative tool,to be used sparingly in those cases in which the plaintiff presses a claim which he knew or should have known was groundless,frivolous,or unreasonable.arnold burger king,cir see also glymph spartanburg,f d,cir district courts should award such fees sparingly.
these principles,we have noted,provide only general guidance.arnold,at.there is no set quantity of evidence separating claims that are frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless from those that are not.id.we have eschewed such formalistic line drawing,and for good reason.id.the fixing of attorneys fees is peculiarly within the province of the trial judge,who is on the scene and able to assess the oftentimes minute considerations which weigh in the initiation of a legal action.id.we thus accord great deference to the trial court assessment of whether the plaintiff claim was frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.
before turning to the merits of great steaks contentions,we briefly address the parties dispute concerning the extent to which the district court denials of great steaks summary judgment motion and motion for judgment as a matter of law should play a role,if any,in the determination of whether the eeoc case was frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.great steaks dismisses their significance.the eeoc,however,emphasizes that its case survived the motions as an indicator that it was not frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.
we have recognized that the denial of a dispositive motion can be an appropriate consideration when determining whether a plaintiff case was frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.see glymph,at.but it does not necessarily yield such a determination.see introcaso cunningham,cir see also hutchinson staton,cir applying introcaso and holding that plaintiffs were liable for attorneys fees even though their case survived motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.this is because,a lthough in some instances a frivolous case will be quickly revealed as such,it may sometimes be necessary to blow away the smoke screens the plaintiffs had thrown up before the defendants may prevail.introcaso,at quoting hicks.health.agency,cir.moreover,it is possible for a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case which is weak but which is sufficient to survive a directed verdict,but which is nonetheless groundless in light of a defense readily apparent to the plaintiff from the outset of the litigation.id.at.
we add,however,that the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all evidence is a particularly strong indicator that the plaintiff case is not frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.at that point,all of the evidence has been introduced as to both the claims and the defenses,and the district court must determine whether a legally sufficient evidentiary basis exists that would allow a reasonable jury to find for the plaintiff.see.a.if the district court denies the motion,it signals that a jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.although we do not preclude their existence,we are to imagine circumstances where the district court could make this determination and nevertheless deem the plaintiff case frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.generally,therefore,the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all evidence strongly indicates that the plaintiff case was not frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.see lowery jefferson cnty.bd.of,cir it generally will be difficult to deem a claim frivolous where the plaintiff has presented sufficient evidence at trial to prevent the entry of a judgment against him as a matter of law.quoting leblanc sternberg fletcher,cir.
great steaks argues that,as a prevailing defendant,it is entitled to attorneys fees under title vii provision because the eeoc case was frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.according to great steaks,the eeoc should have known its case was frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless at the outset when it contacted scores of female employees,yet came up virtually,and when carter did not appear at the conciliation conference even if the case was not frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless from the outset,great steaks insists that the eeoc continued to litigate after it clearly became so.in support,it describes how the number of claimants and defendants dwindled from a class of claimants and two defendants at the initiation of the action to one claimant and one defendant by trial.it notes further that carter failed to appear for a deposition and that lovett ended hers prematurely,which great steaks presumably thinks should have demonstrated to the eeoc that its case was groundless.finally,it argues that continued litigation based solely on jones allegations was frivolous.it highlights inconsistencies in jones deposition testimony as well as the affidavit from her coworker,heather smith,which challenged jones allegations.great steaks maintains that the affidavit and inconsistencies should have apprised the eeoc of the fact that its case was frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.
we disagree and hold that the district court acted within its discretion in determining that the eeoc case was not frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.the eeoc case had a factual and legal basis from start to finish.although it evolved over time to include fewer claimants and defendants than originally anticipated,jones allegations provided a legal and factual basis on which to conduct the litigation through trial.the inconsistencies in jones allegations and the contradictory affidavit from her coworker simply created factual issues for a jury to resolve they did not make her allegations frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.
in reaching this determination,we pay substantial deference to the district court finding that the eeoc case presented justiciable issues of fact warranting a trial.the district court,which managed the litigation and conducted the trial,is in the best position to make this assessment.its denial of great steaks motion for judgment as a matter of law made at the close of all evidence,which indicated that the eeoc had set forth a legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find in its favor,see.a,strongly underscores that the eeoc case had a reasonable legal and factual basis and therefore was not frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of attorneys fees under title vii provision.
we next address great steaks contention that the district court erred when it declined to award attorneys fees under the eaja.our review of a district court denial of attorneys fees under the eaja is for abuse of discretion.cody caterisano,cir.we must consider,however,whether the eaja mandatory fee provision applies in this title vii context.this involves a question of statutory interpretation,which we review de novo.see blaustein reich,buckles,cir w e review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.although the district court did not deny great steaks application for attorneys fees under the eaja on this basis,we may affirm the district court on this alternative ground as it is apparent from the record.see in re maco homes,cir.
typically,under the american rule,parties to litigation bear their own attorneys fees and costs.see goldstein moatz,cir brzonkala morrison,cir.the eaja creates an exception to the american rule for civil actions in which the united states is a party.see goldstein,at.congress,cognizant of the vast disparity of resources between the government and private litigants,enacted the eaja out of concern that the expense involved in litigating against unreasonable government action might deter private litigants from vindicating their rights in civil actions and administrative proceedings in which the united states is a party.equal access to justice act,stat.to alleviate this concern,congress allowed for individuals and entities to recover attorneys fees and costs against the united states in specified situations.id.c.
as part of the eaja,congress provided a mandatory fee provision in d.it provides as follows 
except as otherwise specifically provided by statute,a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses,in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection a,incurred by that party in any civil action other than cases sounding in tort,including proceedings for judicial review of agency action,brought by or against the united states in any court having jurisdiction of that action,unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.
id.d a.the government bears the burden of proving that its position was substantially justified,clay printing,at,which requires it to demonstrate that its position was justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person,pierce underwood.to be substantially justified,t he government position must be more than merely undeserving of sanctions for frivolousness and must instead have a reasonable basis both in law and fact.united states cox,cir citation omitted quoting pierce,at internal quotation marks omitted.
great steaks,as the prevailing party in the action below,sought to avail itself of this mandatory fee provision.as it argued at the district court,great steaks posits on appeal that the eeoc position was not substantially justified.it further argues that the district court erroneously placed on it the burden of proving that the government position was not substantially justified.great steaks argume
