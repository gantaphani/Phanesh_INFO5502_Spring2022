a notice of service of modified judgment was served on april.thereafter,boyce filed a notice of appeal on april,
on appeal,boyce raises four issues.first,he contends that the motion for nonsuit should have been granted because the evidence established a prima facie case for breach of contract.second,a jury instruction regarding awarding penalties pursuant to civil code section should not have been given because the statute has no application to this case.third,the motion for trial should have been granted because miw failed to establish a prima facie case of breach of contract and because civil code section is not applicable to this case.finally,miw motion for attorney fees should have been denied because civil code section does not apply to this case.we agree that civil code section has no application in this case.accordingly,we reverse the award of penalties and attorney fees.in all other respects,we affirm the judgment.

with these standards of review in mind,we recite the facts of this case 
facts and proceedings below 
miw,a california corporation has been in existence since.it is a blacksmithing workshop specializing in ornamental architectural metalwork.typically,miw makes railings,entry gates and doors.most of miw customers are interior designers and architects.ed leisner is the president of miw.
miw has manufactured and installed ornamental metalwork in over five star hotels around the world.miw biggest project to date was the grand staircase at the bellagio hotel in las vegas.
mark morris,an interior designer,met boyce around october.morris became the designer on boyce residence.at some point,morris became aware of miw morris was aware that boyce planned to have ironwork installed in his home,including a staircase,balcony,large doors and an exterior railing.miw san francisco representative told morris that ed leisner was responsible for the architectural ironwork at miw.some time in september,leisner received a phone call from boyce at his office at miw workshop in los angeles.boyce told him that he was interested in some neoclassic french ironwork for the private home he was building.leisner arranged for boyce and his wife susan to visit miw.during this meeting,gary hatch was the only other person present.at the time,hatch was a employee of miw who leisner was grooming to take over more of the responsibilities for the architectural work.
while at miw,boyce toured the facility and saw a chandelier undergoing the gold leafing process.either boyce or his wife asked if miw recycled the flakes on the floor.leisner indicated that they did not because it had no intrinsic value it was imitation gold leaf.then,boyce indicated that he wanted genuine gold leaf on his railing.leisner told him that miw did not use genuine gold leaf because he did not have anybody that knew how to do it.
after several design ideas were passed back and forth,on july,miw provided boyce a quotation for two pairs of iron doors with glass inserts,balcony and staircase railings and an interior main staircase.according to the quotation,the iron was to be finished with exterior grade hand painted premium scratch mar resistant finish with rust inhibiting primer and seal coat including dark gold leaf details.miw has over standard finishes and custom finishes are quoted on request.final selection to be approved.modifications to the original scope of work were made due to a decrease in the linear footage of the railings.a revised quotation dated august,was prepared and hatch traveled to saratoga and met with boyce.interlineations were made to the proposal,which boyce signed.the total cost for the project was.this quotation formed the operative contract.
miw and boyce agreed that payment would be made pursuant to the following terms upon satisfactory completion of project.on august,miw received a check from boyce in the amount of.
subsequently,miw prepared sample sections for final approval of the finish.on january,miw received a letter from morris addressed to gary hatch,which stated that the sample was really beautiful.however,the letter indicated that boyce wanted to change some of the finish on the details of the railing.since the changes involved more work and more cost,miw wrote back informing boyce that there would be an additional charge of percent.
ultimately,by june,the installation of the ironwork was almost completed.around this time,miw received a letter from morris addressed to boyce and hatch that described the doors that miw had installed as faaaaabulous miw completed the installation,finishing the job on or about july.accordingly,miw sent out a final invoice.the total invoice with tax was for.the invoice reflected the original deposit that had been paid leaving a balance of.miw did not receive any payment within days.accordingly,hatch called boyce.miw received no response.between july and september,miw did not hear from morris or boyce regarding the invoice.
on september,miw received a running punch list,which is a list of minor jobs the owner,or designer in this case,would like fixed.
leisner testified that on approximately percent of architectural jobs miw would have to go back to take care of minor items.by december,miw had taken care of all the items on the punch list.however,miw had not received full payment on the july invoice.miw received a check dated october,from boyce in the amount of,which included the following notation in the memo line att ention gary hatch.this is not an ac c eptance of job.however,miw was not given any indication of why the job was not considered accepted.miw attempted to collect the balance of.according to leisner he called boyce a number of times,but was not able to speak with him.
miw was called out again to perform additional work on the house in january.boyce wanted the acorns or finials on the interior railing gilded.miw completed the work,but was still not able to collect the.sometime in february,miw received a letter dated february,from morris.the letter stated,we believe that imitation gold leaf was used in the exterior,interior and doors.we found a box during cleanup.this is an important difference from the specification.leisner testified that at this point he felt the writing was on the wall.they were going to use this as an excuse not to pay us.
leisner testified that there was no specification contained in either of the two quotes that he gave boyce,one of which boyce had signed,that called for miw to install real gold.
in a letter dated march,miw attempted to point out to boyce that his claim that he was supposed to get real gold on his ironwork was ridiculous.miw did not receive an immediate response.miw sent a second letter dated april,in which miw stated,based on the cost and complexity,a reasonable person,especially an experienced interior designer,would realize that gold leaf would not be included in the price.miw never claimed that it was gold leaf.
subsequently,miw received a letter from boyce dated may.the letter stated that boyce completely disagree d in regards to the use of real gold leaf.the letter went on,when sue and i first came to your factory over three years ago to discuss this commission,i made it clear from our first meeting after i asked you if you could do gold leaf,that my experience convinced me that the use of real gold leaf exteriorly and interiorly was very important.you stated that it was an expensive issue and i agreed and asked you to bid it appropriately.leisner denied that he had ever told boyce that it was too expensive to do real gold leaf or that boyce asked him to use real gold leaf because miw does not do it.
miw sent another letter to boyce trying to convince him to pay the balance of the july invoice.miw was never paid the balance.
miw filed a complaint for damages on january.
during the trial,leisner testified that miw had installed a coat of bondo and caulking to the exterior ironwork,but normally miw goes back to check that no gaps have developed.on the boyce project they came back to complete the check to see if the bondo was working correctly.they found a small problem with the bondo on a small section of the exterior ironwork,but they were not able to fix it because it was raining.miw made arrangements to fix the problem.however,leisner instructed his workers not to go back once he received the fax from morris that said that imitation gold leaf had been used on the boyce project.at that time,there was probably an hour and a half worth of bondoing to do after the hour that you have to wait to have it put together.there probably a day maybe a day and a half of painting because it takes time.leisner conceded that he had not told boyce or anyone else that without the completed bondo work there would be a problem with water down the road.
at the conclusion of miw case in chief,as noted,boyce filed a motion for nonsuit.the grounds for the motion were that leisner testified that miw intentionally did not complete the entire process necessary to seal and waterproof the ironwork.thus,the evidence presented by miw failed to state a cause of action for breach of contract.the court denied the motion for nonsuit.
it appears that the court instructed the jurors that if they found boyce wrongfully withheld payment to miw,then boyce was subject to a charge of two percent per month on the improperly withheld amount.boyce has not provided this court with any of the record that contains the set of instructions that were given by the court,or the reporter transcript of the proceedings.however,judge nichols issued a notice of ruling dated january,which states the court instructed the jury on the charge claim,over boyce objection.miw concedes that the court instructed the jury regarding a two percent penalty sought by miw under civil code section.
following the jury verdict,boyce filed a motion for granting a new trial on the grounds that miw failed to present a prima facie case as to the breach of contract claim and that the percent statutory penalty was contrary to law.as noted,the court denied the motion.
discussion 
initially,miw contends that the denial of boyce prejudgment motion for nonsuit is not properly before this court.essentially,miw argues that because boyce appealed from the entire judgment on special verdict entered on february,and from the order on motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict motion for attorneys fees and request for costs,entered on april,and did not designate the entire record on appeal,the denial of the motion for nonsuit is not properly before this court.we disagree.
an order denying a motion for nonsuit,while not directly appealable,may be reviewed on appeal from the subsequent judgment for the plaintiff.torres city of los angeles cal d,gettemy star house movers,d,disapproved of on other grounds by camargo tjaarda dairy cal th,d.here boyce has appealed from the judgment.although boyce did not designate the entire record on appeal,miw fails to point to any part of the record that is missing that would prevent this court from addressing the nonsuit issue 
furthermore,although boyce contends there are four separate issues on appeal there are only two real issues first,whether any evidence supported miw position that it performed or substantially performed all work required under the contract with boyce.second,whether the two percent penalty pursuant to civil code section was properly awarded to miw.
sufficiency of the evidence 
boyce contends that there was no evidence to support at least one required element of miw breach of contract claim.specifically,miw was required to show that all conditions required for his performance had occurred,because his duty to pay the balance of the contract price was conditioned upon the project first being satisfactorily completed.accordingly,in order to state a claim for breach of contract,miw needed to present sufficient evidence that the project was satisfactorily completed.
judicial council of california civil jury instructions caci provides name of defendant contends that name of plaintiff did not perform all of the things that was required to do under the contract,and therefore name of defendant did not have to perform obligations under the contract.to overcome this contention,name of plaintiff must prove both of the following that name of plaintiff made a good faith effort to comply with the contract and that name of defendant received essentially what the contract called for because name of plaintiff failures,if any,were so trivial or unimportant that they could have been easily fixed or paid for.
it appears that the instruction as given by the court to the jury was as follows philip boyce contends that murray iron works,did not perform all the things that it was required to do under the contract,and therefore phillip boyce did not have to perform his obligation under the contract.to overcome this contention,murray iron works,must prove both of the following.that murray iron works,made a good faith effort to comply with the contract and.that philip boyce received essentially what the contract called for because murray iron works,failures,if any,were so trivial or unimportant that they could have been easily fixed or paid for.
the jury was asked to answer the following question.did murray iron works,inc do all,or substantially all,of the significant things that the contract required it to do by a vote of to,the jury said yes.
at common law,recovery under a contract for work done was dependent upon complete performance,although hardship might be avoided by permitting recovery in quantum meruit.the prevailing doctrine today,which finds its application chiefly in building contracts,is that substantial performance is sufficient,and justifies an action on the contract,although the other party is entitled to a reduction in the amount called for by the contract,to compensate for the defects.what constitutes substantial performance is a question of fact,but it is essential that there be no wilful departure from the terms of the contract,and that the defects be such as may be easily remedied or compensated,so that the promisee may get practically what the contract calls for.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.
the doctrine of substantial performance has been recognized in california since at least,when the california supreme court decided the landmark case of thomas haverty jones cal,haverty,in which the court stated the general rule on the subject of contractual performance is that where a person agrees to do a thing for another for a specified sum of money to be paid on full performance,he is not entitled to any part of the sum until he has himself done the thing he agreed to do,unless full performance has been excused,prevented,or delayed by the act of the other party,or by operation of law,or by the act of god or the public enemy.citation.i t is settled,especially in the case of building contracts,where the owner has taken possession of the building and is enjoying the fruits of the contractor work in the performance of the contract,that if there has been a substantial performance thereof by the contractor in good faith,where the failure to make full performance can be compensated in damages,to be deducted from the price or allowed as a counterclaim,and the omissions and deviations were not willful or fraudulent,and do not substantially affect the usefulness of the building for the purposes for which it was intended,the contractor may,in an action upon the contract,recover the amount unpaid of his contract price less the amount allowed as damages for the failure in strict performance.citations.
in haverty,supra,cal.at page,the court observed that the question is one of some difficulty.nevertheless,it stated the guiding principle to be that there is a substantial performance where the variance from the specifications of the contract does not impair the building or structure as a whole,and where after it is erected the building is actually used for the intended purpose,or where the defects can be remedied without great expenditure and without material damage to other parts of the structure,but that the defects must not run through the whole work so that the object of the owner to have the work done in a particular way is not accomplished,or be such that a new contract is not substituted for the original one,nor be so substantial as not to be capable of a remedy,and the allowance out of the contract price will not give the owner essentially what he contracted for.ibid.
several courts in california have denied contractors the right to recover pursuant to the doctrine of substantial performance where their performance was not found to meet a reasonable standard.see shell schmidt d,williams elliott d,bause anthony pools,d.tolstoy constr.minter d.
here,we find substantial evidence to support the jury conclusion that miw completed or substantially completed the contract.leisner testified that the fabrication and installation was completed in july.further,miw completed the minor work that was on the punch list around december.moreover,boyce testified that up until february of he was completely satisfied with the job that miw had done.according to boyce,miw did beautiful work.the jury could reasonably have concluded that the amount of work that miw still had to do,the second coat of bondo and caulking,was so trivial or unimportant that miw could have fixed it very easily.
relying on denver darling,controlled environments construction th,d denver darling and leisner testimony that miw found a small problem with the bondo and caulking that needed to be fixed and that he instructed his crew not to fix it,boyce argues that the project was never completed and miw willfully departed from the terms of the contract.to put it another way boyce argues miw can not rely on the doctrine of substantial performance because it does not apply when a contractor willfully departs from the terms of the contract that is when a contractor makes a calculated decision not to finish a job.
what boyce fails to realize is that the evidence shows that miw had substantially completed,if not fully completed the contract before leisner instructed his crew to not return to the boyce project.thus,there was no willful departure from the terms of the contract.leisner testified that the bondo and caulking was installed on the exterior ironwork.having substantially,if not fully,performed,boyce does not have the right to insist that miw should have finished a minor repair to the bondo and caulking before his obligation to pay the july,invoice arose.
in conclusion,we find that there was substantial evidence to support miw breach of contract claim.accordingly,the trial court did not err in denying boyce nonsuit motion or his trial motion.
civil code section 
civil code section,subdivision b provides except as otherwise agreed in writing,the owner shall pay to the contractor,within days following receipt of a demand for payment in accordance with the contract,any progress payment due thereunder as to which there is no good faith dispute between the parties.in the event of a dispute between the owner and the contractor,the owner may withhold from the progress payment an amount not to exceed percent of the disputed amount.if any amount is wrongfully withheld in violation of this subdivision,the contractor shall be entitled to the penalty specified in subdivision g of section.
in turn,civil code section provides that i n the event that retention payments are not made within the time periods required by this section,the owner or original contractor withholding the unpaid amounts shall be subject to a charge of percent per month on the improperly withheld amount,in lieu of any interest otherwise due.additionally,in any action for the collection of funds wrongfully withheld,the prevailing party shall be entitled to his or her attorney fees and costs,subd.g.
boyce argues that civil code section only applies to contracts involving progress payments.the payment that was alleged to have been withheld was a portion of the final payment,which by the terms of the agreement,was not due until the project was completed.since the payment was not due until the project was completed,it is considered a final payment and not a progress payment.
boyce urges that this court should look to the principles of statutory construction and give significance to every word in the statute,including the word progress.boyce asserts that under this principle it is presumed that the word progress was included to perform some useful this case,to limit the application of the statute to progress payments only.we do not disagree.
when construing a statute,we look first to the words of the statute,giving them their ordinary meaning and construing them in context.if the language is unambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute controls.citations.people hudson cal th,d.here,the plain meaning of the statute is that it applies only to progress payments.
boyce argues that the term progress payment has a particular meaning.specifically,it is a technical phrase used in the construction industry to mean a payment that the terms of the contract require to be made before the project is completed.boyce does not cite to any authority for this proposition.rather,boyce asserts that this is the meaning that is used in courts when called upon to interpret a construction contract that calls for payment by means of progress payments.he cites to two cases,pacific employers insurance state of california cal d,and tesco controls monterey mechanical th,d,for the proposition that a progress payment is a payment that the terms of the contract require to be made before the project is completed.
in pacific employers insurance state of california,supra,cal d,plaintiff,an insurance company,sought money from the state for money plaintiff paid out on a labor and material bond furnished on a public works contract the complaint failed to recite that statutory stop notices or verified claims were filed.the trial court sustained a general demurrer to plaintiff complaint with leave to amend.plaintiff declined to amend,and appealed from the judgment of dismissal that ensued.id.at.
in explaining plaintiff theory of recovery,the supreme court noted the following plaintiff theory of recovery is that the agreement called for a lump sum payment of the entire contract upon completion of the work that progress payments were unauthorized and constituted an alteration of agreement which to the extent of such payments released plaintiff from its obligation as a surety that principles of subrogation entitle plaintiff to recover to the same extent on account of the payments made by it to the laborers and materialmen under its labor and material bond.pacific employers insurance state of california,supra,cal d at.
in tesco controls monterey mechanical,supra,th,d,the plaintiff sought to recover money owed it on a contract under which it supplied electrical equipment for a public works project.defendants claimed plaintiff was barred from recovering because plaintiff had waived its mechanic lien rights up through a date when the funds should have been paid.the trial court granted summary adjudication for defendants on plaintiff first six causes of action determining that plaintiff conditional waiver and release of its mechanic lien rights under civil code section,subdivision d,released lien rights only to the extent plaintiff had received payment and not up through the date stated on the release.id.at,d.
in reciting the facts of the case,the court in tesco controls monterey mechanical,supra,th at page,d,noted that the agreement between two of the defendants in the case,the city of chico the city and monterey mechanical company,to expand the city wastewater treatment control plant at a cost of approximately million,called for the city to pay monterey by means of progress payments and a final payment.
pacific employers insurance state of california,supra,cal d,is a case involving a subrogation claim where no payment was due from the state.tesco controls monterey mechanical,supra,th,d,is a case involving a statutory lien release document that conditionally waived lien,bond and stop notice claims through the date of the waiver document.neither case considered the issue before this court.as our supreme court has instructed,cases are not authority for propositions not considered.citation.people superior court zamudio cal th,d.
pursuant to established principles,our first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in determining such intent,a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves,giving to the language its usual,ordinary import and according significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose.a construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.citations.where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation,fair employment housing com.cal d.
in webster third new international dictionary at page,progress is defined as the action or process of advancing or improving by marked stages or degrees.
as boyce concedes,there is no definition of progress payment in the civil code.however,military and veteran code sections,and provide that a progress payment is payment for improvements to real property as the work progresses.certainly,the completion of a project is progress.on the other hand,business and professions code section defines progress payments to be any payments,other than the down payment made before the project is completed.conversely,sections e and of the public contracts code,define progress payments as all payments due contractors,except that portion of the final payment designated by the contract as retention earnings.if only a portion of the final payment is exempted from the progress payment designation,necessarily,the other portion is not.thus,this implies that part of a final payment is a progress payment.
we find some support for the proposition that a final payment is a progress payment.progress payments are payments of portions of the contract price based upon the progress of the contract work.the more usual types of such progress payment provisions are a those providing for payments in amounts to be determined by periodic estimates,computations,or reports of the amount of work accomplished and b those providing for payments of specified amounts to be made as particular stages of the work are attained or completed,building or divisible,italics added.here,the contract specified for a payment on completion of the project.thus,under this definition boyce final payment was a progress payment.
furthermore,as explained in california construction contracts and disputes cont.ed.bar section,page,construction contracts generally provide for payments to be made in installments,known as progress payments.the owner is unwilling to pay the entire contract price at the beginning of the job without assurance that the contractor will complete the work moreover,the contractor is unwilling and usually unable to finance a construction job that may take months or even years to complete.accordingly,payments from the owner to the contractor are made as the job progresses.again,under this definition it appears that boyce final payment was a progress payment.
we turn to the intent of the legislature in enacting civil code section in an attempt to shed more light on this issue.we find little that is helpful.however,according to assembly woman delaine eastin,the author of assembly bill reg.sess,which added section to the civil code,the bill would ensure that general contractors,followed by their subcontractors and material suppliers,are paid promptly for work completed on private works of improvement.delaine eastin,letter to governor pete wilson.however,the letter goes on to note that assembly bill applies only to construction payments made during the course of construction.ibid.this implies that a final payment made after construction is completed would not be included as a progress payment.
next,we look to the remedy that a contractor has if an owner withholds a progress payment.in integrated,alec fergusson contractors d,the court laid out the rules as to when a contractor can or can not cease to perform upon failure of an owner to make progress payments.specifically,the court noted the following the proposition that in building contracts failure to make
