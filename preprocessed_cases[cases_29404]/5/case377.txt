in this appeal,we consider whether the district court abused its discretion in ordering that the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc pay attorneys fees to a prevailing defendant employer after the court awarded summary judgment to the employer in an action brought by the eeoc.in awarding attorneys fees,the district court concluded that the eeoc acted unreasonably in filing the employment discrimination complaint,because events that occurred during the eeoc administrative investigation precluded the eeoc from obtaining either injunctive or monetary judicial relief.upon our review,we affirm the district court judgment.
in january,michael quintois filed a charge of discrimination with the eeoc against his former employer,propak logistics,propak,a provider of commercial warehousing,transportation,packaging,and shipping services.quintois was a supervisor at propak shelby,north carolina facility,and alleged that propak terminated his employment based on his american national origin after he complained that the company hired only hispanic workers for certain supervisory positions.the eeoc notified propak of the discrimination charge arising under title vii of the civil rights act of title vii.
based on quintois discrimination charge,the eeoc initiated an investigation of propak that lasted nearly six years.this investigation included extensive periods of delay and inactivity.
although propak responded to the charge in may,the eeoc did not interview quintois concerning propak response until may.the eeoc also delayed until april its interview of kathy ponder,a propak manager responsible for hiring decisions at the shelby,north carolina facility.
in september,the eeoc designated the matter as a class case.however,as the district court later found,propak did not receive notice of this procedural decision until about four years later in september 
although the eeoc scheduled and conducted two witness interviews between october and march,little other investigative activity occurred during this period.the record also shows that the eeoc did not contact propak for about two years,between june,and june.in june,the eeoc contacted propak to speak with ponder,but was unable to interview her because she had left her job and her whereabouts were unknown.
during the course of the eeoc inquiry,quintois requested a right to sue authorization after the eeoc granted quintois request,quintois filed a lawsuit against propak in march,which was dismissed about four months later upon agreement of the parties.
in september,the eeoc concluded its investigation of propak and issued a determination letter.the eeoc stated that it had found reason to conclude that propak violated title vii by failing to hire a class of job applicants because of their race or national origin.in the letter,the eeoc also invited propak to participate in informal conciliation to resolve the matter pursuant to the eeoc statutory mandate to engage in such efforts see b.
in attempting to conciliate the matter,the eeoc proposed certain remedial measures concerning propak facilities in north carolina and south carolina.these measures would have required propak in these locations to offer certain employment opportunities,to provide training for supervisors and managers,and to post certain notices.by this time,however,propak had closed all its facilities in those states,thereby rendering it impossible for propak to implement such remedial measures propak advised the eeoc of this fact about one month later.
the eeoc nevertheless initiated a lawsuit in the district court against propak in august,more than six and years after quintois filed his discrimination charge.the eeoc alleged in its complaint that between october and june,propak violated title vii by refusing to hire,on the basis of national origin,a class of individuals at the shelby,north carolina facility.the eeoc sought certain injunctive relief,including an order requiring that propak institute policies and programs to benefit persons in order to mitigate the effects of the allegedly unlawful employment practices.the eeoc also sought monetary relief on behalf of the affected class of employment applicants.
propak filed a motion to dismiss arguing,among other things,that the action should be barred under the doctrine of laches the district court denied the motion without prejudice with respect to propak laches defense,and ordered the parties to engage in discovery limited to the issue whether propak had suffered prejudice resulting from the eeoc extensive delay in initiating the litigation.
at the conclusion of this discovery period,propak filed a motion for summary judgment,again asserting the defense of laches.the district court granted propak motion,concluding that the eeoc delay in initiating the lawsuit was unreasonable.in reaching this conclusion,the court emphasized the fact that during the investigation,there were significant periods when the eeoc took little or no action toward completing the investigation.
the district court held that propak suffered prejudice resulting from the eeoc unreasonable delay.the court observed that certain important witnesses,including the site managers for the shelby facility during the relevant time period,were no longer employed by propak and that locating them would be difficult,if not impossible.the court also stated that even if such witnesses ultimately could be located,they likely would have faded memories of the time period at issue,which was more than five years before the complaint was filed.
the court noted that the eeoc delay caused propak additional prejudice,because propak routinely had destroyed personnel records three years after an individual no longer was employed by the company.thus,propak destroyed the records of employees who left the company between and before being notified in september that the eeoc was pursuing the matter on a class basis the court specifically rejected the eeoc argument that it had notified propak of the class designation at an earlier date,observing that the record did not support the eeoc assertion.although the court also noted the eeoc failure to identify purported victims and the unavailability of injunctive relief,the court primarily emphasized propak inability to produce key witnesses and the destruction of documents essential to propak defense.
after the district court entered its judgment in favor of propak,the eeoc timely filed a notice of appeal.the eeoc later sought dismissal of the appeal,which this court ordered upon the agreed motion of the parties.
the district court later considered propak motion seeking attorneys fees in the amount of,which were incurred by propak after the eeoc filed the complaint.the district court granted the motion,and awarded propak nearly the full amount requested.relying on the supreme court holding in christiansburg garment eeoc,d,the district court concluded that an award of attorneys fees was appropriate because the eeoc knew or should have known that its claim was frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless.id.at.
the district court held that the eeoc acted unreasonably in filing the complaint,and alternatively held that the eeoc acted unreasonably in continuing the litigation in view of the developing record.the court stated that the eeoc had acted unreasonably in filing the complaint because by the time the eeoc determined to bring this action it was abundantly clear that a lawsuit would be moot and thus it was unreasonable to have filed it.the court held that injunctive relief was not available because propak had closed the shelby plant and its other north carolina facilities,and that an award of monetary damages was unlikely because the eeoc knew before filing the complaint that it could not identify the class of alleged victims.
with respect to the eeoc continued pursuit of the litigation following discovery,the district court alternatively held that such pursuit was unreasonable because it was again reaffirmed during discovery that purported victims and witnesses could not be located and the facilities were closed.the court further concluded that the eeoc unreasonably continued to pursue the litigation after learning that the relevant employment records were no longer in existence.
addressing the amount of attorneys fees,the district court analyzed propak request in detail,despite the eeoc failure to contest the amount sought,and ultimately awarded propak the eeoc filed a timely appeal challenging this award.
the eeoc asks us to hold that federal courts are not permitted to apply the equitable defense of laches in a lawsuit brought by an agency of the federal government.conceding that it failed to raise this argument in the district court,the eeoc nevertheless maintains that it would be unjust to permit an award of attorneys fees incurred in asserting a laches defense.alternatively,the eeoc asserts that the district court impermissibly relied on its earlier laches determination in awarding attorneys fees,and that the court made erroneous factual findings in deciding its fee award.we disagree with the eeoc arguments.
as a general matter,a litigant must pay its own attorneys fees in the absence of a statutory or enforceable contractual provision allowing attorneys fees to be awarded to a prevailing party.see christiansburg,at.title vii provides such a statutory mechanism,which gives district courts the discretion to award reasonable attorneys fees to a prevailing party.id.at.this provision states 
in any action or proceeding under this subchapter the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the eeoc or the united states,a reasonable attorney fee including expert fees as part of the costs,and the eeoc and the united states shall be liable for costs the same as a private person.
although section k does not place different burdens on plaintiffs and defendants seeking an award of attorneys fees,the supreme court explained in christiansburg that a heightened standard applies to a prevailing defendant seeking such an award in a title vii action.at.in contrast to a prevailing private plaintiff,who generally will be awarded attorneys fees under this provision,a prevailing defendant is eligible to receive such an award only when the court finds that the plaintiff action was frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation.id.at.however,a finding of bad faith is not required for a prevailing defendant to be awarded attorneys fees.id.
a district court must avoid engaging in post hoc reasoning in considering whether a plaintiff action under title vii was unreasonable,and an award will not stand if based only on the plaintiff failure to prevail.id.at.an award of attorneys fees to a prevailing defendant is a conservative tool,to be used sparingly in cases in which the plaintiff initiated or continued to litigate a claim that the plaintiff knew or should have known was groundless,frivolous,or unreasonable.eeoc great steaks,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
there is neither a precise test to be used,nor a specific quantum of proof required,in determining whether a plaintiff claim was unreasonable.id.citing arnold burger king,cir.instead,a decision whether attorneys fees should be awarded to a prevailing defendant under the christiansburg standard is peculiarly within the province of the trial judge,who is on the scene and able to assess the oftentimes minute considerations which weigh in the initiation of a legal action.id.quoting arnold,at.
we review for an abuse of discretion the district court decision to award attorneys fees to propak under section k.see id.at.in light of the principles discussed above,we accord great deference to the district court conclusion that the eeoc actions were unreasonable.see id.at.additionally,we review the district court factual findings in support of the fee award for clear error.see williams metro.life ins,cir daly hill,cir.
as an initial matter,we reject the eeoc request that we consider the issue whether laches is available as an affirmative defense to an action filed by an agency of the united states.although the issue was relevant to the district court summary judgment holding,the eeoc abandoned its appeal of the summary judgment order.accordingly,we do not consider the rationale for the court laches determination,or the eeoc arguments relating to that decision,in the present appeal.
we turn to consider the eeoc argument that the district court improperly based its decision awarding attorneys fees on the court earlier laches ruling.the eeoc asserts that the district court engaged in hindsight logic in explaining its award of attorneys fees by referencing its earlier laches holding and the prejudicial delay caused by the eeoc.we disagree with the eeoc argument.
in awarding attorneys fees under the christiansburg standard upon finding that the eeoc unreasonably initiated the litigation,the district court award was not based on the earlier summary judgment decision.although the court referenced its previous findings of delay and prejudice from the summary judgment holding,and the two decisions set forth many overlapping facts,the two holdings were based on different principles of law.
the summary judgment holding of laches was based on the eeoc unjustified delay in bringing the lawsuit,and on the resulting prejudice affecting propak ability to defend itself in the action.that decision rested primarily on the unavailability of key witnesses and documents that propak needed to support its defense.
in contrast,the district court awarded attorneys fees chiefly on the basis that the eeoc lawsuit effectively was moot at its inception.in reaching this conclusion,the court emphasized that,when the complaint was filed,the eeoc had failed to identify the class of victims who could be entitled to monetary relief,and injunctive relief was unavailable because propak had closed its facilities in north carolina.these findings,which were central to the court conclusion that the eeoc unreasonably initiated the lawsuit,were not material to the court laches decision articulated on summary judgment.thus,the court fee award reflected proper consideration of the christiansburg standard by assessing whether the eeoc acted unreasonably in initiating the litigation 
we accord great deference to the district court conclusion that the eeoc acted unreasonably in initiating the litigation.see great steaks,at.the eeoc argues nevertheless that the district court erred in reaching this conclusion,and attacks the court factual finding that the eeoc could not identify individual members of the class of victims eligible for monetary relief.
under our clear error standard,however,we will not reverse a district court factual finding unless after reviewing the record we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.helton v.at t,cir.the present record contains four entries from the spring of noting that an i nvestigator interviewed potential class member,and four similar notations from early noting that p otential class member was interviewed.emphasis added.the eeoc asserts that these entries demonstrate that the eeoc identified the class of victims harmed by propak hiring practices during the relevant period.we disagree.
the record lacks any description of the substance of these interviews with potential class members,or of any other interviews that may have been conducted to identify the class of purported victims in particular,the record does not show whether the individuals who were interviewed worked or applied for work in the shelby,north carolina facility during the relevant time period,nor does the record indicate whether the individuals interviewed had credible claims of discrimination or desired to be included in the class.
the record also includes a notation that contact letters were mailed to potential class members.however,the record does not show that any individuals receiving these letters fell within the eeoc definition of the target class.moreover,the fact that the eeoc engaged in efforts to identify potential claimants does not establish that the eeoc successfully identified individuals harmed by propak hiring practices during the relevant time period.indeed,the evidence showing the eeoc efforts to identify the class of victims,without any indication that such efforts wer
