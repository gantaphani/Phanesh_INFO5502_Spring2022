defendant sharmila isaiah,who was judicially acquitted of two criminal charges,appeals the district court denial of her request for expenses and attorneys fees arising from her criminal defense.the united states charged isaiah with participation in a conspiracy and with bank fraud.after the government rested its case,the district court,pursuant to,acquitted isaiah because it determined that the government had failed to present sufficient evidence of isaiah specific intent to enter into a conspiracy and to defraud a financial institution.isaiah then moved to recover costs and attorneys fees under the hyde amendment,stat.reprinted in,statutory notes.the district court,however,denied her request because,as the question of isaiah intent was a close one,the government had not engaged in a vexatious,frivolous,or bad faith prosecution.we affirm.
in the summer of,packaging materials,an ohio company that manufactures plastic bags sold throughout the united states,discovered a counterfeit check among the items drawn on its checking account with firstar bank in cambridge,ohio.the check was to the order of sharmie isaiah in the amount of.
isaiah is a resident of indiana with a bank account at indiana members credit union.she was romantically involved with ikenna myers,and myers introduced her to his high school friend mitch yanni when the two men traveled from columbus to indianapolis to visit isaiah.myers testified that yanni asked him whether isaiah had a bank account,but myers stated that he did not know and that yanni would have to ask isaiah.myers testified that he later heard isaiah agree to yanni request for isaiah to deposit a check made to her order.after isaiah agreed to negotiate the check,myers and yanni returned to columbus.while the pair traveled,yanni called isaiah and asked for her name,number,and the name of her bank.
approximately two weeks later,myers,yanni,and two of yanni friends returned to indianapolis.myers testified that,to the best of his knowledge,yanni and isaiah had made arrangements for the deposit of the check that yanni had brought with them.after the group assembled and arrived at isaiah bank,yanni handed isaiah the check to her order for,and she went inside the bank to deposit it.she handed the deposit receipt to yanni.
yanni and myers asked isaiah to write some checks to their order,and she mailed the checks to them.check number was to the order of myers in the amount of,and check number was to the order of yanni in the amount of.yanni and myers were not able to negotiate the checks in columbus,so they drove to indianapolis to cash the checks at isaiah bank.the bank contacted isaiah when the checks were presented,and isaiah verified that the checks were good.
a week or two later,yanni and myers returned to indianapolis with justin alles to meet demetrius bynum,one of yanni schoolmates.as the three men traveled to indianapolis,yanni telephoned isaiah and had her write checks from her account to the order of alles and bynum,neither of whom isaiah knew.the three men went to isaiah apartment,where she gave the men the checks,and they left.the three men then picked up bynum.check was to the order of alles for,and check was payable to bynum for.these checks were cashed at isaiah bank after the tellers obtained confirmation from isaiah that the checks were good.
soon after,an investigator from firstar bank contacted isaiah and told her that the check drawn on packaging materials account was counterfeit.the investigator testified that isaiah sent him a written statement,a copy of the checks to the order of myers and yanni,and her bank statement for the relevant period.in her statement to the investigator,isaiah identified yanni as yani michel and failed to mention the checks made to the order of alles and bynum.she wrote that myers not yanni,as myers later testified at trial asked her to negotiate the check from a settlement because myers did not have a checking account.myers request for checks did not make sense since he said he could get the check in the first place but he said that he would cash it at my bank.she continued,this made me think something was wrong with the whole situation but all i could do at that point was get the money out and give it to ikenna myers.her bank statement revealed that isaiah had used some of the money from the counterfeit check.
in august,a federal magistrate judge issued several criminal complaints and arrest warrants,including a complaint and warrant for isaiah.the complaint charged her with knowingly aiding and abetting a scheme to defraud a financial institution.several persons pled guilty to various offenses and testified at isaiah trial.in december,a federal grand jury returned an indictment,charging issa conteh,yanni,keith edward walker,deepika benjamin,isaiah,joshua ingram,and heather watkins with various offenses.isaiah was charged with participating in a conspiracy,in violation of h,and aiding and abetting bank fraud,in violation of and.two of these criminal defendants entered guilty pleas before the trial began.the remaining criminal defendants elected to go to trial.
at the joint trial,the evidence revealed that conteh managed a nationwide counterfeiting operation.according to mahamdou tunkara,an individual involved in the counterfeiting who pled guilty,conteh recruited and relocated individuals so that they could open bank accounts under assumed names around the united states.the individuals would then deposit counterfeit checks into the bank accounts.the individual would next receive instructions for withdrawing the money in multiple transactions.once the individual had withdrawn all of the counterfeit check proceeds from the account,the organization relocated the individual so that the counterfeit scam could begin in a new location.
the evidence reflected that conteh and yanni knew each other and that yanni oversaw counterfeiting operations in the columbus area.instead of recruiting individuals to relocate to various parts of the united states,yanni or his confederates in the counterfeiting operation convinced other individuals,mostly young women,to negotiate checks in their personal bank accounts.several trial witnesses,who had pled guilty to crimes related to the same counterfeiting scheme,testified that they did not know that the checks were counterfeit at the time that they negotiated them.
two aspects of the testimony of one of these witnesses,haniya sabir,figure in this appeal.sabir testified that she had given yanni her bank account number and that yanni had at least once obtained her account balance.sabir testified,however,that she did not know how yanni did so without her account password,which she had not given to him.isaiah now contends that the government failure to investigate this discrepancy demonstrates that the government prosecuted isaiah in bad faith.
also,on recross of sabir,isaiah defense counsel asked sabir whether she had known that the check that she deposited was counterfeit,and sabir answered no.presumably,the purpose of the question was to demonstrate that the government knowingly accepted sabir guilty plea despite evidence that she had been tricked into participating in the counterfeiting scheme.the government followed up by presenting sabir with the information that charged her with uttering a counterfeit instrument and asking her whether that information included any language referring to intent to defraud.sabir answered that it did not.after isaiah defense counsel objected that the government inquiry was irrelevant and misleading,the government explained that its purpose was to demonstrate that,the statute that sabir pled guilty to violating,does not require intent to defraud.instead,section requires only intent to deceive,a mental state that is easier to prove than intent to defraud.the district court noted that intent was at issue and overruled defense counsel objection.however,the district court,over the government objection,then permitted isaiah defense counsel to ask sabir clarifying questions as to whether she understood the terms contained in her plea agreement and information.
at the conclusion of the government case,isaiah moved for judgment of acquittal pursuant to.because,she argued,the government had not produced sufficient evidence for the jury to find that she had specific intent to defraud or to join a conspiracy.the government countered that reckless indifference was sufficient to satisfy the scienter requirement and that the government had offered sufficient circumstantial evidence of isaiah reckless indifference to satisfy its burden.isaiah replied that united states desantis,cir,stands for the proposition that recklessness is relevant only to whether the defendant knowingly executed a scheme the first element of bank fraud,not whether the defendant also had the specific intent to defraud the second element of bank fraud.the district court granted isaiah motion for acquittal on both the and counts because the government failed to demonstrate that isaiah had specific intent to defraud or to join a conspiracy.
isaiah subsequently applied for attorneys fees and costs pursuant to the hyde amendment,arguing that the government prosecution was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith.isaiah principal contentions were that the government refused to accept her denial of guilt,that the government sought to coerce her into pleading guilty,that the government knew that it was unable to prove that isaiah had any specific intent,that the government discounted her cooperation with investigators,and that the government accepted guilty pleas from several witnesses at trial who denied having the intent to defraud.the government opposed isaiah motion.
the district court denied isaiah motion.the district court first determined that the government case was not frivolous because it was not groundless.the court questioned whether,in hindsight,it made the correct decision in removing this issue from the jury because the government presented several facts which could reasonably give rise to an inference of guilty knowledge and criminal intent.at the very least,the question of isaiah intent was a close one.the court also held that the government was not required to believe isaiah claims of innocence or accept her cooperation.the court then determined that the prosecution was not vexatious because the government position was supported by probable cause.probable cause existed because the government presented circumstantial evidence to establish her intent.the court also noted that there was no evidence that the government intended to harass isaiah,even assuming that she did not engage in plea negotiations and did not admit any guilt.finally,the court determined that the government had not pursued its prosecution in bad faith because its case was supported by probable cause and because isaiah innocence was not obvious.moreover,the court held that there was no reason to question the propriety of the witnesses guilty pleas,which presumably complied with.and were not appealed.the court ended its opinion by determining that there was no evidence to support isaiah contention that the government prosecution was racially motivated.isaiah now appeals the judgment of the district court.
the hyde amendment permits prevailing federal criminal defendants to recover expenses incurred in defending criminal charges if the position of the united states was vexatious,frivolous,or in bad faith,unless,the court finds that special circumstances make such an award unjust,stat.in deciding a defendant motion,the district court must analyze the case as a whole,not count by count.united states heavrin,cir.the defendant bears the burden of meeting any one of the three grounds under the statute,and acquittal by itself does not suffice.see united states true,cir.this court has previously stated that the hyde amendment places a daunting obstacle before defendants who seek to obtain attorney fees and costs from the government following a successful defense of criminal charges.id.at citing united states gilbert,cir.
this court reviews factual aspects of determinations under the hyde amendment for clear error,legal aspects de novo,and discretionary aspects for abuse of discretion.see true,at treating all three scopes of review as part of review for abuse of discretion.an abuse of discretion may be found when the district court has used an erroneous legal standard or when the reviewing court is firmly convinced that a mistake has been made,when it is left with a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.id.quoting sec y of treasury,cir.deference to the district court is warranted because that court has a fresh recollection of the government conduct that this court review of the cold record simply can not provide.united states skeddle,cir per curiam.the district court did not abuse its discretion in this case because the district court reasonably determined that isaiah failed to meet her burden of demonstrating that the united states prosecution was vexatious,frivolous,or brought in bad faith.
the district court properly determined that the prosecution was not vexatious because isaiah did not proffer sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the government position was not supported by probable cause.the government position is vexatious if it is brought without reasonable or probable cause or excuse,true,at,for the purpose of irritating,annoying,or tormenting the opposing party,heavrin,at.isaiah argues,without any evidence to support her claim,that the government knew that isaiah engaged in no wrongdoing.because the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that isaiah has not demonstrated that the government position was without probable cause,it is unnecessary to consider whether the government prosecuted isaiah to harass her.
there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the government position was supported by probable cause.the government presented evidence that isaiah agreed to negotiate a check to her order written on the account of a business of which she had never heard,that she wrote checks payable to people she had never met,that her involvement allowed her to profit from the funds of the counterfeit check,and that she admitted that the circumstances were suspicious.these circumstantial facts are sufficient to establish probable cause that isaiah intended to defraud the bank and join the conspiracy.as the seventh circuit stated in united states ryan,cir,i ntent to defraud can be proven by circumstantial evidence and by inferences drawn from the scheme itself.indeed,the district court noted that with the benefit of the transcribed testimony now before it,this court questions whether it made the correct decision in removing this issue from the jury at the very least,the question of isaiah intent was a close one.moreover,the government was not required to credit isaiah denial,and the government was under no duty to accept her assistance with the investigation.thus,even if the government could not prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt,the government position was supported by probable cause and therefore was not vexatious 
the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the prosecution was not frivolous.this court has defined a frivolous position as one lacking a reasonable legal basis or where the government lacks a reasonable expectation of obtaining sufficient material evidence by the time of trial.heavrin,at.the government legal position was reasonable,and the government had a reasonable expectation of proffering sufficient circumstantial evidence of isaiah intent at trial.
the government position that reckless indifference could satisfy the statutes requirement for specific intent was not frivolous because what constitutes specific intent under federal criminal statutes is not entirely clear.the elements of bank fraud under are not in dispute.they are that the defendant must have knowingly executed or attempted to execute a scheme to defraud a financial institution the defendant must have done so with the intent to defraud and the financial institution must have been insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation.united states reaume,cir.the charge of conspiracy also requires specific intent.see united states brown,cir.i
