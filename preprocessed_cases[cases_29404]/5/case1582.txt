factual and procedural background 
we begin with an overview of the parties to this appeal and their respective roles in three cases,of which the last is the interpleader case on appeal.
sesnon fire case 
in,flannery and murray sued the gas for damages suffered as a consequence of the sesnon wildfire super.county,no.the sesnon fire case,consolidated under the lead case,no.judge john shepard wiley presided over the case.tepper represented flannery and murray jointly pursuant to a contingency fee agreement until the fall of,when attorney dennis ardi substituted in as murray counsel.tepper continued to represent flannery until june,when attorney joseph daneshrad substituted in as flannery counsel.
on february,flannery,murray,and the gas settled the sesnon fire case.the parties settlement was approved by the court.although the terms of the settlement were confidential,it is clear that a specific amount settlement funds was to be paid to flannery and his counsel,while other amounts were payable to other individuals,including murray and her counsel.
palimony case 
while the sesnon fire case was pending,murray filed a separate lawsuit against flannery super.county,no.the palimony case claiming among other things percent ownership of the ranch that was damaged in the sesnon fire.judge richard rico conducted an jury trial in the palimony case,as well as a separate court trial,and in february the court entered judgment declaring murray percent owner of the property that was the subject of the fire damage claims in the sesnon fire case,and directing the court in the interpleader case described below to disburse to murray from the funds being held by the court,subject to any attorney fees and costs to be determined as against her share of the interpleaded funds.
interpleader case 
on march,the gas deposited the settlement funds with the court and filed a complaint in interpleader,identifying tepper,daneshrad,and flannery as defendants and claimants.super.county,no.the interpleader case.the case was assigned to judge wiley and related to the sesnon fire case.on march,the gas filed an amendment adding murray as a doe defendant tepper and murray filed answers in the interpleader case on march and march,respectively.
on may,judge wiley ordered the gas discharged from the interpleader case.he also denied flannery anti slapp motion to strike the interpleader complaint under section.flannery appealed,and the interpleader case was stayed at the trial court level until the appeal was resolved,with this court affirming judge wiley order.the remittitur issued on april.
on may,the gas filed a motion for attorney fees and costs,seeking payment for expenses incurred after may,in connection with opposing various motions and writ petitions filed by flannery,as well as the prior appeal.the hearing on the gas motion for attorney fees was scheduled for september.on august,murray filed a motion seeking to collect the february,judgment awarded to her in the palimony case.on august,tepper filed a motion seeking to collect attorney fees and costs associated with his representation of flannery in the sesnon fire case.tepper motion pointed out that despite the case having been pending for over two years,and remittitur having issued on april,after flannery unsuccessful appeal,flannery had not filed an answer and was therefore in default.tepper motion also pointed out that daneshrad had not a demurrer filed before the appeal.on august,flannery and daneshrad filed answers in the interpleader case.flannery also filed oppositions to all three motions

discussion 
appellants raise a number of challenges to the court orders granting the motions filed by the gas,murray,and tepper.we first consider whether the appeal is subject to dismissal based on the absence of a reporter transcript or an agreed or settled statement.next,we review appellants claim that the court orders deprived them of due process.we then consider in turn each of the arguments raised by flannery to the orders granting the motions filed by the gas,murray,and tepper.
effect of appellants failure to include a reporter transcript or a suitable substitute 
appellants challenge orders made after a lengthy hearing at which no court reporter was present.the record on appeal does not include a settled statement or agreed statement as authorized by california rules of court,rules and.

appellants due process claim 
appellants contend the trial court violated due process by granting respondents motions without a trial or a summary judgment motion.because appellants failed to put their own claims at issue in compliance with the statutes governing interpleader actions,they can not now complain that they were deprived of a right to a trial.
when an interpleader defendant elects to file an answer or under subdivision d of section the pleading must contain allegations of fact as to either defendant ownership of or other interest in the amount or property interpleaded.subdivision e of the same section states that conflicting claims to funds shall be deemed issues triable by the court,and if the amounts claimed exceed the amount on deposit,any issues of fact involved in determining whether there is a deficiency shall be tried by the court or a jury 
appellants filed their answers belatedly the answers were insufficient to place their claims to the interpleaded funds at issue before the court.first,both appellants answers contained a general denial of the allegations of the interpleader complaint.the general denials in effect denied the gas allegations that appellants each claim an interest in some or all of the same settlement proceeds to which tepper claim s an interest and that other defendants claim an interest to all or some of any settlement proceeds payable to flannery under the confidential settlement agreement.next,appellants answers are legally inadequate to state a conflicting claim to the interpleader funds because they are devoid of any factual specificity.interior systems,del webb d,conclusionary sic allegations without facts to support them are ambiguous and may be disregarded.flannery answer purports to state his claim in a single sentence flannery claims that the entire amount of the interpleader funds deposited with the court belongs to him as provided for in the settlement agreement.similarly,daneshrad purported claim states,daneshrad claims the sum of up to date and continuing for legal services rendered to flannery pursuant to a contractual lien with flannery.
on this record,particularly where the sum total of the court awards to the gas,murray,and tepper was less than the amount of funds deposited with the court,appellants can not demonstrate that they were entitled to have their claims decided by trial or summary judgment motion.with no reporter transcript in the record,we presume that flannery had the opportunity to present evidence at the hearing on september,and waived any objection to the court proceeding on the parties declarations and exhibits alone.vo,supra,th at affirming judgment in absence of reporter transcript on the grounds that the lower court judgment is presumed correct,and all intendments and presumptions are indulged to support the judgment.
attorney fee award to the gas.
relevant facts and procedure 
in may,the trial court granted the gas motion for discharge and awarded for costs and reasonable attorney fees.in may,after we remanded the interpleader case following flannery first appeal,the gas filed a renewed motion seeking additional attorney fees and costs incurred after may.flannery opposed the gas motion,arguing neither section nor section authorizes an award of attorney fees.on september,the court granted the gas motion,awarding in fees and costs incurred since may.
flannery contends section,subdivision a,only permits the court to award attorney fees incurred until the party is discharged,and therefore the trial court erred in granting the gas motion for additional attorney fees and costs incurred after may.we disagree.
a de novo standard of review applies to the question of whether statutory language authorizes an award of attorney fees and costs.conservatorship of whitley cal th.if a statute permits a party to obtain attorney fees and costs,the order granting or denying such an award is reviewed for abuse of discretion.soni wellmike enterprise th.
section,subdivision a,gives the trial court authority to award attorney fees to the gas for fees and costs incurred not only to initiate the interpleader case and obtain discharge,but also to defend against subsequent motions,writ petitions,and appeals attacking the validity of the interpleader complaint and discharge order.flannery relies solely on the text of section,subdivision a,and excerpts from canal ins.tackett th canal to argue that the statute only authorizes a court to award attorney fees to an interpleading party when it orders discharge,not at any later date.section,subdivision a permits the party initiating an interpleader action to request fees and costs incurred in such action.the statutory text continues in ordering the discharge of such party,the court may,in its discretion,award such party his costs and reasonable attorney fees from the amount in dispute which has been deposited with the court,subd.a.canal involved an interpleading plaintiff who sought an award of attorney fees three months after the court had discharged plaintiff and allocated the interpleader funds among claimants.the appellate court held section did not authorize a court to award fees to a party that had earlier opted to settle the case and forgo its request for fees,and then belatedly sought fees three months after the interpleaded funds had been allocated among the claimants.canal,supra,at.the facts of canal are fully distinguishable from the facts and procedural posture of the case before us.here,the lower court awarded the gas fees and costs incurred prior to discharge,but the gas subsequently incurred additional fees and costs in the interpleader action based on flannery decision to continue to challenge the validity of the action itself.case law recognizes that attorney fees,whether recoverable by contract or statute,are available for services at trial and on appeal.citation.serrano unruh cal d,italics added rejecting argument that no fees are recoverable for defending a fee award on appeal because the appeal did not independently meet the statutory requirements for a fee award see also ketchum,supra,cal th at the party litigating a matter tenaciously can not complain about the time necessarily spent by the other party in response.we do not read the language of section or the reasoning of canal as mandating a departure from the usual rule that a party entitled to attorney fees and costs by statute is also entitled to fees and costs incurred on appeal.
we therefore conclude section,subdivision a,gives the court statutory authority to award the gas attorney fees and costs until the gas was fully and finally discharged from the proceeding,which includes defending the interpleader complaint and discharge order against subsequent motions,writ petitions,and appeals.see lincoln nat.life ins.mitchell d.because the court had authority to award fees under section,we need not consider whether section provides an alternate basis for the award.to the extent flannery challenges the amount of the award to the gas,without a reporter transcript,flannery can not demonstrate the trial court award constituted an abuse of discretion.
monetary award to murray 
relevant facts and procedure 
judge wiley ruled on motions in limine filed by murray and flannery in the sesnon fire case on january,ordering that murray and flannery are parties to the palimony case in which murray seeks a declaration of her ownership interest in the real property murray and flannery claim the sesnon fire damaged.the respective ownership interests of murray and flannery in the subject property are not directly relevant to their claims of negligence against the gas litigating the issue of the ownership interests of murray and flannery in this case is unnecessary,as the palimony case will resolve that dispute.
murray,flannery,and the gas later settled the sesnon fire case.the settlement terms specified,as between murray and flannery,the parties are not releasing each other of and from any and all claims that may exist between them,whether or not included in the pending lawsuits.and this settlement is without prejudice to either of their rights in those other lawsuits.murray attorney in the palimony case advised the sesnon fire case settlement judge that he planned on going to court in the palimony case and advising the court of this settlement because we intend to seek an injunction restraining order.
on february,judge rico issued an order in the palimony case requiring certain settlement proceeds from the sesnon fire case be deposited in a trust account for the benefit of murray and flannery.
on february,murray obtained a judgment in the palimony case awarding her,subject to attorney fees and costs palimony judgment.the pertinent part of the palimony judgment declares murray a percent owner of the ranch property damaged in the fire at issue in the sesnon fire case and recognizes that murray and flannery property damage claims in the sesnon fire case were settled in the amount of.the palimony judgment continues this settlement of was deposited by the gas with the court in the interpleader case.as and for her share of the property damages claim in the sesnon fire case,flannery shall pay to murray the sum of,which amount is subject to any attorney fees and costs that may be assessed against this money as to be determined in the interpleader case.the court in the interpleader case,shall release and disburse from the funds being held in that action,the sum of to murray subject to attorney fees and costs,if any to be determined as against murray share.on april,flannery appealed the palimony judgment 
while flannery appeal of the palimony judgment remained pending,murray filed a motion in the interpleader case to collect the palimony judgment,seeking disbursement of plus interest from the funds deposited by the gas.flannery opposition argued that the palimony judgment was stayed pending appeal,judge wiley lacked jurisdiction to modify the settlement agreement reached in the sesnon fire case,and the palimony judgment was subject to an offset for attorney fees claimed by tepper and daneshrad.murray reply brief argued that the palimony judgment was not stayed pending appeal because flannery had not posted a bond or undertaking as required by section,judge wiley had expressly granted judge rico,the judge presiding over the palimony case,authority to determine the division of any judgment or settlement in the sesnon fire case as between flannery and murray,and any claim for attorney fees regarding murray palimony judgment had been resolved.
after a hearing on september,judge wiley issued an order dated september,awarding murray from the interpleader funds,but denying her request for interest.judge wiley noted his prior january,order in the sesnon fire case that the court in the palimony case would determine the ownership split between murray and flannery and adopted the finding from the palimony case to award flannery.the september,order also addressed the provision in the palimony judgment making murray award subject to any attorney fees charged against murray share of the interpleaded funds.relying on murray declaration that she would resolve any fee obligations to her attorneys out of the award amount,the court extinguished any claims by murray attorneys,tepper and ardi,to the remaining funds on deposit with the court.the trial court denied murray request for postjudgment interest,noting that the palimony judgment is most fairly interpreted as a judgment for the personal property that is within this court interpleader jurisdiction.finally,the court ruled that murray is entitled to the funds immediately,rejecting flannery argument that the palimony judgment is stayed pending appeal.
flannery raises multiple contentions of error against the order awarding of the interpleader funds to murray,but none are persuasive.first,the court correctly concluded the palimony judgment was not stayed pending appeal.second,flannery can not show the court that entered the palimony judgment lacked jurisdiction.third,flannery fails to demonstrate the trial court abused its discretion in deferring to murray assurance that her attorneys will be paid from the award amount.fourth,there is no evidence or even adequate factual allegations to support flannery claim that daneshrad firm had a lien that took priority over any distribution to murray.
stay of palimony judgment pending appeal 
flannery contends the interpleader court lacked authority to grant murray motion because the palimony judgment was stayed pending appeal under section,subdivision a alternatively,flannery argues that because the palimony judgment is a mandatory injunction,it was subject to an automatic stay on appeal.murray responds that the palimony judgment was enforceable because flannery did not post an undertaking as required under section.murray is correct.
under subdivision a of section enforcement of a judgment for m oney or the payment of money is not stayed on appeal u nless an undertaking is given.under section an appeal of a judgment for delivery of personal property does not stay enforcement of judgment unless an undertaking in a sum and upon conditions fixed by the trial court,is given 
flannery and murray disagree about the impact of mccallion hibernia.society cal.mccallion on the question of whether flannery needed to post an undertaking to stay the palimony judgment on appeal.in mccallion,the court concluded that money held by the court in a proceeding akin to an interpleader action constituted personal property within the meaning of former section,the predecessor to section.id.at.murray and the lower court relied on the mccallion court reasoning that when the money came into the possession of the court the litigation resolved itself essentially into an action to try the title to personal property subject to the stay provisions applicable to judgments for delivery of personal property.ibid.flannery,on the other hand,focuses on the mccallion court reliance on the former statutory language to conclude that no stay bond was required because the fund was in the possession of the court,and such fact by the terms of the section itself does away with the requirement.ibid.
in order to explain why current statutory language requires a bond to stay a judgment for identified funds already in the court possession,we briefly review some relevant legislative history.when mccallion was decided in,former section provided that the execution of a judgment or order for assignment or delivery of personal property can not be stayed by appeal,unless the things required to be assigned or delivered be placed in the custody of such officer or receiver as the court may appoint,or unless an undertaking be entered into former,code amends,ch,code civ.proc,italics added.in,the legislature recodified the statutory provisions for stays pending appeal,replacing former section with section,but retaining language exempting from the bond requirement property placed in the court custody stats,ch.in,the legislature eliminated the exception relied upon by the mccallion court,so section currently states in relevant part the perfecting of an appeal shall not stay enforcement of the judgment or order of the trial court if the judgment or order appealed from directs the assignment or delivery of personal property unless an undertaking in a sum and upon conditions fixed by the trial court,is given the reference to funds deposited with the court,historically part of section,now appears in section,subdivision b and provides that in cases where the money to be paid is in the actual or constructive custody of the court such cases shall be governed,instead,by the provisions of section.
based on the amendments to statutory language since the time mccallion was decided,we conclude that the palimony judgment was a judgment for delivery of personal property governed by section because flannery did not seek an order from judge rico fixing the amount for an undertaking,flannery appeal did not stay enforcement of the palimony judgment.
jurisdiction to determine division of ownership of property at issue in the sesnon fire case 
flannery contends the palimony judgment is void because the palimony case court judge rico lacked jurisdiction to declare the rights of parties in the sesnon fire case.his argument rests on the fact that the settlement judge dismissed the sesnon fire case under section,retaining jurisdiction only to enforce the terms of the settlement.however,the settlement and dismissal of the sesnon fire case did not resolve the ongoing dispute between murray and flannery regarding their respective ownership interests in the property,and therefore their respective claims to the settlement funds.the parties to the sesnon fire case were well aware that there was ongoing litigation between murray and flannery and that judge wiley had deferred those questions to judge rico when he ruled on murray and flannery motions in limine on january.the settlement agreement expressly reserved those claims by stating,as between murray and flannery,the parties are not releasing each other of and from any and all claims that may exist between them,whether or not included in the pending lawsuits.and this settlement is without prejudice to either of their rights in those other lawsuits.
having entered into a settlement agreement that expressly reserved murray claims against him,flannery can not now claim that the court tasked with resolving those claims somehow lacked jurisdiction to do so.
offset of attorney fees 
flannery also contends the trial court erroneously failed to offset attorney fees against the disbursement as contemplated by the palimony judgment.flannery does not provide any legal authority to support his argument,nor does he specify what standard of review should apply.nevertheless,we glean from appellants opening brief that flannery is unhappy that the court ordered the full to murray without deducting fees owed to tepper or to daneshrad.one problem with the argument is that tepper is apparently satisfied with the judgment,as he has not appealed,and flannery has no standing to make an argument for him.a greater folly in this argument is that the court decision on whether or not to award fees to tepper or daneshrad is subject to an abuse of discretion standard of review.a request for an award of attorney fees is entrusted to the trial court discretion and will not be overturned in the absence of a manifest abuse of discretion,a prejudicial error of law,or necessary findings not supported by substantial evidence.yield dynamics,tea systems th.because flannery can not show the court abused its discretion in extinguishing tepper claim to additional fees based on his representation of murray and in impliedly denying daneshrad claim for fees,we find no error.
daneshrad fee lien 
finally,flannery contends the court erred when it disregarded the priority of daneshrad attorney fee lien and instead disbursed half of the funds on deposit to murray.as discussed earlier in this opinion,the record does not establish that daneshrad ever made a claim on the interpleaded funds,and so flannery contentions are unwarranted.a lien in favor of an attorney upon the proceeds of a prospective judgment in favor of his client for legal services rendered may be created either by express contract citations or it may be implied if the retainer agreement between the lawyer and client indicates that the former is to look to the judgment for payment of his fee citations.cetenko united california bank cal d,italics added cetenko.even if daneshrad had filed a sufficient answer,there is no evidence in the record on appeal demonstrating a contractual relationship between murray and daneshrad.accordingly,daneshrad lien would only apply to any amount awarded to flannery,and the court judgment reflects that fact.
monetary award to tepper 
relevant facts and procedure 
tepper represented flannery and murray jointly in the sesnon fire case until the fall of,when ardi substituted in as murray counsel.in june,tepper sought to withdraw from his role as flannery attorney,based on tepper recent diagnosis with advanced prostate cancer,ethical conflicts relating to flannery insistence on untruthful testimony,and flannery refusal to advance expert witness fees.ultimately,daneshrad substituted in as flannery new counsel on june.
on august,tepper filed a motion for attorney fees and costs seeking a disbursement of from the interpleaded funds.flannery opposition argued tepper could not recover on his fee lien without first filing a separate lawsuit against flannery,tepper is not entitled to any fees because he voluntarily withdrew from the case,and tepper inflated his fees and was double billing by seeking compensation from both flannery and murray.
after the september,hearing,the court awarded tepper.the court deducted any time claimed but not reflected in tepper billing records and half the time claimed for the period when tepper was representing both murray and flannery.the court also used an hourly rate of,rather than the hourly rate claimed by tepper.using the new hourly rate and the reduced time,the court applied a multiplier of based on the contingent nature of the fee agreement,which reflects a risk of and a delay in payment.
interpleader case satisfies the separate,independent action requirement for enforcement of an attorney fee lien 
flannery contends the court erred in awarding attorney fees and costs to tepper because tepper did not establish the existence and amount of his lien in an independent action.we reject this contention because the interpleader case satisfies the requirement that an attorney must file a separate,independent action in order to enforce a fee lien.
a lien in favor of an attorney upon the proceeds of a prospective judgment in favor of his client for legal services rendered has been recognized in numerous cases.cetenko,supra,cal d at.in california,an attorney lien is created only by contract either by an express provision in the attorney fee contract citations or by implication where the retainer agreement provides that the attorney is to look to the judgment for payment for legal services rendered citations.carroll interstate brands th,fn.omitted carroll.for liens created in a contingency fee contract,a cause of action to enforce the lien does not accrue until the occurrence of the stated contingency.fracasse brent cal d.the attorney lien survives even after discharge,although the attorney recovery is limited to the reasonable value of services actually performed,quantum meruit,rather than the full percentage specified in the contract.id.at weiss marcus d,where an attorney has been discharged with or without cause by a client with whom the attorney had a contingent fee agreement,upon occurrence of the contingency specified in the agreement,the attorney is limited to a quantum meruit recovery for the reasonable value of his services rendered to the time of discharge.
unlike a judgment creditor lien,which is created when the notice of lien is filed citation,an attorney lien is a secret lien it is created and the attorney security interest is protected even without a notice of lien.citations.carroll,supra,th at.still,it is permissible,and even advisable,for an attorney to file a notice of lien in the underlying action,meaning the action where the attorney is the client attorney of record or in the case of an attorney who has been discharged where the attorney previously represented the client.valenta regents of university of california d,valenta discharged attorney filed a notice of lien in the underlying action,an action by plaintiff valenta against defendant university for wrongful termination court lacked jurisdiction to either affirm or terminate the lien.
it is well recognized that,regardless of whether an attorney files a notice of lien,the court deciding the underlying action lacks jurisdiction to decide the existence or validity of the attorney lien claim on the underlying judgment.see,brown superior court th,brown the trial court in the underlying action had no authority to determine the existence or validity of the attorney claimed lien on the proceeds of the underlying judgment carroll,supra,th at a ppellate courts have consistently held that the trial court in the underlying action has no jurisdiction to determine the existence or validity of an attorney lien on the judgment valenta,supra,d at.the court in brown explained the limitation is founded on the fundamental principle that one who is not a party to a proceeding may not make a motion therein.citation.brown,supra,at.because an attorney is very unlikely to meet the criteria to intervene and become a party to the underlying action,the fundamental rule is that the attorney is not a party to the client action and can not appear on his or her own behalf to seek any relief in that action,including enforcement of a contractual lien against the proceeds of the judgment.see hansen jacobsen d,because the discharged attorney is not a party to the pending action and may not intervene,the trial court has no jurisdiction to award fees to that attorney.brown,supra,at.because the attorney can not intervene in the underlying action,a fter the client obtains a judgment,the attorney must bring a separate,independent action against the client to establish the existence of the lien,to determine the amount of the lien,and to enforce it.carroll,supra,at,italics added.
the court in mojtahedi vargas th,mojtahedi took this principle one step further by requiring that the former client must be named as a party to the separate,independent action to establish the existence and validity of an attorney fee lien.in mojtahedi,the plaintiff was the
