the appellant,john boyer,an income beneficiary of the rosanna forthmann testamentary trust hereafter,the trust,appeals from the trial court order approving the account current and report for the year hereafter the accounting submitted by the cotrustees of the trust.the current cotrustees are the respondents 
the trial court refused to grant boyer an additional continuance of an already hearing on the trustees petition for approval of the accounting.without filing any objections to the accounting,boyer sought the continuance in order to conduct discovery to evaluate whether or not any response on objections to the accounting should be made.italics added.as we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying boyer request for a third continuance of the hearing and thereafter issuing its order approving the accounting,we will affirm.we also conclude,however,that boyer argument with respect to his claimed right to discovery was not frivolous.we therefore will reject the trustees request for imposition of sanctions.
factual and procedural 
the trustor decedent,rosanna forthmann,died testate on february.in her will,she established a testamentary trust that was a charitable trust of a type which existed prior to the tax reform act of.under its provisions,all of the income received by the trust was to be distributed currently to specified beneficiaries of which boyer was one the testamentary trust also had a clause 
at the time of the proceedings initiated herein by boyer,annual accountings had been filed by trustees and approved by the trial court for each year from through.the accounting was filed by the trustees on june,
without filing any objections,boyer,on september,filed an application for a determination,pursuant to probate code section that his attached ex parte application for order granting discovery rights would not constitute a contest within the meaning of paragraph eleventh of the trust.see fn,ante.on september,boyer filed a second application under section in which he sought a determination that his proposed response and objections to the accounting a copy of which proposed filing was attached as ex.a to his application and his request that the then scheduled october,hearing on the accounting be taken off calendar,would not constitute a contest.
the trial court set both applications for hearing on october.after argument,the trial court held that boyer was authorized to conduct discovery as to all financial matters relating to the accounting and into the prior year account in order to establish continuity and bring the prior year figures forward and no decision could be made with respect to whether boyer proposed response and objections to the accounting would violate the trust no contest clause until after the objections had been filed,considered and ruled upon.in making this ruling,the court was relying upon the principle articulated in estate of ferber th,d ferber,that a no contest clause may not be enforced against an objection to an accounting unless such objection is found to be frivolous.the court emphasized that the question as to whether boyer objections might be frivolous was not an issue that could be determined in advance of the court consideration of the account and the objections made thereto.
in allowing boyer to conduct limited discovery,the trial court clearly was doing so on the assumption that boyer would first file his proposed response and objections to the accounting once filed,boyer would then be permitted to proceed with the authorized discovery.no ruling,however,could be made with respect to whether boyer proposed response and objections would constitute a prohibited contest until after those objections had been heard and ruled upon the trial court also refused to take off calendar the scheduled october,hearing on the accounting.
this ruling apparently presented boyer with a dilemma and he chose not to actually file the response and objections.he simply went to the october hearing and requested that the hearing be taken off calendar or that he be granted a continuance in which to conduct the discovery authorized by the october,order counsel for boyer conceded that w e have engaged in anything yet since the hearing granting authority to conduct discovery was just on october.however,we are contemplating written discovery subpoenas,possibly to evaluate whether or not any response or objections should be made.italics added.
boyer request for a continuance for a matter already delayed twice was vigorously opposed by the trustees.after confirming with boyer counsel that she had been representing him throughout this whole period since the accounting had been filed or at least since the initially scheduled hearing date of july,the court denied the request for a continuance.since the trustees application for approval of the accounting was before the court,all proper notices had been given,and no objections had been filed,the trial court approved it,and also ruled that a ny and all objections of john boyer to the accounting and any previous accounts and reports are hereby overruled with prejudice.
boyer has prosecuted this timely appeal.
boyer argues that he had a right to conduct discovery and that the trial court abused its discretion in denying him an opportunity to do so,and approving the accounting without first allowing him to conduct and complete such discovery.he also contends,in the alternative,that the trial court order should be modified to reflect that his proposed response and objections were neither filed nor ruled upon 
the trustees respond by contending that the trial court acted well within its discretion in denying boyer request for a continuance.boyer had filed no objections and there was no reason to further delay approval of the accounting.given that boyer did not actually file any objections,there was no legal basis for the trial court to do other than it did and boyer appeal from that order is frivolous.the trustees request,in order to reduce the expense burden on the many other income beneficiaries,that boyer be required to pay their attorney fees incurred in responding to this appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
the decision to grant or deny a continuance is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.lucas george murai farms,th,d.the trial court exercise of that discretion will be upheld if it is based on a reasoned judgment and complies with legal principles and policies appropriate to the case before the court.bullis security pac.nat.bank cal d.a reviewing court may not disturb the exercise of discretion by a trial court in the absence of a clear abuse thereof appearing in the record.denham superior court cal d.the burden rests on the complaining party to demonstrate from the record that such an abuse has occurred.ibid.
the trial court did not abuse its discretion 
in its order of october,on which boyer relies for his argument that his right to proceed with discovery had been judiciously sanctioned,the trial court made it clear that such discovery would be allowed if he actually filed his proposed response and objections.
leaving aside the fact that the hearing on the trustees accounting had already been delayed for five months and that boyer sought another seven months continuance without presenting any discovery plan or offering any basis for such an extensive further delay,the basic and dispositive fact remains he did not file any objections.he did not satisfy the clear predicate requirement on which the trial court october order rested.indeed,boyer counsel admitted,on october,that he only wanted the delay to evaluate whether or not he would file objections sometime in the future.
the trial court can not be faulted for slamming the door on this transparent fishing expedition.until boyer actually filed objections,there was no contested proceeding that would require an assignment for trial and the conduct of discovery.see,estate of howard d.the trustees accounting,like those that preceded it,was simply a report to the court,necessary to the court discharge of its duty of supervision of the management activities of the trustees.in the absence of specific objections to such report there is no way to determine what discovery,if any,was relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.code civ,subd.a italics added see coberly superior court d.party objecting to an accounting is entitled to discovery party providing the accounting,too,is entitled to the concomitant safeguards against abuse of discovery and absence of good cause.as boyer never tendered any issues,raised any issue requiring resolution or sought to become an actual party to a contested proceeding,the trial court was entirely justified in denying his request and approving the account.as we discuss more extensively in the next section,there was no abuse of discretion.
in view of this conclusion,we need not address or discuss any of the other arguments raised by the trustees,except their request for an award of attorney fees.
an award of attorney fees for a frivolous appeal is not appropriate in this case 
while we find ourselves in agreement with the trustees argument with respect to the lack of merit in boyer appeal,we can not conclude that sanctions should be imposed for a frivolous appeal.
the principles and standards by which we discover and measure a frivolous appeal are well settled.see code civ.the twin standards for determining when an appeal is frivolous were considered by the supreme court in in re marriage of flaherty cal d.the california cases discussing frivolous appeals provide a starting point for the development of a definition of frivolous.those cases apply standards that fall into two general categories subjective and objective.citation.the subjective standard looks to the motives of the appellant and his or her counsel.thus,in simon bemis.bag d,the court rejected a claim that an appeal was frivolous,noting that counsel presented his argument in a courteous and gracious manner and seemed to believe fervently that he might succeed on the merits.similarly,the courts have frequently looked at the good faith of the appellant and have penalized appellants where the only purpose of the appeal was delay.citations.
the objective standard looks at the merits of the appeal from a reasonable person perspective.the problem involved in determining whether the appeal is or is not frivolous is not whether the attorney acted in the honest belief he had grounds for appeal,but whether any reasonable person would agree that the point is totally and completely devoid of merit,and,therefore,frivolous.citations.the two standards are often used together,with one providing evidence of the other.thus,the total lack of merit of an appeal is viewed as evidence that appellant must have intended it only for delay.citations.both strands of this definition are relevant to the determination that an appeal is frivolous.an appeal taken for an improper motive represents a and disruptive use of the judicial process.similarly,an appeal taken despite the fact that no reasonable attorney could have thought it meritorious ties up judicial resources and diverts attention from the already burdensome volume of work at the appellate courts.thus,an appeal should be held to be frivolous only when it is prosecuted for an improper harass the respondent or delay the effect of an adverse when it indisputably has no any reasonable attorney would agree that the appeal is totally and completely without merit.citation.in re marriage of flaherty,supra,cal d at.italics added,fn.omitted.
we are,of course,particularly mindful of flaherty caution that any definition of a frivolous appeal must be read so as to avoid a serious chilling effect on the assertion of litigants rights on appeal.counsel and their clients have a right to present issues that are arguably correct,even if it is extremely unlikely that they will win on appeal.an appeal that is simply without merit is not by definition frivolous and should not incur sanctions.in re marriage of flaherty,supra,cal d at,italics in original.
the issue of sanctions therefore depends on whether boyer position was at least arguable.probate code section generally provides that the rules of practice applicable to civil actions apply to,and constitute the rules of practice in,proceedings under the probate code.thus,except as otherwise provided in the probate code itself,the normal rules of discovery for civil actions apply in probate proceedings,and,in fact,there is no question but that the discovery procedures found in the code of civil procedure are available for use in probate proceedings.morris stulsaft foundation superior court d.coberly superior court,supra,d at.see generally adams superior court cal d.
appellate courts must keep liberal policies of discovery statutes in mind when reviewing decisions denying or granting discovery.pacific.superior court cal d.absent a showing that substantial interests will be impaired by allowing discovery,liberal policies of discovery rules will generally counsel against overturning a trial court decision granting discovery ibid.and militate in favor of overturning a decision to deny discovery,quoting greyhound superior court cal d,in passing on orders denying discovery appellate courts should not use the trial court discretion argument to defeat the liberal policies of the statute.
matters sought are properly discoverable if they will aid in a party preparation for trial.pacific.superior court,supra,cal d at.because all issues and arguments that will come to light at trial often can not be ascertained at the time when discovery is sought,courts may appropriately give an applicant substantial leeway,especially when precise issues of litigation of governing legal standards are not clearly established.ibid.
turning to the specific facts before us,it is clear that the critical issue upon which boyer right to pursue discovery following the october hearing depended was whether he was required to first file objections to the accounting.we have been cited to no case nor has our research disclosed one that expressly imposes such a requirement in the factual context presented by this appeal.however,such a requirement is certainly implied by the relevant code sections.
probate code section,subdivision a,provides that any interested person may appear and make a response or objection to a pending petition in writing at or before a probate hearing.in addition,such a person may make an oral response or objection at the hearing.when an oral response or objection has been made,the probate court then has the discretion either to hear and determine the response or objection at the hearing,or grant a continuance for the purpose of allowing a response or objection to be made in writing,subd.b.this section expressly allows a continuance for one purpose only to make a written response or objection it does not allow for a continuance to conduct discovery in the absence of a response or objection of some kind.
furthermore,probate code section,subdivision c,specifically provides that a request for a continuance for the purpose of making a written response or objection shall not itself be considered a response or objection,nor shall the failure to make a response or objection during the time allowed be considered as a response or objection.in other words,an allegedly interested person must make at least an oral objection or response before the probate court is required to take any action at all.we therefore are satisfied,and do expressly hold,that the filing of a formal objection or response is a necessary predicate to the conduct of any discovery with respect to the trustee interim accounting.absent an objection or response,even if made only on information and belief,there is no issue joined by which the relevancy of any proposed discovery may be judged.
and just as the probate court could not determine whether any discovery might be relevant in the absence of an objection or response of some kind,so,too,we,as an appellate court,have no basis upon which to determine that the probate court abused its discretion by denying boyer request for a continuance to conduct discovery.as the court in pacific.superior court,supra,noted,an appellate court can not reverse a trial court grant of discovery under a
