ii.background 
filed an application for naturalization with uscis on february.uscis filed a name check request with the fbi which was received by the fbi on march.was interviewed by uscis on may,and again on august.at the conclusion of the august interview,he was informed he passed both the english and history examinations but his application could not be processed to finality until the fbi name check was complete.uscis concedes it did not adjudicate application within days of either the may or the august interview.
attempted to resolve the inaction on his application through correspondence with uscis.when that approach proved unsuccessful,filed a petition in federal district court pursuant to b.in the february petition,he sought a judgment that he was entitled to naturalization or,in the alternative,an order remanding the matter to uscis with instructions to adjudicate his application within fifteen days.the government responded on april,by filing a motion seeking an unrestricted remand to uscis for the purpose of adjudicating naturalization application and scheduling a naturalization proceeding when the application is approved.the motion effectively sought to deny all relief under b.in its memorandum in support of its motion,the government informed the court that name check was still pending with the fbi.
the government motion was denied after a hearing.the district court ordered the government to file a detailed answer to petition.in the answer,filed on june,uscis represented to the court that it had filed a request with the fbi to expedite name check and the fbi completed the check on june.uscis further represented that approval of naturalization application was likely and a naturalization ceremony could be scheduled soon.the parties thereafter filed a joint motion for remand,requesting the district court to remand the matter to uscis with instructions to administer the oath of citizenship to by july.the court granted the motion and entered an order which stated as follows 
pursuant to b,this case is remanded to the citizenship and immigration services uscis with instructions to uscis to administer the oath of citizenship to plaintiff by july,for the reasons set out in the stipulation and joint motion.
less than two weeks after he was naturalized,filed a motion seeking attorneys fees pursuant to the eaja.the district court granted the motion,concluding was the prevailing party in the b matter and the government failed to show the underlying agency actions and its litigation position were substantially justified.the government challenges both of those conclusions in this appeal.
iii.discussion 
the eaja provides that a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses incurred by that party in any civil action unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.d a.the district court conclusion that is a prevailing party is a legal question this court reviews de novo.see browder city of moab,cir.the determination that the government position was not substantially justified is reviewed for abuse of discretion.gilbert shalala,cir.
prevailing party determination 
our evaluation of the government argument that was not the prevailing party in the b action is guided by the supreme court decision in buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health human resources,d,and this court interpretation of that decision.see biodiversity conservation alliance stem,cir.the plaintiff in buckhannon was a care facility challenging a state statute requiring that residents of boarding homes be capable of on the grounds that the statute violated the fair housing amendments act.buckhannon,at.buckhannon sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the state of west virginia.id.while the suit was pending,the west virginia legislature amended the statute to eliminate the disputed requirement and the district court dismissed buckhannon action as moot.id.at.buckhannon then filed a motion seeking attorneys fees,arguing it was the prevailing party because its lawsuit was the impetus for the statutory change.id.the supreme court affirmed the denial of fees,holding the term prevailing party is a legal term of art that does not include a party that has failed to secure a judgment on the merits or a consent decree,but has nonetheless achieved the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct.id.at.the court ruled buckhannon was not a prevailing party because its lawsuit did not result in a judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.id.at.emphasis added.
this court applied the buckhannon standard in biodiversity conservation alliance stem,relying on the court emphasis on judicial imprimatur to support the conclusion that a party is entitled to attorneys fees only if it could obtain a court order to enforce the merits of some portion of the claim it made in its suit.biodiversity,at.we held the preliminary injunction obtained by the plaintiff in biodiversity did not satisfy that standard because it did not grant the plaintiff any of the relief sought in its complaint.id.at reasoning plaintiff won only the right to have the status quo preserved,so that had it prevailed on the merits,its victory would have meaning.
the government asserts that under buckhannon,is not the prevailing party because uscis acted voluntarily when it naturalized him.according to the government,the change in the parties legal relationship occurred when uscis,in the ordinary course of performing its statutory duties,voluntarily processed naturalization application and reached a favorable determination.thus,the government argues,the district court grant of the motion to remand did not effect the required material alteration in the parties legal relationship and the lawsuit was merely a catalyst for uscis voluntary actions.
the government argument that lawsuit was only a catalyst for uscis voluntary actions is unavailing.even if b can be interpreted in a way that effectively permits uscis to divest a federal district court of jurisdiction over a naturalization application by taking final action on the application after the filing of a federal suit but before the district court issues a ruling that is not the situation before us.instead,the district court resolved the litigation before uscis could voluntarily naturalize.thus,the government argument fails to acknowledge the most vital fact,at the time the district court order was entered,uscis had not yet naturalized or made a binding commitment to do so.while uscis may have continued with some unspecified processing activities after filed his lawsuit it did not complete the naturalization process until after it was ordered to do so by the district court.admittedly,on july,uscis represented to the district court that it completed processing and approved application and was scheduled to take the oath of citizenship on july.these representations,however,did nothing to materially change the legal relationship of the parties or moot b action.uscis made no enforceable commitment to naturalize and it has not identified any recourse could obtain under any potentially applicable law if it failed to administer the oath as promised.
further,the order entered by the district court did not merely recognize the fact of the parties agreement and dismiss the case because there was no longer a dispute before the court.bell bd.of county comm rs of jefferson county,cir quotation omitted.to the contrary,it granted substantive relief on the merits of the claims raised in his b action.see biodiversity,at.on the basis of the parties stipulations,the district court resolved claims in his favor,concluding he was entitled to be naturalized and ordering uscis to administer the oath on a date certain.the order,therefore,also provided the judicial imprimatur which is indispensable to the prevailing party determination.the order placed the weight of judicial authority behind uscis stipulation that was entitled to be naturalized by imposing a judicially enforceable obligation on uscis to naturalize by a date certain.if uscis failed to comply with the order,could petition for relief in district court.see biodiversity,at explaining that once a judgment has been obtained,a party who turn s back to its old ways might well be subject to contempt proceedings.entry of the order,not uscis stipulation,was the action which indelibly alter ed the legal landscape between uscis and.biodiversity,at a party is entitled to attorneys fees only if it could obtain a court order to enforce the merits of some portion of the claim it made in its suit.thus,the government can not prevail on its assertion is not a prevailing party either because his lawsuit was simply a catalyst for uscis voluntary actions or because the court order merely memorialized the parties voluntary agreement.the order is a judgment on the merits that conferred prevailing party status upon 
substantial justification 
our conclusion that is the prevailing party in the b proceeding does not automatically entitle him to recover his attorneys fees.the eaja specifically provides that a court should not award fees to a prevailing party if it finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.d a.here,the government challenges the district court conclusion that its position was not substantially justified,a conclusion we must affirm unless the court abused its discretion.gilbert,at.
the position of the united states is defined in the eaja as the position taken by the united states in the civil action and the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civil action is based.id.at d d.thus,uscis prelitigation actions and the government litigation position are both relevant to the inquiry and both must be reasonable in fact and law.hackett barnhart,cir eaja fees generally should be awarded where the government underlying action was unreasonable even if the government advanced a reasonable litigation position quotation omitted.the government need not demonstrate its position was correct,but it bears the burden of establishing its position was justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.id.at quotation omitted.
before beginning our analysis,it is necessary to summarize the naturalization process generally and the specific actions of uscis which precipitated b suit.typically,the naturalization process begins when an alien files a written,sworn application with the department of homeland security a.with limited exceptions not relevant here,the government may not naturalize an alien until it has conducted a personal investigation.a.the applicant must appear in person for an initial examination,which includes questioning about the applicant written submissions and administration of english literacy and civics tests.a,c.pursuant to regulation,uscis may conduct the examination of the applicant only after it has received a definitive response from the fbi that a full criminal background check has been completed.b.once the examination has been held,uscis must act within days to either grant or deny the naturalization application.b a a decision to grant or deny the application shall be made at the time of the initial examination or within after the date of the initial examination.if the application is granted,uscis administers an oath of allegiance to the applicant in a public ceremony.a a.the oath of allegiance is a prerequisite to obtaining citizenship.a.
the government concedes uscis did not adjudicate naturalization application within days as required by statute.it argues uscis prelitigation conduct was nonetheless reasonable in both law and fact because uscis was precluded by a from proceeding with application until the fbi name check was complete and the fbi was unable to act on the name check request within days due to a tremendous backlog of naturalization cases.see a before a person may be naturalized,uscis shall conduct a personal investigation of the person applying for naturalization.relying on a provision in the appropriations act,the government further argues uscis was prohibited from using agency funds to adjudicate naturalization application until the name check was complete.see dep ts of commerce,justice,state,the judiciary,related agencies appropriations act,stat,stating that funds appropriated to uscis may not be used to complete adjudication of an application for naturalization unless uscis has received confirmation from the federal bureau of investigation that a full criminal background check has been completed.according to the government,it demonstrated that uscis was unable to adjudicate application within the period and the district court abused its discretion by failing to credit its argument to that effect.
does not dispute the government explanation that the lengthy delay in receiving the results of the fbi name check caused uscis to miss the deadline for adjudicating his naturalization application.he challenges,however,any suggestion by the government that an fbi name check is a congressionally mandated component of the criminal background investigation required by either a or the appropriations act.neither,he argues,is the name check mandated by regulation.see the investigation shall consist,at a minimum,of a review of all pertinent records,police department checks,and a neighborhood investigation in the vicinities where the applicant has resided and has been employed,or engaged in business,for at least the five years immediately preceding the filing of the application.b employing the term full criminal background check but not referencing the fbi name check process.thus,he challenges the legal reasonableness of preconditioning the adjudication of his application on the receipt of the results of the name check.even conceding the name check was required,further argues uscis prelitigation position was not reasonable in law and fact because uscis created the gordian knot in which it found itself by conducting his examination before receiving the results of the name check,in violation of uscis own regulation.see b providing uscis may conduct the initial examination only after it has received a definitive response from the fbi that a full criminal background check has been completed.finally,he argues this court should reject the government reliance on the fbi name check backlog as insufficient to show substantial justification because uscis could have complied with the requirement by requesting the fbi to expedite his name check.
it is unnecessary to address many of the arguments advanced by the parties because the district court ruling on the reasonableness of uscis prelitigation actions can be affirmed even if we assume all the disputed underlying issues should be resolved in the government favor.thus,we will first assume an fbi name check is an essential component of uscis congressionally mandated duty to conduct a personal investigation of an applicant.we will further assume uscis was precluded by law from finally adjudicating application until the name check was completed and that uscis can rely on the backlog of another agency to justify its actions.finally,we will ignore the uncontroverted fact that uscis violated its own regulations by conducting initial examination before the comprehensive background investiga
