stella andrews appeals the district court dismissal of her action in light of her failure to pay attorneys fees from a prior action under federal rule of civil procedure d.while we conclude that rule d may permit the award of attorneys fees under certain circumstances,those circumstances are not present here.we thus vacate,reverse,and remand.
andrews first filed suit against defendants under the fair labor standards act flsa on june.on july,defendants moved to dismiss under federal rule of civil procedure b,to which andrews responded on september.in the response,andrews stated that she was prepared as the court may direct and allow to submit an amended complaint setting forth her allegations in more detail.in a subsequent order setting a hearing,the magistrate judge noted that this was not a proper request,as the local rules prohibited making a motion within a response to another motion and andrews had missed the deadline provided in federal rule of civil procedure a for unilaterally amending the complaint after a motion to dismiss.on october,the day before the hearing on the motion to dismiss,andrews filed a motion for leave to amend with a proposed amended complaint.
the magistrate judge heard argument on both motions and provided the three following options for the parties he could rule on the motion to dismiss,recommending that the district court dismiss the case he could rule on the motion for leave to amend or andrews c ould just stand up and say,i want to take a dismissal plaintiff can be free to file another complaint.id.at.
andrews decided to voluntarily withdraw her complaint under federal rule of civil procedure a.on november,andrews dismissed her first action and filed a second complaint,which she served on defendants in february.defendants then moved to stay the second action and for costs under rule d.defendants sought for attorneys fees and other expenses that had been incurred in defending the first action.the magistrate ordered that defendants be awarded those fees that related to the motion to dismiss,and the district court affirmed,finding that an award of attorneys fees was proper under rule d and that andrews conduct amounted to vexatious litigation,for which fees could be recovered.
this case has been before us twice before in,andrews appealed before an amount had been determined,and we dismissed the appeal as interlocutory and unappealable.andrews am.living centers,llc,app x,cir.on remand,the district court awarded in attorneys fees to defendants and stayed the case pending payment.in,andrews appealed without paying the costs and before the case was dismissed for nonpayment.after oral argument,we granted andrews motion for voluntary dismissal and dismissed the case.andrews am.living centers,llc,cir.on remand,the district court dismissed the second action for failure to pay the awarded attorneys fees.andrews timely appealed.
we first consider whether and under what circumstances rule d permits an award of attorneys fees as a component of costs,an open question in this circuit.the proper scope of a rule of procedure is a question of law subject to de novo review.marex titanic,wrecked abandoned vessel,cir.
federal rule of civil procedure d provides,
if a plaintiff who previously dismissed an action in any court files an action based on or including the same claim against the same defendant,the court 
may order the plaintiff to pay all or part of the costs of that previous action and 
may stay the proceedings until the plaintiff has complied.
as is apparent from the text,rule does not explicitly permit attorneys fees.nevertheless,courts have noted that the purpose of rule d is to serve as a deterrent to forum shopping and vexatious litigation.simeone first bank ass n,cir.see also esposito piatrowski,cir.citing simeone,at wright miller,fed.prac.proc.civ.ed.citing cases.this includes attempts to gain any tactical advantage by dismissing and refiling th e suit.rogers stores,cir.citation omitted alteration in original.with this purpose in mind,some courts have determined that rule d permits an award of attorneys fees.as one court has explained,surely,congress intended that that provision of the federal rules have some teeth.behrle olshansky.
several of our sister circuits have considered the question now before us,producing an apparent split of authority.the eighth and tenth circuits,for example,have both upheld an award of attorneys fees under rule d,albeit without much explanation.meredith stovall,cir.unpublished evans safeway stores,cir.see also robinson bank of,app x,cir.unpublished relying on evans.
meanwhile,based on the language of the rule itself,the sixth circuit has held that attorneys fees are not included in costs.rogers,at.the rogers court reasoned,where congress has intended to provide for an award of attorney fees,it has usually stated as much and not left the courts guessing.further,the law generally recognizes a difference between the terms costs and attorney fees and we have no desire to conflate the two terms.id.the court recognized that attorneys fees may be permissible where the structure evinces an intent to provide them,id.at quoting key tronic united states,but was unpersuaded that the structure mandated costs to include attorneys fees in this context,where other provisions in the federal rules explicitly provided for attorneys fees.id.citation omitted.
between these two goalposts,the seventh circuit has held that attorneys fees are not generally awardable under rule d unless the substantive statute which formed the basis of the original suit allows for the recovery of such fees as costs or unless such fees are specifically ordered by the court.esposito,at.in so holding,the court first determined that nothing in the text of the rule indicated that congress intended to alter the american rule,under which attorneys fees are not generally recoverable.id.at citing key tronic,at alyseka pipeline serv.wilderness soc y.
the esposito court then considered marek chesny,where the supreme court held that the costs provided for in federal rule of civil procedure did not include attorneys fees.id.like rule d,rule d allows for an award of costs but does not define the term.see fed.civ.d.determining that the authors of the federal rules were familiar with the american rule and its exceptions,the marek court held that the most reasonable inference is that the term costs in rule was intended to refer to all costs properly awardable under the relevant substantive statute or other authority.at.thus,absent congressional expressions to the contrary,where the underlying statute defines costs to include attorney fees,we are satisfied such fees are to be included as costs for purposes of rule.id.as the plaintiff had sued under,and a prevailing party in a action may be awarded attorneys fees as part of the costs,b,such fees are subject to the provision of rule.this plain meaning interpretation of the interplay between rule and is the only construction that gives meaning to each word in both rule and.marek,at.
applying this reasoning to rule d,the esposito court held that a party may recover reasonable attorneys fees as part of its costs under rule d only where the underlying statute defines costs to include attorneys fees.at.thus,attorneys fees are not a recoverable cost of litigation under rule d unless the substantive statute which formed the basis of the original suit allows for the recovery of such fees as costs id as esposito had brought suit under,the defendants would have to show that the first suit was frivolous,unreasonable,or groundless,as it is only on such a showing that prevailing defendants can recover attorneys fees in a suit.id.
the esposito court briefly noted an alternative way to award attorneys fees as part of costs if such fees were specifically ordered by the court.id.the seventh circuit explained this alternative in a subsequent unpublished decision the same year.see sanderson spectrum labs,wl cir.unpublished table decision.in sanderson,in addition to the availability of attorneys fees based on the underlying lanham act claim,the court found attorneys fees appropriate e ven when rule d does not autho
