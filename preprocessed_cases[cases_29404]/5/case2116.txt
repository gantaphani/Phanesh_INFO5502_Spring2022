the law in california is well established that when legal malpractice involves negligence in the prosecution or defense of a legal claim,the methodology must be used.more specifically,for purposes of this case,which involved settlement of litigation,the plaintiff must prove his opponent in the underlying litigation would have settled for less,or that following a trial,plaintiff would have obtained a judgment more favorable than the settlement.
real party in interest michael malcolm sued petitioners for malpractice,alleging they omitted critical terms from a marital settlement agreement.in response to a summary judgment motion,malcolm did not produce evidence showing that his former wife would have settled for less,or that he would have obtained a judgment more favorable than the settlement.instead he claimed as damages the legal fees he spent in an unsuccessful attempt to overturn the settlement.contrary to the conclusion reached by the trial court,those fees do not represent possible tort damages.as there is no evidence of any other recognized tort damages,this case is simply a fee dispute.the action should go forward,but only on the contract causes of action alleged in the complaint.
background 
malcolm hired several lawyers to represent him in the dissolution of his marriage.among the lawyers he hired were petitioners,the law firm of orrick herrington sutcliffe llp and one of its partners,christopher ottenweller collectively,hereafter,orrick,unless otherwise noted.
during a mediation session on march and,malcolm and his former wife signed a property settlement agreement that divided their substantial assets.according to malcolm,however,he was advised by ottenweller that the agreement was a term sheet,and that it did not contain all the terms required for a final,binding agreement.
the attorneys for malcolm former wife took the position that the agreement was fully enforceable as written.on march,malcolm moved to set aside the settlement agreement.the trial court denied the motion,finding no reasonable basis for it.on july,the court entered a judgment in the dissolution action that incorporated the terms of the settlement agreement.when malcolm persisted in efforts to set aside that judgment,the court imposed monetary sanctions in the amount of.the court also found a motion by malcolm new wife to intervene in the matter was frivolous and made for the purpose of bolstering malcolm attempt to set aside the settlement.ultimately,malcolm paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in attorney fees in his futile quest to overturn the settlement 
malcolm sued orrick,the law firm of kaufman young,and robert kaufman for professional negligence,breach of contract,and breach of fiduciary duty.malcolm alleged his lawyers had failed to provide competent services,leading him to enter into a horribly defective settlement agreement.he cited the agreement failure to include a release from his former wife,and its inclusion of provisions that could expose him to adverse tax consequences or securities law violations.he also cited his lawyers failure to obtain his current wife consent to the settlement.
orrick responded with a,which alleged malcolm owed over in fees.
orrick moved for summary judgment on all causes of action,or,in the alternative,summary adjudication on the individual causes of action.orrick asserted malcolm could not prove actual damages,an essential element of each of his causes of action.orrick submitted discovery responses that showed neither malcolm former wife nor his current wife had filed any claims against him in connection with the settlement,that malcolm had not been accused of any securities law violations,and that malcolm could not identify any adverse tax consequences.
in opposition,malcolm identified as damages the fees he had paid to orrick,the fees he had paid to attempt to remedy orrick errors,and his payment of over million to his former wife to settle claims worth approximately million at the time of separation.malcolm submitted,among other things,his legal bills and a declaration from an expert,who stated orrick conduct in negotiating the settlement agreement,fell below the pertinent standard of care.malcolm also submitted a declaration by ottenweller from the dissolution action,dated october,in which ottenweller stated it was his understanding that a final stipulated judgment would contain additional language and terms to flesh out the property settlement agreement,including a mutual release between the parties.in his separate statement of facts,malcolm noted that although it was undisputed that his wives former and current had not filed any claims against him and that there were no securities or tax claims against him,he was exposed to future claims.
the trial court denied orrick motion for summary judgment,finding there were triable issues of fact regarding damages created by evidence of attorneys fees expended in connection with attempts to correct errors committed in the negotiation,preparation and execution of a settlement agreement enforceable under code of civil procedure section,entered on or about march,including,without limitation,motions to vacate the judgment and subsequent appeals.
orrick timely filed a petition for peremptory writ of mandate prohibition or other appropriate relief in this court.we asked for opposition from malcolm and notified him that we were considering the issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance.palma industrial fasteners,cal d.malcolm has filed his opposition,and after reviewing it,we conclude the issuance of a peremptory writ in the first instance is appropriate,as the applicable principles of law are well established and the relevant facts are undisputed.see lewis superior court cal th,d.
