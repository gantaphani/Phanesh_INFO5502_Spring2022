the question before us in this appeal is whether the trial court properly ordered an attorney lien expunged.we conclude the trial court lacked jurisdiction to assess the validity of the lien,and we reverse the order.
background 
in two consolidated actions below,trial was held on the claims of several plaintiffs for damages resulting from employment discrimination.all plaintiffs were initially represented by the law offices of joseph alioto and angela alioto hereafter alioto.alioto in turn hired attorney waukeen mccoy to perform certain legal work on the case.according to mccoy,he was promised a percentage of the recovery as compensation for his services.
eventually mccoy left the employ of alioto,and three of the plaintiffs substituted mccoy as their attorney of record in place of alioto.those three plaintiffs were represented by mccoy through trial.a jury verdict was rendered in favor of plaintiffs,although retrials are pending for the three plaintiffs represented at trial by mccoy.
alioto and mccoy hotly disputed the attorney fees owed to mccoy,and that dispute resulted in a separate lawsuit filed by mccoy against alioto to recover his earnings.additionally,mccoy filed a notice of lien within the instant employment discrimination lawsuit for the value of his services performed for of the plaintiffs represented by alioto.
after the verdict was rendered,the plaintiffs filed a motion to expunge mccoy attorney lien,asserting that because mccoy had no contractual relationship with them,mccoy had no valid attorney lien.mccoy opposed the motion on the ground that the trial court had no jurisdiction to determine the validity of an attorney lien.the trial court granted the plaintiffs motion.mccoy now appeals from the order directing that his attorney lien be expunged as to the plaintiffs represented by alioto 
discussion 
creation of an attorney lien 
a lien may be created by contract or by operation of law.in most jurisdictions a lien is established by operation of law in favor of an attorney to satisfy attorney fees and expenses out of the proceeds of a prospective judgment.see witkin,cal.procedure ed.attorneys.in california,an attorney lien is created only by by an express provision in the attorney fee contract cetenko united california bank cal d,haupt charlie kosher market cal d,or by implication where the retainer agreement provides that the attorney is to look to the judgment for payment for legal services rendered wagner sariotti d,see gelfand,greer,popko miller shivener d.skelly richman d.unlike a service lien or a mechanic lien,for example,an attorney lien is not created by the mere fact that an attorney has performed services in a case.ex parte kyle cal.see isrin superior court cal d,see generally witkin,cal.procedure,supra,attorneys.
because an attorney lien is not automatic and requires a contract for its creation,a direct contractual relationship between the attorney and the client is essential.when the client enters into a retainer agreement with one particular attorney,a lien in favor of another,albeit associated attorney is neither express nor implied and does not exist.law offices of stanley bell shine,browne diamond th,d trimble steinfeldt,supra,d at.associate counsel must look to the client attorney for compensation,not to the client.d at.
what is not essential to creation of an attorney lien is the filing of a notice of lien.unlike a judgment creditor lien,which is created when the notice of lien is filed code civ,subd.b,an attorney lien is a secret lien it is created and the attorney security interest is protected even without a notice of lien.cetenko united california bank,supra,cal d at,cappa f k rock sand,d.hansen jacobsen d.an attorney may,however,choose to file a notice of lien in the underlying action,and the common practice of doing so has been held permissible and even advisable.valenta regents of university of california d.hansen jacobsen,supra,d at.
it bears emphasizing that a notice of lien is not the same as the lien the security interest or the lien claim.as will be seen in the discussion that follows,a lack of precision in the use of these terms all too often creates confusion.see valenta regents of university of california,supra,d at.hansen jacobsen,supra,d at.
determining the existence of an attorney lien 
appellate courts have consistently held that the trial court in the underlying action has no jurisdiction to determine the existence or validity of an attorney lien on the judgment.law offices of stanley bell shine,browne diamond,supra,th at,d valenta regents of university of california,supra,d at.hansen jacobsen,supra,d at.hendricks superior court d.the trial court does have fundamental jurisdiction over the subject matter and over the parties.nevertheless,because the attorney is not a party to the underlying action and has no right to intervene,the trial court acts in excess of its jurisdiction when it purports to determine whether the attorney is entitled to foreclose a lien on the judgment.hendricks superior court,supra,d at.see also law offices of stanley bell shine,browne diamond,supra,th at,d valenta regents of university of california,supra.at.hansen jacobsen,supra,d at.nor can the court entertain a motion to terminate the lien.valenta regents of university of california,supra.at.after the client obtains a judgment,the attorney must bring a separate,independent action against the client to establish the existence of the lien,to determine the amount of the lien,and to enforce it.law offices of stanley bell shine,browne diamond,supra,th at,d valenta regents of university of california,supra,d at.bandy diablo unified sch,supra,d at.see hansen jacobsen,supra,d at.an order within the underlying action purporting to affect an attorney lien is void.valenta regents of university of california,supra,at,fn.
in the case before us,the trial court oral remarks reflect a finding that mccoy had no attorney lien because the essential element of a direct contractual relationship was missing i just do think there any question that there is a right to file a lien,only if there is an agreement between,in this case,mccoy and the client a lien has been improperly filed on the face of it,not because mccoy did do any work,or not because his agreement with alioto is different from what alioto claims,but simply because it appears indisputably that there is no direct agreement between mccoy and these clients all i saying is that mccoy,since he did not have an agreement directly with the clients,does not have a right to file a lien against any recovery the clients may obtain in this litigation.
it is apparent that the trial court had no jurisdiction to determine the existence of an attorney lien.whether mccoy and the plaintiffs had a direct contract and whether that contract impliedly created an attorney lien are questions of fact to be decided in an independent action brought by mccoy to enforce his lien claim.gelfand,greer,popko miller shivener,supra,d at.they are not questions to be resolved in the underlying action.
the trial court seems to have relied on trimble steinfeldt,supra,d.in that case,the associated attorney filed a notice of lien in the underlying action,and the moved to expunge the lien.the trial court denied the motion,but the appellate court held that the motion to expunge should have been granted.id.at.the appellate court reasoned that without an agreement between the client and the attorney there is neither an express nor an implied basis for impressing a lien against the client in the attorney favor.id.at.
the holding of trimble,however,concerns the creation of a lien and the necessity for a direct contractual relationship between the attorney and the client.no question was raised in that case regarding the jurisdiction of the trial court to determine whether a lien had been created.when the trimble court endorsed the remedy of granting the plaintiff motion to expunge,it did so without analysis of the jurisdiction issue.to the extent that trimble suggests a proceeding may be had within the underlying action to extinguish an attorney lien,the opinion conflicts with bell,valenta,and other cases limiting
