defendants produce various computer devices,including laptops and docking stations.in its amended complaint,cdsc identified a number of defendants laptop computers and docking stations as infringing.the record shows that each accused laptop computer has a display or keyboard.
the district court construed portable computer and portable computer microprocessing system in the preambles of the asserted claims to mean a computer without a display or keyboard that is capable of being moved or carried about.claim construction order,dist.lexis,at.the trial court determined that the prosecution history and the specification distinguished the claimed invention from a laptop computer.in particular,the district court found that the applicants had emphasized the differences between their invention and laptop computers to overcome the examiner rejections based on herron.because the district court held that the statements in the prosecution history amounted to a clear and unmistakable disavowal,it construed the terms portable computer and portable computer microprocessing system to exclude computers with displays or keyboards.id.at.the district court also construed the phrase said single connector for making all connections from the microprocessor to said computer peripheral devices to require that all individual peripheral device connections on the housing that connect to the microprocessor also pass through the single connector.id.at.

the words of the claims define the scope of the patented invention.vitronics conceptronic.it is that,in interpreting an asserted claim,the court should look first to the intrinsic evidence of record,the patent itself,including the claims,the specification and,if in evidence,the prosecution history.id.claim terms are generally given their ordinary and customary meaning,which is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention.phillips awh,en banc citations omitted.however,the person of ordinary skill is deemed to read the claim terms in the context of the entire patent,including the specification and prosecution history.id.
occasionally specification explanations may lead one of ordinary skill to interpret a claim term more narrowly than its plain meaning suggests.nonetheless,this court will not countenance the importation of claim limitations from a few specification statements or figures into the claims,see id.at warning against importing limitations from specification and noting that although the specification often describes very specific embodiments of the invention,we have repeatedly warned against confining the claims to those embodiments,particularly if those specification extracts describe only embodiments of a broader claimed invention,see,verizon servs.vonage holdings,examples of translation in specification involving change in protocol from higher to lower level did not support importing a limitation into claims liquid dynamics vaughan,subset of figures from specification depicting perfectly helical flow of slurry in a slurry tank did not limit claim,which required substantial ly helical flow,to perfectly helical flow.by the same token,the specification is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis.usually,it is dispositive it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.phillips,at quoting vitronics,at.the specification may show that the patentee has disclaimed subject matter or has otherwise limited the scope of the claims.rexnord laitram.for example,repeated and definitive remarks in the written description could restrict a claim limitation to a particular structure.see watts xl.
statements made during prosecution may also affect the scope of the claims.rexnord,at.specifically,a patentee may limit the meaning of a claim term by making a clear and unmistakable disavowal of scope during prosecution.purdue pharma endo.a patentee could do so,for example,by clearly characterizing the invention in a way to try to overcome rejections based on prior art.see,microsoft,limiting the term transmitting to require direct transmission over telephone line because the patentee stated during prosecution that the invention transmits over a standard telephone line,thus disclaiming transmission over a network alloc int l trade comm n,finding the patentee expressly disavowed floor paneling systems without play because the applicant cited the feature during prosecution to overcome prior art bell atl.network servs.covad commc ns group,limiting operation of the transceiver to the three stated modes because of clearly limiting statements made by the patentee to try to overcome a prior art rejection.the doctrine of prosecution disclaimer protects the public reliance on definitive statements made during prosecution by precluding patentees from recapturing through claim interpretation specific meanings clearly and unmistakably disclaimed during prosecution.omega eng g,raytek,citing in part cleveland trust.bracketed material added.claims should not be construed one way in order to obtain their allowance and in a different way against accused infringers.chimie ppg,citation omitted.
prosecution disclaimer does not apply to an ambiguous disavowal.see telecom samsung,holding that prosecution disclaimer did not support the judicial narrowing of a clear claim term because the inventors statements were amenable to multiple reasonable interpretations pall pti techs,remanding because the scope of disclaimer over the prior art reference was ambiguous,vacated on other grounds,d.prosecution disclaimer does not apply,for example,if the applicant simply describes features of the prior art and does not distinguish the claimed invention based on those features.see eolas,microsoft.and if the specification expressly defines a claim term and remarks made to distinguish claims from the prior art are broader than necessary to distinguish the prior art,the full breadth of the remark is not a clear and unambiguous disavowal of claim scope as required to depart from the meaning of the term provided in the written description.innovative props.avery dennison,quoting storage tech.cisco.
as a threshold matter,neither party disputes that the terms portable computer and portable computer microprocessing system,as used in the preambles of the asserted claims,limit their scope.in considering whether a preamble limits a claim,the preamble is analyzed to ascertain whether it states a necessary and defining aspect of the invention,or is simply an introduction to the general field of the claim.on demand mach.ingram.the terms at issue here clearly recite a necessary and defining aspect of the invention,specifically its portability.the written description and applicants statements during prosecution emphasize this feature of the invention,yet this limitation does not appear in the body of the claims.as a result,this court finds that the terms portable computer and portable computer microprocessing system limit the scope of the asserted claims.
the district court construed the portable computer limitation to require a computer without a display or keyboard that is capable of being moved or carried about.claim construction order,dist.lexis,at.the parties do not dispute that the limitation requires a computer that is capable of being moved or carried about.this court agrees that the plain meaning of portable and its use in the specification and prosecution history require the computer to be capable of being moved about.this appeal focuses on the a display or keyboard component of the district court construction.
during prosecution,in a response dated june,the applicants sought to distinguish their invention from herron.the applicants statements clearly and unambiguously disavowed computers with displays and is,laptops.at the outset of those statements,the applicants distinguished their invention,a portable microprocessing system,from its peripheral devices 
the applicants invention is a portable microprocessing system with a microcomputer contained within a housing.as is typical of such systems,the microprocessor interfaces with several peripheral devices including a keyboard,display,modem,serial and parallel port devices,a power source.the applicants system provides all of the interfaces for these devices at a set of interface connectors on the rear bezel of the housing.
amendment to application,dated june,at.the applicants expressly listed a keyboard and display as peripheral devices.they also explained that the interface connectors for the keyboard and display are located on the rear bezel of the housing.if the keyboard and display were or attached to the housing like a laptop,these peripheral connections would not be necessary.
in the same response,the applicants also contrasted the advantages of their invention with the limitations of the herron laptop 
the applicants system therefore provides an extremely powerful utility.a microprocessor with large memory capacity is made completely portable.the processing unit housing or brick can be easily removed from one system and transported in a briefcase to another system.rather than requiring a portable display and keyboard,the present invention concentrates on portability of an exceptionally large memory capacity in hard disk drive for the same sized unit as a conventional computer,the invention does require that peripherals be made available at each location,a requirement that would lead one away from the present invention.however,even that requirement can be an advantage over laptop computers in that higher quality peripherals will more likely be used since they need not be transported.thus,machines make concessions in memory,display and other areas in favor of portability.the applicants system,on the other hand,is a portable full service microprocessing system which concedes portability of peripherals.
id.at.emphases added.in this statement,the applicants clearly distinguished their invention from computers with a display or keyboard.they told the examiner that the invention concedes portability of peripherals,which they previously defined to include displays and keyboards,in favor of processing power and memory.as a result,they stated that the invention does not require a display and keyboard.in fact,the applicants explained that the invention requires these peripherals at each location of use.in contrast,the applicants emphasized that laptops sacrificed the power of the claimed microprocessing system in favor of peripherals.the applicants also stated that the display and keyboard of a laptop would be inferior in quality to the peripherals stored permanently at each location and used with the claimed invention.
moreover,the applicants further distinguished their system from the herron laptop computer with its own flat panel display and keyboard,arguing that laptops did not have the memory capacity,utilities and functionalities of their system 
the herron system does not allow a microprocessor having memory capacity and other capabilities to interface to a processing system as does the applicants system.the herron system allows a computer with its own flat panel display and keyboard to interface to other peripheral devices.this computer does not possess utilities and functionalities comparable to those of the applicants system.
the applicants also distinguished their invention from laptops based on how the devices connect to the docking station.because the keyboard and display are not built into the claimed microprocessing system,the applicants described the system as able to fit vertically in the docking station.because of its keyboard and display,a laptop could not fit vertically.specifically,the applicants stated the herron reference discloses a docking module which is latched to the rear of a computer.the computer and docking module rest on a desk top.id.at.t he computer in herron is not oriented vertically as in the applicants system.it would make no sense to do so with the herron with its attached keyboard and display.therefore,herron does not have the applicants reduced footprint size.id.at.
this response to the examiner also referred to laptops.in this statement,the applicants saw that laptops too might find a use for the claimed system 
a single connector to implement all of the interfaces provides for easy connection and disconnection and may be used to advantage with computers as well.for example,the system of herron,et docks to several connectors making it difficult to align the connectors before docking.
this statement,however,does not bring a laptop within the scope of the claims.instead,the statement suggests that one component of the claimed invention,a single docking connector,could be used with laptops.the single docking connector is one of several limitations recited in the claims,recited separately from the portable computer limitation.thus this reference to laptops,if anything,just represents another attempt to distinguish the invention from the laptops of herron.
a careful reading of the prosecution history leaves little doubt that the distinctions between the invention and herron are more extensive than only the single connector limitation.this court observes that the applicants distinguished their invention from the prior art in multiple ways.nonetheless a disavowal,if clear and unambiguous,can lie in a single distinction among many.see andersen fiber composites,llc,norian stryker,w e have not allowed patentees to assert that claims should be interpreted as if they had surrendered only what they had to.moreover,the examiner citation of the single connection limitation in the reasons for allowability does not erase the applicants clear disavowal of laptops.laitram morehouse,finding prosecution statements relevant to claim construction although the examiner did not rely on them.of course,a multitude of distinctions may serve to make any single distinction in the group less clear and unmistakable as the point of distinction over prior art and as a critical defining point for the invention as a whole.
moreover,the prosecution history must always receive consideration in context.for instance,in innovative,at,this court held that the patentee had expressly defined a term in the specification,and that the definition would control over broad remarks during prosecution.in this case,however,the specification of the patent does not provide an express definition of portable computer that would override or make the distinctions in the prosecution history ambiguous.
as noted,the specification in this case does not create any ambiguity.the background section describes a hierarchy of computer systems based on size and processing ability mainframe systems,systems,microcomputer systems or personal computers,and laptop computers.patent.thus,the specification contrasts the microcomputer system with a laptop computer.furthermore,the specification repeatedly describes the invention as a microcomputer.see,abstract a microcomputer system includes a microprocessor and a housing for holding the microprocessor.in accordance with the present invention a microcomputer works equally well for business applications as it does for personal applications.depicts the main housing of the microcomputer of the present invention.in contrast,the specification never identifies the invention as a laptop.
cdsc argues that the specification discloses an embodiment with a display and keyboard,specifically the embodiment illustrated in figures.however,the text and the figures demonstrate that the keyboard and display are not actually built into the computer in this disclosed embodiment.rather,the specification explains that a keyboard and visual display are options available with the system.id.figure shows how a keyboard and display may be coupled to the microcomputer system.id.see also,shows a possible configuration of the microcomputer system that includes a keyboard,a visual display and a dc power source.as discussed above,the background of the invention distinguishes microcomputers from laptop computers.and the keyboard shown in figure is physically separate from the main housing.the text confirms that the keyboard is connected to the housing using connector,shown on the side of the rear bezel in figure.id.thus,a cable connects the physically separate keyboard to the main housing.the keyboard is neither nor attached.figure only illustrates that the keyboard may be folded with the display and microcomputer for economy of space.id.further,the display illustrated in figure is easily attachable and detachable,not.the specification describes using connectors and,a mechanical mechanism,and thumb screws,which simplif y the process of removing the mechanical connections.id.
the claims do not recite the term microcomputer.this point,however,does not alone expand the claims beyond the microcomputer embodiment described in the specification.to the contrary,a person of ordinary skill is deemed to read the claim terms in the context of the entire patent,including the specification and prosecution history.phillips,at.thus,the specification does not suggest that the claimed invention encompasses laptops.rather the written description emphasizes differences between the claimed invention and laptops.at a minimum,the specification does not cut against the applicants clear disavowal of laptop computers in the june,response.
as noted above,the totality of the prosecution history informs the disavowal inquiry.rheo
