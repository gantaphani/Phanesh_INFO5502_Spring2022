this case arises from state bar disciplinary proceedings involving attorney patricia barry.after the state bar office of chief trial counsel filed disciplinary charges against her,barry stipulated to having committed violations of the rules of professional conduct.she further agreed to recommended discipline including a actual suspension from the practice of law.the state bar court entered an order approving the recommended discipline.
despite having agreed to the state bar court recommendation,barry thereafter filed a petition for writ of review in this court,asking the court to set aside the stipulation and dismiss the disciplinary charges.barry asserted,among other things,that the stipulation was false and that she had entered into it due to financial hardship.this court denied barry petition for writ of review and imposed the recommended discipline.
after this court denied barry petition,barry filed an action in superior court against the state bar.alleging that the state bar actions were retaliatory and discriminatory,barry asserted causes of action under a variety of state laws,as well as the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution.she sought an order vacating the stipulation and dismissing the underlying disciplinary charges,or,in the alternative,granting her a jury trial on the underlying disciplinary charges.barry also sought various reforms of the state bar.

on appeal,barry did not challenge the trial court conclusions that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over her claims or that the claims arose from protected activity.rather,she argued that because the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over her claims,it also lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the state bar motion or to award attorney fees.agreeing with barry,the court of appeal reversed the judgment of the trial court.the court of appeal reasoned i n the absence of subject matter jurisdiction,a trial court has no power to hear or determine the case.citation.citation.the trial court lack of subject matter jurisdiction in this case precluded it from ruling on the state bar motion,an adjudication that necessarily involved a determination of the merits of plaintiff claims.section establishes a procedure where the trial court evaluates the merits of the lawsuit using a procedure at an early stage of the litigation.g ranting a motion to strike under section results in the dismissal of a cause of action on the merits varian medical,supra,cal th at because the trial court had no jurisdiction to rule on the motion,it also lacked jurisdiction to award attorney fees under section,subdivision c.
