ii.background 
melinda benton plaintiff is a professor at a community college in oregon.she holds a degree from bob jones university,an unaccredited institution that emphasizes conservative values.at the time she brought this action,oregon law provided in relevant part 
no person who has been warned by the oregon student assistance commission,through the office of degree authorization,to cease and desist shall claim or represent that the person possesses any academic degree unless the degree has been awarded to or conferred upon the person by a school that 
a has accreditation recognized by the united states department of education or the foreign equivalent of such accreditation 
plaintiff brought this action pursuant to.plaintiff brought this action as a class action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.plaintiff alleged seven claims for violation of the federal and state constitutional rights to free speech,free exercise of religion,due process and equal protection.these claims were predicated upon allegations that the oregon office of degree authorization had decreed that plaintiff should be fired from her position at the college because her degree was illegal or face criminal sanctions and then later decreed that plaintiff need not be fired but must give a disclaimer regarding her degrees.
plaintiff initially named four defendants the oregon department of education,the oregon student assistance commission,the oregon office of degree authorization and alan contreras,the administrator of the oregon office of degree authorization,in his official and individual capacities.plaintiff later amended her complaint to drop the institutional defendants and add two more individuals stan bunn,in his official capacity as superintendent of public instruction and head of the oregon department of education,and jeff svejcar,executive director of the oregon student assistance commission.
the district court denied class certification and dismissed defendant bunn from the case.subsequently,the oregon legislature amended.to provide an additional exception to the cease and desist requirement where the school is located in the united states and has been found by the oregon student assistance commission through the office of degree authorization to meet standards of academic quality comparable to those of an institution located in the united states that has accreditation,recognized by the united states department of education,to offer degrees of the type and level claimed by the person.d.the district court then dismissed plaintiff claims for declaratory and injunctive relief as moot in light of the amendment to.
plaintiff then sought leave to amend her complaint to add a claim for compensatory damages against defendants svejcar and contreras in their individual capacities in an unspecified amount.the district court allowed the amendment.
finally,at some point in the litigation,plaintiff unsuccessfully attempted to amend the complaint to add claims against several past and present members of the oregon student assistance commission.
at the pretrial conference,plaintiff sought reconsideration of the district court previous rulings disposing of much of her case.the district court entertained additional briefing and took evidence at trial but ultimately affirmed its prior summary judgment rulings.after a bench trial,the district court found that defendant contreras had violated plaintiff constitutional rights.specifically,the district court concluded that defendant contreras application of the regulations to plaintiff degrees resulted not from an intent to achieve the goals of the regulations,but because of bias toward the institution from which they were received.that finding is not challenged on appeal.the district court awarded plaintiff nominal damages in the amount of one dollar.although plaintiff contends that she received a declaratory judgment that her rights were violated,a review of the judgment reveals that the judgment is a damages judgment only.
plaintiff subsequently sought attorney fees in the amount of and costs in the amount of.the trial court awarded plaintiff in attorney fees and in costs.
both plaintiff and defendants have filed timely notices of appeal of the district court award.
iii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review an attorney fee award pursuant to under an abuse of discretion standard.see wilcox city of reno,cir corder brown,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when it awards fees based on an inaccurate view of the law or a clearly erroneous finding of fact.wilcox,at quoting corder gates,cir.any elements of legal analysis which figure in the district court decision are,however,subject to de novo review.corder,at.i t is vital that the court provide some indication or explanation of how it arrived at the amount of fees awarded.cummings connell,cir second alteration in original quoting chalmers city of los angeles,cir,amended by cir.moreover,when confronted with an objection on the basis of the limited nature of relief obtained by the plaintiff,the district court should make clear that it has considered the relationship between the amount of the fee awarded and the results obtained.cummings,at quoting hensley eckerhart,d.
plaintiff entitlement to fees 
in an action brought pursuant to,the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs b.a plaintiff who receives a nominal damage award is a prevailing party for purposes of.see farrar hobby,d.that does not,however,mean that such a plaintiff is necessarily entitled to an award of fees.see farrar,at.explaining that although the technical nature of a nominal damages award does not affect the prevailing party inquiry,it does bear on the propriety of fees awarded under.
in hensley,the supreme court explained that t he most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate.at.after calculating this lodestar amount,the district court should then determine whether other considerations warrant increasing or decreasing the lodestar amount.id.as explained in hensley,these other considerations include the following twelve factors 
the time and labor required the novelty and difficulty of the questions the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly the preclusion of employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case the customary fee whether the fee is fixed or contingent time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances the amount involved and the results obtained the experience,reputation,and ability of the attorneys the undesirability of the case the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client and awards in similar cases.
although this is the analysis generally applied by district courts in determining fee awards,as we noted in morales city of san rafael,cir,amended by cir,the supreme court in farrar held that nominal damages cases in which the relief is de minimis are exempted from the general requirements that govern the calculation of attorney fees id.at.this includes the requirement that a lodestar first be calculated,as well as the requirement that the district court recit e the factors bearing on reasonableness,farrar,at.after farrar,the district court first consideration must be whether the nominal damages plaintiff is entitled to any fees at all.
in farrar,the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit for million dollars against six defendants.after ten years of litigation,they obtained a nominal damages judgment of one dollar against one defendant.the district court nonetheless awarded the plaintiffs in attorney fees.as the supreme court explained,the most critical factor in determining the reasonableness of a fee award is the degree of success obtained.farrar,at.quoting hensley,at.in a civil rights suit for da
