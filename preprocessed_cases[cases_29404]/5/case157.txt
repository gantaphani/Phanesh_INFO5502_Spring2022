background 
on july,moulton masonry construction,llc,became a signatory to a collective bargaining agreement cba with the bricklayers and allied craftworkers,local in albany,new york the union.among other obligations,the cba required the corporate defendant to make contributions to the union pension,health benefit,annuity,and education and training funds,as well as to the bricklayers trowel trades international pension fund the plaintiff funds and to remit deductions from the union workers paychecks to those funds in accordance with stipulated schedules.the cba also required the corporate defendant to submit to an audit of its books upon request and bound it to the agreements and declarations of the trust as well as the funds collection policy.duane moulton,as the owner,officer,and shareholder of the corporate defendant,signed the cba,reported the hours worked by union members to the plaintiff funds,and communicated with the auditor on the corporate defendant behalf.
in the spring of,the plaintiff funds initiated a payroll audit of the corporate defendant pursuant to the terms of the cba.moulton,however,failed to comply with repeated requests from the auditor.the plaintiff funds,therefore,instituted the present action in federal court.moulton and the corporate defendant received the summons and complaint on february,and march,respectively.on march,the plaintiff funds counsel received a letter from raeann johnson,an attorney in corinth,new york,requesting an extension of time to file an answer on behalf of the corporate defendant.although the plaintiff funds agreed to this request on march,neither the individual nor the corporate defendant ever filed an answer or other responsive pleading.as a result of this failure,on april,the plaintiff funds requested that the court enter a default and served a copy of that request on the defendants.the district court clerk entered the default on that same day.
though the defendants continued to ignore the judicial proceedings,moulton did begin to work with the plaintiffs auditor although the exact extent of that participation is disputed by the parties.on may and may,the plaintiffs advised the defendants of the audit preliminary findings.the plaintiffs represent that they served their first discovery requests on june.on june,the defendants acknowledged receipt of the audit,and after several from the auditor requesting a response,moulton replied with five proposed revisions on july.these revisions were specific to individual employees and did not challenge the audit methodology or raise any concerns about out of trade hours.on july,plaintiffs sent a letter to defendants reminding them of their discovery obligations.on august,the auditor issued his final report concluding that the corporate defendant owed the plaintiff funds.
on october,the plaintiff funds filed a motion for a default judgment.with it,they included affidavits from the fund administrators and business managers,the cba,the funds agreement and declaration of trust and collections policy,affidavits from their auditor and legal counsel,as well as a number of other documents justifying their request for damages.defendants,through new counsel,responded on december,with a brief in opposition as well as a to vacate the entry of default.along with this filing,defendants included a affidavit from duane moulton in which he attempted to explain his reasons for failing to participate in the litigation and challenged the methodology of the audit.the defendants,however,did not provide exhibits or documentary support for any of the statements made in this affidavit.
on january,the district court denied the defendants motion to vacate the initial entry of default and granted the plaintiffs motion for default judgment,awarding plaintiffs the full amount requested.this award included in fringe benefit contributions and deductions,in interest through october,in liquidated damages,and in attorney fees and costs for a total award of.defendants appealed.
discussion 
on appeal,the defendants challenge the district court decision on three grounds.first,they argue that the district court abused its discretion by denying the defendants motion to vacate the original entry of default.second,they argue that because questions of fact remained regarding liability,even accepting all allegations in the complaint as true,the district court abused its discretion by entering a default judgment against them.third,they argue that the district court abused its discretion in calculating the default judgment damages assessed against them.we consider each challenge in turn.
entry of default 
under rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure,w hen a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend,the clerk must enter the party default.the entry of default is therefore not discretionary.that said,after such default is entered,t he court may set aside an entry of default for good cause.c emphasis added.because rule c does not define the term good cause,the second circuit ha s established three criteria that must be assessed in order to decide whether to relieve a party from default or from a default judgment.enron oil diakuhara,cir.these criteria are the willfulness of default,the existence of any meritorious defenses,and prejudice to the party.guggenheim capital,llc birnbaum,cir.relying upon these factors,the district court denied the defendants motion to vacate the entry of default.this denial was not an abuse of the district court discretion.see sony elm state,cir.
first,the record demonstrates that defendants default was willful.we have previously interpreted willfulness,in the context of a default,to refer to conduct that is more than merely negligent or careless,but is instead egregious and not satisfactorily explained.sec mcnulty,cir here,there is no dispute that duane moulton was aware of the legal action pending against him and his company based on his own admissions and the fact that the corporate defendant requested,through counsel,an extension of time to respond.despite this knowledge,the defendants failed to file a responsive pleading for over nine months after the receipt of the summons and complaint,nearly eight months after the defendants were informed that the plaintiffs had requested an entry for default,and six months after they were served with discovery demands.
the defendants primary justification for failing to file a responsive pleading,or participate in the litigation in any way,is that moulton believed his participation in the audit was sufficient to discharge the defendants duties.in his view,therefore,his failure to file a responsive pleading was a mere mistake and,therefore,excusable.a defendant responsibility to file a responsive pleading,however,is not obviated by participating in efforts which could,in theory,later resolve the case.see mcnulty,at,settlement discussions that proved fruitless did not render a default unwillful.proof of facts t he mere belief on the part of a defendant that matters will be settled is not a sufficient excuse for
