the principal issue in this case is the applicability of the supreme court recent decision in buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health human resources,d,to the provisions of the equal access to justice act eaja.the united states court of federal claims,in a decision dated june,held that brickwood contractors brickwood recovery of attorney fees under the eaja is not barred by buckhannon.because we disagree with the court of federal claims conclusion that buckhannon does not apply to the eaja and its alternative theories that attorney fees in this case are permissible under buckhannon,we reverse.
background 
on february,the department of the navy navy issued an invitation for bids ifb to repair elevated water storage tanks at the naval air station,patuxant river,maryland.thereafter,the navy issued amendments to the solicitation adding polychlorinated biphenyl pcb contamination testing to the base requirements and adding three options related to removing pcb contamination from the water storage tanks.five bids base bid plus options were received and publicly opened on april,with brickwood identified as the apparent lowest bidder.as a result of further testing,however,the navy determined there was no evidence of pcb contamination and on may,announced that the bids on the options were no longer needed and would therefore be excluded from the final price evaluation.because of this change,brickwood no longer had the lowest bid.
on june,the navy further amended the solicitation,converting it from an ifb,or a solicitation of bids,to a request for proposals rfp,or a negotiated procurement,deleting the evaluation of options and eliminating the requirements regarding pcbs.the navy intended to negotiate with the bidders whose bids did not include the now determined unnecessary pcb testing.
on june,brickwood filed a bid protest in the court of federal claims seeking to enjoin the navy from converting the ifb to an rfp and to direct the navy to award the contract to brickwood.a hearing was held on brickwood request for a temporary restraining order tro on june.on july,prior to any court decision on that tro request,the navy filed a motion to dismiss informing the court that a fter further consideration of both the circumstances surrounding the solicitation and the governing far provisions,and in light of the court comments at the tro hearing,the navy has cancelled the solicitation and plans to using a new ifb.the court dismissed brickwood protest on july,without reaching the merits of the case.
thereafter,on august,brickwood filed an eaja application seeking attorney fees and expenses for work performed on the lawsuit protesting the navy attempted conversion to an rfp and on the eaja application.
in its opinion dated april,the court of federal claims found that brickwood satisfied the requirements necessary for entitlement to attorney fees and expenses under the eaja brickwood contractors,united states,fed.cl,brickwood i.applying the catalyst theory of prevailing party status pursuant to the eaja,the court found that brickwood was the prevailing party because it had succeeded on a significant issue in the litigation that resulted in a benefit to the plaintiff.in so doing,the court relied on what it termed the advice offered by the supreme court in hewitt helms,d,a case interpreting the prevailing party requirement with respect to attorney fees under the civil rights attorney fees awards act of.that advice was 
a lawsuit sometimes produces voluntary action by the defendant that affords the plaintiff all or some of the relief he sought through a,a monetary settlement or a change in conduct that redresses the plaintiff grievances.when that occurs,the plaintiff is deemed to have prevailed despite the absence of a formal judgment in his favor.
notably,in applying hewitt interpretation of the term prevailing party in to the same term in the eaja,the court observed that this construction of prevailing party is consistent with the policy behind eaja,to compensate parties who cause the government to conform to the law.brickwood i,fed.cl.at.the court further found that the government position in litigation and its underlying conduct regarding the procurement was not substantially justified,and that there were no special circumstances that would make the award of fees unjust.id.at.final judgment was issued on may,awarding plaintiff in attorney fees and expenses.
on may,the supreme court issued its opinion in buckhannon denying the plaintiff fee claim under the fair housing amendments act of,c fhaa and the americans with disabilities act of,ada.in so doing,the court rejected the catalyst theory as a basis for attorney fee awards under fee shifting statutes because it allows a fee award where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the legal relationship of the parties.buckhannon,at.
on june,the government filed a motion for relief from the court prior judgment awarding attorney fees to brickwood pursuant to rule b of the rules of the united states court of federal claims,arguing that the supreme court decision invalidated the basis of that judgment.the court concluded,however,that buckhannon did not bar recovery by brickwood and thus denied the government motion first,the court held that buckhannon does not apply to the determination of prevailing party under the eaja,stating broadly that t he standards for meeting the prevailing party requirement recently set forth in buckhannon conflict with the plain language and the legislative history of the eaja.brickwood ii,fed.cl.at.the court based its conclusion on the fact that while buckhannon applied to two specific statutes the fhaa and the ada and referenced three others,the eaja was not mentioned.further,the court contrasted the eaja and the five cited statutes,noting that the former stated that an award shall be made unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified,whereas the latter allowed broad discretion to trial courts by use of the term may without any further substantial justification requirement.id.at emphases added.the court concluded that these distinctions were significant in the context of construing the term prevailing party because the substantially justified analysis directs the court to consider the merits of the case underlying the eaja application,a plaintiff can not prove the legal merits of the case solely through the prevailing party requirement.id.at.thus,based on this analysis,the court concluded that the term prevailing party,as it appears in the eaja,means something different from that same term in other statutes.id.
second,the court concluded that the facts in brickwood ii were materially distinguishable from those in buckhannon since the latter involved a change by the legislature in eliminating the requirements at issue in the litigation.thus,in buckhannon neither the court nor the plaintiffs had a direct role in the action that engendered resolution of the case.id.at.
finally,the court held,in the alternative,that brickwood is a prevailing party even if buckhannon applies by virtue of the comments made by the court at the june,tro hearing.id.at.according to the court,although it did not issue a written opinion,at the tro hearing it announced its acknowledgement of the merits of plaintiff claims,the rectitude of plaintiff position,and the error of defendant actions.id.at.those remarks,the court concluded,amounted to a finding that the navy had acted unlawfully and represent the necessary judicial imprimatur that caused the change in the legal relationship of the parties.id.at.in this regard,the court also expressed its strong opinion that to interpret buckhannon as requiring formal written judgments on the merits or formal findings of unlawful conduct will inhibit settlements and discourage parties from taking action such as that taken by defendant in brickwood.id.

in buckhannon,the supreme court rejected the use of the catalyst theory in construing whether one is a prevailing party under federal statutes such as the fhaa and the ada.the catalyst theory grants prevailing party status to a plaintiff if it achieves the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct.at.the court held that enforceable judgments on the merits and consent decrees create the material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties necessary to permit an award of attorney fees.id.at.citing.state teachers ass garland indep.sch,d.both the majority and dissent in buckhannon acknowledged that the catalyst theory had previously been recognized by the majority of federal courts of appeals.see id.at.see also id.at.ginsburg,dissenting.
in buckhannon,the named plaintiff,an operator of assisted living homes,failed a state fire marshal inspection because some of its residents were incapable of,removing themselves in such dangerous situations as fires.id.at.plaintiffs sued the state seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and alleging that this requirement violated the fhaa and the ada.while the case was pending in district court in west virginia,that state legislature enacted two bills that eliminated the requirement.the state motion to dismiss the case as moot was granted by the district court and the plaintiff then sought attorney fees as the prevailing party pursuant to the fhaa and the ada,basing its entitlement on the catalyst theory.
the court in buckhannon affirmed the fourth circuit decision that the catalyst theory,which allows a fee award where there is no judicially sanctioned change in the parties legal relationship,lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change to establish prevailing party status.thus,the court concluded it is not a permissible basis for the award of attorney fees under the fhaa and the ada.according to the court 
numerous federal statutes allow courts to award attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party.the question presented here is whether this term includes a party that has failed to secure a judgment on the merits or a consent decree,but has nonetheless achieved the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct.we hold it does not.
id.at.following the supreme court decision in buckhannon,the court of federal claims rejected the government argument that the supreme court holding in buckhannon compels a rejection of the award of attorney fees in brickwood ii on three alternative grounds buckhannon does not apply to attorney fees under the eaja even assuming buckhannon applies to the eaja,its holding is limited to its purely voluntary change by the legislature not prompted by a those facts are distinguishable from the facts in brickwood ii and even if buckhannon applies to the eaja and to the facts of this case,the court statements at a prior tro hearing met the requirements of buckhannon.we reject all of the court of federal claims alternative theories and discuss each in turn.
the court of federal claims concluded that the supreme court decision in buckhannon rejecting the catalyst theory of the prevailing party requirement does not apply to the eaja notwithstanding that the term prevailing party,as construed by the supreme court in buckhannon,appears in virtually all statutes including the eaja.instead,examining the text of the eaja and its legislative history,the court concluded that the term prevailing party has a different meaning when used in the eaja than when used in other statutes.we disagree.
as the supreme court observed in buckhannon,under the american rule,we follow a general practice of not awarding fees to a prevailing party absent explicit statutory authority.buckhannon,at.citing key tronic united states,d.in the numerous statutes in which congress has provided for an exception to the american rule by permitting certain designated parties an award of their litigation costs,congress has used the term prevailing party,a legal term of art.id.at.
although two particular statutes,the fhaa and the ada,were at issue in buckhannon,the court made it clear that its analysis applied to the award of attorney fees to the prevailing party in numerous statutes in addition to those at issue here.at.indeed,while buckhannon specifically listed three statutes in addition to the fhaa and the ada,the court also expressly cited to the appendix to justice brennan dissenting opinion in marek chesny,d,which lists over federal statutes.in a footnote immediately following the reference to the marek appendix,the court stated we have interpreted these fee shifting provisions consistently and so approach the nearly identical provisions at issue here.id.at.citing hensley eckerhart,d.hensley,which considered fees under the civil rights attorneys fees awards act of,held that the standards used to interpret the term prevailing party under any given statute are generally applicable in all cases in which congress has authorized an award of fees to a prevailing party.hensley,at.see also schultz united states,d indeed,the supreme court has recognized that the definition of prevailing party does not differ from or.
the court of federal claims,however,differentiated between prevailing party under the eaja and that same legal term of art found in numerous other statutes because the eaja differs from other statutes in two other respects the eaja mandates the award of fees if specified conditions are met by use of the word shall,whereas such awards in other statutes are left to the court discretion and in contrast to other statutes,the eaja includes an additional hurdle for an award of attorney fees by only permitting an award if the government position was not substantially justified.the court concluded that this substantial justification hurdle alleviates the concerns of the supreme court that motivated its elimination of the catalyst theory since it requires the court to review the merits of the case.
the appellant responds that the inclusion of the additional substantial justification requirement in the eaja does not warrant an alternative interpretation of prevailing party under the eaja.first,the appellant points out that if an application for fees under the eaja fails because the litigant is not a prevailing party,the court never reaches the merits of the government position in litigation.also,the appellant points out that the inclusion of the additional hurdle of substantial justification represents the fact that the bar under the eaja awards was intended to be higher than other fee shifting statutes,whereas the application of the catalyst theory to only the eaja would have the opposite result.these are simply two separate and distinct hurdles one seeking such fees from the government must overcome.
we agree with the appellant construction of the statutory language.the court of federal claims is obviously correct that there are certain differences between the eaja and other statutes.the question,however,is not simply whether there are certain differences,but whether these differences would reasonably lead one to conclude that the prevailing party requirement in the eaja should therefore be construed differently than in other statutes.our examination of the text and the legislative history of the eaja leads us to conclude that there is no basis for distinguishing the term prevailing party in the eaja from other statutes.see smith,cir we discern no reason to interpret the eaja inconsistently with the supreme court interpretation of prevailing party in the fhaa and the ada as explained in buckhannon.the unique aspects of the eaja demonstrate that when congress wanted the eaja to operate in a certain way,it did so explicitly by adding certain criteria.in contrast,it chose to use the same term prevailing party in the eaja as it appears in othe
