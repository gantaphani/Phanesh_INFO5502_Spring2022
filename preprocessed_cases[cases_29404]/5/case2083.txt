factual and procedural history 
the puc proceedings giving rise to the compensation award at issue here arose out of california attempt to deregulate the market for electrical power these efforts produced assembly bill reg.sess.hereafter ab,which became law in stats,ch.and provided for a transition to a competitive electricity market at the end of a transition period ending no later than march.the law also provided for the state main electric utility companies,including sce,to divest themselves of substantial parts of their generating assets.to give the utilities an opportunity to recover their investments in these assets known as stranded or transition costs,the legislature froze retail electricity rates with some exceptions during the transition period.see.
in,sce,pacific gas and electric company pg e,and san diego gas and electric company filed applications in the puc,proposing certain methods for determining the end of the transition period and subsequent ratemaking mechanisms.the puc proceedings on these applications are known as the ratemaking ptr proceedings.the puc issued a decision in october which,among other things,prohibited the utilities from carrying over and recovering after the rate freeze period any uneconomic costs that they had not recovered during the rate freeze.pg e petitioned the puc for rehearing,which issued a decision in march,denying rehearing but making some modifications to the original decision.turn actively participated in these proceedings 
in the summer of,wholesale electricity rates increased dramatically.in october of that year,sce and pg e petitioned the puc to modify its prior decisions in the ptr docket and allow for recovery of certain costs they had not recovered during the rate freeze period.that same month,turn filed an application in which it proposed a change in the accounting method for determining the utilities costs.the puc consolidated these matters.it ultimately issued a decision in march,granting the utilities some rate relief and also adopting turn accounting proposal.
meanwhile,in november,sce and pg e filed separate federal court actions in los angeles and san francisco,respectively against the commissioners of the puc,challenging the puc jurisdiction to enter their ratemaking decisions.in early,turn successfully moved to intervene in both federal actions and actively participated in those proceedings on the side of the puc.after turn intervention,the district court presiding over sce action denied sce request for a preliminary injunction,and the district court presiding over pg e action denied motions by all parties for summary judgment 
in february,turn filed with the puc a notice of intent to claim compensation for its participation in some of the puc proceedings discussed above.in july,turn filed its request for compensation,seeking approximately for its work,including its work in the federal court actions initiated by sce and pg 
in march,an administrative law judge alj issued a draft decision awarding turn approximately for its contributions,which included compensation for turn involvement in the federal court actions.the alj draft decision rejected the utilities contention that turn was not entitled to compensation for its involvement in the federal court proceedings.the alj concluded turn had made a substantial contribution to puc proceedings by participating in the federal court proceedings,noting that if the utilities had succeeded in their federal court actions,the outcome would have prevented the commission from ever reaching the issues raised by turn in its petition for modification filed in one of the puc proceedings.
pursuant to the puc rules of practice and procedure,sce filed comments to the alj draft decision,claiming turn was not entitled to compensation for its federal court work because such compensation is not authorized by the intervenor compensation provisions.
in june,a puc panel issued a decision awarding turn approximately in compensation,including approximately for its federal court work.in the decision,the puc offered two independent rationales for awarding turn compensation for its federal court work.first,the puc concluded such compensation could be awarded under section,which provides in pertinent part that t he commission shall award reasonable advocate fees,reasonable expert witness fees,and other reasonable costs of preparation for and participation in a hearing or proceeding italics added.the puc concluded that the term hearing,which is not defined in the public utilities code,should be interpreted to include participation in hearings before other entities,not just before the puc.
second,the puc concluded turn was entitled to compensation for its federal court work under section,subdivision a,because the costs turn incurred were associated with obtaining judicial review.
sce applied to the puc for rehearing,challenging both rationales offered by the puc for its award of compensation for turn federal court work.
in april,the puc issued a decision denying rehearing,but substantially modifying its original decision.the puc determined it was not necessary to rely on section and deleted the discussion concerning this section from the original decision.instead,the puc focused on the judicial review language of section,subdivision a,as the basis for its award.the puc explained that it did not interpret the phrase obtaining judicial review in section a to provide compensation only when an intervenor initiates judicial review.once judicial review is initiated,all parties that participate in the process are seeking to obtain judicial review in their favor.thus,an intervenor can obtain judicial review not just by succeeding when it initiates judicial review to challenge a commission decision,but also when the intervenor successfully defends a commission decision against a challenge.again,this interpretation is buttressed by the legislative mandate to interpret the statutory provisions to encourage effective intervenor participation.section b.if an intervenor can not gain compensation to defend a commission decision in which the intervenor prevailed,the intervenor effectiveness is severely limited.
the puc also emphasized the importance of turn federal court efforts turn participation in the federal court forum was helpful in protecting the commission authority to act as it eventually did in this way,turn federal court actions significantly contributed to turn ability to make its substantial contribution to the eventual decision in this matter.the federal court litigation was an essential component of these consolidated proceedings and the commission decisions that are the subject of turn compensation request.as such,turn could not practically or effectively advocate its position before the commission without first helping to overcome utility litigation intended to prevent the commission from acting on the very points turn was seeking to raise at the commission.
sce filed a timely petition for a writ of review,subd.a,challenging the compensation award to the extent it included compensation for turn federal court work.the puc and turn filed separate answers opposing sce position.
we issued a writ of review to consider sce contentions on the merits.after receiving the certified record from the puc,we received two amicus curiae by the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights,the utility consumers action network,and the western center on law poverty collectively the puc amici curiae in support of the puc,and another by pg e in support of sce we also received various responses to the amicus curiae briefs and heard oral argument.

the intervenor compensation provisions.
the legislature enacted the intervenor compensation provisions in and they became effective on january,see stats,ch.the legislature declared that the purpose of the intervenor compensation provisions is to provide compensation for reasonable advocate fees,reasonable expert witness fees,and other reasonable costs to public utility customers of participation or intervention in any proceeding of the commission.the provisions apply to all formal proceedings of the commission involving electric,gas,water,and telephone utilities and are to be administered in a manner that encourages the effective and efficient participation of all groups that have a stake in the public utility regulation process,subds.a,b.
the legislature declared its intent that i ntervenors be compensated for making a substantial contribution to proceedings of the commission,as determined by the commission in its orders and decisions,subd.d,italics added.
section specifies the conditions for an award of compensation 
the commission shall award reasonable advocate fees,reasonable expert witness fees,and other reasonable costs of preparation for and participation in a hearing or proceeding to any customer who complies with section and satisfies both of the following requirements 
a the customer presentation makes a substantial contribution to the adoption,in whole or in part,of the commission order or decision.
b participation or intervention without an award of fees or costs imposes a significant financial hardship.italics added.
substantial contribution means that,in the judgment of the commission,the customer presentation has substantially assisted the commission in the making of its order or decision because the order or decision has adopted in whole or in part one or more factual contentions,legal contentions,or specific policy or procedural recommendations presented by the customer.where the customer participation has resulted in a substantial contribution,even if the decision adopts that customer contention or recommendations only in part,the commission may award the customer compensation for all reasonable advocate fees,reasonable expert fees,and other reasonable costs incurred by the customer in preparing or presenting that contention or recommendation,subd.h.
as reflected in the provisions discussed above,the legislature sought to encourage customers to participate in puc proceedings and contribute to puc decisions.the legislature recognized,however,that a decision by the puc is not necessarily the final word on a matter,and it saw fit to assist customers who wished to continue advocating their positions after the puc has issued a decision.therefore,it defined compensation as payment for all or part,as determined by the commission,of reasonable advocate fees,reasonable expert witness fees,and other reasonable costs of preparation for and participation in a proceeding,and includes the fees and costs of obtaining an award under this article and of obtaining judicial review,if any,subd.a,italics added.
turn was entitled to compensation for its federal court efforts.
a.the puc construction of the judicial review clause is reasonable and is consistent with the statutory purpose of promoting effective customer participation in the public utility regulation process.
as in any case involving statutory interpretation,our fundamental task here is to determine the legislature intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.citation.we begin by examining the statute words,giving them a plain and commonsense meaning.citation.we do not,however,consider the statutory language in isolation.citation.rather,we look to the entire substance of the statute in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision citation.citation.that is,we construe the words in question in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute citation.citation.we must harmonize the various parts of a statutory enactment by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.citations.people murphy cal th,d,original ellipses,fourth and sixth brackets in original.
in this case,however,we must also consider and afford considerable deference to the puc interpretation of the statute because,as noted above,the puc interpretation of the public utility code should not be disturbed unless it fails to bear a reasonable relation to statutory purposes and language.sce peevey,supra,cal th at,d,quoting greyhound lines,public utilities,supra,cal d at,
sce claims the award to turn for its federal court work was improper because turn was not obtaining judicial review under subdivision a of section when it intervened in the federal court actions filed by sce and pg e.according to sce,only a customer who initiates a proceeding in a judicial forum is engaged in the process of obtaining judicial review.
the puc rejected sce narrow construction of the phrase obtaining judicial review.the puc explained that o nce judicial review is initiated,all parties that participate in the process are seeking to obtain judicial review in their favor.thus,an intervenor can obtain judicial review not just by succeeding when it initiates judicial review to challenge a commission decision,but also when the intervenor successfully defends a commission decision against a challenge.
we can not say that this construction bears no reasonable relation to statutory purposes and language.sce peevey,supra,cal th at,d.in seeking to intervene in the federal court actions,turn was seeking to ensure that its views concerning the issues would be fully considered,reviewed by the courts in those actions.when the federal courts granted turn requests to intervene,turn obtained judicial review.that there would have been some form of judicial review even absent turn participation does not negate the fact that turn also obtained judicial review.
moreover,the puc constru
