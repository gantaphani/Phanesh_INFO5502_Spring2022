in defendants first motion for summary judgment,defendants argued that the legal malpractice case was separate from the parties fee agreement in the first case.that motion was denied.in a second motion for summary judgment,defendants contended that any representation agreement concerning the legal malpractice case is void and unenforceable under the fee sharing requirements in rules f and of the illinois code of professional conduct.rs.f,f.the trial court granted this motion.plaintiffs appeal from the court granting of summary judgment.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
background 
in june,barry vandermeulen,the chairman of the board of havoco,had concerns about his company lawsuit for fraud,conspiracy and breach of contract and contacted his friend,plaintiff episcope,for consultation.his original attorneys,freeman,alkins and coleman freeman firm,had filed the federal action in and had withdrawn from the case.vandermeulen wanted plaintiffs episcope and erb to take the case over.instead,episcope recommended defendants campbell and di vincenzo,who took over the case,and plaintiffs episcope and erb also filed their appearance at the direction of the client,but the legal work was performed only by campbell and di vincenzo.
the parties and the client,by vandermeulen,signed a joint representation agreement on july.the document was titled representation agreement.in the agreement it states paul episcope,and campbell di vincenzo agree to represent havoco,and havoco agrees to retain these same lawyers,this being the complete agreement among them.
the representation agreement states nothing about how legal fees or the responsibilities for the performance of the legal services were divided between the lawyers.it provides that,in the event a monetary recovery is obtained by way of judgment,settlement or otherwise,paul episcope,and campbell di vincenzo shall receive of the net recovery as a contingent fee.net recovery is the total recovery,including any award of attorney fees or expenses,less all expenses and disbursements that you havoco have paid.
the caption of the agreement at the left margin directly underneath the title lists the client and,under that,the matter.the client is havoco of america,a delaware corporation.the matter is havoco federal case against hill and hilco havoco of america,a delaware corporation elmer hill,hilco,a tennessee corporation,and sumitomo.after this follows the case number of the pending federal action,civil action c.
defendants tried the case with a jury.in early,before trial,the federal district court judge dismissed all of havoco tort claims against sumitomo as barred by the statute of limitations and only the contract claim remained.the freeman firm had added sumitomo as a party defendant in november,which was barred by the statute of limitations.at trial,hilco was granted a directed verdict in its favor,and the jury found in favor of sumitomo on the contract claim.the jury did render a verdict for million on the remaining tort claim against hill personally.
hill filed for bankruptcy prior to the circuit affirming the judgment.the client was only able to collect on the judgment.defendants received a third of that amount for fees and paid episcope a third of what they received under an oral understanding concerning their fee splitting agreement.
vandermeulen desired to file a legal malpractice action against the freeman firm for its failure to add sumitomo as a party defendant within the statute of limitations.initially he asked the parties to do so,but both defendants and plaintiffs declined.plaintiffs claim they urged defendants to take the case and delivered them research on the issues.plaintiffs were unable to show anything more that would indicate that they were representing the interests of the client.
however,defendants did later accept the legal malpractice case.plaintiffs claim they were unaware of the representation agreement in the legal malpractice case signed on february,and the fact that they were not included.additionally,plaintiffs were unaware of a settlement proposal on september,and of the legal malpractice suit that was filed on november.on june,erb telephoned di vincenzo to obtain an update and was told that the case was settled for million in.di vincenzo refused to discuss fee sharing.
plaintiffs then brought this action,alleging breach of a fiduciary duty and seeking a third of the fees received from the settlement.their claim relies on the initial representation agreement.they claim it reflects the parties joint undertaking of representation and fee sharing,consistent with an oral agreement.they claim that the legal malpractice case is part of the same representation as that contained in the original representation agreement,only directed against a different defendant and as a result the defendants have a duty to share the fees.
defendants in their motion for summary judgment argue the representation agreement of february,must be construed as a separate action.they further claim contracts,especially integrated contracts,are confined to their specific terms and point out that the initial agreement was specifically limited to the parties representation of the client in havoco elmer hill,hilco,and sumitomo,c.
the plaintiffs advocate an expansive construction.they claim that the legal malpractice litigation was part of the legal dispute as a whole.as episcope characterized it,the suit was just another way to collect the judgment in the underlying case.plaintiffs argue the parties oral understanding reflected this broader interpretation.the trial court denied the first motion for summary judgment without written comment.
defendants then brought their second motion for summary judgment relying on rule f of the illinois rules of professional conduct f.in that motion they attacked the very validity of the written agreement of july.rule f requires a lawyer dividing a fee with another lawyer from a different firm to have the client signed,written consent to the other lawyer employment.defendants emphasized that under rule f the writing must disclose the basis for the division of fees,including the economic benefit to the other lawyer as a result of the division.defendants also cited rule f that the writing must disclose the responsibility to be assumed by the attorney for the performance of the legal services.
plaintiffs responded that the signed writing is sufficient to prove their case,even under rule f,if supplemented with the oral agreement providing them with a third of the fees.they argue,alternatively,that the representation agreement could be read excising the oral agreement with implied joint ventures principles of equal profits,providing them a split of fees.thirdly,they advanced the claim there was a breach of duty in defendants failure to include the prior oral understanding in the written agreement.plaintiffs counsel argues that the oral provision for the fees should have been included by di vincenzo in the written agreement.those arguments are contained in an affidavit in response to the second motion for summary judgment.in that affidavit plaintiffs aver that plaintiffs inadvertently overlooked the fact that a specific division of fees between the lawyers was not contained in the assessment.
the judge agreed with defendants.the court ruled that the representation agreement failed to comply with rule f.the judge found it disclosed nothing about the basis for the division of fees nor of the responsibility for legal services.the court stated the agreement is clearly silent on the matters which subsections and of rule f require to be in writing.the court declared the agreement void and unenforceable,granting summary judgment for defendants.
plaintiffs appeal.we affirm.
summary judgment is proper where,when viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,the pleadings,depositions,admissions,and affidavits on file reveal that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.general casualty insurance lacey.we review the granting of a motion for summary judgment de novo.general casualty,at.
the reviewing court must construe all evidence strictly against the movant and liberally in favor of the nonmoving party.larry karchmar,nevoral,d.
on appeal from a grant of summary judgment,a reviewing court function is to determine whether the trial court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact,and if there was not,whether the judgment was correct as a matter of law.people ex rel.burris memorial consultants,d.in other words,where no genuine issue of material fact exists,the reviewing court sole function is to determine whether judgment for defendant was correct as a matter of law.cates cates.
construing the language employed in a contract is a matter of law appropriate for summary judgment citations,unless the contract is ambiguous.memorial consultants,d at.whether an ambiguity exists in a document is a question of law.memorial consultants,d at.a contract is ambiguous if it is reasonably susceptible to more than one meaning citation,but an ambiguity is not created merely because the parties disagree.memorial consultants,d at.
plaintiffs claim that the defendants breached their fiduciary obligations of honesty,good faith and fair dealings arising out of a joint venture agreement with plaintiffs.the joint venture agreement that plaintiffs refer to is the written retainer agreement of july,signed by the parties and the client,and the subsequent oral agreement as to the splitting of the fees on the federal case referred to in that agreement.that agreement referred only to client havoco federal case number c against elmer hill,hilco,and sumitomo.this agreement does not mention a legal malpractice case against the freeman firm.it is plaintiffs theory that a trier of fact could find from erb affidavit that an oral agreement to split fees between the parties existed prior to the written agreement of july,and that the defendants breached their fiduciary obligations of honesty,good faith,and fair dealings arising out of a joint venture in their failure to place that information in the agreement.it is this court position that even if the splitting fee provision was included in the july agreement,it would not extend to the legal malpractice case because the agreement is not ambiguous and was limited to the federal lawsuit that was specified in the document.
plaintiffs further claim that the legal malpractice case was part of the agreement of july,because the agreement states 
in the event a monetary recovery is obtained by way of judgment,settlement,or otherwise,the parties shall receive of the net recovery as a contingent fee.
plaintiffs theory is that otherwise widens the meaning of the recovery agreed upon to include a plaintiff recovery from a lawyer who was negligent in pursuing recovery.plaintiffs second argument is also not persuasive.
the word otherwise does not have the expansive meaning claimed by plaintiffs.other and otherwise are limited to the objects and persons that plaintiffs enumerated,according to ejusdem generis principles which means other such like things.e e hauling,ryan,d.for the purposes of the ejusdem generis rule,other and otherwise are treated identically.e e hauling,ryan,d at.
in farley marion power shovel,quoting people capuzi,our illinois supreme court stated 
the doctrine of ejusdem generis is that where a statute or document specifically enumerates several classes of persons or things and immediately following,and classed with such enumeration,the clause embraces other persons or things,the word other will generally be read as other such like,so that the persons or things therein comprised may be read as ejusdem generis with,and not of a quality superior to or different from,those specifically enumerated.
thus,we must interpret otherwise in the initial agreement to mean that monetary recovery can occur by judgment,settlement,and by such other similar means as arbitration,mediation,or other alternative dispute resolutions.since otherwise is not interpreted to extend to things of a different quality,it can not apply to a different recovery when a written agreement limits itself to a single action,as it normally will not be expanded beyond its terms.
a n agreement,when reduced to writing,must be presumed to speak the intention of the parties who signed it.air safety,teachers realty,quoting western illinois oil thompson.it speaks for itself,and the intention with which it was executed must be determined from the language used.air safety,at,quoting thompson,at.it is not changed by extrinsic evidence.air safety,at,quoting thompson,at.if no ambiguity exists in the writing,the parties intent must be derived by the trial court from the writing itself,as a matter of law.quake construction,american airlines.any ambiguity claimed has to be asserted reasonably and plausibly.the interpretation of the party contending for ambiguity needs to be equally plausible to the construction of the party arguing the contract is unambiguous.krantz chessick,d.there is no plausible ambiguity in the representative agreement when it applies to a specific case filed in the federal court.
where a document is a fully integrated writing,the extrinsic or parole evidence rule is not available to vary or contradict the writing.eichengreen rollins,d.the meaning of the integrated document as it expresses the intentions of the parties exclusively and is facially unambiguous has to be confined to the four corners of the document.eichengreen,d at.the agreement as an integrated writing here does not include the legal malpractice suit.
however,even if this court found that there was a question of fact for the trier of fact to determine as to whether there was a valid joint venture agreement among the parties concerning the legal malpractice case,the agreement would still be void and unenforceable as a matter of law under rule f of the illinois rules of professional conduct,which is the primary basis of defendants motion for summary judgment and the subject of this appeal.at the time of the execution of the agreement of july,the relevant provision was disciplinary rule a,which is,for all practical purposes,identical to rule f,which states 
f a lawyer shall not divide a fee for legal services with another lawyer who is not in the same firm,unless the client consents to employment of the other lawyer by signing a writing which discloses 
that a division of fees will be made 
the basis upon which the division will be made,including the economic benefit to be received by the other lawyer as a result of the division and 
the responsibility to be assumed by the other lawyer for performance of the legal services in question.f.
defendants argue that the agreement claimed by plaintiffs violates rule f in that it fails to set forth the basis for a division of fees between the two firms and the responsibili
