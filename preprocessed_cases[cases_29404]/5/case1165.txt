appellant bonnie snavely appeals from the order of the district court for the district of montana affirming the order of the bankruptcy court for the district of montana montana bankruptcy court awarding douglas miller in attorney fees based on snavely breach of her fiduciary duties as trustee of a trust of which miller was a beneficiary.snavely filed a petition for bankruptcy in the bankruptcy court for the western district of washington washington bankruptcy court on march.she argues that the montana bankruptcy court order,issued on march,violated the automatic stay triggered by the earlier filing of her bankruptcy petition in the washington bankruptcy court.we reverse because we conclude that the automatic stay enjoined the montana bankruptcy court from entering an award of attorney fees until after the expiration or lifting of the stay.

following trial on miller objections and counterclaims to the proof of claim,the montana bankruptcy court issued a detailed order allowing a portion of the trust proof of claim against miller,subject to offset of a judgment in favor of miller and against snavely on miller counterclaims.on january,miller filed a motion for attorney fees and costs against snavely in the montana bankruptcy court.the montana bankruptcy court denied this motion on march.

this court has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to d and.we review a district court decision on appeal from a bankruptcy court de novo.preblich battley,cir.we apply a clearly erroneous standard to a bankruptcy court findings of fact and review de novo its conclusions of law.id.
during the argument in this matter,snavely counsel asserted,for the first time,that under washington state law,the superior court oral ruling on march,in in re the margueritte miller living trust,that snavely did not breach her fiduciary duties as trustee of the trust was binding on the montana bankruptcy court under the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.we ordered counsel to file supplemental briefs addressing this question.
none of the cases cited by snavely in her supplemental brief supports her contention that an oral ruling of a washington trial court can serve as a final judgment triggering the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.see cunningham washington,holding that partial summary judgment was sufficiently final to invoke collateral estoppel where judge issued a written opinion bull fenich,holding that probate court order was a final judgment because it represented the final adjudication of the parties rights chau city of seattle,holding that a judgment on verdict entered by the trial court regarding damages against a codefendant satisfies the finality requirement for collateral estoppel purposes.

snavely argues that because she filed for bankruptcy in the washington bankruptcy court on march,any proceedings pending against her in the montana bankruptcy court,including miller motion for reconsideration of his request for attorney fees,were subject to an automatic stay under a.snavely contends that the march,montana bankruptcy court order awarding attorney fees to miller is therefore void.
section a provides in relevant part 
a except as provided in subsection b of this section,a petition filed under section,or of this title operates as a stay,applicable to all entities of 
the commencement or continuation,including the issuance or employment of process,of a judicial,administrative,or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title,or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title 
although the plain language of a appears to apply the stay to all court proceedings,courts have generally limited the application of the stay in bankruptcy court proceedings.prewitt north coast village,in re north coast village,cir.the automatic stay is applicable only to proceedings against the debtor.see parker,at s ection should be read to stay all appeals in proceedings that were originally brought against the debtor emphasis omitted alteration in original parallel citation omitted quoting fin.miller mining,cir.this rule finds its source in the language of section,which extends the automatic stay to the continuation,as well as the commencement,of an action against the debtor.id.emphasis in the original.
the automatic stay does not apply to proceedings initiated against the debtor if the proceedings are initiated in the same bankruptcy court where the debtor bankruptcy proceedings are pending.teerlink lambert in re teerlink ranch,cir automatic stay is inapplicable to a suit commenced in the same court where the bankruptcy is pending civic center square,ford in re roxford foods,cir same.in in re north coast village,the bankruptcy appellate panel explained the reasoning behind this exception 
we agree that the stay does not apply to proceedings commenced against the debtor in the bankruptcy court where the debtor bankruptcy is pending.although the statutory language does not differentiate between proceedings in bankruptcy courts and proceedings in other courts,the application of the stay to proceedings against the debtor in the home bankruptcy court would be illogical and would not serve the purposes underlying the automatic stay.the automatic stay is designed to provide the debtor a breathing spell from his or her creditors by stopping all collection efforts,to protect creditors from each other by stopping the race for the debtor assets and preserving the assets for the benefit of all creditors and to provide for an orderly liquidation of administration of the estate declining to apply the stay to proceedings in the home bankruptcy court will not interfere wi
