this is,as yogi berra might say,déjà vu all over again.not long ago,we affirmed a verdict awarding byron crowe in his indemnity action against bolduc.crowe bolduc,cir crowe ii.flush from his appellate triumph,crowe repaired to the district court and successfully petitioned for incremental awards of prejudgment interest and attorneys fees.bolduc challenges both awards.
the prejudgment interest issue requires us to revisit prior circuit precedent,specifically,aubin fudala,cir.aubin held that the proper vehicle for the initial assessment of mandatory prejudgment interest,wholly omitted from an earlier judgment,is a motion to correct the judgment pursuant to.a rather than a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to.e.id.at.recognizing that an intervening supreme court decision has undermined aubin s resolution of this point,we overrule that determination and hold that,in such circumstances,resort should be made to rule e however,since crowe justifiably relied upon,and faithfully followed,existing circuit precedent,we direct that this holding operate in a purely prospective fashion.consequently,we affirm the award of prejudgment interest even though crowe failed to file his motion within the period delineated in rule e.
the remaining question involves crowe entitlement vel non to attorneys fees.the answer to that question depends principally on contractual arrangements entered into by and between the parties.fairly read,those agreements authorize in the circumstances of this case.thus,we affirm the award of attorneys fees as well.
background 
we do not write on a pristine page.this appeal is an offspring of a transaction that has been mired in litigation for several years.that litigation has inspired two published circuit court opinions,each of which recounts pertinent aspects of the factual background.see crowe ii,at achille bayart cie crowe,cir crowe i.we refer the reader who hungers for further details to those opinions.for present purposes,we offer only an overview.
crowe was the president and sole shareholder of andrew crowe sons,crowe rope company crowe rope.once an industry leader,crowe rope fell upon hard times.by december of,the company owed over to its prime commercial lender,fleet bank.to secure this debt,fleet held mortgages on,and security interests in,all the assets of crowe rope.when crowe rope defaulted on its obligations to fleet,bolduc emerged as a white knight.
acting through a web of holding companies,bolduc purchased the fleet debt and stepped into fleet shoes as crowe rope principal secured creditor.crowe rope then transferred all of its assets to one of bolduc nominees the operating company and crowe and his wife transferred some real estate held in their names to another of bolduc nominees.in exchange,bolduc the operating company agreed to i cancel the existing debt and release the crowes from any personal liability,ii pay the crowes or the survivor of them a lifetime annuity,iii pay crowe a fee for consulting services and for agreeing not to compete,and iv hold the crowes harmless should creditors cry foul.we discuss below the various documents that memorialize this transaction.
the deal left crowe rope trade creditors barking up a defoliated tree.on may,one such creditor,achille bayart cie,brought suit against the crowes seeking to set aside the annuity as a fraudulent transfer.see crowe i,at.after some preliminary skirmishing,not relevant here,the district court granted the crowes motion for judgment as a matter of law.we affirmed that decision.id.at.
in crowe view,certain provisions in the agreements between the parties bound bolduc to defray the legal fees that he had expended in defending crowe accordingly,he brought suit against bolduc in a maine state court to recoup those fees.bolduc removed the case to the district court based on diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount.a,a.the parties proceeded by consent before a magistrate judge.see id.c.after a trial,a jury accepted crowe view of the arrangement and awarded him.crowe ii,at.we affirmed that award on july.id.at.
that did not end the case,but,rather,set the stage for further proceedings.on july,crowe invoked.a and moved to correct the judgment by adding prejudgment interest.he also moved for an award of attorneys fees pursuant to.d.the magistrate judge granted both motions,tacking on in prejudgment interest and in attorneys fees this appeal ensued.
ii.prejudgment interest 
bolduc challenge to the prejudgment interest award turns on abstract questions of law.we therefore review the lower court decision de novo.disola,llc mancuso,cir charities trust engelhard,cir.
when a plaintiff obtains a jury verdict in a diversity case in which the substantive law of the forum state supplies the rules of decision,that state law governs the plaintiff entitlement to prejudgment interest.see charities trust,at roy star chopper,cir.maine law broadly entitles prevailing civil plaintiffs to prejudgment interest as a matter of right.ann.tit,repealed and replaced by.ann.tit,effective for judgments entered on or after july,sawyer walker,me.it is,therefore,beyond serious question that crowe success in crowe ii carried with it an entitlement to prejudgment interest so long as that entitlement was properly preserved.
despite crowe right to recover prejudgment interest,the district court judgment in crowe ii made no mention of interest,but simply confirmed the damage award.that judgment entered no later than november,on july,than eight months filed a motion to augment the judgment by adding prejudgment interest.crowe brought this motion under.a,which provides in pertinent part that c lerical mistakes in judgments and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at any time on the motion of any party.
bolduc opposed crowe motion,asseverating that rule a was the wrong procedural vehicle and that recourse to the proper.civ.e was.rule e governs motions to alter or amend a judgment and explicitly provides that all such motions shall be filed no later than days after entry of judgment.because crowe had filed his motion to add prejudgment interest more than days after the entry of judgment,the deadline,if applicable,had long since expired.
the district court rejected bolduc importunings.it found this case indistinguishable in all material respects from our earlier decision in aubin,at.relying principally on that precedent,the court anointed rule a as an acceptable vehicle for adding prejudgment interest and adjudged crowe motion timely.aubin,however,was a weaker reed than the district court thought.we explain briefly.
in aubin,the plaintiff won a jury verdict in new hampshire federal district court and,thus,became entitled to prejudgment interest as a matter of new hampshire law.id.at citing.ann.b.the court entered a judgment that referred only to the amount of damages and the plaintiff subsequently moved to add prejudgment interest.the district court allowed the motion even though it had been filed more than ten days after entry of the judgment.we affirmed,holding that a rule a motion was an appropriate vehicle for correcting a final judgment that omitted mandatory prejudgment interest and that,therefore,the plaintiff motion was not subject to the temporal strictures of rule e.id.at.
this court decided aubin in.three years later,the supreme court decided osterneck ernst whitney,d.in that case,the court held that a motion to augment a previously entered judgment by adding discretionary prejudgment interest is properly classified as a motion to alter or amend the judgment,and,thus,must be brought under rule e.id.at.the court reasoned from the premise that the use of rule e is appropriate when a motion involves reconsideration of matters properly encompassed in a decision on the merits.id.at.quoting white dep t of emp,d.it then noted two considerations pertinent to discretionary prejudgment interest i prejudgment interest traditionally has been regarded as a remedy and as a part of the plaintiff complete compensation,and ii motions to add prejudgment interest to a verdict neither raise issues wholly collateral to the judgment in the main cause of action nor require an inquiry wholly separate from the decision on the merits.id.at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.based largely on these two considerations,the court concluded that motions for the addition of discretionary prejudgment interest involve the kind of reconsideration of matters within the merits of a judgment to which rule e was intended to apply.id.at.and as a policy matter,requiring resort to rule e for this purpose further s the important goal of avoiding piecemeal appellate review of judgments.id.at.discussing fed.a 
strictly speaking osterneck is distinguishable.the court there was dealing with a belated attempt to secure a discretionary award of prejudgment interest.see id.at.crowe seizes on this distinction,pointing out that this a motion to add mandatory prejudgment interest.that distinction carries little weight.for one thing,the considerations relied upon by the osterneck court apply with equal force to augmentations involving mandatory prejudgment interest.for another thing,the osterneck court took pains to note 
we do not believe the result should be different where prejudgment interest is available as a matter of right.it could be argued that where a party is entitled to prejudgment interest as a matter of right,a reexamination of issues relevant to the underlying merits is not necessary,and therefore the motion should be deemed collateral in the sense we have used that term.however,mandatory prejudgment interest,no less than discretionary prejudgment interest,serves to remedy the injury giving rise to the underlying action,and in that sense is part of the merits of the district court decision.moreover,w hat is of importance here is not preservation of conceptual consistency in the status of a particular type of motion as merits or nonmerits,but rather preservation of operational consistency and predictability courts and litigants are best served by the rule that a motion for prejudgment interest implicates the merits of the district court judgment.
id.at.citations omitted.
to be sure,this footnote is dictum,but it is much more than an offhand comment.we have recognized before,and today reaffirm,that c arefully considered statements of the supreme court,even if technically dictum,must be accorded great weight and should be treated as authoritative.united states santana,cir accord mccoy mit,cir.the osterneck footnote is purposeful,straightforward,and soundly reasoned.all nine justices subscribed to it.and,finally,the footnote remains unblemished it has not been scarred by any subsequent supreme court pronouncement.in these circumstances,we are unwilling to turn a blind eye to the clear import of footnote.
following osterneck lead,we conclude that rule e is the proper procedural vehicle for motions seeking to revise a judgment to include an initial award of prejudgment interest whether mandatory or discretionary.this holding aligns us with the three other courts of appeals that have addressed the question.the tenth circuit has held squarely,as do we,that rule e,rather than rule a,is the proper vehicle for motions seeking an initial award of mandatory prejudgment interest,capstick allstate ins,cir,and two other circuits have indicated their assent to that proposition,see pogor makita,cir dictum kosnoski howley,cir dictum to the extent that our earlier decision in aubin is inconsistent with this holding,it is overruled.see supra note.
despite this square holding,our journey must continue.crowe asserts that he nonetheless was entitled to rely upon aubin because that decision had not been expressly overruled and,indeed,had been followed by the federal district court in maine even after the osterneck decision.any abrogation of aubin should,he suggests,be purely prospective,and should not have force in this case.
as a general rule,judicial decisions are retroactive in the sense that they apply both to the parties in the case before the court and to all other parties in pending cases.james beam distilling georgia,d amann town of stow,cir per curiam.this rule is absolute in the criminal context.griffith kentucky,d.in civil cases,however,the rule admits of a narrow equitable exception.see chevron oil huson,d see also am.trucking ass ns,smith,d plurality op.reaffirming preeminence of chevron oil in the civil context.
the exception works along the following lines.a court in a civil case may apply a decision purely prospectively,binding neither the parties before it nor similarly situated parties in other pending cases,depending on the answers to three questions.first does the court decision announce a new and unexpected rule of law,by,say,overruling settled precedent on which the parties may have relied second does the history of the jurisprudence in the affected area of the law,together with the new rule purpose and effect,counsel for or against retroactive application third would retroactive application give rise to a substantial inequity chevron oil,at.selective prospectivity,however,is not permissible if a new rule is applied to the parties in the case,then it must be applied retroactively to similarly situated parties in all pending cases.harper.dep t of,d.in a civil case,then,a court has only two available options pure prospectivity or full retroactivity.glazner glazner,cir en banc george camacho,cir en banc.
we find this case a suitable candidate for purely prospective application of a new rule.in jettisoning aubin,we set aside binding circuit precedent that authorized submission of initial motions for mandatory prejudgment interest under rule a.although the osterneck dictum presaged the demise of the aubin rule,osterneck did not expressly abrogate aubin.thus,aubin remained good law in this circuit.bolduc has pointed to no opinion at either the circuit or district level that raised the possibility that aubin was lingering on life support.typical cases,such as the decisions in mirra maine school administrative district,wl,at.may,and lewis city of brockton,civ,wl,at,cite confidently to aubin,and proceed to apply it with no mention of the osterneck dictum.under these circumstances,crowe reliance on aubin was understandable and the first prong of the chevron oil test is,therefore,satisfied.see glazner,at george,at.
the second chevron oil factor also counsels against retrospective application here.the newly minted requirement that mandatory prejudgment interest motions must be brought pursuant to rule e is meant to provide parties with clear direction and certainty in litigating their claims.applying the rule retroactively to parties who justifiably have relied on a previous rule does not advance any discernible goal.
the final chevron oil signpost points in the same direction.we think that it would be patently unfair to subject a party to a forfeiture for assiduously following binding circuit precedent.see george,at n o court has ever applied a change to a procedural rule in a manner that serves to forfeit a litigant substantive rights when that litigant had fully complied with the provisions of the rule as it existed at the time he acted.emphasis in original see also wagner daewoo heavy indus.am,cir en banc refusing to apply new rule restricting right to amend pleadings retroactively.
our conclusion in favor of purely prospective application fits well with cases that change the allotted time in which to make a filing,but refuse to apply the new rule retroactively.for example,when a decision replaces a limitations period previously established in circuit precedent with a new,less generous rule of timeliness,courts regularly have refused to apply the new rule retroactively if doing so would bar an action timely brought under the prior law.see,francis coll,d chevron oil,at.another example is george,in which the ninth circuit overturned circuit precedent that had allowed litigants in the northern mariana islands an additional seven days within which to file notices of appeal.despite the fact that the overruled precedent was based on a flat misreading of the applicable local rule,the george court made its decision purely prospective and refused to apply the new interpretation to bar the appellant appeal.at.
that ends this aspect of the matter.although we hold that motions to augment previously entered judgments by adding mandatory prejudgment interest must be brought under rule e and therefore must meet that rule filing requirement,we direct that our holding be applied in a purely prospective manner.consequently,this holding does not affect crowe.and because crowe motion was timely under circuit precedent,we affirm the district court award of prejudgment interest.
iii.attorneys fees 
we turn next to the decision awarding crowe the attorneys fees incurred in prosecuting crowe ii.the american rule,followed in maine,generally requires that each party compensate his or her own lawyers.alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,d jackson inhabitants of searsport,me.this rule,like almost every general rule,admits of various exceptions.one exception is that prevailing parties are entitled to attorneys fees if the parties agreed by contract to a arrangement.jackson,at.
in this case,the district court concluded that the documents memorializing the transaction authorized the shifting of fees.bolduc challenges this conclusion.
there are three agreements which,taken together,govern the arrangements between crowe and bolduc.the centerpiece is an agreement dated december,among the crowes,bolduc,and the operating company.in it,crowe agreed to transfer all of crowe rope assets to the operating company and the real estate to another of bolduc nominees in satisfaction of the fleet debt.the same agreement bound bolduc and the operating company to pay the crowes the lifetime annuity and the fee.the second document,executed on the same date,is a letter agreement between the crowes and bolduc.the letter agreement is,broadly speaking,an indemnity agreement.it imposed two obligations on bolduc.first,it bound him to hold the crowes harmless against any loss in the event that a court decree interrupted the payment of either the annual stipend or the fee.second,it obligated bolduc to defend the crowes against creditor suits or,alternatively,reimburse them for the reasonable cost of defending such actions.see crowe ii,at approving a jury finding that the letter agreement imposed that obligation on bolduc.
the third document is a guaranty the guaranty,executed one week after the other two agreements.the crowes,bolduc,and the operating company are parties to the guaranty.in the portion of the guaranty that is of interest here,bolduc guaranteed payment to the crowes of certain obligations due to them under the december agreements.
this appeal centers on the district court recension of the guaranty.in this inquiry,maine law supplies the substantive rules of decision the agreements so stipulate,and the parties concede the point.the district court held that the guaranty was,in pertinent part,unambiguous,and that the indemnity provisions encompassed the costs incurred by crowe.whether a contract is unambiguous presents a question of law subject to plenary review.blackie maine,cir.so too the interpretation of unambiguous contract terms.id.
the interpretive principles that guide our decision are familiar.a guarantee is simply a specialized form of contract and,as such,is subject to the same canons of construction that apply to other types of contracts.handy boat prof l,me.thus,the language of the guaranty should be interpreted to effect the parties intentions as reflected in the written instrument,construed with regard for the subject matter,motive,and purpose of the agreement,as well as the object to be accomplished.id.where,as here,the parties entered into several contracts in the same time frame and for the purpose of completing a unitary transaction,the contracts ought to be construed together.bumila keiser homes of,me.
with these tenets in mind,we turn to the specific provisions at issue here.pertinently,the guaranty provides in paragraph 
bolduc hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the payment by the operating company of all payments due to the crowes or either of them from the operating company under and on account of the december,agreement and pursuant to a certain letter agreement also dated december,from bolduc to the crowes,a true copy of which is attached hereto and made a part hereof,as and when said payments are due,including without limitation,all compensation for noncompetition and consulting services and annuity payments 
the guaranty also includes a provision stating that bolduc agrees to pay all o sic the crowe sic reasonable legal fees,costs,and expenses in collecting the obligations or in enforcing this guaranty.the question before us reduces to whether this provision,when read together with the remainder of paragraph and the december agreements,obligates bolduc to pay crowe the legal fees incurred in prosecuting crowe ii.
the parties offer competing interpretations of the provision.crowe begins from the premise that he is entitled to recoup legal fees expended in enforcing this guaranty.in paragraph,bolduc guarantees the making of payments pursuant to the letter agreement.one payment due under the letter agreement was for the cost of defending crowe see crowe ii,at.since bolduc initially refused to make that payment and crowe only recovered the sums due after bringing suit,crowe ii should be characterized as an action to enforce bolduc obligation under paragraph.hence,crowe is entitled to recover legal fees expended in prosecuting that action.
bolduc begins from the same crowe is entitled to legal fees expended in enforcing this guaranty but reaches the opposite conclusion.under paragraph,bolduc guarantees the payment by the operating company of all payments due to the crowes or either of them from the operating company under and on account of the december,agreement and pursuant to the letter agreement.bolduc reads this language as restricting his liability to payments due from the operating company to the crowes.since crowe ii was an action to collect a payment bolduc individually owed crowe under the letter agreement not to collect a payment due from the operating company,it should not be characterized as an action to enforce the guaranty.hence,crowe is not entitled to recover attorneys fees for prosecuting that action.
at first blush,it may seem that we are faced with an ambiguous contract although neither crowe nor bolduc subscribes to that view on further examination,however,that is not the case.after all,a contract need not negate every possible construction of its terms in order to be unambiguous.waxler waxler,me.nor is a contract ambiguous merely because a party to it disputes an interpretation that is logically compelled.blackie,at.in the last analysis,a contract is ambiguous only when its terms,fairly construed,yield more than one reasonable interpretation.lexington ins.accid.ins,cir blackie,at.
in this instance,bolduc interpretation of the provision is unreasonable.a contract ordinarily should be interpreted so as to give force to all of its provisions.blackie,at acadia ins.buck constr,me.it follows that an inquiring court should,whenever possible,avoid an interpretation that renders a particular word,clause,or phrase meaningless or relegates it to the category of mere surplusage.acadia,at.here,the fatal flaw in bolduc argument is that it renders nugatory paragraph reference to the letter agreement.
according to bolduc,his only obligation under paragraph is to ensure payments due from the operating company.this interpretation overlooks the fact that paragraph applies not only to payments under and on account of the december,agreement but also to payments required pursuant to the letter agreement.the operating company is liable,under the main december agreement,to make the annuity and payments,and the guaranty clearly applies to those payments.but the operating company is not liable for any payments under the letter agreement it is not even a party to that agreement.if we were to accept bolduc thesis,paragraph reference to payments pursuant to the letter agreement would be meaningless.that would contravene the rule that,whenever possible,contracts should be construed to give effect to every word,
