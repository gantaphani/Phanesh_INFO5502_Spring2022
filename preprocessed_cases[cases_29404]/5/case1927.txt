the city of monte sereno city sued defendants darla and joseph padgett for abatement of a public nuisance and violations of the monte sereno municipal code msmc.the parties settled before trial,with an agreement that the action would be deemed dismissed upon defendants compliance with the city demands,and that the city could thereafter seek its attorney fees.the trial court awarded the city its fees based on two provisions of the msmc.on appeal,defendants challenge the validity of these provisions.defendants further contend that the city should not have received any award because they were prevented from complying with the city demands,the city used the lawsuit to harass them and selectively enforce its ordinances,and the amount of the award was excessive.we agree with defendants that the msmc provisions on which the city relied were not a proper basis for attorney fees.accordingly,we must reverse the judgment.
background 
the dispute between the city and defendants arose from darla padgett plans to improve defendants property with new structures and remodeling of an existing structure.in march she obtained a site development permit sdp,which included a landscaping plan.the following october she obtained a building permit covering construction,plumbing,mechanical,and electrical improvements.the building permit was to expire,however,if the work was abandoned for more than days,or if defendants failed to arrange for a final inspection of the work within days of completion.
during construction defendants removed a eucalyptus tree,contrary to the landscape plan.the city then imposed an additional mitigation condition on the sdp defendants were required to plant six evergreen trees along the property line.they did not plant those trees at that time,however.according to darla padgett,defendants could not plant the trees because of pending utility easements and because the driveway had not been completed.she further stated that she could not complete the requirements of the building permit because of an existing injunction related to litigation initiated by her neighbors.as for the fence,padgett expressed willingness to lower it if the city could assure her that it would enforce the fence law equally.
the city filed a suit in abatement in february,alleging building code violations,violations of the msmc,and public nuisance.in its first amended complaint in march,the city specifically alleged that defendants removal of the eucalyptus tree and their failure to plant the mitigation trees violated the sdp.the city further alleged that defendants had failed to schedule their final inspection as required by the applicable building code,resulting in expiration of their building permit.finally,the city alleged that defendants had constructed and maintained a fence that exceeded the maximum height allowance under the msmc.in addition to requesting an injunction and abatement,the city sought costs of suit,including the attorney fees and costs authorized pursuant to section of the msmc.
the parties settled the case on january,six days before the scheduled trial.the remedial terms of the settlement called for lowering of the fence to six feet,the planting of six trees,and an independent final inspection by january.if the final inspection produced a,everything approved,then the matter would be deemed dismissed on that date,january.the parties further agreed that the city had the right to file a request for costs,including attorney fees,but that defendants were entitled to oppose both entitlement to and amount of those fees.the city was claiming attorney fees of about.
on february,a notice of dismissal was filed,stating that the action was deemed dismissed on february.the city filed a memorandum of costs on february and a motion for costs and attorney fees on march.according to the city,attorney fees were recoverable under code of civil procedure section,subdivisions a b and a c,because they were authorized under the msmc,by sections and.defendants moved to strike or tax costs.the city eventually submitted a revised fee claim of.
on october,after receiving extensive written and oral argument from both parties,the trial court denied defendants motion and granted the city,awarding it attorney fees of.the court entered judgment on both motions on october,and on november,the city voluntarily dismissed the action.
discussion 
on appeal,defendants challenge both the city entitlement to attorney fees and the amount awarded.they acknowledge the general rule that attorney fees are permitted in a civil action when authorized by statute,contract,or law.code civ,subd.a.a municipal ordinance is a law within the meaning of this provision.city of santa paula narula th,d see also segundo rancho mirage city cir.defendants contend,however,that msmc section conflicts with or is preempted by government code section,subdivision b section b,which defines the procedures a city may establish for abating nuisances.they further argue that fees were not authorized under msmc section because that ordinance did not become effective until six days after the case was deemed dismissed.finally,defendants contend that the amount of the fee award was excessive in view of the city litigation conduct and the result achieved.

msmc section 
msmc section describes the penalties to which a monte sereno property owner may be subjected for maintaining a nuisance in the city.in addition to providing for imposition of a fine and imprisonment,the ordinance states s hould the city commence a civil or criminal proceeding to abate a public nuisance,the costs of abatement which may be recorded shall include all legal costs including reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the city in commencing and pursuing civil or criminal remedies.
defendants contend that this provision is invalid because it conflicts with section b,which requires an ordinance allowing attorney fees to permit their recovery by the prevailing party,rather than limiting recovery of attorneys fees to the city if it prevails.emphasis added.the trial court agreed with the city that section b was intended to apply specifically to recovery of fees as a special assessment in connection with summary abatement administrative proceedings.in those procedures,the city and the court reasoned,reciprocity provides an essential procedural safeguard,whereas judicial proceedings already afford the property owner procedural and substantive protections.the court also agreed with the city that permitting a city alone to recover its fees furthered the public policy to encourage the pursuit of abatement actions by reducing the costs of such actions.city of santa paula narula,supra,th at,d.
we disagree with the city and trial court construction of section b limiting its application.it is true that government code section permits summary abatement of a nuisance at a property owner expense.that statute also allows a city to make the expense of abatement a lien against the property as well as a personal obligation of the property owner,in accordance with section or.but there is no indication in section that it is,in effect,a subdivision of section.subdivision a of section allows abatement procedures as an alternative to the procedure established in section,which permits liens on property as a means of collecting nuisance abatement costs,subd.a.section b then provides for attorney fees as follows a city may,by ordinance,provide for the recovery of attorneys fees in any action,administrative proceeding,or special proceeding to abate a nuisance.if the ordinance provides for the recovery of attorneys fees,it shall provide for recovery of attorneys fees by the prevailing party,rather than limiting recovery of attorneys fees to the city if it prevails.the ordi
