around on december,the officers arrived at the home of charles and rita barnard rita to execute an arrest warrant.the warrant called for the arrest of david barnard david,charles brother,who was staying with charles and rita.
upon arrival at the barnard residence,the officers knocked on the door,announced themselves as police officers,and demanded entry.charles opened the door and came out on the landing.the officers immediately confronted him.all of the officers had their weapons drawn,and officer clark had his weapon pointed at charles.at trial,charles testified that the officers appeared agitated,and that they were shaking,they screaming,yelling at me,hey,motherfucker,put your hands up,put your fucking hands up.charles put up his hands.
the officers asked charles to identify himself.charles told the officers that his driver license was in his bedroom,and asked the officers to explain the purpose of their visit.the officers explained that they had a warrant to arrest david.charles told the officers that david is his brother,and that he was asleep inside the house.the officers ordered charles to turn around and put his fucking hands on the wall.again,charles complied.
standing behind charles,officer theobald seized charles right arm and handcuffed his right wrist.before theobald could handcuff charles other arm,however,theobald tripped on a flower pot that was on the barnards landing.theobald fell backward,still holding onto the handcuffs that were attached to charles right wrist.officer radmanovich,who had been standing to charles left,grabbed for charles left free arm as charles was being pulled down by theobald,but radmamovich tripped over one of charles legs,and all three men came crashing down radmanovich on top of charles,and charles on top of theobald.
officer clark then joined the fracas.clark came over to charles,who was still lying on top of theobald,and put charles in a chokehold.clark then tried to lift charles up by his neck.theobald,however,still had hold of the handcuff around charles right wrist.the other officers yelled at theobald to release the cuff,which he did.still holding charles by the neck,officer clark then lifted charles even higher off the ground and spun charles around so that he was on his hands and knees with officer clark straddling his back.charles testified that at some point during this time,his legs went numb.
clark kept charles in a chokehold as he rode charles to the floor.while clark was sitting on charles back restraining him in a chokehold,officers theobald and radmanovich ordered charles to give them his motherfucking arms.with clark on top of him,however,charles could not comply with the officers order.officer theobald then instructed clark to use his chemical agent,pepper spray to gain charles compliance.while still sitting on charles back,officer clark released the chokehold and sprayed pepper spray into charles face.clark then dropped his spray canister next to charles.one of the officers immediately picked up the can and charles for a second time.
soon thereafter,officer clark got off of charles back,and the other officers handcuffed charles arms behind him.both officers radmanovich and theobald then dug one of their knees into charles back officer radmanovich knee pressed near charles neck and shoulders,and officer theobald pressed into charles lower back.
at this point,rita came to the front door to investigate the disturbance.officer clark ordered her to put your fucking hands up,and get on the fucking wall.clark then asked rita to identify herself.rita identified herself as charles wife.
finally,david came to the front of the house.officer radmanovich got off of charles in order to secure david.meanwhile,officer theobald slid his knee up charles back towards his neck.for the next few minutes,as officers clark and radmanovich secured the scene,theobald kept his knee pressed firmly into the back of charles neck and shoulders charles repeatedly asked theobald to get off of his neck,and told theobald that he was in considerable pain.but theobald refused to relent.eventually,after the other officers had secured david in the back of a police car,theobald released his knee from the back of charles neck.charles was taken to clark county detention center,where he was held for three days on charges of battery on a police officer,resisting an officer,and obstructing a public officer
