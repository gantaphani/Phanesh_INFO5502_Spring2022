introduction 
nearly ten years ago,appellant u haul of california uhc sued respondent leigh robinson,one of uhc independent dealers,for breach of contract and unfair competition after he terminated their contract and began renting budget trucks from what was formerly a uhc dealership robinson i.uhc alleged a covenant not to compete in the uhc dealer contract prohibited robinson from offering the products of uhc competitors while a yellow pages ad,running at uhc expense,was still promoting robinson business as a u haul dealership.robinson filed a seeking to avoid enforcement of the covenant not to compete by,among other things,seeking a judicial declaration that it was void due to fraud in the inducement 
after uhc lost its request for a preliminary injunction and dismissed its complaint,robinson filed a separate action alleging malicious prosecution by uhc in the prior lawsuit and violation by u haul of business and professions code section,et,also known as the unfair competition law ucl robinson ii.he based his ucl cause of action on uhc inclusion of the covenant not to compete in its dealer contracts,which he alleged was illegal,and its aggressive enforcement of that provision through litigation and threats of litigation.a jury awarded robinson more than in compensatory damages for malicious prosecution.the trial court later issued a permanent injunction prohibiting u haul from initiating or threatening to initiate judicial proceedings to enforce the noncompetition covenant in california.it awarded robinson more than in attorney fees as a private attorney general on his ucl cause of action.
in their consolidated appeals from robinson ii,the u haul defendants argue the trial court committed reversible error in issuing a permanent injunction because uhc had voluntarily abandoned enforcement of the covenant not to compete in california,and the court abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees to robinson as a private attorney general because robinson request for fees was.we conclude the injunction was properly entered and the court did not abuse its discretion in allowing robinson to file a late motion for attorney fees.we therefore affirm the judgment and the award of fees.
ii.factual and procedural background 
a.the relationship between the parties 
in,robinson purchased downtown self storage,a business in fairfield,california.on august,he signed a standard form dealer contract with uhc and renewed the contract three years later.under the dealer contract,uhc and robinson agreed that he would rent u haul vehicles and equipment at his storage facility and they would share the rental income.uhc also agreed to promote and advertise robinson storage business as a u haul rental location,including yellow pages advertisements using the u haul trademark.
uhc standard dealer contract included a noncompetition covenant requiring robinson to refrain from competing with uhc by representing u haul competitors while the yellow pages ad remained in print dealer warrants,covenants and agrees that dealer shall not represent or render any service either on its own behalf or in any capacity for the duration of the or telephone directory listing s for the dealer location.an addendum to the contract extended the noncompetition covenant for another year after expiration of the advertising,which could leave a dealer unable to rent competitors trucks for two years or more.covenants not to compete are,with limited exceptions,illegal under california law,et see edwards arthur andersen llp cal th.
between and,uhc advertised downtown self storage in the fairfield and vacaville area yellow pages as a place where consumers could find u haul rental vehicles and equipment.uhc paid for the dealer ads on an annual basis,placing the orders several months before the directory listings were published.
on september,a month after uhc had renewed the annual yellow pages advertising and after it was too late to cancel the ads,robinson sent a letter to uhc terminating their dealer contract.a few days later,robinson opened a budget rental truck dealership at downtown self storage.uhc responded by writing to robinson,warning him not to compete with uhc while the yellow pages ad was running.in the letter uhc said it was the policy of u haul to aggressively protect its legitimate business interests by seeking to enforce the provisions of the dealer contract,and that it would,without hesitation,consider any and all remedies available to it at law and in equity.
b.the proceedings in robinson i 
in december,uhc filed its complaint in robinson i in solano county superior court against robinson in docket no.uhc asserted causes of action for unfair competition,breach of contract,and specific performance.uhc lawsuit alleged that robinson was impermissibly offering budget trucks for rent at the same time that uhc yellow pages ad identified robinson business as a u haul dealership.in addition to damages,restitution,an accounting,attorney fees and costs,uhc sought preliminary and permanent injunctions requiring robinson to discontinue his relationship with budget and to refrain from entering into business with any other competitor of uhc until a year after the yellow pages ads expired.
robinson filed a for declaratory relief and breach of contract.he alleged uhc had breached the dealer contract in various material ways,relieving him of the obligation to comply with the covenant not to compete.he further alleged the covenant not to compete was void based on fraud in the inducement,and he sought a judicial declaration to that effect.
in june,uhc filed a motion for a preliminary injunction,and robinson opposed it,primarily based on the theory that the noncompetition covenant was void under section.the court denied uhc its requested preliminary injunction.approximately three weeks later,uhc dismissed its complaint in robinson i.according to a declaration by robinson lawyer,uhc dismissed its complaint in an effort to avoid having to pay robinson attorney fees.in,uhc filed a motion for summary judgment on robinson,together with the supporting declaration of jeff singleton a uhc management level employee.singleton stated under oath that uhc had dismissed its complaint against robinson and would not or reinitiate any proceedings against downtown self storage seeking to enforce the noncompetition provisions.uhc motion for summary judgment argued that the were therefore moot.
robinson dismissed his cause of action for breach of contract,but maintained his action for declaratory relief.two weeks after uhc filed its summary judgment motion,he filed a motion for summary judgment on his declaratory relief cause of action,asking the court to declare uhc noncompetition covenant void.as the court would later observe,robinson had by that time developed the argument that uhc had a pattern of threatening to sue,filing lawsuit s,against former dealers with identical noncompetition covenants,with no evidence or reasonable expectation of use of trade secrets by these former dealers,that would legally justify attempted enforcement of the covenants.robinson sought declaratory relief despite uhc claim that the dispute was moot because,robinson argued,uhc wrongdoing was capable of repetition,yet evading review.
in february,the trial court judge paul beeman in robinson i denied robinson motion for summary judgment on his declaratory relief cause of action in part because it was moot in light of the fact that uhc had waived enforcement of the noncompetition clause against robinson.as for robinson contention that uhc misconduct was capable of repetition,yet evading review,the court ruled that robinson had failed to produce sufficient admissible evidence that u haul had,or currently has,cases against other dealers pending in which u haul attempted or is attempting to enforce covenants without a reasonable expectation that the dealer used or is using its trade secrets.
uhc motion for summary judgment remained pending at that time,as robinson was seeking to reopen discovery to locate additional litigation between uhc and its dealers.robinson claimed he had found through his own investigation a number of lawsuits against dealers that uhc had failed to disclose in discovery.robinson was granted limited additional discovery on that basis in may.uhc summary judgment motion in robinson i was never ruled upon because robinson ultimately dismissed his for declaratory relief before there was a ruling.uhc unsuccessfully sought recovery of attorney fees in robinson i,with the court determining in may that uhc was not the prevailing party.
c.the trial in robinson ii 
on june,while robinson i was still pending,robinson filed robinson ii as a class action in docket no.he alleged causes of action against the u haul defendants for malicious prosecution and violation of the ucl.through his ucl claim,robinson sought to permanently enjoin the u haul defendants from including the covenant not to compete in future u haul dealer contracts in california,to require them to notify their current dealers that the covenant was void and unenforceable,and to order them to dismiss any action in any court in california through which they sought to enforce the covenant.
in august,the court tried the malicious prosecution cause of action in robinson ii together with the ucl cause of action before a jury,with the trial structured so that the jury would decide only the malicious prosecution action,while the court would decide the ucl claim.see hodge superior court th,no jury trial on ucl claims.at the conclusion of the trial,the court determined as a matter of law that the noncompetition covenant was illegal in california and that u haul knew this at the time it inserted the noncompetition clause into its dealer contracts.the judge said first off,the clause is void and unenforceable as a matter of law.section was the law predated these events herein by many,many years.their only reason to put a void contract clause in a contract is to mislead people.u haul knew when it put that in its contract that section of the business and professions c ode was in existence.that statute was clear.why would you possibly put something in a contract where the law says it void you do that so you can cause somebody to think that that clause is,in fact,valid when it is.so it is void and unenforceable as a matter of law.u haul does not challenge this ruling on appeal.
throughout both robinson i and the trial in robinson ii,uhc attempted to defend its noncompetition covenant,claiming robinson had misappropriated uhc trade name and trade secrets.see muggill reuben donnelley cal d,metro traffic control,shadow traffic network th.on august,the jury found,among other things,that uhc did not reasonably believe robinson was misusing trade secrets or confidential information when it filed robinson i and that u haul did not reasonably believe robinson renting budget trucks would confuse its customers while the yellow pages ad was running.the jury awarded robinson compensatory damages of on his malicious prosecution claim,but awarded no punitive damages,and the court entered judgment thereon.
in september and october,the parties submitted briefing and additional supporting documentation on robinson ucl cause of action.robinson argued he was entitled to judgment on that claim,asked the court to grant an injunction,and requested attorney fees.robinson introduced into evidence an order of the federal trade commission ftc dated in that prohibited uhi and its subsidiaries from initiating or participating in any judicial or administrative proceeding in which its primary purpose was to harass or injure any competitor or potential competitor.robinson also presented evidence of four lawsuits that had been filed in california by uhc between and against its former dealers in which it attempted to enforce the noncompetition covenant.
on october,uhc filed a motion for judgment on the ucl cause of action,arguing an injunction was unauthorized because robinson lacked standing under the ucl and such claims were in any case moot because uhc had abandoned all attempts to enforce the noncompetition covenant in california.in support of its position,uhc filed the declaration of kristine campbell counsel for uhc attesting in,uhc modified its dealer contracts to make the noncompetition clause void where prohibited.she added,since the dismissal of robinson i,uhc has not attempted to enforce the noncompetition clause in california and currently has no pending cases seeking enforcement of the noncompetition clause in california.and finally,since,uhc corporate policy has been,and continues to be,that it will neither threaten nor bring any action against its independent dealers to enforce the covenant not to compete contained in the dealer contract.uhc has advised its dealers of this policy.robinson attorneys,in fact,were able to turn up anecdotal evidence from several dealers who claimed they had not been so notified.
on january,judge harry kinnicutt filed his order after hearing on plaintiff motions.the judge found in favor of robinson on his ucl claim but limited relief to issuance of a permanent injunction against uhaul prohibiting it from instituting,or threatening to institute,judicial proceedings to enforce against any former or current dealers the covenant in its dealer contracts.judge kinnicutt ruled robinson ucl claim was not moot because it presented an issue of broad public interest that was likely to recur.although the court did not expressly rule that robinson met the standing requirements of section,it implicitly rejected u haul argument that he did not.
on january,the court entered its final judgment in favor of robinson on both the malicious prosecution and ucl claims,and the clerk served notice of entry on january.although robinson was awarded the damages found by the jury in the malicious prosecution cause of action,the only remedy provided under the ucl was the injunction described above.in the final judgment the court ordered that robinson shall also recover attorneys fees against u haul on the ucl claim,but the court left blank spaces where the amounts of such fees were apparently intended to be designated.on march,the u haul defendants timely appealed from the judgment.
after further proceedings,which we shall discuss in section,post,on may,the court found,under code of civil procedure section section,robinson was entitled to an award of in attorney fees as a private attorney general.u haul timely appealed from the trial court order granting robinson motion for attorney fees.on august,this court ordered the two appeals consolidated at the parties request.
iii.discussion 
permanent injunction precluding uhc from enforcing covenant 
uhc contends the court erred in issuing a permanent injunction because there was no evidence supporting a continuing violation by uhc,so as to justify an injunction robinson lacked standing robinson ucl claim did not,in fact,present an issue of broad public interest the denial of robinson motion for summary judgment as moot in robinson i operated through collateral estoppel to bar the issuance of a permanent injunction in robinson ii and the court erroneously excluded the testimony of one of its witnesses who would have testified that uhc had stopped enforcing the covenant not to compete in california.
there was substantial evidence supporting the court factual findings,and issuance of the injunction was not an abuse of discretion.
the grant or denial of a permanent injunction rests within the trial court sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of a clear abuse of discretion.citation.the exercise of discretion must be supported by the evidence and,to the extent the trial court had to review the evidence to resolve disputed factual issues,and draw inferences from the presented facts,we review such factual findings under a substantial evidence standard.salazar matejcek th.here,there is a dispute about the facts,including whether uhc claim to have abandoned its past practices was made in good faith.we approach such issues with deference.
the trial court summarized its reasons for issuing the injunction as follows uhaul apparently had followed a policy for years of threatening to enforce,and instituting proceedings to enforce,those covenants.in late,faced with robinson in the first case,uhaul carved out an exception for robinson alone although uhaul claims,and robinson has no evidence to the contrary,that uhaul has not sued any other former dealers since bringing the first case against robinson.then,in,after robinson in had filed this second case,uhaul modified its covenant,but only to state that it was void where prohibited.uhaul continued up until trial in early to claim as a defense to this action that the covenant was enforceable under california law.uhaul now in through a conclusory declaration of its counsel claims that it has told its california dealers that the covenant will not be enforced against them,but provided no copy of mass letter sent to those dealers,or record of other transmissions of this kind of binding reassurance.the court continued absent clear evidence that uhaul has confirmed to its california dealers that it will not be enforced,the disclaimer of void where prohibited does not provide sufficient reassurance to the court that this unenforceable covenant will not have some effect detrimental to california dealers or their customers.
one of the central legal questions in this case is whether a party to a lawsuit can avoid having a permanent injunction issued against it by voluntarily undertaking to do what the injunction would require.there is case authority saying an injunction may be denied on that basis.nelson pearson ford th,madrid perot systems th,midpeninsula citizens for fair housing westwood investors d,injunction would serve no purpose where the challenged policy was withdrawn nearly four years ago,and nothing in the record indicates any intention to reinstate it.but simply because a request for permanent injunctive relief may be denied based on voluntary submission to its terms does not mean such a request must be denied on that basis.u haul nevertheless claims there was no evidence before the trial court warranting an injunction.nelson held that a party seeking an injunction must present actual evidence that there is a realistic prospect that the party enjoined intends to engage in the prohibited activity.nelson,supra,at.here,the evidence of u haul past practice,coupled with evidence of the it took in lieu of eliminating altogether the noncompetition covenant in its california contracts,amounted to substantial evidence to support any factual findings necessary to or implicit in the issuance of the injunction.
first,there is no rule that a party discontinuance of illegal behavior makes injunctive relief against him or her unavailable.while voluntary cessation of conduct may be a factor in a court exercise of its equitable jurisdiction to issue an injunction,it is not determinative people ex rel.feuer superior court cahuenga the spot th.similarly,marin county bd.of realtors,palsson cal d,palsson held t he voluntary discontinuance of alleged illegal practices does not remove the pending charges of illegality from the sphere of judicial power or relieve the court of the duty of determining the validity of such charges where by the mere volition of a party the challenged practices may be resumed.citation.and of course,there is the fundamental question whether a defendant discontinuance of a ucl violation was implemented in good faith.people national association of realtors d,where the injunction is sought solely to prevent recurrence of proscribed conduct which has,in good faith been discontinued,there is no equitable reason for an injunction italics added.where,as here,a company has not taken action to bind itself legally to a future,there may be reason to doubt the bona fides of its newly established policy.
second,uhc lawsuit against robinson was not an isolated one.based on the court finding that u haul knew when it inserted the noncompetition covenant into the contract that the clause was illegal in california it appears uhc had acted in knowing violation of the law over a period of many years.uhc own letter to robinson in october said the company had a policy of aggressively protect ing its legitimate business interests by seeking to enforce the provisions.this statement was borne out by robinson evidence of other lawsuits uhc had filed against its dealers over a period of ten years before uhc sued robinson.evidence of such an ingrained,knowingly illegal corporate practice provides support for a finding of likely repetition in the future.
third,even when uhc revised its standard dealer contract in,it did not purge the offending covenant from its california contracts.the court explicitly found that inserting the words void where prohibited into the language of the dealer contract was insufficient to solve the problem.it also found insufficient evidence of notification of current dealers to support a finding that uhc had corrected its anticompetitive behavior.
fourth,uhc change in policy came only after it lost its motion for a preliminary injunction in robinson i and after the complaint in robinson ii was filed.and despite the purported change in policy in,uhc continued to insist at trial in robinson ii that its noncompetition covenant was valid and enforceable.it thus changed its policy only when threatened with an injunction.on this record,the trial court found that uhc promise to refrain from further enforcement of its noncompetition covenant could not be relied upon as the sole means of ensuring a change of practice in the future.
as we read judge kinnicutt orders and judgment,the injunction was a response in part to u haul resistance to amending its policies,and its persistence in pursuing its anticompetitive litigation strategy over the years,up to the time it initiated the lawsuit in robinson i and even throughout the trial in robinson ii.the injunction eliminates a practice that is now shrouded in uncertainty and plagued by a troubling past.we have no reason to overturn the trial court decision to issue an injunction,as it did not result from lack of evidence,legal error,or an abuse of discretion.
robinson had standing 
uhc claims robinson lacks standing to seek an injunction against u haul under the ucl because he can not show he personally suffered injury as a result of u haul alleged unfair competition,citing section and amalgamated transit union,local,afl cio superior court cal th,amalgamated transit.section vests in the attorney general,county district attorneys,and city attorneys authority to seek injunctive relief under the ucl,but it also grants such authority to any person who has suffered injury in fact and has lost money or property as a result of the unfair competition.see aron u haul of california th,customer forced to pay unfair refueling costs upon return of rental truck had standing under ucl.
amalgamated transit,supra,cal th dealt with the changes in standing requirements ushered in by voter initiative in under proposition id.at.that case involved a labor union that attempted to assert a ucl cause of action against an employer to enjoin alleged labor law violations and obtain other relief both on behalf of,and as assignee of,its members.id.at.the supreme court held the union did not have standing because it had not suffered injury in fact under section.id.at.amalgamated transit explained the background of the changes wrought by proposition.see fn,ante.suffice it to say,the mere likelihood of harm to members of the public is not sufficient to confer standing on any individual.pfizer superior court th.but if a plaintiff has suffered particularized harm as a result of the defendant anticompetitive conduct,standing has been upheld.see medrazo honda of north hollywood th.
we agree with robinson that he has standing in this action because he was sued by uhc in robinson i to enforce the covenant not to compete and incurred attorney fees and costs as a result.the alleged unfair business practice in this case was not just the inclusion of the noncompetition covenant in uhc dealer contracts,but the strategic use of litigation and threatened litigation to achieve its anticompetitive purpose.robinson successfully showed that robinson i was part of a pattern of business activity in which uhc sought to intimidate its former dealers from setting up business relations with uhc competitors.barquis merchants collection cal d,collection agency pattern of intentionally commencing litigation in improper venues for the purpose of impairing its adversaries ability to defend such suits was an unlawful business practice under predecessor to.when robinson refused to break ties with budget,he was sued and thereby suffered an injury in fact and lost money by way of court costs and attorney fees.this is not a case where an unscrupulous attorney teamed up with a stick figure plaintiff to shake down a completely unrelated business.see fn,ante.as one of the victims of uhc anticompetitive business practice,robinson has standing.
the court finding of a broad public interest was supported by the record and was not an abuse of discretion 
a major thrust of uhc briefing is that this litigation is moot.uhc acknowledges,however,that i f a pending case poses an issue of broad public interest that is likely to recur,the court may exercise an inherent discretion to resolve that issue even though an event occurring during its pendency would normally render the matter moot.johnson hamilton cal d.uhc contends the trial court erred in finding a broad public interest at stake in this case.application group hunter group th,application group declaratory relief held properly granted,even though the individual plaintiff case was moot.
the parties have cited no cases articulating the standard of review on the broad public interest determination,and we have located none.issues of justiciability,such as mootness,are generally reviewed de novo.panoche energy center,llc pacific gas electric th,ripeness meredith th,mootness reviewed de novo where facts are undisputed gilb chiang th,justiciability biodiversity legal found.badgley cir,appellate courts review mootness,a question of law,de novo.but since the broad public interest exception to mootness is an exercise of the court inherent discretion johnson hamilton,supra,cal d at,the determination arguably could be subject to an abuse of discretion standard of review.see application group,supra,th at whether an action is justiciable is a matter entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court.we need not decide which standard applies,as we would reach the same result under any standard.
uhc claims there is no california case finding a noncompetition clause to present an issue of broad public concern.that ignores palsson,upon which the court below relied.while palsson did not deal directly with a covenant not to compete,its holding is pertinent here because it dealt with a private entity curtailment of employment opportunities through policies adopted in its bylaws.
in palsson,an association of real estate brokers and sales associates,to which of brokers in the county belonged,denied palsson application for membership and hence his access to the multiple listing service mls because he was primarily employed as an airline engineer and sold real estate only.palsson,supra,cal d at.under the association bylaws,a salesman had to be primarily engaged in the real estate business in order to join,and members were prohibited from employing or sharing office space with anyone denied membership.ibid.thus,a salesman faced not only denial of access to the mls,but also denial of employment with percent of the residential brokers in marin county.id.at.when palsson contested the board decision denying him membership,the board sought a declaratory judgment that its bylaws were valid.id.at.
the central question in the case was whether the board primarily engaged rule and related limitation on access to the mls violated the cartwright act.before reaching that question,the california supreme court addressed a number of preliminary issues,including mootness.palsson,supra,cal d at.the real estate association argued the action was moot because it had changed its bylaws,allowing brokers to become associate members.id.at.despite this fact,the supreme court,noting on the merits that the practices of the board pose serious anticompetitive dangers both to licensed real estate salesmen and brokers and to consumers id.at,and then ultimately finding those practices to violate the cartwright act,held the broad public interest exception to mootness applied because t he issues raised are of substantial interest not only to real estate boards and but also to all trade associations and their members,and to consumers in general id.at.
palsson also mentioned that the importance of the questions involved was partly shown by the appearance of the california association of realtors,the attorney general,and the district attorney of los angeles county through amicus briefs,and because there were a number of similar cases pending in various trial courts.palsson,supra,cal d at.while those may have been factors influencing the court decision in palsson,we do not think the applicability of the broad public interest exception can legitimately turn on whether amicus briefs were filed,whether any other parties intervened in the action,or whether there were currently pending actions elsewhere in the state asserting similar positions.the presence of such factors may provide support for a finding of broad public interest,but their absence does not prove the opposite.we have already discussed the trial court reasons for issuing the injunction in this case,which were sound.
as a secondary argument,uhc contends that the small number of independent dealers in california is too limited a group to qualify under the broad public interest exception.according to robinson,uhc has approximately california dealers,and uhc offers no contrary evidence.we are aware of no rule establishing how many members of the public must be affected in order for the broad public interest exception to apply.to our way of thinking,a population of dealers,together with past dealers and prospective dealers,makes up a sufficient segment of the public to qualify as a broad swath.we hasten to add,however,that here the court found the anticompetitive impact of the covenant spread to more than just dealers.the trial court found the threat to competition extended to the dealers customers and to the truck rental market in general.uhc enforcement and threats to enforce the covenant in california negatively affected its competitors by denying them rental outlets for their trucks and hurt the rental market customers by limiting their access to rental trucks and restricting price competition.for the protection of uhc dealers,past dealers and prospective dealers,uhc competitors,and the members of the general public who participate in the truck and trailer rental market,an injunction was warranted.
collateral estoppel 
uhc next contends judge beeman ruling in february in robinson i denying robinson motion for summary judgment on mootness grounds should have operated to collaterally estop robinson from obtaining an injunction against uhc in robinson ii.whether collateral estoppel applies is a question of law reviewed de novo.duarte state teachers retirement system th,fn.at its most fundamental,i ssue preclusion,or collateral estoppel,precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.city of oakland oakland police fire retirement system th.id.at.collateral estoppel applies only if all of the following conditions are met the issue is identical to an issue decided in a prior proceeding the issue was actually litigated the issue was necessarily decided the decision in the prior proceeding is final and on the merits and the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party to the prior proceeding or in privity with a party to the prior proceeding.zevnik superior court th,zevnik.
based on those requirements,collateral estoppel does not apply here.robinson did not allege a ucl violation in robinson i,and judge beeman did not rule that any issues underlying a ucl action namely,whether uhc noncompetition covenant amounted to an unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice would be mooted,either by the waiver of all claims against robinson in singleton declaration,or by the later and broader disavowal of past practices throughout california,as reflected in campbell declaration.the issues raised by robinson ucl claim were different from those raised by his request for declaratory relief in robinson i,where robinson alleged fraud in the inducement as a basis for declaring the noncompetition covenant void.for this reason alone we may reject uhc collateral estoppel theory.because the issues in the two cases were different factually and legally,and the occurrences and declarations which purportedly mooted the issues were different in scope,application of the mootness doctrine in the two cases did not involve identical issues and need not be resolved uniformly.the campbell declaration was not even in existence at the time judge beeman made his mootness ruling in robinson i,and hence he could not have determined that campbell declaration mooted the issue of the legality of uhc noncompetition clause under the ucl.nevertheless,uhc theorizes that robinson ucl claim in robinson ii was moot when judge kinnicutt issued the injunction because judge beeman determined five years earlier that his declaratory relief cause of action was moot in robinson 
as noted above,one of the elements of collateral estoppel is that the decision in question be on the merits.zevnik,supra,th at.a decision that a matter is moot is not a decision on the merits.see paul milk depots,cal d.quite the opposite,it is a decision that the merits need not be reached because there is no longer a live controversy.eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group to,to.perhaps one might characterize judge beeman ruling as a decision on the merits of mootness,but it is more accurately characterized as a decision not to decide anything.witkin describes moot cases as t hose in which an actual controversy did exist but,by the passage of time or a change in circumstances,ceased to exist.witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions.the preferred disposition of a moot case on appeal is either to dismiss the appeal or to reverse the moot judgment and remand with instructions to the trial court to dismiss the action as moot,so as to avoid having the underlying judgment become subject to res judicata.see paul,supra,at coalition for a sustainable future in yucaipa city of yucaipa th.because the mootness decision,by definition,is not a determination on the merits,the mootness determination in robinson i was not binding on the court in robinson ii.
indeed,mootness is highly situational and not readily compatible with the concept of estoppel.it is an aspect of justiciability that must be decided independently by each court with respect to the facts and legal issues before it.accordingly,we conclude that collateral estoppel does not prohibit the injunction entered here.application group,supra,th at,affirmed declaratory relief in favor of corporate plaintiff despite mootness of individual plaintiff claims in re stinnette d,when a case presents questions of general public interest that are likely to recur,the court may render a decision on the merits even though the issue has become moot as to the particular litigant involved.
exclusion of savelle jefferson testimony 
finally,uhc contends the trial court erroneously excluded evidence that it had voluntarily ceased enforcing its covenant not to sue in california.during the trial,uhc attempted to introduce testimony of savelle jefferson,an area field manager,in an effort to show that uhc had changed the language in its dealer contracts and had advised its dealers in california that it would not enforce the restrictive covenant the trial court sustained objections to the questions,ruling such testimony was irrelevant,which uhc cites as error.employing an abuse of discretion standard of review shaw county of santa cruz th,we do not agree the court erred.
the relevance of jefferson evidence was slim at best.as explained above,evidence of discontinuance of an illegal practice does not compel the court to reject a request for an injunction.it is only one factor to consider,and it bears little weight if its credibility is doubtful.even if marginally relevant,the court could have validly considered jefferson evidence on this point to be of such minimal significance that it could reasonably have been excluded under evidence code section.a party failure to refer specifically to section as a basis for objection does not preclude a trial court from exercising its discretion sua sponte to exclude proffered evidence on that ground.people roscoe d,fn.people jackson d.
more important,assuming for argument sake the court should have allowed the testimony,we would find the error harmless.people watson cal d,easterby clark th,watson standard applies to evidentiary errors.before ruling on the attorney fees issue,the court received the declaration of campbell,which duplicated in substance the evidence uhc had attempted to elicit from jefferson.the court referred to campbell declaration in its order filed january.thus,it considered but rejected uhc argument and evidence that the abandonment of its attempts to enforce the noncompetition clause made injunctive relief unavailable.jefferson testimony would have been cumulative,and it is unlikely anything he said would have made a difference to judge kinnicutt.the exclusion of jefferson testimony was at worst harmless error.
robinson late filing of his motion for attorney fees 
finally,the u haul defendants claim they can not be ordered to pay robinson attorney fees because he did not follow the proper procedure in seeking his fees award.again,we disagree and affirm the trial court order.
proceedings related to attorney fees 
on september,before judgment was entered,robinson filed a motion for contractual attorney fees under the dealer contract in connection with his malicious prosecution cause of action.he also claimed in briefing that he was entitled to attorney fees as a private attorney general under section the total amount he claimed in fees for both causes of action was.
the trial court issued a tentative ruling on october,denying robinson request for attorney fees because the jury verdict in his favor on the malicious prosecution cause of action was interlocutory,as judgment had not yet been entered on the ucl claim.with regard to robinson request for attorney fees under section,the tentative ruling stated if the court ruling awards plaintiff the right to attorneys fees as to the unfair business practices ucl cause of action,the determination of the amount of those fees is deferred to proper and timely later filing of a motion for attorneys fees,following issuance of the court final judgment.as noted above,the court included in its judgment that robinson shall also recover attorneys fees on the ucl claim,but did not indicate an amount of any award.
on february,after judgment was entered,robinson filed a memorandum of costs seeking,among other costs,in attorney fees.uhc responded with a motion to tax costs,arguing that robinson could not seek attorney fees by way of a memorandum of costs,but instead was required to file a noticed motion.at that time,robinson still had time to file a motion for attorney fees within the days permitted under rule b motion must be brought within time allowed for filing notice of appeal but instead robinson simply opposed the motion to tax costs,arguing that seeking his attorney fees by a memorandum of costs was appropriate because there was no debate he was entitled to attorney fees after the final judgment ordered such recovery.
on april,a hearing was held on uhc motion to tax costs.at the hearing,apparently in response to the court tentative ruling,robinson counsel abandoned his argument that a motion was not required,but argued he was allowed to file such a motion under section at any time after entry of final judgment.there is no express time limit,he told the court,relying primarily on angelheart city of burbank d.the next day,uhc submitted a letter brief to the trial court in which it contended that rule required robinson to file his motion for attorney fees within days after the court clerk service of notice of entry of the final judgment,and the deadline had already passed.uhc argued that angelheart had been over
