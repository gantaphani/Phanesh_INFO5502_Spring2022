this is an appeal from a district court order awarding appellees attorney fees under against plaintiff attorney,pro se appellant john gage.gage argues that the award was inconsistent with the district court denial of fees under and.the award violated due process applies only to the multiplication of proceedings and not to the initiation of proceedings was inapplicable to punish his numerous requests for extensions of time and appellees motion for fees violated various procedural rules.finding partial merit in gage third argument,we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
lawrence steinert retained attorney gage to sue james winn and the winn group,collectively,winn.gage filed a complaint in federal court in december,and served it in april.he alleged that winn offered to represent steinert in finding work as an actuary.steinert apparently accepted and was notified of a job opportunity with scruggs actuarial service,located in texas.during an interview with scruggs,steinert was allegedly induced through fraud to provide scruggs with fifteen hours of actuarial services as part of a conspiracy between scruggs and winn to obtain slave labor.at.steinert signed a secrecy agreement,but he refused to sign an employment contract because it contained a provision requiring that he reimburse scruggs for any recruiting fee if the employment relationship ended within three years.id.although steinert never became a scruggs employee,he filed a wage claim with the texas work force commission for the work performed during the interview.scruggs later sued steinert in state court,claiming a breach of the secrecy agreement.
based on these allegations,gage formulated nine claims for relief against winn violation of the kansas private employment agency act,kpea id.at violation of the texas personnel employment services act,tpea id.at breach of fiduciary duties breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing negligence exposing plaintiff to litigation with scruggs,id.at fraud conspiracy and violation of and regarding,among other things,plaintiff right against involuntary servitude and peonage,id.at.
on april,winn answered and moved to dismiss the kpea claim,the fiduciary duty claim,the claim,the claim,the title claims,and a portion of the tpea claim.in response,gage embarked on a campaign,during which he requested nine extensions of time to file an opposition to winn motion to dismiss.the requests cited gage problems with support staff,computers,office equipment,and other problems too numerous to detail.at,as well as family illnesses,fatigue,personal doctor visits,responsibilities on other cases,the complexity of the instant case,attendance at a legal convention,and a camping trip with his son.gage also sought six extensions of time to file a motion for leave to amend or add parties,five extensions to make.a initial disclosures,four extensions to respond to a demand for documents,three extensions to provide medical,employment and tax releases,three extensions to identify authority for any attorney fee award,two extensions to serve a preliminary witness list,and two extensions to file a certificate of financial interest.winn counsel agreed to many of the extensions and the district court expressly granted most of them,citing good cause or excusable neglect,and sometimes both.most of the extension requests violated rule a of the united states district court rules for the district of kansas,as the requests were made after the previously extended deadlines 
but on october,winn counsel moved to dismiss for failure to prosecute.on october,the district court reviewed the litigation history and stated 
the court recognizes that some of plaintiff requested extensions,viewed in insolation,may have been properly based on time constrictions or excusable neglect.a review of the entire course of the litigation,however,shows a pattern of neglect which the court can not characterize as excusable.
at.nevertheless,the district court declined to dismiss the case,and instead gave gage hours to file any motion to parties and any opposition to winn april motion to dismiss,and provide initial disclosures and respond to winn production demand.but the court cautioned gage that it might order that plaintiff his counsel pay the costs and attorneys fees attributable to their default if gage failed to timely comply.at.
on october,gage filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint by adding four more claims against winn and adding scruggs as a defendant facing ten claims in the motion,gage revealed for the first time that the primary factors causing the delays in the case were his difficulties in obtaining a determination from steinert and his texas counsel regarding their intent to proceed against winn and scruggs in state court.at the district court denied leave to amend.
gage also filed a page opposition to winn april motion to dismiss.therein,gage conceded that his client claim failed because there was no state action.but gage devoted fourteen pages to arguing that winn and scruggs were liable under and specifically,regarding subsection,gage argued that winn and scruggs had conspired to sue scruggs employees and steinert in state court to keep present employees cowering,captive,and unable to mount any challenges to their status as peons based upon the debt bondage scruggs has put into effect through its employment contracts.at.regarding subsection,gage argued that winn and scruggs had conspired to violate steinert constitutional right against involuntary servitude and peonage,both of which are regarded as badges of slavery.id.at.
gage then embarked on another campaign.he untimely sought more time to oppose a motion to compel the execution of a medical release form.he resurrected his prior excuses and added that he had suffered two car accidents,litigat ed the dissolution of his earlier arrangement,id.at,experienced marital difficulties,and struggled with other problems too numerous and personal to mention,id.at.after his own suggested deadline expired,gage sought to extend the time even further,complaining of a total computer breakdown.id.at.even after the district court ordered gage to produce the executed release,gage failed to comply,prompting a motion to dismiss from winn.
gage also sought an extension in which to oppose a motion to compel the execution of an release form,describing at length his continuing and taxing time problems in maintaining his workload.id.at.and nearly one month after the scheduling order date for the close of discovery,gage moved to extend the deadlines for disclosing expert witnesses,propounding written discovery,and completing all discovery.he cited staffing problems and his recent diagnosis with adult attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder.id.at.gage also stated that he had telephoned winn counsel and offered to dismiss the case because steinert could not litigate in two different states,id.at,but that winn counsel responded by insisting in a letter that dismissal be conditioned on the payment of winn fees and costs.in the letter,dated january,winn counsel commented that the court is empowered to award attorneys fees under and rule,and that he would be seeking fees under those provisions.id.at.
on january,the district court granted in part and denied in part winn april motion to dismiss.the court dismissed steinert claims,observing that conspiracies motivated by economic animus are not actionable and that there were no allegations of discrimination similar to racial bias.also dismissed were steinert kpea,and claims,as well as a portion of steinert tpea claim.
on march,facing another motion to compel and his client scheduled deposition,gage moved to dismiss the case with prejudice,stating that steinert was unable to continue financially.the district court granted the motion,dismissed the case,and on august,entered judgment in winn favor.
on august,winn filed a motion for award of attorney fees and for discovery related thereto,citing and.a.at.on september,winn filed a document entitled suggestions in support of the motion,again citing and rule a,but adding as justifying a fee award against gage primarily for multiplying the proceedings by seeking numerous extensions of time,but also for asserting frivolous claims.at.winn asked the court to either require plaintiff his attorney to pay fees or allow him to depose steinert regarding the frivolity of his claims and to then supplement the suggestions.filed contemporaneously with the suggestions was a statement of consultation,indicating that winn counsel had informally tried to resolve the fee issue by letter on september and that gage did not respond.gage filed an opposition to the fees motion and suggestions,disputing the availability of fees.
on september,the district court granted winn request to depose steinert,but limited the scope to winn assertion of entitlement to attorney fees pursuant to,and under the exception to the american rule.at.the district court further ruled that winn fee request was mooted pending completion of the discovery,but that winn could resubmit the briefs after steinert deposition.id.gage unsuccessfully sought reconsideration or a protective order to minimize steinert expenses in traveling to the deposition.
during the deposition,which took place on april,steinert testified that he paid no placement fee to either winn or scruggs,stayed through the interview to be polite and because he thought that there was a job at the end of the rainbow.at,but never entered into employment with scruggs.afterward,winn resubmitted the fee request by filing an suggestions in support of defendants renewed motion on may.id.at.therein,winn again argued entitlement to attorney fees under primarily because gage multiplied the proceedings in this case unreasonably and vexatiously by seeking numerous extensions of time,id.at,but also because gage had assert ed frivolous claims,id.at.winn again asked the court to require plaintiff his attorney to pay fees.at.gage filed an opposition,again arguing against the imposition of fees.
on march,the district court ruled that an award of fees against gage was warranted under for two reasons.first,the court found that gage decision to move forward with the and claims when no clear legal basis supported them multiplied the proceedings in this case,resulted in an increase in the cost of the proceedings,and was unreasonable and vexatious.at.second,the court found that gage requested extensions multiplied the proceedings by approximately days,unreasonably and vexatiously increasing the costs of the proceedings.id.at.the court ordered winn counsel to account for the fees expended in defending against the title claims and responding to gage extension requests.gage unsuccessfully sought reconsideration.
winn counsel accounted for in fees.after reviewing winn counsel records and gage objections,the district court reduced the figure and sanctioned gage in august.gage appeals 
discussion 
any attorney who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs,expenses,and attorneys fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.
sanctions under are appropriate when an attorney acts recklessly or with indifference to the law.they may also be awarded when an attorney is cavalier or bent on misleading the court intentionally acts without a plausible basis or when the entire course of the proceedings was unwarranted.
dominion video satellite,echostar satellite,cir quotations and citations omitted alteration in original.we review a district court award of sanctions for an abuse of discretion.resolution trust dabney,cir.but we review de novo any statutory interpretation or other legal analysis underlying the district court decision concerning attorneys fees.aerotech,estes,cir.
section as an independent basis for sanctions 
gage first argues that the district court imposition of sanctions is incompatible with its rejection of sanctions under and.a.the court entire explanation for selecting over and rule a is contained in a single sentence having examined the three bases set out by winn in support of the request for attorneys fees,the parties arguments,and the relevant statutory and case law,the court finds that an award of attorneys fees in this case is appropriate only under.at.we reject gage argument.
section b allows fees to be awarded to the party who prevails on or against claims brought under civil rights statutes like and.but when a defendant prevails,he may recover an attorney fee only where the suit was vexatious,frivolous,or brought to harass or embarrass the defendant.hensley eckerhart,d.rule a,on the other hand,allows an attorney fee award as a term or condition of a dismissal sought by the plaintiff.charles wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,at ed.but if the dismissal is with prejudice,attorney fees may be imposed under rule a only in exceptional circumstances.aerotech,at.an example of such a circumstance is when a litigant makes a repeated practice of bringing claims and then dismissing them with prejudice after inflicting substantial litigation costs on the opposing party and the judicial system.id.
even if the district court selection of as the basis for sanctioning gage could be equated with an affirmative ruling that there was no merit to a or rule a sanction,such a ruling would not foreclose sanctions.there are significant differences between the three fee provisions that permit imposing a sanction while concurrently denying a or rule a sanction.for instance,is not available against attorneys,foster mydas,cir brown borough of chambersburg,cir see also roadway express,piper,d,whereas is available against only attorneys,maguire oil city of houston,cir.and although targets the vexatious and unreasonable multiplication of proceedings,a rule a sanction in a case dismissed with prejudice is reserved for the most exceptional of abuses,such as repeat filings and dismissals.accordingly,we conclude that operation in this case was not dependent upon the district court imposition of or rule a sanctions.
ii.due process 
gage next argues that he was sanctioned without due process because winn never filed a motion for fees under.gage points out that winn august motion for award of attorney fees and for discovery related thereto only mentioned and rule a.although winn september,and may,suggestions relied on,as well as and rule a,gage maintains that those memoranda were not motions.thus,he reasons,r eliance of the district court on suggestions alone,rather than a motion under,denied him due process of law.aplt.br.at.
we need not dwell on this argument too long.the basic requirements of due process with respect to the assessment of costs,expenses,or attorney fees are notice that such sanctions are being considered by the court and a subsequent opportunity to respond.dominion video,at quotation omitted.the precise procedural protections of due process vary,depending upon the circumstances,because due process is a flexible concept unrestricted by any rules.id.
gage knew as early as october,when the district court gave him hours to file any motion to parties and an opposition to winn motion to dismiss,that his conduct could lead to sanctions.winn counsel reiterated that point in his january letter,even citing.and although winn august motion for fees failed to cite,both of winn suggestions in support of the motion sought to establish gage liability under the statute.further,the district court ordered that steinert be deposed regarding,and gage attacked the statute applicability on several occasions.we conclude that winn failure to cite in the fees motion did not deny gage due process.
gage also contends he lacked notice that sanctions were being considered by the district court for filing frivolous claims.although most of winn argument concerned gage dilatory conduct,winn concluded each segment of the two suggestions by stating that gage should be required to bear the expense for assert ing frivolous claims,provid ing no information required by the rules and the court,delay ing the case,impos ing on winn substantial attorneys fees and expenses and then dismiss ing his claims.at emphasis added.we conclude that gage had notice regarding the full extent of his liabilit
