the company and broadspire services,broadspire appeal the district court entry of summary judgment,calculation of damages,and award of attorney fees and expenses in favor of theron oliver oliver sought benefits under long term disability plan,and brought suit after broadspire and denied his initial claim and subsequent appeals.we find that broadspire,as a claims administrator,was not the plan administrator,and accordingly,not a proper defendant.we also find that acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying oliver claim,no genuine issue of material fact remains for trial,and the district court therefore properly entered summary judgment in favor of oliver.we affirm the district court award of damages,and because the district court did not abuse its discretion,we affirm its award of attorney fees and expenses in favor of oliver.
background 
a.the benefit plan 
at issue in this case is the long term disability income plan of the company the plan,an employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of erisa.see.the plan document designates as the plan administrator.the plan document also contains a delegation by of some of its powers as plan administrator to the company long term disability income plan committee the committee.the plan document delegates to the committee primary responsibility for the administration of the plan,and all powers necessary to enable it to properly perform its duties,including the discretionary authority to determine the eligibility of participants to receive benefits and the amount of benefits to which any participant may be entitled under the plan,exh.f b,b.the plan also provides that the committee may delegate to the administrative services provider its discretionary authority to decide claims.id.b.broadspire is the administrative services provider.
under the plan,a claim for benefits involves an initial application,and,if the claimant is unsatisfied with the result of the initial application,two levels of appeals.pursuant to b of the plan,the committee delegated to broadspire responsibility for making initial determinations of claims for benefits under the plan,as well as responsibility for resolving appeals.the committee is responsible for deciding appeals,although in the committee delegated to two employees the delegates its function of reviewing final claims.
under the plan,a participant who suffers a disability,as that term is defined in the plan,will receive benefits,exh.the term disability has two definitions under the plan,one which applies during the first months following the date the disability is incurred,and one which applies after the first months.during the first months,a disability is defined as a physical or mental illness or injury that continuously disables the participant from performing his normal duties for his employer.id.this is known as the own occupation standard.after the first months,the plan defines a disability as a physical or mental illness or injury that continuously disables the participant from engaging in any occupation for wage or profit,for which he is reasonably qualified by training,education or experience.id.this definition is known as the any occupation standard.
oliver claim 
oliver is a former systems support specialist ii at,and a participant in the plan.the responsibilities of a systems support specialist ii involve providing administrative and technical support for voice mail system.most of oliver work was performed at a personal computer,although he was sometimes required to w alk to telephone switch rooms to do system backups and provide voice mail training to groups and individuals,exh.
in october,oliver was involved in an automobile accident.shortly after the accident,he began to complain of pain,stiff ness and ach es in his neck and upper back,and severe headaches,exh.at.oliver applied for and received weeks of short term disability benefits from under a separate benefit program that is not part of an plan.in april,after the short term disability benefits terminated,oliver timely applied for long term disability ltd benefits under the plan.because oliver application was filed during the first months following the date of his automobile accident,the own occupation standard applied.
in support of his claim for ltd benefits,oliver submitted statements from two attending physicians,and one physician who had examined oliver but did not consider herself an attending physician and declined to complete broadspire evaluation form regarding oliver prognosis and limitations.one of oliver attending physicians,scott arrowsmith,indicated that oliver suffered fibromyalgia of.id.at.on the line on broadspire form labeled objective findings,arrowsmith wrote p ositive emg for chronic illegible radiculopathy and cervical illegible unremarkable cervical mri.id.in response to a question asking him to list activities oliver should not do,arrowsmith wrote d oes not tolerate cervical motion or prolonged tolerance to driving.id.at.the form then asked arrowsmith to list activities your patient can not do.id.arrowsmith wrote can not lift over pounds,can not sit for over hour.id.under a section of the form asking the doctor to indicate level of impairment,arrowsmith checked a box labeled marked limitation of functional of sedentary work,but drew a question mark next to the check box.id.arrowsmith then completed a section of the form labled estimated physical abilities,and indicated that oliver could sit for no more than three hours per day,in short episodes,could stand no more than four hours per day,and could walk no more than three hours per day.id.at.in response to the question,c an patient now work,arrowsmith responded n ot when last seen on.id.at.
oliver other attending physician,james fugedy,diagnosed oliver with c hronic pain syndrome,headaches secondary to neck injury insomnia.id.at.on the form provided by broadspire,fugedy also wrote the patient continues to have serious,neck pain and right arm pain requiring narcotic analgesics and developing tolerance.can not function due to pain.id.at.fugedy also wrote oliver is incapacitated due to continuous headaches,neck pain and right arm pain,which no longer responds to medications.id.under the section of the form labeled estimated physical abilities,fugedy indicated that oliver could n ever lift,carry,squat,crawl,climb,or r each above shoulder level.id.he further indicated that oliver could not crouch,kneel,balance,p ush p ull,or d rive automobile.id.nor,according to fugedy,could oliver use his right hand for repetitive actions such as s imple g rasping,p ushing p ulling,or f ine m anipulating,or use his right hand and neck in the s tatic p osition,for frequent flexing,or for frequent rotating.id.in response to the question,can patient now work,fugedy wrote no.id.at.
on june,norman moskowitz conducted a peer review,on behalf of broadspire,of the evaluation forms submitted by oliver attending physicians.moskowitz did not examine oliver.moskowitz concluded,in relevant part 
t here is no objective evidence to determine any kind of disability in this person own specialty and job description.there is no evidence that a prolonged limited disability is documented.there are arbitrary checkpoints by a physician without any concrete objective evidence of any physical capacity limitations.there are no medicals to support any disability at this time.this is a medical certainty.
id.at.on june,broadspire sent oliver a letter denying his claim.after receiving broadspire denial of his claim,oliver filed a written appeal with broadspire.
on july,oliver began visiting husham mishu,a neurologist.mishu examined oliver,performed an emg and a nerve conduction test,prescribed oxycontin and celebrex,ordered an epidural injection with nerve root sleeve injection,and recommended that oliver strongly consider long term disability,exh.at.according to mishu,oliver emg revealed a active and chronic radiculopathy on the right.id.at.mishu also examined the results of oliver earlier mri,and found that it showed ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and a disk.id.
on august,mishu treated oliver with injections of lidocaine and celestone near his nerve roots in his spine.mishu examined oliver again on august.he noted that oliver had been taking milligrams of oxycontin twice daily,with an additional milligrams at night,and that oliver said that this has practically saved his life.id.at.mishu stated that he had treated oliver with an root injection,as well as a botox injection,which seemed to help,but that oliver still ha d a significant problem with his shoulder and spasms of his neck,shoulder,and posterior trunk muscles.id.
on august,oliver visited mishu again,and mishu wrote that while he believed oliver was feeling better overall,he still had a significant amount of breakthrough pain,and that he believed oliver needed physical therapy and further botox injections in his spine.id.at.mishu also noted that oliver physical examination today is essentially unchanged,and that he continued to have the same problems with his right arm and cervical spine.id.he observed that oliver is able to get around more,do some cleaning up at home,but once he starts to do these things,he then has more pain and has to go lie down.id.mishu increased oliver oxycontin prescription from milligrams twice daily to milligrams twice daily.id.
in support of his appeal of the initial denial of his ltd benefits claim,oliver submitted the medical records from his treatment by mishu,including mishu notes and the results of the emg and nerve conduction tests conducted by mishu.broadspire submitted oliver file to gerald goldberg for a peer review.goldberg did not examine oliver.goldberg began his report,dated september,by summarizing oliver symptoms as myofascial pain,chronic pain in chest,cervical pain,right shoulder pain and numbness in his right four fingers,pain and palpation of the right triceps emg examination reveals active and chronic radiculopathy on the right and mri showed ligamentum flavum hypertrophy and disk,exh.at.goldberg summarized the results of mishu treatment of oliver,and noted mishu conclusion that the emg test showed a right active and chronic radiculopathy.id.at.goldberg also noted mishu observation that even very minimal activity seemed to aggravate oliver pain.id.goldberg stated that arrowsmith report rated the patient as having a class restriction,indicating he could do sedentary work however,goldberg omitted from his report the fact that arrowsmith annotated the check box for class restriction with a question mark.id.
goldberg concluded his peer review by stating his belief that oliver could perform his job,based on documents that indicated oliver job was mostly done with the patient sitting and using the computer.id.he further stated that oliver history was far from typical,and that his reports of pain were not particularly in a radicular distribution.id.at.he characterized oliver prescription of milligrams of oxycontin twice daily as fairly strong narcotic doses,but concluded that the oxycontin would certainly make him much more functional.id.goldberg stated that the emg test did not support any radicular disturbance,but did not dispute mishu conclusion that the emg showed a chronic radiculopathy.id.goldberg concluded t he two attending physician statements that were obtained do not list any objective findings,and that therefore he could not support the long term disability claim from a neurological standpoint.id.
shortly after conducting his first peer review,goldberg conducted a review in response to information that oliver dosage of oxycontin had been increased from milligrams twice daily to milligrams twice daily.goldberg stated that the high dosage would not present a problem.he opined i f anything,the medicine helps the pain quite a bit and in the patient own words it saved my life.since the medicine helps so much,this lends further support to the fact that he is capable of carrying out his job.id.at.
via a letter dated october,broadspire informed oliver that it had denied his appeal.the letter stated that broadspire had conducted a peer review of oliver file in an effort to afford oliver every consideration under the plan,exh.at.the letter contained a summary of goldberg peer review,and concluded by stating that the medical documentation within your file does not support your claim that you are totally disabled from your own occupation,and that i n order for us to reconsider your claim for ltd benefits,you must submit objective medical evidence id.
on november,oliver visited kenneth lazarus.lazarus conducted a physical examination and found,in relevant part 
examination of the neck reveals it to be exquisitely tender bilaterally.the patient has significant spasm noted in the cervical paraspinal regions bilaterally.he has pain in scalene muscles bilaterally and has exquisite spasm.he has bilateral trapezius trigger points noted on exam.he has pain with lateral bending and with forward bending,and has markedly limited range of motion.he has normal mobility of the shoulders,although elevating the right arm of the shoulder seems to trigger a lot of neck and shoulder pain.any sort of movement in the neck appears to trigger some arm discomfort.he reports arm discomfort radiating from the axilla through the medial arm and into the hand.elbows and wrists function normally.no tinel or phalen signs are noted.hand temperature is symmetrical.distal pulses are intact.the lower back is nontender.he tolerates straight leg raising well.distal pulses are intact in the lower extremity.
exh.at.lazarus described his impressions as cervical myofascial pain syndrome.secondary to above.rule out cervical disc herniation,not demonstrated on the patient imaging.id.at.
further,on november,mishu completed a questionnaire submitted to him by oliver attorneys.mishu indicated that oliver suffered c ervical r adiculopathy with muscle spasms,with symptoms including severe pain in spine radiating down his a rm r and center of back w a ssociated muscle spasms,exh.at.he responded affirmatively to questions asking whether the limitations associated with the symptoms of oliver condition side effects from his medications prevent him from performing material and substantial duties of his past work as a systems support specialist eight hours a day,forty hours a week cause lack of concentration,fatigue,drowsiness or other symptoms inhibiting his ability to mentally complete the most sedentary or basic work tasks and cause substantial impairment to his ability to concentrate focus on tasks.id.at.he also indicated that oliver would be required to lay down periodically throughout the day,and that his reliability in most job settings would be poor.id.
on december,oliver,through his attorney,filed a appeal of the denial of his claim.in support of his appeal,he included lazarus report and the additional information from mishu.in a letter dated december,broadspire acknowledged receipt of the appeal,but again requested objective evidence,such as current diagnostic test results and medical records,exh.emphasis in original.broadspire letter did not mention the mri,emg,and nerve conduction tests already submitted by oliver.see id.
in response to the december letter from broadspire,oliver submitted additional materials related to his ltd benefits claim,including a report signed by mani of the atlanta pain center.mani observed that oliver reproductions on the pain drawing were concise and matched his complaints of pain.they did not appear to be histrionic or exaggerated,exh.at.his report concluded that oliver suffered a djustment disorder with physical complaints and mixed mood,as well as upper torso,extremity and cervical pain migraine headache.id.at.
after receiving this additional information from oliver,broadspire again had goldberg conduct a peer review.in pertinent part,goldberg concluded 
t he patient has complaints of severe neck pain without a true organic etiology being determined.an mri scan of the thoracic spine is reported as normal and except for perhaps a disc bulge in the cervical spine,there is no evidence of major disc herniation.basically,we have the patient own subjective complaints of his particular pain and level of activity without any objective data to support this.based on the above,the determination is made that the patient is not disabled from carrying out the duties of his job which is a sedentary position.
exh.at.goldberg did not examine oliver as part of this peer review.
another broadspire physician,barry glassman,submitted an evaluation form dated april regarding oliver claim for ltd benefits.like moskowitz and goldberg,glassman did not examine oliver.glassman wrote that he had reviewed mani report concluding oliver suffered from certain psychological disorders,and that it was his opinion that the psychological disorders at issue did not render oliver disabled.id.glassman did not consider whether oliver was physically disabled rather,his report was limited solely to psychological issues.
on april,through the committee,denied oliver appeal.the letter contained an itemized list of the materials reviewed by the committee,but did not include the two emg tests and the nerve conduction test submitted by oliver,which supported the diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy.the letter from the committee repeated broadspire frequent objection that oliver had failed to submit objective evidence of his disability,and stated that a true organic etiology had not been determined for oliver severe neck pain,exh.at.the letter concluded with the statement that there is no objective evidence to support oliver subjective complaints although oliver may still require treatment for pain management,the existing medical documentation does not support his claim that he has a disability,as defined in the company ltd plan.id.at.
district court proceedings 
in august,oliver sued and broadspire in the circuit court of etowah county,alabama,seeking ltd benefits under the plan.and broadspire timely removed the action to the united states district court for the northern district of alabama.after a period of discovery,each party moved for summary judgment.on october,the district court issued an order denying and broadspire motions for summary judgment,and granting oliver.
the court found that broadspire was the de facto plan administrator,and was not endowed with discretion to interpret the plan.because the court found that broadspire was the true final decision maker,it reviewed broadspire determination rather than that of the committee,and,because it found that broadspire did not have discretion under the plan,the court exercised de novo review.examining the evidence de novo,the court found that broadspire erred in finding that oliver was not continuously disabled from performing his own occupation during the first months after his automobile accident,and in finding that he was not continuously disabled from engaging in any occupation after that month period.the court observed 
t he medical opinion evidence is substantial,if not overwhelming,that oliver is a person of not unlimited skill and education who was told by his own doctor not to return to work and who has been found by his treating neurologist to be totally disabled.he is in constant pain.
oliver v.the,d.the court then summarized the conclusions of mishu,one of the treating physicians who diagnosed oliver with cervical radiculopathy,and stated 
no one has suggested that mishu is a complete charlatan or a fool when he recognizes pain and its side effects if mishu was lacking in objectivity,so were,arrowsmith,lazarus,and other medical professionals,all of whom confirmed mishu disability diagnosis and prognosis.
id.at.the court proceeded to enter judgment in favor of oliver as to liability,finding that he was disabled under both the own occupation and any occupation standards.the court deferred a ruling on the issue of damages.
on november,the court ruled on damages.under the plan,benefits are based on a participant average monthly compensation.at.the court accepted contention that oliver average compensation was.relying on of the plan,which states,t he participant who incurs a disability will receive a monthly benefit in an amount equal to percent of his average compensation,the court awarded oliver a monthly disability payment of,or percent of.the court rejected argument that oliver benefits should be reduced by deducting his social security benefits from an amount equal to percent of his average compensation,holding that a of the plan barred from reducing oliver benefits below percent of his average compensation.see,exh.a t he offset for other disability benefits will not serve to reduce the disability benefit under this plan to an amount less than percent of the participant average compensation as limited.
in addition to ordering to pay future benefits to oliver,the court awarded oliver unpaid disability benefits and interest totaling.finally,on december,the court entered an order awarding oliver his attorney fees and expenses.and broadspire now appeal the district court judgment,both on the merits and as to damages.
ii.discussion 
a.our standard of review 
we review de novo a district court ruling on a motion for summary judgment,applying the same legal standards that governed the district court disposition.williams bellsouth,cir citation omitted.summary judgment is appropriate when,viewing all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.kinnon arcoub,gopman,cir alteration,quotations,and citations omitted.c.
b.the district court standard of review 
a district court is to apply de novo review to an erisa plan administrator decision to deny benefits,unless the benefit plan gives the administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility or to construe the terms of the plan.hunt hawthorne,cir quoting firestone tire rubber bruch,d.where,however,the plan administrator has such discretionary authority,an arbitrary and capricious standard of review is appropriate.id.to trigger the arbitrary and capricious standard of review,the language conferring discretion on the administrator must be express language unambiguous in its design.id.internal quotation omitted.
here,b and of the plan express ly and unambiguous ly granted discretion to the which delegated authority to determine final interpret the plan and to determine eligibility of plan participants to receive benefits.see id.the plan,however,did not confer such discretion on broadspire,the company that hired to administer initial claims and appeals.accordingly,the appropriate standard of review turns on whether through the broadspire was the plan administrator.the district court found that broadspire was the true plan administrator,and consequently applied de novo review,correctly observing that the plan does not confer discretion upon broadspire.as explained subsequently,however,we find that was the plan administrator,that the appropriate standard of review was arbitrary and capricious,and that the district court erred in holding otherwise.
whether broadspire or was the plan administrator 
the plan document designates the plan administrator.oliver relies on hamilton,in which we held that the plan document is not dispositive with respect to the identity of the plan administrator,and that it is necessary to examine the factual circumstances surrounding the administration of the plan,even if these factual circumstances contradict the designation in the plan document,cir.in hamilton,a plan participant sued her employer,allen,arguing that she had been wrongly denied disability benefits under the applicable erisa plan.at.under that plan,allen was not designated as the plan administrator rather,an insurance company,unam,was the named plan administrator.id.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the employer,allen,on the ground that it was not the plan administrator,and on appeal,we reversed.we held that t he key question was whether allen had sufficient decisional control over the claim process that would qualify it as a plan administrator id.at.
in holding that allen did have the requisite level of control to qualify as a plan administrator,we relied on several facts.first,we noted that,although unam was the designated plan administrator,allen require d its employees to go through its human resources department in order to obtain an application for disability benefits.id.we held that that fact place d allen in sufficient control over the process to qualify as the plan administrator notwithstanding the language of the plan booklet.id.moreover,we observed that allen held itself out to employees as administer ing the plan,process ing all claims and appeals,and provid ing other administrative services.id.this bolstered our determination that allen was a de facto plan administrator.finally,we noted that allen did carry out its administrative designation by handing out the claim forms itself and by fielding questions about the plan from employees.id.we found that these facts comprised sufficient indicators that point ed to allen as a plan administrator.id.we also expressly rejected the approach taken by the second circuit in crocco xerox,cir,which held that only an entity named in the plan document as an administrator could be a plan administrator.see hamilton,at.
we have also recognized the de facto administrator doctrine in several cases in addition to hamilton.in rosen trw,we reversed the dismissal,for failure to state a claim,of a complaint against an employer not named in the plan document as an administrator,and permitted the plaintiff to pursue the claim that the company was the de facto plan administrator and the committee was an inactive entity,cir.we held that if a company is administrating the plan,then it can be held liable for erisa violations,regardless of the provisions of the plan document.id.similarly,in garren john hancock mutual life insurance,we stated that t he proper party defendant in an action concerning erisa benefits is the party that controls administration of the plan,cir per curiam.
each of the foregoing cases,however,is distinguishable from the instant case in a significant respect hamilton,garren,and rosen applied the de facto administrator doctrine to employers,not to administrative services providers.at issue in those cases were plans with frameworks similar to that in this case an employer established an erisa plan and then outsourced responsibility for administering claims to a separate entity.see hamilton,at garren,at rosen,at.in hamilton and rosen,plan participants brought suit against employers that had sought to avoid liability as plan administrators,not,as here,against the claims administrator.hamilton,at rosen,at.in garren,the plaintiff brought suit against the claims administrator,and the court held that the true plan administrator was the employer.at.
indeed,where a plaintiff has sought to hold a administrative services provider liable,rather than the employer,we have rejected the de facto plan administrator doctrine.see baker big star div.of the grand union,cir.in baker,an employer had established an erisa disability benefits plan,and contracted with connecticut general life insurance to administer claims,though,as here,the employer reserved the right to review any and all claim denials.id.at.an employee submitted a claim for benefits under the plan,and connecticut general denied the claim.id.baker was informed of his right to appeal the initial benefits decision,but instead brought suit in state court claiming that connecticut general improperly denied his claim.id.the case was removed to federal court,and the district court ruled in favor of connecticut general,basing its decision in part on the determination that connecticut general was not an erisa fiduciary and could not be held liable under erisa for its handling of baker claim.id.
we affirmed,holding that the employer did no more than rent the claims processing department of connecticut general to review claims and determine the amount payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plan.id.citing the provisions of the plan.we held that connecticut general did not become an erisa fiduciary simply by performing administrative functions and claims processing within a framework of rules established by an employer,particularly in light of the fact that the employer made the final determination as to eligibility.id.citations omitted.
were we to find broadspire a de facto plan administrator on these facts,we would undercut the ability of employers to contract out the administrative tasks associated with operating an erisa plan,a practice we upheld in baker.see id.at.indeed,it is hard to imagine how an administrative services provider could fulfill its functions without engaging in the types of activity that,in hamilton,triggered the application of the de facto administrator doctrine.see hamilton,at finding that employer was de facto administrator because,inter alia,it distributed disability benefit application forms and field ed questions about the plan from employees.the first circuit,which also recognizes the de facto administrator doctrine in some contexts,see law ernst young,cir,has also declined to apply the de facto administrator doctrine to a third party administrative services provider in circumstances similar to those here.see terry bayer,cir w hen the plan administrator retains discretion to decide disputes,a third party service provider,such as northwestern,is not a fiduciary of the plan,and thus not amenable to a suit under erisa.citations omitted.because broadspire is merely an administrative services provider,and because,under the plan,through the the final decision on benefits claims,we are bound by baker to hold that is the plan administrator.see baker,at.accordingly,the appropriate standard of review was arbitrary and capricious,see hunt,at,and the district court erred in applying de novo review.moreover,under baker,broadspire is not a proper defendant in this action.at.
whether decision to deny oliver claim for ltd benefits was arbitrary and capricious 
under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review,the plan administrator decision to deny benefits must be upheld so long as there is a reasonable basis for the decision.jett blue cross blue shield of,cir.the district court review of the plan administrator denial of benefits should be limited to consideration of the material available to the administrator at the time it made its decision.id.to determine whether the administrator denial of benefits was arbitrary and capricious,we begin with the language of the plan itself.see a d stating that an erisa fiduciary shall discharge its duties in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of erisa.
section of the plan provides 
as a condition to receiving a disability benefit,the disabled participant must submit a written application on a form provided by his employer,as soon as practicable after his disability date.he must include with his application a medical certification of his disability.
the relevant portion of section a provides 
as a condition to receiving a disability benefit,the disabled participant may be required to submit to a physical mental examination by,and receive a written certification of disability from,a licensed medical doctor selected or approved by the administrative services provider.the medical doctor opinion will be binding on the participant,the plan and the administrative services provider.
id.section b gives the employer the right to make payment of continuing disability benefits contingent on the participant submitting to periodic medical examinations.id.section of the plan provides that a disabled plan participant will receive disability benefits.id.at.
thus,under the terms of the plan,a disabled participant is entitled to disability benefits.id.moreover,to receive those benefits,a disabled participant is required only to submit a written application on a form provided by his employer,and provide medical certification of his disability.neither nor any other provision of the plan requires objective evidence of a disability.in addition to the requirement that the participant submit a written application and provide medical certification of a disability,the plan permits the employer to require the applicant to submit to a medical examination by a doctor of the employer choosing.here,however,chose not to exercise that right.under the terms of the plan,then,oliver was entitled to disability payments so long as he submitted a written application and provided medical certification that he was disabled within the meaning of the plan.id.at.
in seeking to provide medical certification of his disability,oliver submitted voluminous medical documentation from at least six treating physicians arrowsmith,fugedy,mishu,lazarus,and mani,including records of physical examinations,treatment notes,and the results of several objective diagnostic laboratory tests including an mri,two emgs,and a nerve conduction test that supported his treating physicians diagnoses.he submitted reports from arrowsmith,fugedy,and mishu that concluded unequivocally that he could not work.oliver submitted evaluations from multiple treating physicians reflecting a consistent diagnosis of chronic radiculopathy and pain of the cervical spine and right arm,as well as fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndrome.oliver also submitted,inter alia,a report from mishu that addressed how oliver disability related specifically to the various tasks required of him as a systems support specialist,and concluded that he could not perform those tasks.
we find that denial of oliver ltd benefits claim was arbitrary and capricious,for a number of reasons.based its rejection of oliver claim on its contention that oliver failed to provide objective evidence of his disability,stating that the true organic etiology of oliver pain had not been determined,exh.yet much medical evidence,especially as it relates to pain,is inherently subjective in that it can not be quantifiably measured.indeed,the only evidence of a qualifying disability may sometimes be the sort of evidence that and broadspire characterize as subjective,such as physical examinations and medical reports by physicians,as well as the patient own reports of his symptoms.see,hawkins first union.disability plan,cir pain often and in the case of fibromyalgia can not be detected by laboratory tests.
the plan does not exclude from its coverage disabilities,such as fibromyalgia or chronic pain syndrome,merely because they are not subject to diagnosis by objective laboratory tests.neither nor broadspire identified any evidence that conflicted with oliver diagnosis of fibromyalgia and chronic pain syndrome,and their peer review doctors did not dispute those diagnoses.nonetheless,peer reviewer,goldberg,recommended denying oliver disability claim because,in his view,oliver medical evidence consisted of his own subjective complaints of his particular pain and level of activity without any objective data to support this,exh.at march peer review by goldberg.by denying oliver claim on the ground that he had not provided objective evidence of his pain,despite oliver submission of uncontroverted medical evidence of the only sort available to prove his medical reports from multiple physicians stating that his reports of pain were consistent with their diagnoses and did not appear to be histrionic or exaggerated engaged in capricious decision making.see hawkins,at,exh.at april report by mani.
indeed,it is unclear what additional objective evidence of his pain oliver could have provided in addition to,among other things,the medical opinions of numerous treating physicians based on examinations of oliver,two positive emgs,a nerve conduction test,and an mri.tellingly,never identified what sort of objective evidence it sought.although in some contexts it may not be arbitrary and capricious to require clinical evidence of the etiology of allegedly disabling symptoms in order to verify that there is no malingering,we conclude that it was arbitrary and capricious to require such evidence in the context of this plan and oliver diagnosis.see mitchell eastman kodak,cir see also hawkins,at t he gravest problem with the peer review doctor report is the weight he places on the difference between subjective and objective evidence of pain.
denial of oliver claim for failure to provide objective evidence of his disability was also arbitrary and capricious because it was based on a mischaracterization of the evidence oliver submitted.as noted previously,two of oliver treating physicians conducted emg tests,the results of which supported oliver diagnosis of chronic radiculopathy.see,exh.at may evaluation by arrowsmith citing positive emg for chronic radiculopathy,exh.at july report of mishu we did perform nerve examination today which revealed a active and chronic radiculopathy of the right arm with myofacial pain,muscle tension and overall nerve root irritation.these tests provided the clinical,objective evidence that broadspire and requested throughout the claims process.see,black food lion,cir characterizing mris and emgs as objective tests.while goldberg noted that the emg conducted by mishu only tested certain muscles,he did not assert that the results of the test were invalid and neither he nor moskowitz addressed the results of the emg discussed in arrowsmith evaluation.see,exh.at september peer review by goldberg id.at june peer review by moskowitz.though he did not dispute the validity of the one emg test he acknowledged,goldberg nonetheless ignored the results of both emgs when he later concluded that oliver had failed to provide any objective findings in support of his disability claim,an incorrect statement and a mischaracterization of the evidence presented by oliver.see id.at see also id.at march peer review by goldberg noting lack of any objective data to support oliver disability claim.
indeed,the record reveals a disturbing pattern of goldberg disregarding evidence that would undermine his ultimate conclusion.for example,goldberg placed great emphasis on arrowsmith ambiguous demarcation of a check box next to the phrase m arked limitation of functional of sedentary work,which arrowsmith qualified by placing a question mark next to the check box.id.at september peer review by goldberg id.at may evaluation by arrowsmith.yet goldberg flatly ignored the remainder of the same evaluation form,in which arrowsmith clarified any ambiguity by explicitly stating his opinion that oliver was not capable of working.id.at.
similarly,a common refrain in goldberg peer reviews was that oliver job was sedentary,and that therefore he was capable of performing his job functions.see,id.at september peer review by goldberg id.at march peer review by goldberg.yet goldberg never addressed arrowsmith findings that oliver was capable of sitting for only one hour at a time,or three hours per day total with periodic breaks.see.if oliver could not sit for more than an hour at a time,that fact would undermine a finding that he could perform his job,which required him to sit for five hours a day,five days a week.yet rather than address that finding in his peer review,or dispute it as unsound,goldberg failed to mention arrowsmith finding that oliver could not sit for prolonged periods of time,and proceeded to cite the sedentary nature of oliver position as a reason to deny oliver disability claim.likewise,goldberg did not acknowledge reports from at least two of oliver treating physicians stating that oliver either could not drive a car or that he had a limited ability to do so,and failed entirely to address mishu november evaluation that addressed in detail oliver inability to perform his specific job functions,due not only to his chronic radiculopathy,but also to the effects of his pain and the side effects of his medication.
similarly,the limited peer review performed by glassman,a psychiatrist,did not provide a basis on which to deny oliver ltd benefits claim.glassman did not consider any medical evidence relating to the disabilities at issue,but rather addressed only psychological issues.he concluded that oliver was not disabled due to psychological factors,but did not address whether oliver was physically disabled.
if the foregoing were not enough to persuade us that review of oliver claim was arbitrary and capricious,denial letter to oliver confirms that conclusion.denial letter to oliver includes an itemized list of the materials reviewed in deciding oliver claim.though the list includes the mri test,which did not provide conclusive support for oliver disability claim,conspicuously absent from the list are the two emg tests and the nerve conduction test that oliver physician relied on as clinical objective evidence of oliver chronic radiculopathy,and that peer review doctors did not dispute.the letter contains a discussion of some of the medical evidence provided by oliver,and addresses the mri,which though itself was inconclusive,did not contradict the results of the emgs and nerve conduction test.however,the letter simply notes that the mri did not support a finding of disability,and omits any discussion of the emgs,nerve conduction test,and other evidence oliver submitted that supported a finding of disability 
by relying on goldberg flawed peer review as a basis for denying oliver ltd benefits claim,and by failing to review relevant medical evidence that supported oliver claim,acted arbitrarily and capriciously.though courts may not impose on plan administrators a discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician evaluation,plan administrators may not arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant reliable evidence,including the opinions of a treating physician.black decker disability plan nord,d.here,oliver presented broadspire and with a plethora of medical evidence in support of his disability claim.denied oliver claim not on the basis of conflicting,reliable practice we have upheld,see shaw.life ins,cir rather,it simply ignored relevant medical evidence in order to arrive at the conclusion it desired.does not identify any evidence creating a genuine issue of material fact as to whether it improperly required objective evidence of oliver pain,or as to whether it ignored oliver objective evidence of chronic radiculopathy.accordingly,even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to,as we must,we are compelled to find that acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying oliver claim for ltd benefits,and that the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of oliver.
exhaustion of remedies 
because oliver initiated his claim for ltd benefits during the first months of his disability,the own occupation definition of long term disability applied.see,exh.neither broadspire nor has considered oliver claim under the any occupation standard,which applies to claims for ltd benefits after the first months following the onset of the disability.see id.accordingly,we agree with that oliver did not exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his claim for ltd benefits under the any occupation definition.see perrino southern bell,cir a s a general rule plaintiffs in erisa actions must exhaust available administrative remedies before suing in federal court.
though the general rule in our circuit is that erisa plaintiffs must exhaust administrative remedies before bringing suit,it is also that t he decision of a district court to apply or not apply the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement for erisa claims is a highly discretionary decision which we review only for a clear abuse of discretion.id.emphasis in original citing springer assocs.group health plan,cir.excusal of the exhaustion requirement is appropriate when resort to the administrative remedies would be futile or the remedy inadequate.counts am.life accident ins,cir citation omitted.
here,under the highly deferential standard that applies,we can not find that the district court clear ly abuse d its discretion in excusing oliver from exhausting his administrative remedies with respect to his claim for ltd benefits under the any occupation standard.see perrino,at.indeed,in an analogous case,the sixth circuit reversed as an abuse of discretion a district court decision to apply the exhaustion of remedies requirement in this context.see dozier sun life assurance of canada,cir.in dozier,the plaintiff was a participant in a long term disability plan and a life insurance policy through his employer.id.at.under the plan,a participant could receive ltd benefits if he satisfied the own occupation standard of disability.id.the life insurance plan offered a benefit for participants who satisfied the any occupation definition of disability.id.dozier applied for ltd benefits,which required that he satisfy the own occupation standard,and his claim was denied on the ground that his position was sedentary.id.at.he brought suit under erisa in federal district court,seeking both ltd benefits and the premium waiver benefit.id.the district court dismissed without prejudice his claim for the premium waiver benefit,on the ground that dozier had not exhausted his administrative remedy with respect to that claim,because he had not sought to show that he was disabled from performing any occupation.id.
the sixth circuit reversed as abuse of discretion the district court dismissal of dozier premium waiver claim.id.it found that it would have been futile for dozier to exhaust his administrative remedy with respect to his claim for the premium waiver benefit,which required him to prove he was disabled from performing any occupation,after the plan administrator had already determined he was not disabled from performing his own occupation.id.at.the court observed that i n denying the claim,sun life had made a final determination that dozier was able to perform the material and substantial duties of his own occupation.that determination necessarily precluded him from arguing with a straight face to the same insurance company that he was unable to perform the material and substantial duties of any occupation id.emphasis in original.the sixth circuit further found that an appeal of the claim would not have advanced any of the purposes of the erisa exhaustion requirement,including,inter alia,promoting the consistent treatment of claims and minimizing unnecessary costs during the claims process.id.at citation omitted.because here,as in dozier,it would have been futile for oliver to seek benefits from broadspire and under the any occupation definition of disability where those same decision makers had already denied benefits under the own occupation standard,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by deciding not to apply the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement.see id.at perrino,at.
argues that,even if oliver is awarded ltd benefits under the plan,a requires that his benefits be reduced to account for benefits he receives from other sources,such as social security.section is entitled offset for other disability benefits,and subsection a provides 
reduction in disability benefit.the monthly disability benefit payable from this plan to the participant who receives disability benefits from any source described in subsection b will be reduced as necessary so that the total of his monthly disability benefit from this plan equals no more than the following amount 
percent of his average compensation minus 
the amount of his monthly disability benefits payable from all other sources 
provided that the offset for other disability benefits will not serve to reduce the disability benefit under this plan to an amount less than percent of the participant average compensation 
this section of the plan is far from a paragon of clarity,and contains seemingly inconsistent provisions.on one hand,a provides that benefits should be reduced so that benefits received under the plan plus benefits received from other sources total no more than percent of a participant average compensation.on the other hand,it provides that the offset will not reduce benefits received under the plan to an amount less than percent of a participant average compensation.yet under,the standard,benefit rate is set at percent of average compensation thus,if the final sentence of a is read literally as placing a floor of percent on any offset,there could be no reduction in benefits,and the offset provision would be meaningless.
neither nor oliver attempts to explain how these provisions should be reconciled.each litigant merely quotes the language they favor,while ignoring the remainder of a.because is granted discretion to interpret the plan
