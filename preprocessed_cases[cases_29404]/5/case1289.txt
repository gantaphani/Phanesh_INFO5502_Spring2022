this appeal marks the fourth time this case,which stems from a deputy arrest of a child,has been before us since it began in.the first time we reversed the district court dismissal of laquarius gray complaint on qualified immunity grounds.gray bostic.cir gray i.the second time we affirmed the district court denial of defendant antonio bostic motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.gray ex rel.alexander bostic,cir gray ii.the third time we affirmed the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law against bostic because he lacked even arguable probable cause to arrest gray.gray ex rel.alexander bostic.cir gray iii.this time the issue is whether the district court abused its discretion under by awarding gray attorney fees even though the jury awarded her only in nominal damages for bostic violation of her fourth amendment right to be free from illegal seizure.
because our earlier opinions set out the facts more fully we offer only a distilled version here.after gray was reprimanded by her gym teacher for failing to finish an assigned set of jumping jacks,she made a physical threat toward him.gray ii,at.although a nearby female gym teacher stepped in to handle the situation,antonio bostic,who was then a tuscaloosa county sheriff deputy acting as the school resource officer,intervened.id.at.he took gray into an adjacent lobby,where he pulled her arms behind her back and handcuffed her.id.at the time of the incident the age of laquarius was nine,and she was in the fourth grade.gray i.at.
following the district court entry of judgment as a matter of law against bostic,which we affirmed,gray iii.at,a jury awarded gray in damages.gray then filed a motion for attorney fees and expenses seeking.bostic did not file a response to that motion the district court awarded gray.bostic appealed.
we review a district court order awarding attorney fees for an abuse of discretion,which occurs if the court fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making the determination,or bases an award upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.aclu barnes,cir.under the abuse of discretion standard there is usually a range of choices available to the district court and there is not only one right choice for the court to make.this is true even though we would have gone the other way had it been our call.kenny ex rel.winn perdue,cir alteration,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted.no matter what choice the court makes,though,it must provide a concise but clear explanation of its reasons for the fee award.hensley eckerhart,d.
only a prevailing party is eligible for attorney fees in civil rights cases,and a plaintiff prevails when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff.farrar hobby,d.a plaintiff who wins nominal damages is a prevailing party under.id.at.at.that a plaintiff succeeds in only a limited way does not strip her of prevailing party status,but the degree of her success is the most critical factor in determining the reasonableness of a fee award.id.at.at internal quotation marks omitted see also hensley,at.at.
the small amount of money involved in a nominal damage award does not automatically indicate that a particular case is of little importance or that awarding attorney fees would be an abuse of discretion.see farrar,at.at,concurring nominal relief does not necessarily a nominal victory make.other factors,including the significance of the legal issue on which the plaintiff prevailed and the public purpose served,go into determining whether a plaintiff victory is substantial enough,despite the minimal damage award,to justify shifting her attorney fees to the defendant under.id.at.at see also city of riverside rivera,d duckworth whisenant,cir cullens.dep t of,cir.as the supreme court has explained,a civil rights plaintiff seeks to vindicate important civil and constitutional rights that can not be valued solely in monetary terms t he public as a whole has an interest in the vindication of the rights conferred by the statutes enumerated in,over and above the value of a civil rights remedy to a particular plaintiff.riverside,at.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
relying on the statement in farrar that w hen a plaintiff recovers only nominal damages because of his failure to prove an essential element of his claim for monetary relief,the only reasonable fee is usually no fee at all,at.at citation omitted,bostic contends that gray was not entitled to attorney fees even though she was technically a prevailing party.he argues not only that the amount of money damages she recovered was de minimis but also that the legal issue on which gray prevailed had virtually no significance.he asserts that she accomplished no public purpose or goal with this extended litigation.finally,bostic argues that the fee award is not proportional to the in nominal damages the jury awarded her.
in response,gray contends that at most farrar supports the proposition that a district court may exercise its discretion to conclude that no attorney fee award is appropriate where the plaintiff has recovered only nominal damages it does not stand for the proposition that a court is required to reach that conclusion.she asserts that the district court was within its discretion to award her attorney fees and devoted considerable judicial effort to settling upon a reasonable fee.gray argues that the district court used the proper method to calculate the lodestar amount,then followed this court case law when it reduced the lodestar to offset the claims on which she did not prevail and when it enhanced the lodestar to account for the delayed payment of the fees.she maintains that the outcome of this case sends a clear and unmistakable signal that society will not tolerate an authority figure violating a child constitutional rights,which makes this litigation significance extend far beyond the jury award of nominal damages.
the district court,in deciding that the attorney fee award it chose was warranted notwithstanding the nominal amount of damages,relied on the fact that the one published opinion to have come out of this litigation,gray ii,had been cited more than fifty times in the two years between its issuance and the district court attorney fee order.the court also stated that gray lawsuit,a,civil rights case,was an undesirable one among northern district of alabama lawyers because it required those lawyers to divert time and money away from more lucrative cases to accept one in which they had only a small chance of prevailing.the district court reasoning was flawed.
for one thing,the court reliance on the number of times the published decision generated by this litigation had been cited overstates the significance of the decision.of the now citations to that decision,only three are for the point of law that it established.that point of law,which is hardly,is that it is an unreasonable seizure in violation of the fourth amendment for a law enforcement officer,acting as a school resource officer,to handcuff a compliant child for purely punitive purposes.gray ii,at see also,jordan blackwell,wl,at,noting that gray ii used fourth amendment analysis when evaluating the seizure and use of force on a student by a school resource officer.the other citations to our gray ii decision are for general principles of law that were already well established,such as those dealing with our interlocutory jurisdiction over appeals from motions for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.see,bates harvey,cir marshall west,d,citing gray ii for the principle that the first step of a qualified immunity analysis requires us to ask if the challenged act falls within or is reasonably related to the outer bounds of an officer discretionary authority.it is clear that the district court reliance on the number of citations to our gray ii decision,which was one of the central reasons supporting its fee award,was based on a misunderstanding about the significance of those citations.
