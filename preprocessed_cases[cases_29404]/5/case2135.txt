facts and procedural history 
on september,the four companies that own lincoln place,including pfeiffer venice properties,llc pfeiffer,sued tenants or former tenants of lincoln place,as well as the lpta,seeking in damages plus punitive damages.the complaint included causes of action for negligent and intentional interference with economic advantage,vandalism,conspiracy,and unfair competition.briefly,the facts underlying the complaint concerned pfeiffer notice to certain tenants to vacate their parking spaces for purposes of construction.the lpta encouraged affected tenants to send pfeiffer a letter which stated if you want us to vacate our parking spaces,you must go through a legal process to do so.in addition,certain of pfeiffer signs had been removed,and locks broken,which plaintiffs attributed to the actions of defendants.
on november,defendants filed a joint demurrer and motion to strike portions of the complaint.at that time,they also notified plaintiffs in writing of their intention to file a slapp motion no later than november,the deadline prescribed by code of civil procedure section,subdivision f.on the eve of the november deadline,plaintiffs dismissed all defendants save bernard,ponce,and the lpta.defendants received notice of that filing on november,days after filing their slapp motion.
on december,pfeiffer filed an amended complaint,together with papers opposing the defendants demurrer,motion to strike,and slapp motion on the original complaint.the amended complaint,filed by pfeiffer alone,named only bernard,ponce and the lpta as defendants,and repeated the allegations of the original complaint,but abandoned the conspiracy claim.defendants filed a second slapp motion and motion to strike,which came on for hearing on february.at that hearing,the trial court questioned pfeiffer motives in filing the lawsuit in the first instance why would the landlord go to a silk stocking law firm to bring this case in the superior court for two broken locks and a sign y ou expect the superior court to entertain this case while you do what put these people through discovery,take their depositions,send out interrogatories,send out requests for admissions,require that they be present at mandatory settlement conferences,require that they be present for what,a jury trial you going to put them through thousands upon thousands upon thousands of dollars in expense in order to litigate two broken door locks.counsel,this is offensive.it outrageous.
the trial court issued a minute order striking the first amended complaint in its entirety.the order stated l eaving aside the fact that the declarations in support of these causes of action mainly consist of hearsay and innuendo,it is disturbing that the plaintiff has chosen the forum of the superior court,together with the full arsenal of litigation weapons attendant thereto,in order to litigate what is at best a very petty small claims case.quite apart from ccp,which also applies here,using a blunderbuss to kill a gnat is sufficiently offensive to cause the court to invoke its inherent powers to strike the complaint under the doctrine of de minimis non curat lex,and as improper,frivolous,and abusive.judgment against pfeiffer was entered on march.
on march,the trial court issued another minute order entitled court explanation of findings in judgment and order.said the court in determining that the case was of a de minimis dimension,with damages at the lowest end of the small claims range,the court implicitly determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the amount in controversy.the court continued this is an extraordinary case in which a large landlord has,in the court view,improperly asserted the general jurisdictional power of the superior court for the purpose of intimidating two individuals from exercising their rights to organize and lead a tenant organization.while the first amended complaint is allegedly directed at extremely petty vandalism,rather than speech per se,the suit is a transparent device obviously brought for the purposes of political intimidation,rather than for the proper redress of a slight grievance.the court invited the defendants to file a motion for attorney fees.
pfeiffer initially appealed the trial court judgment striking the amended complaint,but,on august,abandoned its appeal.
on april,defendants filed a motion for attorney fees pursuant to sections and.pfeiffer opposed the motion.on june,the trial court issued a minute order ordering both sides to brief the issue of attorney fees in the context of code of civil procedure section.both sides filed supplemental briefs addressing the issue of attorneys fees under section.
the attorney fee motion was heard on july.while stating that it was not entirely happy about the equities,the trial court ruled that it was without jurisdiction to award attorneys fees,citing hon marshall th,d,and denied the motion.defendants timely appealed.
contentions 
the defendants frame the issue on appeal thus the sole question before this court is whether a defendant who prevails after having filed a slapp motion is entitled to recover attorneys fees under ccp c,where the case is dismissed on other grounds that obviate the necessity of expressly ruling on the pending slapp motion.we hold that the trial court has jurisdiction to award attorney fees to a prevailing defendant whose slapp motion was not heard solely because the matter was dismissed before defendants obtained a ruling on the slapp motion.
discussion 
code of civil procedure section,subdivision b states a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.subdivision c of section provides,in part in any action subject to subdivision b,a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike shall be entitled to recover his or her attorney fees and costs.thus,the award of attorney fees to a defendant who successfully brings a special motion to strike is not discretionary but mandatory.ketchum moses cal th,d.
the trial court cited hon marshall,supra,th,d as the basis for its ruling that it lacked jurisdiction to award defendants attorney fees.in that case,the plaintiff sued defendants,the administrators and chief executive officers of her employer,for,among other things,violation of government code section,the fair employment and housing act feha.the trial court granted defendants summary judgment,concluding that plaintiff had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies.defendants then moved for an award of attorney fees under government code section,contending that plaintiff claims of discrimination and harassment were vexatious and frivolous since she had not complained to the department of fair employment and housing,a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the courts.the trial court awarded defendants for defense of the feha cause of action.
the court of appeal in hon considered the narrow question which is apparently one of first impression in this state,whether a defendant who is granted summary judgment because of such a jurisdictional defect qualifies as a prevailing party entitle
