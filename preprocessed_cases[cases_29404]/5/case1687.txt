this is the second appeal in a partition action brought by plaintiffs shwu jen lin and her husband,hong chuan lin,against shwu jen lin brother,ing jieh jeng.as did the parties at trial,we refer to plaintiff shwu jen lin as jane,and to defendant ing jieh jeng as jack.in the complaint,jane and her husband collectively,plaintiffs alleged that they owned an undivided percent interest in a single family residence in alhambra,and that jack owned an undivided percent interest.plaintiffs sought a partition by sale.the five surviving siblings of jane and jack filed a complaint in intervention in the partition action,alleging that each of the siblings including jane and jack owned a interest following a bench trial,the trial court entered an interlocutory judgment decreeing that jack,jane,and her husband held title to the property as trustees of a resulting trust,and that jane,jack,and the other surviving siblings were the beneficiaries of the resulting trust and owned equitable interests in the property as tenants in common.
in the first appeal,plaintiffs challenged the trial courts findings.we affirmed the judgment in case no,filed january.after we issued our opinion in that appeal,jack and the collectively,respondents filed a motion for their attorney fees,and plaintiffs moved for their attorney fees.the trial court granted respondents motion,apportioning the fees among the parties in proportion to their interests in the property,and denied plaintiffs motion.plaintiffs now appeal from that order,contending that the trial court improperly applied code of civil procedure section in denying their motion and in granting respondents motion in full.we affirm the trial court order granting and denying the attorney fees motions.
plaintiffs also challenge the trial court order setting a trial date in a separate although related case filed by jack,seeking contribution from plaintiffs for amounts jack paid on the mortgage on the property after trial,before the property was sold.as we explain below,that order is not a proper subject of this appeal because it was made in a different case.
background 
to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion when ruling on the attorney fees motions,it is necessary to consider the facts of the underlying litigation.for that,we rely on the statement of facts from our opinion in the first appeal,much of which we repeat here.
i.the parties 
we begin with the cast of characters.as noted,jane and jack had five surviving siblings a sister,shwu huey jeng who was the sole resident of the property at the time of the litigation,and four brothers,ing song jeng,ing ming jeng,ing yann jeng,and ing pei jeng.at trial,brother ing song jeng was referred to as raymond,and we will use that designation.as necessary,we will refer to the other surviving brothers and the sister individually by their first hyphenated names.one other brother,ing lei jeng,was deceased at the time of trial.in the record,he is referred to as larry,and we will use that designation as well.the parents are also deceased,and their names do not appear in the record.we will refer to them as the parents.
a bench trial was conducted on jane complaint and the siblings complaint in intervention.jane,her husband hong chuan lin,jack,raymond,shwu huey,and certified public accountant phillip thong testified at that trial.
ii.the purchase of the rosemead house 
after immigrating to the united states from taiwan,the parents decided to purchase a house on brighton street in rosemead,california.this house was the predecessor property to the alhambra property that was the subject of the partition action.jane,who was a real estate agent,helped in the purchase of the rosemead house,which was completed in.the persons who lived in the house were the parents,jack,larry,and shwu huey.
according to jane,the parents did not have credit,and jack had just arrived from taiwan.thus,jane obtained the loan for the purchase of the rosemead house.however,because the mother insisted that jack also be named on the loan,both jack and jane signed the loan documents.also at the parents request,jack and jane took title to the house as tenants in common,each with a percent interest,even though jane paid no money for the purchase,and never made a loan payment.soon after the purchase,jane quitclaimed her interest in the house to jack,because she did not own the house and had simply arranged the loan.
according to jack,he made all the mortgage,tax,and insurance payments on the rosemead house.in late,he married and moved out,but continued to make all the payments.
iii.sale of the rosemead house and purchase of the alhambra house 
the parents decided to sell the rosemead house,and found another house that they wished to buy on geranio drive in alhambra.this is the property that was the subject of the partition action.at the parents request,jane arranged the sale of the rosemead house and the purchase of the alhambra house,which were completed in january.
the purchase price for the alhambra house was approximately.the down payment was,comprised of contributions from certain family members,as follows the mother contributed approximately percent jack contributed approximately percent shwu huey contributed approximately percent and jane contributed approximately percent.
the purchase loan was approximately,at a variable rate of interest.the loan was signed by jane and her husband,and by jack and his.
the grant deed for the alhambra property listed jane and her husband as owners in joint tenancy of an undivided percent interest,and jack and his as owners in joint tenancy of a percent interest.jack later divorced,and his wife quitclaimed to him her interest in the property.
the family members who lived in the house were the parents,larry the brother,and shwu huey the sister who was the sole resident of the house at the time the partition action was litigated.
in february,the property was refinanced through a loan obtained by jane and jack approximately was paid to retire the original loan.jane paid jack around which was percent of the total loan,and paid shwu huey as repayment for a loan jane had obtained from the mother.
after the refinance,the monthly mortgage payment was,which jane paid to the lender.jack would write jane a check each month for,percent of the mortgage payment.in addition,as explained below,jane received rent from shwu huey.
iv.rent and other payments 
according to jane trial testimony,beginning in january,the parents,larry,and shwu huey were to pay rent to jane for living in the alhambra house,with the checks written to jane by shwu huey.before,there was no formal lease,and shwu huey paid rent in amounts as instructed by jane.jane calculated the rent by setting it at around less than the monthly mortgage payment.for the first six months,the monthly rent was.thereafter,the rent increased because the variable interest rate on the original purchase money loan increased.
in,jane as landlord with husband hong chuan lin prepared a written lease,later signed by the parents,larry,and shwu huey,which called for monthly rent of beginning in january.this payment continued until january or february,when the property was refinanced,after which jane reduced the rent to a month.shwu huey paid at that rate until march,and afterward stopped paying,although she continued to live in the house.shortly before trial,jane had served her with a day notice to quit.
jane testified that although she was listed on the grant deed as an percent owner,she was responsible for only of the property tax.the arrangement was that shwu huey would write a check for the property tax,and then jane would pay shwu huey back.shwu huey would then take a deduction from the rent.
jane did not consider the payments made by shwu huey to be payments toward the mortgage she considered them to be rent paid to her.jane alone took the mortgage interest deduction for tax purposes,and never told any of her brothers that she was collecting rent.jane did not issue receipts for the payments made to her,and did not keep track of the amounts she was paid by shwu huey.
shwu huey testified that jane told her that the amounts she was paying were for rent.however,shwu huey never told her parents the payments were rent,because they did not understand united states law.
according to shwu huey,from through,she paid jane a month jane denied that the rate began in.beginning in february,shwu huey paid jane rent of a month.she stopped making that payment in april.
v.the brothers financial assistance to shwu huey 
although jane knew that shwu huey was not employed,she testified that she did not know whether her brothers were contributing money so that shwu huey could make the payments.she later testified that she did know that the brothers were providing some financial assistance to shwu huey,and that she considered her own assistance to be her reduction of the monthly rent to around less than the mortgage payment.
jack testified that at the mother request,he set up a joint checking account for himself and shwu huey so that shwu huey could write checks for living expenses and make payments to jane for the mortgage.in,when the alhambra house was purchased,the mother asked five of the six brothers excluding larry to contribute at least a month to the account.on average,jack contributed about a month from until the father died in.in,the mother asked the five contributing brothers to contribute at least a month.jack believed that all the brothers did so.jack continued to contribute to the account until,and believed that his brothers continued their contributions also.
raymond testified that when the parents bought the alhambra house,they asked the brothers to contribute money to help them make the mortgage payment.raymond contributed a month until his father passed away in.then jack asked him to increase his payments to a month,which he did until five years ago when he retired.he then resumed contributing a month.raymond made out the checks to shwu huey,or left them blank for her to fill out.he did not specify what the contributions were to be used for,but understood it was for shwu huey to pay the mortgage and living expenses.
shwu huey testified that five of her brothers excluding larry contributed money to her to pay jane the mortgage and other expenses.she received to a month from jack.at some point,she told jack that she did not have enough money,and he loaned shwu huey,after which she told him he did not have to contribute anymore.from raymond,she received a month from ing ming,she received a month and from ing yann,she received a month.ing pei would contribute money on special occasions such as the autumn festival or new years.
vi.jane explanation for her claim to an percent interest as specified in the grant deed 
in her trial testimony,jane explained why she and her husband received an percent interest in the grant deed for the alhambra property,and why jack with his then wife received a percent interest,as follows.
when the rosemead house was sold,the cash proceeds from the sale were about,which the mother instructed jane to divide among the parents,shwu huey,and jack.but jack initially refused to use any part of his share of the funds to purchase the alhambra house.the mother then demanded that he pay an amount equal to percent of the purchase price.jack contributed that amount.for that reason,the parents gave him a percent interest as specified in the grant deed.
the mother also asked jane to arrange a loan to cover the balance of the purchase price,about.jane did so.in exchange for jane obtaining the loan and for signing it along with her husband,the mother gave jane and her husband the remaining percent interest in the house.
similarly,jane husband,hong chuan lin,testified that in early or,the parents asked him and jane for help in obtaining a loan for the purchase of the alhambra house.they said that in exchange,he and jane would receive an percent ownership interest.
vii.the document and letters contradicting jane claim to an percent interest 
jane testimonial claim to an percent interest in the alhambra property was contradicted by certain written communications to her surviving brothers.
in january or february,in response to inquiries from her brothers as to the distribution of shares in the alhambra property,jane prepared a written document in chinese,which set forth the way the property was to be divided as of.the document stated that four brothers larry,raymond,ing ming,and ing yann were to share a percent interest jane and her husband were to receive a percent interest jack was to receive a percent interest sister shwu huey was to receive a percent interest and brother ing pei share was to be determined.
at trial,jane first testified that these percentages reflected the way her parents told her that the property was to be divided.she then testified that her parents did not tell her that the property was to be divided in this manner,but that these were the percentage s as far as my parents knew.she explained when they were alive,they know that their percentage,but they did tell me when they passed away,i should distribute it this way.jane then denied that the document set forth her belief as to how her parents wanted the property divided.rather,the percentages of ownership listed in the document set forth what jane was willing to do.but jane was no longer willing to divide ownership in these percentages.
in a letter to jack with copies sent to the other surviving brothers dated february,jane wrote that based on the circumstances surrounding the sale of the rosemead house and purchase of the alhambra house,jack received a percent interest in the alhambra house,and jane and her husband received a percent interest.jane wrote that when the alhambra property was sold,she and her husband would take percent,and would withhold percent long term capital gain for filing the tax return.at trial,jane conceded that in this letter,she was stating that she and her husband owned only percent,not percent,of the alhambra house.
in march,jane wrote a letter to her surviving brothers in which she stated that each of her brothers was entitled to percent of the property,for a total of percent,and that jack was entitled to percent.
in february,jane also wrote a letter to raymond with a copy to jack in which she stated that she decided to claim an percent interest in the property when she learned that jack wanted to sue her and had told shwu huey not to pay the rent.at trial,jane testified that she changed her mind about how the property should be divided after gathering all the cancelled checks,bank statements,and tax returns showing how much she had paid over the years in relation to the property.she also testified that her parents wanted the property to pass only to her and jack,and did not want the other siblings to have a share.
viii.jack and raymond testimony concerning ownership of the alhambra property 
jack testified that he believed he owned a percentage of the alhambra property,but he did not know how much.he did not see the grant deed giving him a percent interest until the refinancing of the property.
he conceded that his parents never told him that they wanted his brothers or shwu huey to have an ownership interest in the property.however,in december,when his mother knew she was dying,she gave him a diamond ring and asked him to keep the house for larry who was then alive and shwu huey.
raymond testified that his parents never told him that he would receive an interest in the alhambra house.he considered his contributions not as an investment,but as helping provide his parents with a decent place to live.according to raymond,his parents would be shock ed to find out they were living in the place renting from jane and her husband.they believed that they were living in their own house.he implore d the court to protect my parent estate from becoming the income property of jane and her husband.in his view,the home was the family home left to all the children,and he believed that his parents shared that view.
ix.certified public accountant phillip thong 
before trial,by stipulation,the parties agreed to have phillip thong,a certified public accountant,prepare an audit report for submission to the court concerning the alhambra property.the stipulated instructions directed thong to u se standard,recognized documents,such as cancelled checks,receipts,check registers or bank statements to tabulate and calculate payments made by each of the parties for mortgage payments,taxes,and maintenance at the alhambra property.thong was instructed to i gnore all tabulations prepared by the parties and to consider any sworn declaration of a party only if it is supported by standard,recognized documents.
thong prepared an audit report dated march.only jane submitted records to thong none of the other siblings did so.based on the information supplied by jane,thong calculated that jane paid mortgage payments of,property taxes of,insurance of,and maintenance of,for a total of.
argument and oral ruling 
following the presentation of evidence,counsel for plaintiffs argued that under evidence code section,the ownership interests reflected in the grant deed percent for jane and her husband,percent for jack were presumed to reflect the full beneficial title,and that this presumption could only be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.he argued that no such clear and convincing evidence had been presented.
the other siblings jack defendant in the action and shwu huey,raymond,and the other surviving brothers the intervenors in the action were represented by one attorney.he argued that the presumption of evidence code section had been rebutted by jane letters in which she claimed less than an percent ownership interest and admitted that her other siblings had varying ownership interests.moreover,the ownership structure of the rosemead house the grant deed showing jane and jack as each owning percent of the rosemead property,although jane conceded that she did not actually own such an interest suggested that the family also did not consider the grant deed for the alhambra house as the final word on ownership.further,according to counsel,the evidence showed that the parents considered the house theirs.
counsel also argued that a resulting trust can be created when the purchase price of property is paid by one person,but title is taken in another.here,according to counsel,the evidence showed that the alhambra property was purchased with a down payment supplied by contributions from the mother,jack,shwu huey,and jane,but title was taken only in the names of jane and jack.under these circumstances,the court would be justified in finding that a resulting trust was created.
the trial court orally ruled that clear and convincing evidence rebutted the presumption of evidence code section.the court found jane and her husband were inconsistent,biased,and not entitled to much credibility.on the other hand,the court found jack and raymond honest and truthful and entitled to a lot of credibility.the court announced that it found that jack and the intervening siblings prevailed over plaintiffs,and that the court was prepared to make some sort of division of the property at this time.the court subsequent comments suggest that it was inclined to divide the property,based on each party percentage contribution to the down payment for the purchase of the alhambra residence.however,the court also intended to divide the parents interest in the residence in some fashion among the seven surviving children,taking into account contributions to the mortgage,and also to refund to jane certain amounts for property taxes and mortgage payments since.the court ordered both sides to brief the precise manner in which the shares and assets should be calculated.
xi.the interlocutory judgment 
in its interlocutory judgment filed july,the court declared,in relevant part,that jane,her husband,and jack held the alhambra property as trustees of a resulting trust.the beneficiaries of the trust,and their corresponding equitable interests as tenants in common,were jane,percent shwu huey,percent jack,percent raymond,ing ming,ing yann,and ing pei,each percent.the judgment ordered jane,her husband,and jack to convey their title to the beneficiaries,and ordered that the property be sold.upon the sale of the property,plaintiffs were to be reimbursed for contributions toward encumbrances on the property,and for property taxes,insurance,and maintenance costs.the remaining proceeds were to be distributed to the beneficiaries according to their respective interests.
xii.the first appeal and post appeal events 
plaintiffs appealed from the interlocutory judgment.we affirmed the judgment on january,and awarded costs to respondents.on july,jack filed a new action against jane and her husband,seeking contribution for a share of the amounts jack paid on the mortgage for the preceding two years,after the trial court entered the interlocutory judgment.the new action the contribution action,which was a limited jurisdiction case,was assigned case.in december,jane and her husband filed an answer to the complaint,as well as notices in both the contribution action and this action the partition action asserting that the cases are related.the appellants appendix in this appeal does not include an order stating that the cases are related,although it does include a minute order from the contribution action,in which the court to which the contribution action was originally assigned notes that a notice of related cases was filed and sets the matter for a status conference before the court to which the present action is assigned.there is no indication that the two actions were consolidated.
in the meantime,on november,the alhambra property was sold.the proceeds from the sale,after the lienholder and referee were paid,totaled,and remained deposited in an escrow account awaiting an order of the court regarding how the proceeds would be disbursed.
in late december,respondents filed a motion for attorney fees in the trial court.the motion included a declaration from their attorney,stating that he charged his clients an hourly fee of,and that the total amount of fees he charged was he attached a copy of the historical billings to his clients,which included descriptions of the services he rendered and the amounts owed,but did not include the number of hours spent on those services.the motion asked the court to determine the proportion of those fees that jane should be ordered to pay,and argued that the court should exercise its discretion to order her to pay percent of the fees charged,based upon her conduct in the litigation.
plaintiffs opposed respondents motion,arguing that all of the parties attorney fees should be apportioned among the parties based upon each party interest in the property.they also raise d a general objection to the amount claimed,on the ground that the historical billings did not specifically state the number of hours for which the attorney sought compensation.
plaintiffs also filed their own motion for attorney fees,claiming in fees,to be apportioned according to each party interest in the property.respondents opposed the motion,arguing that the court should exercise its equitable discretion and not require respondents to pay any portion of jane attorney fees due to her conduct in trying to deprive her siblings of any interest in the property.
in addition to the attorney fees motion,plaintiffs filed a separate motion for an order allocating and ordering disbursement of the proceeds from the sale of the property.included with the motion was evidence setting forth the amounts plaintiffs paid after entry of the interlocutory judgment until the property was sold.respondents opposed the motion,noting that jack was also claiming reimbursement for payments he made during that period,under an alleged agreement with jane,and that his claim is the subject of a separate lawsuit,the contribution action.respondents asked that all posttrial matters be resolved in the contribution action.
xiii.the trial court ruling on the post appeal motions 
the trial court issued a tentative ruling on the attorney fees motions and the allocation motion.the court granted respondents motion for fees,finding the requested fees were reasonable,and ordered that the fees be apportioned among the parties in proportion to each party interest in the property.the court denied the motion for fees brought by plaintiffs,citing equitable considerations.finally,the court granted plaintiffs motion for allocation and ordered that the net proceeds of the sale of the property be distributed to the parties according to their respective ownership interests.
at the hearing on the motions,plaintiffs counsel argued that,under the relevant statute,section,they are entitled to their attorney fees because they were incurred for the common good,since the litigation benefitted all of the parties.in response,the court noted that although the statute provides for attorney fees to be awarded to both sides,it also includes a provision for equitable consideration.the court concluded that the equities in favor of respondents far outweighed any equity whatsoever for the plaintiff s,and found that jane manipulated this thing in her favor and not in favor of all the siblings.
moving on to the motion for allocation,counsel for plaintiffs observed that the issue of posttrial payments made on the property before the sale are addressed both in the motion and in the contribution action jack filed.the court,which had little information about the contribution action,asked respondents counsel about it.counsel explained that the action addresses posttrial payments jack made,and alleges the payments were made under an agreement between jack and jane regarding who would be responsible for them.he asked that the case be set for trial.plaintiffs counsel disagreed that the matter should be set for trial,arguing that the court had already determined the appropriate allocation of pretrial payments made on the property and that the posttrial payments should be similarly allocated.he noted that plaintiffs had submitted a declaration showing the amounts they had paid,and all that was necessary was for respondents to submit their own declarations showing the amounts they paid.the court indicated it would set a trial date for the contribution action and send the parties to mediation to see if the issues could be resolved without a trial 
the court adopted its tentative ruling as the court order,and ordered counsel for respondents to give notice.the notice of ruling filed by respondents states,among other things,the amount jane is required to pay to respondents for her portion of their attorney fees,which is percent of the total fees incurred by respondents and the total amount respondents are required to pay plaintiffs as their share of the amounts expended by plaintiffs posttrial,which is percent of the total amount plaintiffs expended.plaintiffs timely filed a notice of appeal from the trial court order.
discussion 
plaintiffs contend on appeal that the trial court improperly applied section in refusing to award them any of their attorney fees based upon equitable considerations the award of attorney fees to respondents was improper because the evidence they presented did not set forth the number of hours the attorney worked and the trial court erred by setting the contribution action for trial.
denial of attorney fees 
section governs the apportionment of costs in a partition action.it provides except as otherwise provided in this article,the court shall apportion the costs of partition among the parties in proportion to their interests or make such other apportionment as may be equitable.plaintiffs contend that,under this statute,they were entitled to recover their attorney fees because those costs were incurred for the common benefit of the parties since it resulted in ownership interests for each of the siblings,and the equitable exception in the statute does not apply under the circumstances of this case.in making this contention,plaintiffs rely primarily upon two cases stutz davis d stutz a case decided by this court and finney gomez th finney.we find that stutz is distinguishable,and finney is inconsistent with the current statutory language.
in stutz,the plaintiff in the partition action owned a interest in the property at issue,and the defendant owned a interest.stutz,supra,d at.the property was sold to the plaintiff at private auction,and the plaintiff deposited of the sale price into escrow.in awarding attorney fees,the trial court properly found that the plaintiff should bear of the costs and the defendant should bear,but it erroneously applied that ratio to the funds in escrow,resulting in the defendant bearing the entire cost of the attorney fees.id.at.in reversing the trial court order,we explained that w hile we recognize that the applicable statutes allow the trial court to apportion fees and costs in an equitable manner,there is nothing in the record before us to support an apportionment in any manner other than according to the respective interest of the parties in the property.ibid.in other words,in stutz unlike in the present case there was nothing in the record to indicate that the trial court intended to exercise its discretion to apportion the fees other than according to the parties interest in the property,nor was there any evidence to support such an allocation.thus,plaintiffs reliance on stutz is misplaced.
in finney,the appellate court stated that s ection has been consistently interpreted as giving courts only two options in apportioning the costs and fees of a partition action.the court may apportion the fees and costs based on the parties respective interests in the property,or it may apportion the costs and fees based on some other equitable apportionment.finney,supra,th at.the court went on to state that the law revision commission comments to section set forth the only two circumstances under which a trial court may make an equitable apportionment where the litigation arises among only some of the parties,or where the interest of the parties in all items,lots,or parcels of property is not identical.id.at.we disagree with the finney court analysis.although there is case law that supports a limitation on the trial court ability to make an equitable apportionment,those cases were decided under a different version of the applicable statute 
section was enacted in,and was based upon former section.there is a key difference,however,between section and former section.former section did not include a general equitable exception to the rule that costs in a partition action must be apportioned among the parties in proportion to their interests in the property.instead,it set forth a single exception to an otherwise mandatory rule.it provided in relevant part the costs of partition,including reasonable counsel fees,expended by the plaintiff or either of the defendants,for the common benefit,fees of referees,and other disbursements,must be paid by the parties respectively entitled to share in the lands divided,in proportion to their respective interests therein,and may be included and specified in the judgment when,however,litigation arises between some of the parties only,the court may require the expense of such litigation to be paid by the parties thereto,or any of them.enacted.amended code amdts,ch.
because there was no general equitable exception in former section,challenges to attorney fee awards before that statute was replaced by section focused on whether the challenged fees were expended for the common benefit,with parties objecting to awards of fees incurred by parties who contested matters that ultimately were resolved in favor of the objecting parties.in a pair of early cases,the california supreme court held that when an action for partition was properly brought,the costs incurred for services rendered for the common benefit must be shared by the parties in proportion to their respective interests regardless of whether or not there had arisen and been litigated controversies either over the question as to whether or not the parties to the action were cotenants or over the extent of their respective interests as such in the property thus sought to be divided.capuccio caire cal,capuccio i accord,capuccio caire cal,capuccio ii.the court observed,however,that there was an exception to this rule,found in the last sentence of former section,which allowed the court to apportion the costs differently when litigation arose between only some of the parties.capuccio ii,supra,cal.at.
