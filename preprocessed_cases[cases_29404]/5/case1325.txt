the question in this appeal is whether the district court properly awarded attorney fees to a prevailing defendant,even though the plaintiff,paul quintana,who alleged racial discrimination and retaliation in employment,established a prima facie case on one of his two claims for relief.because the presentation of a prima facie case in response to a motion for summary judgment means that a claim necessarily can not then be considered frivolous,we conclude that the district court abused its discretion by awarding fees for the defense against the claim that was not frivolous.although we affirm the decision of the district court for the defense against the frivolous claim,we reverse the decision to award attorney fees for the defense against the other claim and vacate the order that awarded in attorney fees.we remand this case so that the district court can calculate the amount of attorney fees attributable to the defense against the frivolous claim.
background 
quintana,a hispanic male,worked as a deputy sheriff for broward county,florida,from until his termination in.in,quintana passed an examination and became eligible for promotion to sergeant.the district chiefs of the sheriff office were responsible for submitting recommendations for promotion when vacancies occurred in the sergeant ranks.the chiefs submitted two or three names from the eligibility lists to a group of officers that discussed the candidates with a colonel.the colonel then made the final recommendation regarding promotions to the sheriff.
of the officers who became eligible for promotion to sergeant in,were promoted by,when the eligibility list expired.of those,only three were hispanic,but there is no information in the record regarding the total number of hispanics on the eligibility list.although quintana was not promoted from the eligibility list,chief george brennan,who supervised the district in which quintana worked,did not recommend any of his subordinates for promotion from that list.quintana renewed his eligibility for promotion in.in late,chief brennan recommended for promotion three officers from his district,none of whom were hispanic.when brennan made these recommendations,quintana was suspended with pay due to disciplinary matters.
in october,quintana requested a copy of the eligibility list from the human resources department of the sheriff office.his request was not granted and was forwarded to brennan.quintana alleged that,in december,brennan held a meeting with quintana and two senior officers.quintana alleged that brennan expressed anger towards quintana for violating the chain of command by attempting to obtain the eligibility list from human resources.quintana alleged that he then told brennan that he wanted the list because he believed he was not promoted in because he was hispanic.
on october,a citizen complained to the sheriff that quintana stopped motorists in an road block and called one of the stopped motorists,a black female,a stupid fucking nigger.brennan assigned one of the two senior officers present in the december meeting between brennan and quintana to investigate the allegations.brennan forwarded the investigation to the professional standards committee psc for additional review and,if appropriate,a recommendation for punishment.in april,the psc sustained charges against quintana and recommended a suspension.sheriff kenneth jenne approved this suspension.
in december,quintana filed a lawsuit against sheriff jenne,in his official capacity,in which quintana alleged that jenne discriminated against him based on his race when quintana was not promoted to a position for which he was eligible.quintana also alleged that jenne retaliated against him for complaining about racial discrimination when jenne denied quintana another promotion and punished him more harshly than comparable officers for his misconduct.as to each claim,quintana alleged that jenne violated provisions of title vii of the civil rights act of and.
also in december,quintana responded to a report that someone was illegally dumping motor oil into a storm drain.although both the individual who reported the incident and the alleged perpetrator were present when quintana arrived,quintana wrote in his daily log that the suspect was gone on arrival.the sheriff office investigated this charge,and quintana admitted that he had falsely reported the incident in his log.brennan referred this investigation to the psc,and the psc recommended that quintana be terminated.after a may,meeting between quintana,his lawyers,and lawyers for the sheriff office,the recommendation was changed to a suspension.jenne approved this suspension.during quintana suspension,brennan recommended three subordinates for promotion.
on august,jenne terminated quintana for reckless display of a weapon that occurred in march.in october,quintana pleaded nolo contendere to misdemeanor charges stemming from the same incident.quintana did not amend his complaint to include his termination.
the district court granted summary judgment for jenne on both claims.the district court found that quintana did not establish a prima facie case to support his claim of retaliation.although the district court determined that quintana established a prima facie case for his claim of discrimination regarding his promotion,the court concluded that quintana failed to advance sufficient evidence for a reasonable fact finder to conclude that jenne legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons for not promoting him were pretextual.quintana did not appeal the summary judgment against him.
jenne moved for attorney fees as a prevailing party under k and,and moved for fees under and.the district court applied the factors delineated in sullivan school board of pinellas county,cir,and found that both of quintana claims were frivolous.the court awarded jenne attorney fees under k and for defending against both claims,but denied jenne motion for attorney fees under.and.quintana appealed.because the district court had not awarded a specific amount of fees,the order was not final and appealable,and we dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.the district court then awarded jenne in attorney fees,and quintana appealed.

iii.discussion 
although attorney fees are typically awarded to successful title vii plaintiffs as a matter of course,prevailing defendants may receive attorney fees only when the plaintiff case is frivolous,unreasonable,or without foundation.christiansburg garment eeoc,d.factors that are important in determining whether a claim is frivolous include whether the plaintiff established a prima facie case whether the defendant offered to settle and whether the trial court dismissed the case prior to trial or held a trial on the merits.sullivan,at.these factors are general guidelines only,not hard and fast rules.determinations regarding frivolity are to be made on a basis.id.
to resolve this appeal,we address three matters.we first consider whether quintana retaliation claim was frivolous and whether the district court abused its discretion by awarding jenne attorney fees for defending against that claim.we then consider whether quintana discrimination claim was frivolous and whether the district court abused its discretion by awarding jenne attorney fees regarding that claim.finally,we address the propriety of awarding and apportioning attorney fees for defending against one frivolous claim while denying fees for another claim that,while unsuccessful,was not frivolous.
quintana retaliation claim was frivolous.
our analysis is straightforward regarding two of the sullivan factors,as the record plainly supports the analysis of the district court.the district court concluded,in its order of summary judgment,that quintana failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation,and quintana did not appeal that ruling.because the district court entered summary judgment for jenne before trial,and quintana failed to establish a prim
