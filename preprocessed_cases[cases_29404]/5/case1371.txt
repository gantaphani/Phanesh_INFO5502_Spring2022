in the appropriations act for the district of columbia,a joint congressional committee issued a statement strongly urg ing the superior court to evaluate the quality of the legal services rendered by lawyers appointed under the criminal justice act to handle juvenile delinquency cases.cong.rec.daily ed.the court was urged to take immediate,affirmative steps to ensure that lawyers who lack the requisite training,experience and skill are not appointed to delinquency cases.id.responding to that directive,chief judge rufus king,iii,of the superior court of the district of columbia superior court,appointed an ad hoc committee to recommend panels of qualified attorneys to represent indigent parties in family court.from among the applications received,the committee ultimately recommended attorneys for a juvenile delinquency panel,attorneys for a guardian ad litem panel,attorneys for the counsel for child abuse and neglect ccan panel,and special education advocates.on march,after reviewing the committee report,chief judge king issued administrative order ao,which established the family court attorney panels in accordance with the committee recommendations.
prior to the establishment of the family court attorney panels,the superior court did not designate attorneys for such panels.rather,the court simply appointed counsel from lists of volunteers that had been maintained by the ccan office or the public defender service pds.any lawyer who desired to be on the volunteer lists was included,without any inquiry into the lawyer qualifications.lawyers on the lists were not guaranteed any appointments,however.inclusion merely indicated to superior court judges that a lawyer was interested in receiving appointments.this regime was changed with the issuance of ao.the order provided,inter alia,that,in most cases,judges in family court must appoint attorneys from the appropriate panel list to represent indigent parties.attorneys may continue to represent their clients,but they are not eligible to receive compensation under the criminal justice act cja,code et,or the ccan statute,code.
on may,who claim to represent a class of attorneys who allegedly suffered harm as a result of ao,filed suit in district court against the judges of the superior court who participated in developing and implementing the panel system superior court appellants,and also against ronald sullivan,of pds,and herbert robinson,chief of pds defender services office collectively pds appellants.appellees alleged,inter alia,that they had a property interest in their specialty practice in family court,and that ao violated their fifth amendment rights by taking their property without due process.
the superior court and pds appellants filed motions to dismiss on several grounds,including immunity from suit and appellees failure to allege a constitutionally protected property interest.the district court granted the motion as to appellees claims for money damages.roth king,ca,mem.op,joint appendix.the district court declined to dismiss appellees claims for injunctive and declaratory relief,however,because,inter alia,in the court view,it was unclear whether the plaintiffs have a property interest in their specialty practice of law.id.at.
on april and,superior court and pds appellants,respectively,filed appeals seeking collateral order review of the district court denial of immunity with respect to appellees claims for injunctive relief.they also filed motions for certificates of appealability pursuant to b to seek review of the district court order denying their motions to dismiss appellees fifth amendment claims and to stay all proceedings.the district court granted these motions on april,and this court granted the petitions to appeal on july.meanwhile,on april,appellees filed a seeking to challenge the district court dismissal of their claims for damages.appellees did not move for a certificate of appealability on these claims,nor did they file a under federal rule of appellate procedure b.
we agree with appellants that the district court erred in failing to dismiss appellees fifth amendment claims.we hold that appellees have no property interest in their specialty practice in the family court,and that ao resulted in no unlawful takings.we also hold that the district court erred in finding that judicial immunity covers only damages.finally,we decline to reach the additional issues purportedly raised by appellees on,because those matters are not properly before this court.
background 
family court appointed counsel 
et,which regulates the family court division of the superior court,guarantees appointed counsel to parties who can not afford adequate representation.section a gives a child alleged to be delinquent or in need of supervision the right to counsel at all critical stages of family court proceedings,and guarantees that,i f the child and his parent,guardian,or custodian are financially unable to obtain adequate representation,the child shall be entitled to have counsel appointed for him in accordance with rules established by the superior court.code a.these provisions work in tandem with the cja,which reaffirms the right of juveniles who are alleged to be delinquent or in need of supervision to counsel.section of the cja establishes the hourly rates for attorneys in juvenile cases,and provides that attorneys serving as counsel or guardians ad litem in neglect proceedings are compensated at the same rate.of particular importance to this case,the cja also specifies that c ounsel furnishing representation shall in every case be selected from panels of attorneys designated and approved by the courts.code.
as noted above,prior to the establishment of the family court attorney panel system at issue,superior court judges appointed counsel in family court matters from lists of volunteers maintained by the ccan office or pds.attorneys were allowed to add their names to these lists without any inquiry into their qualifications.inclusion on the lists did not guarantee appointments,however.rather,it merely indicated that a lawyer was interested in being considered for appointment.
on april,chief judge king issued administrative order,creating the family court panels committee committee for the purpose of creating panels of attorneys for representation of indigents in family court proceedings.administrative order,superior court of,at.the order instructed the committee,in consultation with the presiding and deputy presiding judges of the family court,to recommend panels of designated and approved attorneys to represent four categories of indigent parties juveniles alleged to be delinquent or in need of supervision,minor children needing guardians ad litem in neglect and termination proceedings,parents and caretakers in neglect and termination proceedings,and children needing special education advocates.this order was issued in part in response to a call by a joint congressional committee for the superior court to evaluate the quality of the legal services rendered by lawyers appointed under the criminal justice act to handle juvenile delinquency cases and to take immediate,affirmative steps to ensure that lawyers who lack the requisite training,experience and skill are not appointed to delinquency cases.administrative order,superior court of,at quoting cong.rec.daily ed.
the committee initiated an application process on july,and interested attorneys were directed to submit their applications by october,later extended to november.the application form required applicants to detail,inter alia,their educational background,previous experience in family court,current caseload,methods of client management,whether they had recently attended legal education programs,and other information about their professional background and experience.see report of the family court panels committee,at,committee report.after applications were received,all active,senior,and magistrate judges of the superior court were asked to evaluate each applicant with whom they were familiar.
the committee held its selection meetings in february and march.after reviewing all of the applications and accompanying evaluations,the committee then formulated its recommendations.any attorney who was deemed qualified was placed on an appropriate family court attorney panel list.there was no limit on the number of attorneys who could be deemed qualified,and there was no limit on the number of panels on which an attorney might be listed.from the applications received,the committee ultimately selected attorneys for the juvenile delinquency panel,attorneys for the guardians ad litem panel,attorneys for the ccan panel,and special education advocates.the committee report explained 
some attorneys were excluded from a panel because their work was found to be deficient.others,however,were excluded,particularly from the guardians ad litem panel,because they lacked sufficient experience,because judicial officers had insufficient information about the quality of their work,or because they had not previously demonstrated a commitment to the work of the panel to which they applied.many of these applicants may be outstanding additions to the panels in the future if they obtain appropriate experience training.
on march,after reviewing the committee report,chief judge king issued ao,which established the family court attorney panels in accordance with the committee recommendations.the order provided that,barring exceptional circumstances,if an attorney is seeking compensation under either the cja or the child abuse and neglect act,superior court judicial officers may only appoint that individual if he or she is listed on the appropriate panel.in addition,ao mandated that all nonqualifying guardians ad litem in current neglect and termination of parental rights cases should be replaced with panel attorneys within six months,unless the presiding judge determines in his or her discretion that substitution would not be in the best interest of the child.
district court proceedings 
on may,appellees filed their initial complaint,along with a motion for a temporary restraining order tro seeking to enjoin appellants from applying ao.after the district court denied appellees tro request on june,they filed an amended complaint,which was amended a second time on april.in their second amended complaint,appellees defined the putative plaintiff class as attorneys who have represented in the past three years,are representing,or are otherwise eligible to represent clients in the family court of the district of columbia.second am.compl.appellees complaint challenged the superior court panel system principally on the ground that it abridges their purported constitutional right to receive paid family court appointments.specifically,appellees alleged that they have a property interest in their existing practice before the family court,and that the panel system violates the fifth amendment by taking this property without due process.id.at count i.among the counts listed in their complaint,appellees also raised an array of constitutional,statutory,and common law challenges.the complaint seeks monetary damages as well as injunctive and declaratory relief.
on june,appellants filed motions to dismiss all of appellees claims pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b and b.in their motions for dismissal,both superior court and pds appellants asserted,inter alia,that they were immune from liability as a result of their roles in creating the four panels,and moreover,that appellees fifth amendment process claims failed to state a cause of action.the district court granted in part and denied in part these motions to dismiss on march.
the district court found that the creation of the panel system and the limitation of appointments to panel attorneys was a legislative act,mem.op.at,making those appellants who helped establish the family court panel framework legislatively immune from all forms of relief.the court found that appellants who participated in the selection of various attorneys for panel membership were entitled to a more limited judicial immunity,which the district court found to bar damages,but not injunctive or declaratory relief.id.at.the district court also determined that this judicial immunity covered pds appellants,because their duties are related to the judicial process.id.at,quoting barr matteo,d.
the district court expressed confusion over the odd construction of appellees complaint alleging a fifth amendment taking of property without due process.id.at.nonetheless,relying principally on family division trial lawyers moultrie,the district court concluded that,a t this point in the litigation,the court can not say that the plaintiffs do not have a property interest in a specialty practice of law in the family division.mem.op.at.
near the conclusion of its memorandum opinion granting in part and denying in part appellants motion to dismiss,the district court disposed of two arguments raised by appellees challenging the efficacy of the superior court family court attorney panels.the court first held that the panel system was not ultra vires.on this point,the court found that and a combine to give the superior court authority to make rules governing the appointment of counsel.mem.op.at.the court then rejected appellees claim that ao unconstitutionally interfered with the relationship,noting that appellees had presented no persuasive authority or argument that an attorney has a right to maintain a relationship with a client and that a court may not interfere with that right.id.at,emphasis added.
on april and,superior court and pds appellants,respectively,filed motions for certification under b to appeal the district court denial of their motions to dismiss appellees fifth amendment claims.appellants also filed timely notices of appeal to seek collateral order review of the district court denial of immunity with respect to appellees claims for injunctive relief.on april,the district court granted appellants motions for certification,and on july,this court granted appellants permission to appeal pursuant to b.appellees filed a on april,challenging the district court ruling that appellants were immune from damages.appellees never sought certification under b to seek review of the district court partial grant of appellants motion to dismiss affording appellants legislative and judicial immunity against appellees claims for damages.nor did appellees file a under federal rule of appellate procedure b to appellants petitions for permission to appeal the district court denial of their motion to dismiss appellees fifth amendment claims.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction over appellees fifth amendment claims pursuant to.this court accepted jurisdiction pursuant to b to allow an interlocutory appeal of the district court refusal to dismiss appellees fifth amendment claims.and this court has jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine to review the district court denial of appellants immunity claims,because those claims turn on issues of law.see int l action ctr.united states,explaining the collateral order doctrine under cohen beneficial industrial loan,with respect to interlocutory appeals from denials of immunity.
on january,instead of filing a reply brief,appellees filed a motion to remand the case back to the district court due to lack of jurisdiction.unconsented mot.to remand the case back to the district court due to lack of jurisdiction remand mot.at.in support of this motion,appellees asserted that their complaint sought a monetary claim against the superior court,which appellees contend is a federal court because congress created it pursuant to its article i powers.see id.at.appellees therefore claimed that the federal circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over this appeal.see id.at citing a.appellees also argued that the district court jurisdiction was questionable,because appellees have not clearly waived their claims to damages in excess of and,therefore,the court of federal claims might have exclusive original jurisdiction over their claims.see id.at citing.accordingly,appellees requested that this case be remanded to the district court,so that it could vacate its judgment and transfer the case to the court of federal claims or,in the alternative,permit appellees to amend their claims to specify that they are not seeking damages in excess of.see id.at.the motion to remand was referred to this merits panel.we now deny the motion.
appellees jurisdictional arguments are founded on faulty premises.section a provides that the federal circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction of an appeal from a final decision of a district court if the jurisdiction of that court was based,in whole or in part,on section of this title.a.section delineates trial court jurisdiction in cases where money damages are sought from the united states.see.in particular,provides in pertinent part that the district courts shall have original jurisdiction,concurrent with the court of federal claims,of a ny civil action or claim against the united states,not exceeding in amount,founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.a.appellees believe that applies here,because they are seeking monetary damages from the superior court,which they argue should be treated as the united states.this claim is meritless.
although the superior court is a federal creation,the case law and other federal statutes generally treat the courts like state courts.handy shaw,bransford,veilleux roth,see also jmm district of columbia,congress has made clear that it intends federal courts generally to treat the district of columbia judicial system as if it were a state system,an intent that this circuit has long respected and effectuated.we can find no authority,and appellees cite none,supporting the suggestion that,although it is like state courts for most purposes,the superior court should be treated as the united states for purposes of.we therefore reject the suggestion.and because appellees complaint plainly is not a suit against the united states,there is no merit to their suggestion that the court of federal claims has exclusive original jurisdiction because appellees did not expressly waive damages in excess of.
it is also clear that the judges of the superior court and officials at pds are not the united states for purposes of the tucker act.see a the united states court of federal claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the united states founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states.indeed,the tucker act grants the court of federal claims jurisdiction over suits against the united states,not against individual federal officials.a.brown united states,emphasis added.
in short,as noted above,the district court had jurisdiction under to hear appellees fifth amendment claims,and this court has jurisdiction under b and the collateral order doctrine to entertain the appeals that are now properly before us.
b.the issues on appeal 
this case is laden with multiple claims and a convoluted record.it is therefore important that we carefully draw the bounds of this interlocutory appeal,lest there be any confusion over what is now before this court.there are only two issues now on appeal appellants claim that the district court erred in denying their motion to dismiss appellees fifth amendment claims and appellants claim that the district court erred in concluding that they were not entitled to immunity against appellees claims for injunctive relief.there are no other issues before this court at this time.
appellees purported to file a challenging the district court ruling that appellants were immune from suit and liability on plaintiffs claims.see notice of,roth king,ca.principally,appellees seek to give life to their claims for damages against appellants,which the district court dismissed as barred by legislative and judicial immunity.but the district court dismissal of these claims did not result in a final decision for purposes of,see hill henderson,and appellees did not seek certification under b.nor do appellees satisfy the requirements of the collateral order doctrine.we agree with our sister circuits,which have uniformly held that an order granting immunity does not satisfy the collateral order doctrine and may not be immediately appealed.baird palmer,cir citing cases.it is also noteworthy that the district court did not certify its dismissal as final under federal rule of civil procedure b.see hill,at.
moreover,appellees did not file a for permission to appeal after superior court appellants sought permission to appeal the district court refusal to dismiss appellees fifth amendment claims.see fed.app.b stating that a party may file a within days after the initial petition is served.in light of appellees failure to timely file this any at all,for that is unclear whether we even have discretion to consider the issues presented by appellees.
in yamaha motor,calhoun,d,the court noted 
as the text of b indicates,appellate jurisdiction applies to the order certified to the court of appeals,and is not tied to the particular question formulated by the district court.the court of appeals may not reach beyond the certified order to address other orders made in the case.united states stanley,d.but the appellate court may address any issue fairly included within the certified order because it is the order that is appealable,and not the controlling question identified by the district court.moore ward,moore federal practice,ed.see also wright,miller,cooper,gressman,federal practice and procedure,pp.t he court of appeals may review the entire order,either to consider a question different than the one certified as controlling or to decide the case despite the lack of any identified controlling question.
id.at.although yamaha makes it clear that we may address any issue fairly included within the certified order,it does not address how b should be read in conjunction with rule b of the federal rules of appellate procedure.appellees challenge to the district court order dismissing their damage actions as barred by legislative and judicial immunity arises from the same order denying appellants motion to dismiss appellees fifth amendment claims.it therefore applies to the order certified for review under b.but the challenge also appears to be a within the compass of rule,which must be timely filed,and for which permission to seek review must be given.even if appellees notice of is viewed as a,we did not grant permission for such an appeal,and appellees notice of was filed days after superior court appellants petition was served on the clerk of the district court.at least one other circuit has maintained that t he failure to file a petition for permission to within the time provided is a jurisdictional defect,barring th e court from hearing appellee.tranello frey,cir emphasis added.but freeman b b,holding that failure of an appellee to ordinarily precludes review where an appellee seeks to enlarge his rights or lessen those of an adversary,but is not a jurisdictional bar.
we need not resolve these knotty issues raised in connection with b and rule.the one thing that is clear here is that any review of appellees purported is at most discretionary with this court.given the record at hand,we decline to exercise any discretion that we might have to engage in interlocutory review of the district court order denying appellees claims for damages.as appellants point out,appellees have not even argued,let alone shown,that these claims warrant interlocutory review.reply opp br.of appellants superior court judges at.absent such a showing,there is no good reason for this court to entertain appellees on damages.moreover,we similarly decline to resolve whether the is so inextricably intertwined as to allow for pendent appellant jurisdiction in this case.see swint chambers county comm n,d gilda marx,wildwood exercise,per curiam.
we therefore turn to the two issues that are properly before this court appellees fifth amendment claims and appellants claims that they are entitled to immunity against injunctive relief.
