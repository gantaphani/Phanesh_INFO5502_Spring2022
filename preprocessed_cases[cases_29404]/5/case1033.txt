this is a bankruptcy case,in which a creditor,first american title company fatco,seeks to prevent the discharge of a state court judgment against the debtor,lawrence ormsby,under a and a.the nevada state court found ormsby had converted and misappropriated property belonging to fatco.ormsby filed for bankruptcy protection,and fatco moved to prevent the discharge of the state court judgment.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of fatco the district court,acting in an appellate capacity,affirmed.for the reasons given below,we affirm the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of fatco.we also affirm the district court determination with regard to the withdrawal of fatco prior motion for attorney fees.
we repeat here the findings of fact the nevada state court made when it found ormsby had engaged in misappropriation and conversion.fatco,the creditor in this case,is a title company that provides escrow services and title insurance for real property transactions.ormsby,the debtor in this case,is the owner of inter county title company of nevada inter county,which also provides escrow and title services.
title companies like fatco and ormsby inter county facilitate title searches that could otherwise only be conducted through an onerous search of the official public records for transactions affecting real property.such records in washoe county,nevada,date back to the mid and reflect deeds,deeds of trust,mortgages,judgments,among other documents related to real property.the washoe county recorder organizes the various documents by creating a index.to make the title search process easier,title companies create base files,subdivision files,and preliminary title reports,which in turn are used as aids for examining and insuring title.title companies also compile documents in the form of title plants,which constitute a separate method of assembling recorded information based on the location of the property and which offer search capabilities far beyond the index available at the county recorder.
in washoe county,title companies use title plants covering four separate periods,and to the present.these plants are leased to subscribers,who are not free to transfer,sell,assign,or allow others to access the plants.fatco owned a interest in the plant and leased the other plant data.
in the spring of,fatco had possession of the three title plants covering the on microfiche and stored them in a area for its use only.in addition,fatco compiled a substantial number of base files,subdivision files,and preliminary title reports.though these documents were made available to customers and sometimes to other title companies,fatco considered most of these records private and proprietary.
in june of,joseph mccaffrey was hired to head fatco commercial title business.mccaffrey had access to all of fatco records and title plant microfiche and used them on a regular basis.he was aware that these were not public records but were private and proprietary.
in early,ormsby prepared inter county to begin operations in washoe county.he purchased rights to the title plant for until the present but not to any of the plants covering the.additionally,ormsby solicited employees of fatco to work for inter county.mccaffrey was one of the employees ormsby was able to lure from fatco.the two discussed the importance of access to the title plants to any new title company in the washoe county area.
while he still had access to his office at fatco,mccaffrey downloaded and fatco proprietary base files,subdivision files,preliminary title reports,and other business records.mccaffrey,with the encouragement,cooperation,and assistance of ormsby,appropriated the,and title plants from the possession of fatco.ormsby took the title plants and sent them to a copy service for duplication.
inter county then used these appropriated title plants in searching titles and issuing policies.it did so until the return of the copied plants was compelled by court order.from may until the plants were returned in august,inter county handled approximately escrows.the estimated cost savings realized by inter county use of the plants was about per transaction,resulting in an estimated in savings.
in,fatco filed an action against ormsby in the second judicial district court of nevada in and for the county of washoe.before trial,fatco settled with mccaffrey for,under the condition that mccaffrey testify against ormsby.the court found that ormsby encouraged,assisted,and cooperated with mccaffrey in misappropriating the title plants from fatco and used those plants to conduct title searches for the purposes of issuing title insurance.the court also found that ormsby converted for inter county use the base files,subdivision files,and preliminary title reports of fatco to assist in the opening of the business.the court found that,in the misappropriation of the title plants and files,ormsby had acted maliciously in that his conduct was willful,wanton,and reckless.
the court granted in compensatory damages based on the measure of a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret.punitive,or exemplary,damages were also awarded in the amount of based on evidence of willfulness in ormsby cooperation with mccaffrey in taking,copying,and surreptitiously returning the title plants and files.the court awarded interest of on the compensatory damages,attorney fees of,and costs of.
ormsby and his wife subsequently filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of california,sacramento division.fatco filed a complaint with the court to establish that the judgment ormsby owed was under a and a.fatco then filed for summary judgment,which was granted.ormsby filed a motion for reconsideration that was rejected.he then appealed to the bankruptcy appellate panel.fatco filed a motion for transfer to the district court for the eastern district of california,which affirmed the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment in favor of fatco.ormsby now appeals to this court.
ormsby suggests that the state court judgment against him did not constitute larceny within the federal definition of the term and that the court made no findings of willful or malicious injury.as a result,he contends,summary judgment was inappropriate because the issues are not precluded by the state court judgment.we disagree the state court judgment is sufficient to preclude relitigation of whether ormsby conduct meets the requirements of subsection a or of subsection a,either of which would be sufficient to prevent the discharge of the judgment debt 
section a prevents discharge for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity,embezzlement,or larceny.a.for purposes of section a,a bankruptcy court is not bound by the state law definition of larceny but,rather,may follow federal common law,which defines larceny as a felonious taking of another personal property with intent to convert it or deprive the owner of the same.collier on bankruptcy ed.
ormsby main contention is that the facts of the state court judgment do not prove larceny for the application of section a because the federal definition of larceny requires fraudulent intent whereas conversion under nevada state law does not require a finding of fraudulent intent.conversion is defined as a distinct act of dominion wrongfully exerted over another personal property in denial of,or inconsistent with his title or rights therein or in derogation,exclusion,or defiance of such title or rights.additionally,conversion is an act of general intent,which does not require wrongful intent and is not excused by care,good faith,or lack of knowledge.multi family development,crestdale,internal citations omitted.accordingly,ormsby argues that the state court finding of conversion does not translate to a finding of larceny therefore,the issue is not precluded.
we make no determination concerning whether federal law requires a finding of fraudulent intent for larceny as ormsby contends were we to find that larceny required fraudulent intent,the state court judgment would provide enough information to determin
