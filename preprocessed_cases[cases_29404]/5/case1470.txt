in this government contract case,in which the court of federal claims held that the government had breached the contract,the contractor challenges the court ruling that he had not proven that the government breach had resulted in lost profits for him.the government appeal challenges the district court award to the contractor,under the equal access to justice act,of attorneys fees of in a case in which the contractor recovered damages of.
we affirm the denial of lost profits damages,vacate the attorney fees award,and remand the case to the trial court to reconsider an attorney fees award under the standard we have described.
this case stems from a contract under which the bill hubbard hubbard agreed to build and operate a facility at a naval air station.the navy agreed to provide the personnel to operate the facility and a rental office known as the rent all center.the financial arrangements were that hubbard would give the navy of the business gross revenue and retain the rest.
tensions arose between the parties in when captain al gorthy,became the new commander of the base.despite hubbard objection,captain gorthy moved the rent all center to a new location about two miles from the facility.captain gorthy also took other actions relating to the facility,described below,to which hubbard objected.
in,hubbard filed suit in the court of federal claims seeking damages for breach of contract.he contended that moving the rent all center violated the navy contractual obligation to provide an rental office.hubbard united states.hubbard also contended that the navy breached the contract by ending phone service to the rental facility before it was moved reducing the hours of the rent all center failing to post signs notifying customers of the new office location allowing firefighters to conduct a training exercise at the storage facility site and allowing other contractors to park at the storage facility,which damaged a concrete slab on which hubbard planned to build another storage building.id.
after a trial,the court held that captain gorthy decision to move the rent all center breached both the implied duty to make reasonable decisions and the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,id.at ruling not challenged in this appeal.the court found that captain gorthy stated reasons for the move were pretextual,and that the move was engineered in bad faith,without regard,indeed,with deliberate and bad faith disregard,for the legitimate business interests of hubbard.id.the court also found that the navy permitting a fire drill at the storage facility and parking by other contractors on the slab breached the contract.id.at.lastly,the court found that the termination of telephone service,the reduction in office hours,and the delay in posting signs providing notice of the rent all center move did not breach the contract.id.at.
at trial,hubbard sought damages of of which represented profits he allegedly lost as a result of the contract breaches.the court rejected most of his claim because hubbard had not shown that the breaches had caused his alleged lost profits.id.at.it awarded damages of only,covering the cost of repaving the concrete slab.
finally,the court concluded that 
because of the clear bad faith shown by the navy in dealing with hubbard,hubbard has been forced to appeal to this court,after numerous attempts to resolve the case without resort to litigation,because it was impossible to deal reasonably with a business partner that had acted in bad faith.accordingly,plaintiff is entitled to recover all its attorney costs,fees and expenses related to this litigation,including expert expenses,from the preparation for the filing of this suit until the current date.
the court wrote an additional opinion dealing with the attorney fees issue under the equal access to justice act.hubbard united states,slip op.at,fees.the court first determined that the statutory conditions for awarding a fee were satisfied.the court ruled that the damages it had awarded made hubbard a prevailing party under the act.it stated that although the navy conduct during the litigation phase of the dispute was generally justified,its bad faith,which seriously abused plaintiff contract rights,and amounted to harassment and needlessly forced this matter before the court,meant that the government position was not substantially justified.id.at.
in determining the attorney fees,the court multiplied the number of attorney and paralegal hours billed by the rate specified in the act,adjusted upward to reflect increases based on the consumer price index.hubbard united states,slip op.at.july,fees fees at.this came to.to this the court added total costs of,for a total attorney fees and costs award of.
hubbard claim of lost profits damages was based upon two items of evidence.first,he presented a study by his expert,that purported to show what the business profits would have been had there been no breach.second,hubbard himself testified about the profits he had expected to earn.
the court of federal claims rejected this evidence because it did not establish that the breach of the contract primarily the moving of the rent all center caused the decrease in earnings that hubbard attributed to the breach.
the court found that analysis did not relate to the actual breach actions,and that based on a review at hubbard business records,the rental revenue on a basis varied considerably both before and after the breach,and that no reduction or in rental revenue can be attributable to the move based on the information before the court.hubbard.at.the court rejected hubbard own analysis for substantially the same reason.
although a trier of fact perhaps could have concluded that hubbard lost profits evidence showed the necessary causal connection between the breach and the losses,it did not compel that conclusion.we have no reason to reject,as contrary to the evidence,the trial court determination that the necessary causal connection had not been shown.
the equal access to justice act provides that in any civil action brought by or against the united states a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.a,d a.for the purposes of this subsection fees and other expenses includes reasonable attorney fees.id.d a.thus,the fees and other expenses that the act directs to be awarded to a prevailing party,includes reasonable attorney fees.
the act thus is similar to the provision of the civil rights attorney fees awards act of civil rights act,which provides that the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.the only significant differences between the two provisions are that in the civil rights act the award of attorney fees is discretionary,not mandatory the requirement that the attorney fees be reasonable is contained in the operative provision itself,not in the definitions and it does not include the substantially justified and special circumstances provision of the equal access to justice act.we do not think,however,that these distinctions justify different results with respect to the issue in this appeal.
a.the government urges two grounds upon which,it contends,hubbard is not entitled to any attorney fees.
the government contends that since hubbard recovered only nominal damages,he can not receive any attorney fees.it refers to the statement in farrar hobby,d,that w hen a plaintiff recovers only nominal damages because of his failure to prove an essential element of his claim for monetary relief,the only reasonable fee is usually no fee at all.id.at.internal citation omitted.
nominal damages ordinarily are awarded where,although the plaintiff has established the merits of his claim,he has not shown any actual damages.the nominal damages,frequently or sometimes,are intended to vindicate the plaintiff institution of the law suit.in farrar,in which the court held that a civil rights plaintiff who receives a nominal damages award i
