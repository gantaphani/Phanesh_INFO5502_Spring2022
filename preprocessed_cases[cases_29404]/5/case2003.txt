plaintiff ramona unified school district rusd sought to construct a school the project and,pursuant to the california environmental quality act ceqa,issued a mitigated negative declaration mnd when it approved the project.however,when rusd subsequently proposed a potential alteration to the project,defendant neighborhood alliance for safe ramona schools nasrs filed a writ petition alleging rusd proposal violated ceqa,and sought an order setting aside the proposed change to the mnd and requiring rusd to prepare an eir on numerous issues.the trial court rejected nasrs writ petition,rejected nasrs request for private attorney general fees,and dismissed the action.
rusd then filed the present action,pleading causes of action styled as claims for abuse of process and barratry,and named as defendants nasrs,its principals,and its attorney collectively defendants.defendants moved to strike the complaint pursuant to code of civil procedure section commonly referred to as the strategic lawsuit against public participation statute.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.the trial court granted the motion,concluding rusd could not show probable success on the merits,and subsequently awarded attorney fees to defendants.rusd appeals.
factual and procedural backgrounda.the underlying writ proceeding 
rusd project was to acquire land for,construct,and operate an elementary school on boundary avenue in ramona,california.in october rusd approved the project and,to satisfy ceqa requirements,adopted an mnd for the project.the mnd stated the project would use a septic system for wastewater disposal.the limitations period for challenging the mnd pub.resources code,subd.b expired before the end of.
after the period for challenging the mnd expired,gregory tsiknas and charles apgar two of the principals of nasrs continued to complain about the project to a variety of public agencies and individuals,and in particular raised concerns over traffic and access issues for the new school.tsiknas and apgar lived near the proposed school,and tsiknas having personally witnessed a fatal collision at the intersection where school children would be picked up and dropped off was particularly sensitive to traffic safety issues.
sometime during,rusd explored the feasibility as well as cost savings of switching from the approved wastewater disposal system a septic system to an alternative system that would involve constructing a sewer pipe to connect to an existing sewer system operated by the ramona water district.on december,rusd filed an addendum to the mnd that described the intended change to the project and concluded the proposed change was not substantial and did not involve any significant environmental impacts that required preparation of any further ceqa documentation 
on january,nasrs filed a writ petition challenging the december,addendum the petition asserted the use of the addendum was improper because it was an unlawful review of the environmental impacts of the project,it was improper to treat construction of this sewer line as exempt under public resources code section,and it was improper to proceed by addendum because there was a fair argument the revisions to the project could cause significant impacts but there was no evaluation of the potential impact of the revisions.the petition requested an order requiring rusd to set aside its addendum and to prepare an eir on the issues raised by the petition.
on march,rusd issued a revised addendum to the mnd that evaluated the proposed change from septic to sewer as well as expanding the sewer service area for the ramona water district to accommodate the school site and reviewed the detailed design plans for conformance with the mnd.the addendum continued to assert construction of the sewer line would have no new or substantially increased environmental effects beyond those discussed in the mnd,and therefore no eir or negative declaration was required under ceqa.in apparent response to the revised addendum,nasrs filed an amended petition on april.the first amended petition in addition to updating the information concerning the date of the challenged action and the then current president of rusd restated the claims asserted in nasrs original petition.
on may,rusd filed a motion seeking judgment on nasrs petition.rusd asserted the petition was moot because rusd had decided two days earlier to abandon the sewer plan and to proceed with the project as originally designed and approved and any ceqa challenges to the mnd for original design were,and even if rusd were to implement the sewer related changes,the addendum was valid under ceqa standards.nasrs opposed the motion,asserting the petition was not moot because the addendum still proposed to annex the school site into the ramona water district which would allow rusd to switch back to sewer at a later date with no environmental review process and because the mnd had been limited to acquiring the land for the school while the addendum discussed construction of the school.the court ruled in favor of rusd,concluding all challenges to the mnd for the project as originally designed were,rusd had no intention of pursuing a changed wastewater disposal plan,and under ceqa the remaining elements described in the march,addendum could properly be considered by addendum however,nasrs sought and obtained leave to amend its petition.
nasrs second amended petition alleged that,although the change from septic to sewer had been abandoned,the addendum remained operative insofar as it contained a detailed plan review,and rusd approval of the mnd had been conditioned on the requirement for additional environmental analysis during detailed plan review.the second amended petition further alleged the original mnd had been approved based on a traffic analysis that assumed traffic impacts of the school would be mitigated by providing access along both boundary avenue and dye road,but the addendum appeared to approve a design that abandoned any use of dye road and instead relied solely on boundary avenue for access.nasrs second amended petition asserted this alteration was a significant change that was inadequately analyzed,and therefore it was improper to adopt such a change by addendum.
rusd demurred to the second amended petition,asserting the trial court ruling on the first amended petition all challenges to the mnd for the project as originally designed were and the elements remaining after elimination of the sewer proposal could properly be considered by addendum was res judicata.the court,rejecting nasrs argument that the addendum was subject to attack insofar as it altered the access plan contemplated by the mnd,sustained rusd demurrer and dismissed nasrs action.however,the court rejected rusd concurrent motion for sanctions,apparently brought under section seeking to sanction nasrs for filing the second amended petition because the court was unwilling to find nasrs guilty of bad faith in filing the second amended petition.
nasrs then moved for attorney fees under the private attorney general statute.code civ.it argued that although its petition had been dismissed,the practical effect of its litigation was to force rusd to withdraw its planned alterations to the project because it was the petition that induced rusd to abandon changes to the project not evaluated through the ceqa process.the court denied the motion for fees,and also denied rusd seeking sanctions,apparently brought under section seeking to sanction nasrs for filing the attorney fees motion 
b.the present action 
rusd then filed this action against nasrs,as well as against its principals apgar and tsiknas and its attorney in the underlying proceeding,julie hamilton,pleading causes of action labeled abuse of process and barratry premised on nasrs challenges to the project.defendants moved to strike the complaint under the statute,asserting the complaint arose out of activity within the ambit of the statute,thereby shifting to rusd the burden to demonstrate probable success on the merits of the pleaded claims.defendants argued that because rusd could not meet that burden,the complaint should be stricken.
rusd conceded the complaint was premised on activity covered by the statute,but asserted the motion should be denied because rusd could show probable success on the merits.on the abuse of process claim,rusd argued there was evidence showing defendants,by pursuing the second amended petition and the motion for private attorney general fees,had asserted claims so clearly unmeritorious that pursuing those claims constituted willful acts in the use of process not proper in the regular course of the proceedings.rusd also argued the evidence showed these acts were pursued for the ulterior motive of harassing rusd into abandoning the project or changing its location.rusd argued these two elements sufficed to show probable success on the abuse of process claim.on the barratry claim,rusd argued that because defendants excited three groundless proceedings the original petition and the first and second amended petitions with the requisite malicious intent,rusd had presented sufficient evidence to show probable success on the barratry claim.
the trial court rejected rusd arguments,and granted defendants motion.the court subsequently granted defendants motion for attorney fees,subd.c.on appeal,rusd asserts the trial court erred in granting the motion and further erred in awarding the attorney fees.
analysisa.the law 
the law provides that a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.the purpose of the statute is to encourage participation in matters of public significance by allowing a court to promptly dismiss unmeritorious actions or claims brought to chill another valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances,subd.a.in furtherance of this purpose,the statute is to be construed broadly.ibid.
the law involves a process for determining whether a claim is subject to being stricken.in the first step,the defendant bringing an motion must make a prima facie showing the plaintiff suit is subject to section by showing the defendant challenged acts were taken in furtherance of constitutional rights of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue,as defined by the statute.jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th,d.
rusd concedes defendants satisfied the first step,which shifted the burden to rusd to establish the second step by demonstrating it was reasonably probable it would prevail on the merits at trial,subd.b.in this phase,the plaintiff must show both that the claim is legally sufficient and there is admissible evidence that,if credited,would be sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment.wilcox superior court th,d,disapproved on other grounds by equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th at,fn,d,robertson rodriguez th,d.in making this assessment,the court must consider both the legal sufficiency of and evidentiary support for the pleaded claims,and must also examine whether there are any constitutional or nonconstitutional defenses to the pleaded claims and,if so,whether there is evidence to negate those defenses.traditional cat,gilbreath th,d.
in considering whether a plaintiff has met the evidentiary burden,the court must consider the pleadings and the evidence submitted by the parties,subd.b.however,the court can not weigh the evidence looney superior court th,d but instead must simply determine whether the plaintiff evidence would,if credited,be sufficient to meet its burden of proof.wilcox superior court,supra,th at,d standard for assessing evidence is analogous to standard applicable to motions for nonsuit or directed verdict.
on appeal,we review de novo the trial court ruling on the motion to strike.bernardo planned parenthood federation of america th,d.
b.the gravamen of the complaint controls application of the law 
the statute should be broadly construed equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th at,fn,d,and a plaintiff can not avoid operation of the statute by attempting,through artifices of pleading,to characterize an action as a garden variety tort claim when in fact the liability claim is predicated on protected speech or conduct.navellier sletten cal th,d.thus,a plaintiff can not frustrate the purposes of the slapp statute through a pleading tactic of combining allegations of protected and nonprotected activity under the label of one cause of action.fox searchlight pictures,paladino th,d.we examine the principal thrust or gravamen of a plaintiff cause of action to determine whether the statute applies city of cotati cashman cal th,d,and when the allegations referring to arguably unprotected activity are only incidental to a cause of action based essentially on protected activity,collateral references to unprotected activity should not obviate application of the statute to the complaint.brenton metabolife,th,d.
rusd abuse of process claim 
a claim for abuse of process arises when a party for ulterior reasons misuses the court process for a purpose other than the purpose for which the process was designed.brown kennard th,d.rusd argues it prima facie demonstrated both elements of abuse of process because there was evidence the defendants had ulterior motives to harass rusd into canceling the project and misused the writ proceedings by pursuing claims that the addendum changed the project and required rusd reopen the environmental review process defendants knew were substantively meritless.
although initiating a meritless claim for an improper purpose can expose a party to damages for malicious prosecution,the mere initiation of a lawsuit,even for an improper purpose,does not support a claim for abuse of process.oren royal oaks venture greenberg,bernhard,weiss karma,cal d,oren.similarly,although continued prosecution of a claim after it becomes apparent the claim is meritless can expose a party to damages for malicious prosecution zamos stroud cal th,d,the mere maintenance of a for an improper not a proper basis for an abuse of process action oren,supra,at.rusd cites no authority that the conduct here gives rise to a claim for abuse of process separate from and not subsumed within a malicious prosecution claim.
rusd asserts that abuse of process,which has evolved as a category to cover improper uses of the judicial machinery that did not fit within the earlier established,but narrowly circumscribed,action of malicious prosecution barquis merchants collection cal d,fn,can be asserted based on subsidiary acts occurring within the litigation.adams superior court th,d.rusd argues defendants filing of the second amended petition and motion for attorney fees are subsidiary acts that support its claim for abuse of process.rusd argues these acts employed the court processes for purposes other than that for which the processes were designed,asserting that once the trial court rejected the first amended petition based on statute of limitations as to challenges to the mnd for the project as originally designed and mootness based on rusd abandonment of the proposed change to the wastewater disposal plan,the proper course would have been to appeal that ruling.rusd asserts that by instead pursuing a second amended petition,and by subsequently moving for attorney fees,defendants used the court process in an improper manner within the meaning of a claim for abuse of process.
we are persuaded continued pursuit of meritless litigation for an improper collateral purpose,although actionable under malicious prosecution principles,is not separately actionable under an abuse of process theory.in tellefsen key system transit lines d,the plaintiff filed an abuse of process claim alleging the defendant,after losing at trial,maliciously filed a frivolous appeal to coerce a cheaper settlement,and continued prosecution of the action for a collateral purpose was an improper use of the judicial processes.the tellefsen court concluded merely pursuing the app
