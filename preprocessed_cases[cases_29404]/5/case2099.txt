introduction 
this appeal raises a question of the first impression about the obligation of the california insurance guarantee association ciga.the specific issue is whether ciga is required to pay the claim of an insured of an insolvent insurer when the claim is based upon a judgment the insured obtained against the insurer prior to insolvency for breach of the contractual duty to defend.the judgment reflects the amount the insured paid for legal representation to defend himself after the insurer declined his tender.
ciga contended,and the trial court agreed,that it had no obligation to pay based upon subdivision h of insurance code section that provision provides covered claims for which ciga is liable shall not include any loss adjustment expenses,including adjustment fees and expenses,attorney fees and expenses,court costs,interest,and bond premiums,incurred prior to the appointment of a liquidator for the insolvent insurer.in a nutshell,ciga position and that of our dissenting colleague is that because the insured judgment is to compensate him for attorney fees he incurred before the insurer became insolvent,the judgment and therefore the claim presented to ciga is the functional equivalent of a claim for loss adjustment expenses for which ciga is not liable.
we reject ciga analysis.the insured judgment against the insurer is not a loss adjustment expense.in the insurance industry,the phrase loss adjustment expenses generally means the expense incurred by the insurer to investigate and settle a claim.simply stated,an insured does not incur loss adjustment expenses because the insured does not initiate or control the loss adjustment process.the insured reasonable expectation is that the insurer will engage in that process.that,in fact,is one of the reasons insurance is obtained.consequently,when,as here,an insured is faced with a refusal to defend by its insurer and thereafter first retains counsel to defend and later obtains a judgment against the insurer to compensate for damages caused by breach of the contractual duty to that can include compensation for monies spent on attorney insured judgment against the insurer can not reasonably be categorized as one for loss adjustment expenses.instead,it reflects compensation awarded to the insured by a court based upon the insurer failure to provide a key benefit owed to him under the insurance policy legal representation.because we conclude the exclusion in section,subdivision h does not apply,ciga is obligated to pay the insured claim since,as conceded by ciga,the insured judgment otherwise falls within the statutory definition of a covered claim.we therefore reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
arch woodliff owned an apartment building.in,he purchased a commercial property liability insurance policy from lmi insurance company lmi 
the policy was in effect in when two actions were brought against woodliff for violation of the federal fair housing act.the actions alleged discrimination on the basis of familial status.the actions sought a declaration that woodliff actions were in violation of law,an award of compensatory and punitive damages to the discriminated families,and injunctive relief against further discrimination.
woodliff tendered defense of the action to lmi.he relied upon the provision that lmi would insure him against all claims made based upon his operation and management of the apartment building.lmi declined to defend.although the reasons for lmi decision are not found in this record,ciga conceded at oral argument on this appeal that lmi improperly denied a defense to woodliff.
woodliff retained counsel to defend against the federal actions.the actions were settled when woodliff agreed to build a children playground in the apartment complex.the settlement did not require woodliff to pay any money to the plaintiffs.woodliff incurred attorney fees in defending against these actions.
in,woodliff sued lmi,alleging three causes of action.the first was for breach of contract.woodliff alleged the two federal actions raised claims within the policy coverage so that lmi refusal to defend was a breach of contract.the second was for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.he alleged lmi refused without good cause to provide coverage and a defense to him despite the existence of facts indicating potential coverage.the third,for negligent infliction of emotional distress,alleged woodliff suffered foreseeable emotional distress because of lmi failure to defend.for the cause of action for breach of contract,woodliff sought reimbursement for the attorney fees and costs he had expended to defend against the federal lawsuits.for the causes of action for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and negligent infliction of emotional distress,woodliff sought damages according to proof.
in,a court trial was conducted on woodliff action against lmi.woodliff prevailed in part.the court judgment provides no breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing.hence,no brandt fees and no damages.no proof of emotional distress damages.inadequate proof and no evidence of any such damages over and above what would have been incurred had defendant lmi provided a defense under a reservation of rights.plaintiff archie woodliff is entitled to judgment against lmi for breach of contract.italics added.the court awarded woodliff plus interest,representing the attorney fees and costs woodliff had incurred as a result of lmi failure to defend him in the federal actions 
in,lmi declared insolvency prior to paying woodliff judgment woodliff tendered payment of his judgment against lmi to ciga.ciga denied any obligation to pay the judgment.
woodliff sued ciga for declaratory relief.the parties filed for summary judgment based upon stipulated facts.both motions raised the same legal issue did woodliff claim fall within the statutory exclusion found in section,subdivision h 
insofar as is relevant to this appeal,the trial court ruled in favor of ciga as follows 
the sole issue in dispute is the interpretation of h.as a statutory entity,ciga duties are expressly defined by the insurance code.the insurance code defines covered claims and specifically excludes certain obligations for which the insolvent insurer would otherwise be liable.h excludes loss adjustment expenses,including attorneys fees.in,the statutory language was amended,deleting the words adjustment expense and attorneys fees incurred by the insolvent insurer and inserting the language any loss adjustment expense,court costs,interest and bond premiums incurred.
covered claims are not with an insolvent insurer obligations under its policies.citation.for example,ciga duty to defend is more limited than an insurer duty.citation.
t he fees are expressly excluded by the statutory exception set forth in h.plaintiff argues that because he and not lmi incurred the attorneys fees,the claim does not fall within the exception set forth in the h.however,the above statutory amendment makes it clear that attorneys fees are excluded regardless of who incurs them.
as defendant has established that attorneys fees are excluded from coverage pursuant to h,defendant motion for summary judgment is granted.
this appeal by woodliff follows.
discussion 
woodliff claim is a covered claim within the meaning of statutory law 
the courts of appeal have summarized the history of ciga and its general principles as follows 
ciga was created in as a compulsory association of insurance companies.citation,subd.a.its purpose is to provide insurance against loss arising from the failure of an insolvent insurer to discharge its obligations under its insurance policies.citation.ciga assesses its members when another member becomes insolvent,thereby establishing a fund from which insureds whose insurers become insolvent can obtain financial and legal assistance.citation.member insurers then recoup assessments paid to ciga by means of a surcharge on premiums to their policy holders,subd.a.in this way the insolvency of one insurer does not impact a small segment of insurance consumers,but is spread throughout the insurance consuming public,which in effect subsidizes ciga continued operation.
while ciga general purpose is to pay the obligations of an insolvent insurer,it is not itself an insurer and does not stand in the shoes of the insolvent insurer for all purposes.citation.ciga is not in the business of insurance ciga issues no policies,collects no premiums,makes no profits,and assumes no contractual obligations to the insureds.citation.rather it is authorized by statute to pay only covered claims of an insolvent insurer,those determined by the legislature to be in keeping with the goal of providing protection for the insured public,subd.a.reynolds california ins.guarantee d,d.
since covered claims are not coextensive with an insolvent insurer obligations under its policies,ciga can not and does not stand in the shoes of the insolvent insurer for all purposes.citation.indeed,ciga is expressly forbidden to do so except where the claim at issue is a covered claim.citation.it necessarily follows that ciga first duty is to determine whether a claim placed before it is a covered claim.citation.industrial indemnity workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
section,subdivision c contains the general definition of a covered claim.it provides,in pertinent part covered claims means the obligations of an insolvent insurer,including those i imposed by law and within the coverage of an insurance policy of the insolvent insurer.see also california ins.guarantee superior court d.ciga statutory duties can best be defined by examining the contractual duties which were imposed upon the now insolvent insurer either by law or policy provisions.
on this appeal,ciga concedes there is no dispute that the lmi judgment initially qualifies as a covered claim as that term is defined in insurance code section c.that concession is well taken given our decision in aloha pacific,california ins.guarantee th,d.
there,in regard to the requirement that a covered claim be imposed by law,we held a judgment is the final determination of the rights of the parties in an action or proceeding code civ,and the phrase imposed by law squarely denominates a judgment b y excluding from the primary definition of covered claims a default or stipulated judgment against the insolvent insurer the legislature necessarily determined that a judgment obtained in an adversary setting would constitute an obligation imposed by law.aloha pacific,california ins.guarantee,supra,th at,d.
in regard to the requirement that a covered claim be within the coverage of the insurance policy of the insolvent insurer,we concluded the latter phrase to mean within the risks of loss protected against by an insurance policy.thus the reading of the pertinent portion of subdivision c would be the obligations of an insolvent insurer within the risks of loss protected against by an insurance policy of the insolvent insurer.aloha pacific,california ins.guarantee,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.
particularly relevant to this appeal is the principle that s tandard comprehensive or commercial general liability policies provide that the insurer has a duty to defend the insured in any action brought against the insured seeking damages for any covered claim.it has been stated that,so far as the insured is concerned,the duty to defend may be as important as the duty to indemnify.buss superior court cal th,d,fn.omitted.that is,a n insured buys liability insurance in large part to secure a defense against all claims potentially within policy coverage,even frivolous claims unjustly brought.horace mann ins.barbara cal th,d.consequently,an insurer failure to defend a claim can constitute a breach of contract for which the insurer can be liable for the insured attorney fees,litigation expenses,settlement costs,and the judgment entered against the insured.see,isaacson california ins.guarantee cal d,and state farm mut.auto.ins.allstate ins.d.
the policy lmi issued to woodliff provided lmi had the right and duty to defend any suit seeking specified damages.consequently,one of the risks from which woodliff sought protection by purchasing the lmi policy was the need to mount a legal defense to claim s potentially within the policy coverage.that exactly is the risk that materialized.as the trial court decided in in rendering judgment in woodliff favor on his breach of contract action against lmi based on a claim of a failure to defend,claims potentially covered by lmi policy were made but lmi failed to defend,forcing woodliff to retain counsel at his own expense.
the dispositive issue is whether,as ciga contends,the lmi judgment is excluded from being a statutory claim by virtue of section,subdivision h interpretation of a statute is a question of law.we are not bound by the trial court interpretation.we examine the issue de novo.regents of university of california superior court cal th,d.
because subdivision h,like all statutory provisions,must be read in context,we first set forth the language of subdivision a of section.see,deyoung city of san diego d.subdivision a provides ciga shall pay and discharge covered claims and in connection therewith pay for or furnish loss adjustment services and defenses of claimants when required by policy provisions.subdivision h,in turn,limits the obligation to pay loss adjustment expenses.subdivision h provides covered claims shall not include any loss adjustment expenses,including adjustment fees and expenses,attorney fees and expenses,court costs,interest,and bond premiums,incurred prior to the appointment of a liquidator.italics added.
ciga argued,and the trial court agreed,that woodliff judgment was the functional equivalent of a claim for attorney fees incurred as a loss adjustment expense prior to lmi liquidation and therefore was not a covered claim within the meaning of section,subdivision h.this is also the position taken by our dissenting colleague.we respectfully disagree with this position because we believe it is based upon an incorrect interpretation of the phrase loss adjustment expenses.
as the dissent notes,the term loss adjustment expense is generally understood to refer to attorney fees and expenses incurred by the carrier in either defending or settling claims against the insured.of dis.opn.all of the references we have found support this conclusion for instance,in planet ins.mead reinsurance cir,an excess insurer filed a declaratory relief action to construe the meaning of various policy provisions.one provision at issue was a clause that excluded loss adjustment expenses from ultimate net loss.in construing this provision,the court noted the term,adjustment of losses,means the process of ascertaining the value or amount of a loss or negotiating a compromise or settlement.id.at,citing appleman insurance law and practice.consequently,loss adjustment expenses are generally defined as the costs incurred by the insurer in defending settling the claim.the expenses can include payment to attorneys,investigators,experts,outside adjusters,and court reporters.see state farm mutual automobile ins.quackenbush th,d see also glossary of insurance and risk management terms ed at,defining loss adjustment expense as the cost of investigating and adjusting losses century ins.garamendi cal th,d,administrative regulation promulgated to implement that refers to allocated loss adjustment expenses means the costs associated with the adjustment of specific claims beneficial.ins.kurt hitke cal d,contract between insurer and insurance agency defined loss adjustment expense as the insurer allocated overhead cost in the adjustment of each claim and holmes appleman on insurance glossary of reinsurance terminology,ch,defining loss adjustment expense as t he expense incurred by the ceding insurer in the defense and settlement of claims under its policies but not the insurer overhead expenses.
the bone of contention is whether the term loss adjustment expenses in section,subdivision h also refers to expenses incurred by the insured after the insurer improperly refuses to defend.neither ciga nor the dissent offers any authority to support the position that it does.we will conclude the phrase loss adjustment expenses does not embrace the factual matrix presented on the appeal.at the outset,we note a significant fact the insured woodliff obtained a judgment against the insurer for breach of contract for failing to defend and was awarded damages to compensate him for the loss caused by the failure to defend.because the claim woodliff presented to ciga is predicated upon a final judgment he obtained against the insurer,this case does not present the question of whether ciga would be required to pay if an insured simply tendered a bill from an attorney the insured had retained.our holding is therefore limited to the situation presented here a claim made to ciga after there has been a judicial adjudication the insurer had breached its contractual duty to defend and an award of compensatory damages based upon that finding.
we first examine the language of section.subdivision a of the statute provides if a claim presented by the insured to ciga falls within the statutory definition of a covered claim so that ciga is required to defend,ciga is required to pay for or furnish loss adjustment services ancillary to that defense.however,subdivision h then limits ciga obligation to pay for loss adjustment expenses to those incurred after ciga has become involved.loss adjustment expenses incurred before a liquidator has been appointed for the insurer are specifically excluded from the scope of a covered claim.in other words,ciga has no obligation for loss adjustment expenses,including attorney fees,incurred to defend the insured before the insurer became insolvent and a liquidator was appointed.as explained below,subdivision h simply represents a legislative rejection of a proposal to render ciga liable for loss adjustment expenses incurred by the insurer before insolvency.
when viewed in this context,section,subdivision h does not support ciga argument.woodliff claim presented to ciga was not a claim from a creditor of lmi,a law firm,outside adjuster,investigator who had incurred expenses to help defend woodliff prior to lmi insolvency.instead,the claim was a judgment entered against lmi following a trial in which the court had found lmi had breached its contract with woodliff by failing to defend him.the mere fact the judgment amount is based upon the attorney fees woodliff incurred in defending after lmi declined his tender and before lmi became insolvent and a liquidator was appointed does not transform woodliff claim into a demand for payment of loss adjustment expenses.the key point is that the judgment compensates woodliff for a benefit under the lmi policy denied to him by lmi a defense against a covered claim.
to a certain extent,ciga attempts to avoid the force of this conclusion by relying upon some legislative history to subdivisions a and h of section.this approach is not persuasive.for one thing,in determining the legislature intent in enacting a statute,we first look to the words of the statute itself and give those words their usual and ordinary meaning.we only consult legislative materials when the words of a statute are susceptible of more than one reasonable construction.granberry islay investments cal th,d.
the language of section,subdivision h is clear ciga is not required to pay loss adjustment expenses incurred prior to the insurer insolvency.this furthers the policy behind ciga of creating an institution that can fulfill the function of providing relief to the insureds of an insolvent insurer because it exempts from ciga obligation any requirement to pay third party vendors such as attorneys,investigators,who had rendered services prior to the insurer insolvency.
in any event,the material relied upon by ciga does not support a contrary conclusion.ciga first notes a bill was introduced in to amend subdivision a of section to require ciga to pay loss adjustment services and any reasonable necessary defense expenses remaining unpaid on the date of the insurer insolvency and to add subdivision h which would read covered claims shall include adjustment expense and attorney fees incurred by the insolvent insurer prior to the appointment of a liquidator.ciga then notes the legislature rejected these amendments and,instead,amended section,subdivision a to provide,as it presently reads,ciga shall pay and discharge covered claims and in connection therewith pay for or furnish loss adjustment services and defenses of claimants when required by policy provisions.the earlier language requiring ciga to also pay reasonable and necessary defense expenses remaining unpaid on the date of the insolvency had been deleted.subdivision h to section had been amended to include the word not so it then read covered claims shall not include adjustment expense and attorney fees incurred by the insolvent insurer prior to the appointment of a liquidator.italics added.
this legislative decision to reject the proposal ciga pay preliquidation loss adjustment expenses does not support ciga present position that it has no obligation to woodliff judgment against lmi.the legislature simply determined to limit ciga financial responsibility by deleting any responsibility for costs incurred by the insurer prior to insolvency.this distinction has a sound policy basis.as the michigan supreme court explained in rejecting the claims of attorneys for services rendered prior to the insolvency of three insurers as being outside the scope of michigan version of ciga the act is designed to protect from potentially catastrophic loss persons who have a right to rely on the existence of an insurance insureds and persons with claims against the insureds.persons in such categories are relatively helpless with regard to the insolvency of an insurer.they are not likely to be in a position to evaluate the financial stability of the insurance company and they have no control over the time at which their claims arise.other creditors of the insurance companies,such as attorneys,have an ongoing relationship with the company and can presumably judge its financial position.further,they are in a position to protect themselves from the serious consequences of an insurance company insolvency by negotiating appropriate provisions in their contracts regarding the frequency of billing and payment.metry,metry,sanom ashare,supra,at.the ohio court of appeals reached a similar conclusion in ohio ins.guar.ass simpson ohio app d.there the question was whether the ohio insurance guaranty association was liable to an attorney for services he had provided to an insurance company before its insolvency.the court concluded the claim was not a covered claim within the meaning of the statutory scheme because the purpose of the law was to protect policyholders and persons who had claims against the policyholders,not general creditors of insolvent insurance companies.the attorney claim does not arise out of any insurance policy instead,it arises out of his contract with the insurer for legal services.id.at.we therefore conclude that nothing in our state legislature decision to exempt ciga from liability for expenses suggests it sought to exempt from ciga liability a claim based upon a judgment an insured recovered from the insurer for failing to defend.it merely sought to deny access to ciga financial resources to third party creditors of an insolvent insurer.
ciga next points to a amendment of subdivision h of section.the amendment had two aspects.first,the language incurred by the insolvent insurer was deleted.second,the definition of loss adjustment expenses was expanded.stats,ch.as so amended,the provision now reads as set forth earlier in this opinion covered claims shall not include any loss adjustment expenses,including adjustment fees and expenses,attorney fees and expenses,court costs,interest,and bond premiums,incurred prior to the appointment of a liquidator.
from this ciga argues t he legislature clearly expressed an intent to exclude from ciga obligations any attorneys fees and costs regardless of who incurred them the insolvent insurer,the insured,or anyone else.we are not persuaded.
for one thing,nothing in the legislative history of this amendment supports such a conclusion as counsel for amici curiae noted at oral argument,there is a more pragmatic explanation for the amendment the elimination of a redundancy since,as explained earlier at pages,loss adjustment expenses are generally interpreted to mean expenses incurred by the insurer,not the insured.
in any event,the analytical flaw with ciga argument is that it continues to equate a judgment obtained by an insured against the insurer for refusal to defend with preliquidation attorneys fees and costs.as explained earlier,the two are not the same.in other words,this is not the situation in which the insured has presented ciga with a bill for services rendered prior to insolvency by a third party,an attorney in regard to a claim under the insurer policy instead,this is a situation in which the insurer failed to defend when it should have,the insured incurred attorney fees,and the insured recovered a judgment for the damages caused by the contractual failure to defend.woodliff claim to ciga is one made by a policyholder for policy benefits due but not paid by the now insolvent insurer.
the dissent response to our analysis is that a literal reading of section subdivision h requires rejection of woodliff argument.literally applied the dissent conclusion is understandable.however,realistically such a conclusion is not acceptable.a cardinal rule of statutory construction is that a literal meaning of a statute may be disregarded to avoid an absurd result.see california school employees governing board cal th,d,wells fargo bank superior court cal d,county of sacramento hickman cal d,fn.we believe it would be absurd to deny woodliff recovery from ciga for a benefit of his policy simply because his claim represents the amount spent on legal representation.for instance,if woodliff either had to pay money to settle the two federal actions or if he had chosen not to retain counsel but instead defended himself in propria persona and a judgment was rendered against him,he could have also recovered either of those sums as damages in a breach of contract action against lmi.a request to ciga to pay a claim based upon a judgment for either of those amounts would not have fallen within the exclusionary ambit of subdivision h bar on recovery of loss adjustment expenses.the fact woodliff incurred no damages other than attorney fees and related costs should not result in ciga being able to deny what it otherwise concedes is a covered claim.it would constitute an absurd result to exempt ciga from liability merely because the damages recovered were the exact amount spent on legal representation.this result would be nonsensical because it would penalize the insured for having retained counsel and,in effect,would require him to forgo legal representation an undisputed benefit of his policy with lmi and leave himself at the mercy of the claim.
requiring ciga to pay woodliff claim is consistent with ciga objective to protect against a loss arising from the failure of an insolvent insurer to discharge its obligations under its insurance policies.citation.biggs california ins.guarantee,supra,d.as set forth above,a significant portion of an insured reasonable expectation of coverage is that the insurer will pay to provide a defense against suits within the policy coverage.because ciga is intended to protect insureds,the risk of that loss failure to defend should not be shifted,as ciga essentially urges,to the insured when prior to insolvency the insured has obtained a judgment based upon the insurer refusal to defend such a result runs entirely counter to the whole purpose and philosophy behind ciga which is to protect insureds,not place upon them unusual risks they would not have faced if their insurer has not become insolvent.california ins.guarantee superior court,supra,d at,fn.omitted.
our conclusion is fortified by applying a venerable principle of statutory construction.under the familiar rule of construction,expressio unius est exclusio alterius,where exceptions to a general rule are specified by statute,other exceptions are not to be implied or presumed.citations.wildlife alive chickering cal d.as ciga points out,a approach is taken to decide whether ciga is liable on a claim.the first step is to determine whether the proffered claim is a covered claim as defined by section,subdivision c.as noted earlier,ciga properly concedes woodliff claim meets that statutory definition.the next step is to determine whether there is any statutory exception to exempt ciga from liability.we have already rejected ciga argument that the exception in subdivision h of section applies to this case.however,pertinent to this analysis is another statutory exception subdivision g of section.it states a covered claim shall not include any judgments against or obligations or liabilities of the insolvent insurer resulting from alleged or proven torts.we believe that by explicitly excluding a tort judgment from the definition of a covered claim,the legislature implicitly included judgments against the insurer grounded on other theories of law such as breach of contract for failure to defend 
carver workers comp.appeals bd.d.is instructive on this point.there,the insurer issued a workers compensation policy.an employee of the insured was injured at work.he first filed a workers compensation claim and later filed,relying upon labor code section a petition for a penalty based on the insurer failure to make timely payments as required by law.the insurer thereafter became insolvent.in subsequent proceedings,it was conceded ciga was required to pay the claim for workers compensation benefits however,the parties disputed whether ciga was also liable for the penalty award the workers compensation judge had issued.
ciga relied upon the provision,now found in subdivision g of section that a covered claim does not include any judgments against or obligations or liabilities of the insolvent insurer resulting from alleged or proven torts.the court of appeal rejected this argument.it held we do not find the fixed percentage assessed by labor code section to be analogous to tort damages in the civil field.we conclude that it is more in the nature of a statutory method of ensuring the timely return to work of injured workers by providing an economic incentive to employers to make the payments due for prompt necessary treatment under the labor code.ciga,as a creature of statute,is bound to pay all covered claims in the absence of a statutory exclusion.no tort liability was imposed on the insolvent workers compensation carrier in the instant case,since the board does not adjudicate tort claims.the amount at issue herein is clearly a workers compensation benefit,not tort damages,and is not excluded section.carver workers comp.appeals,supra,d,fn.omitted.
by a parity of reasoning,woodliff judgment against lmi is likewise a covered claim not within any statutory exclusion.the judgment was based solely on breach of contract the trial court,in fact,rejected the tort claim the judgment compensates woodliff for a benefit due under the policy costs of defense.no statutory provision exempts ciga for liability for this claim.ciga is therefore liable for the claim as a matter of law,rendering the trial court grant of summary judgment to ciga error.
b.a triable issue of fact exists as to the amount woodliff can recover from ciga 
disposition 
the trial court grant of ciga summary judgment motion is reversed.the trial court is directed to grant woodliff summary judgment motion after determining the disposition of the plus interest that was to be held in trust to satisfy an outstanding claim from woodliff prior counsel.woodliff is to recover costs on appeal.
the facts are uncontradicted and accurately reflected in the majority opinion.i briefly summarize the pertinent facts.
