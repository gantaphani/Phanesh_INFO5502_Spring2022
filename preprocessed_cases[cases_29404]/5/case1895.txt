ii.general principles regarding entitlement to attorney fees and costs 
whether a party to litigation is entitled to recover costs is governed by code of civil procedure section,which provides,in subdivision b,that e xcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute,a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.santisas goodin cal th,d.these costs,however,do not include the attorney fees the prevailing party has incurred in the litigation unless an agreement between the parties provides for the recovery of those fees,or a statute creates a right of recovery.code civ,stephens coldwell banker commercial group,d,overruled on other grounds in white ultramar,cal th,fn,d.
when authorized by contract,the right to attorney fees is made reciprocal by civil code section.under this statute,in any action on a contract,where the contract specifically provides that attorney fees and costs,which are incurred to enforce that contract,shall be awarded either to one of the parties or to the prevailing party,then the party who is determined to be the party prevailing on the contract,whether he or she is the party specified in the contract or not,shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees in addition to other costs,subd.a.this provision has been interpreted to mean that when determining the prevailing party for purposes of contractual attorney fees,such as here,the determination is to be made without reference to the success or failure of noncontract claims.hsu abbara cal th,d.
with respect to contractually based fee awards,a party prevailing on the contract is the party who recovers a greater net relief in that portion of the action based upon the contract,subd.b hsu abbara,supra,cal th,d.where a section fee award is made at the trial level,the prevailing party may,at the appropriate time,request fees attributable to a subsequent appeal.morcos board of retirement cal d,serrano unruh cal d.
prior to,trial courts had the authority to award statutory attorney fees incurred on appeal,but could only award contractual attorney fees if the appellate court ordered it to do so.the reason for the distinction between contractually authorized and statutorily authorized attorney fees was simple attorney fees authorized by statute were specifically listed as costs under code of civil procedure sections,and.by contrast,contractual attorney fees were special damages and could be awarded only upon pleading and proof.thus,they could not be taxed as costs.harbour,anderson th,d.
in the legislature eliminated the distinction by amending code of civil procedure section to specifically provide that costs include attorney fees authorized by contract,statute,or law.citations.the comment following that amendment states in pertinent part,the legislature finds and declares that there is great uncertainty as to the procedure to be followed in awarding attorney fees where entitlement thereto is provided by contract to the prevailing party.it is the intent of the legislature in enacting this act to confirm that these attorney fees are costs citation.harbour,anderson,supra,th,d.accordingly,because contractually authorized attorney fees are now listed as costs under code of civil procedure section,they may either be requested of the appellate court while the appeal is pending,or of the trial court upon issuance of the remittitur.the trial court has jurisdiction to award them,regardless of the lack of specific instructions in the opinion or the remittitur.id.at,d.
the court in mustachio great western bank th,d mustachio,established the rule that trial courts retain discretion to award attorney fees incurred on appeal to the eventual prevailing party without any order from the appellate court,even where the appellate court,in its remand order,orders the parties to bear their own appellate costs.as the court noted i t is well settled a party who prevails on appeal is not entitled under a civil code section fee provision to the fees he incurs on appeal where the appellate decision does not decide who wins the lawsuit but instead contemplates further proceedings in the trial court citations the provisions allowing costs on appeal citations,however,are entirely separate from the contractual provision for fees and do not depend on the party winning the appeal being the ultimate prevailing party citations.id.at,d.
iii.california rules of court,former rule c 
rule c now numbered rule c provided unless the court orders otherwise,an award of costs neither includes attorney fees on appeal nor precludes a party from seeking them under rule.emphasis added.prior to,this rule was numbered as rule and read as follows unless otherwise ordered by the reviewing court,i an order or judgment regarding costs on appeal neither includes attorney fees on appeal nor precludes any party from seeking fees on appeal and ii the issue of entitlement to attorney fees on appeal shall be determined by motion made in the trial court under rule.former rule a,emphasis added.
it is true that this language implies an appellate court may order an award of costs to a prevailing party that includes attorney fees on appeal.this does not mean,however,that the rule itself provides a substantive basis for an appellate court to award or to disallow attorney fees to the prevailing party.what the initial clause implies is that when a party claims the right to an award of attorney fees on appeal pursuant to a contract or a statute,the party may request that award from the appellate court in the first instance,and the appellate court may make that award.see,harbour,anderson,supra,th,d.even when that happens,however,the right to recover attorney fees does not arise from the rule it arises from the applicable contract or statute.accordingly,former rule c does not provide a substantive basis for this court to award or deny attorney fees on appeal.
appellants read much significance into the amendment to rule.they contend respondents can not recover the fees incurred in the prior appeal because our remittitur directed each party to bear its own costs on appeal.the argument proceeds that since no award of costs was made,
