a group of public entities composed of various california counties and cities collectively referred to as the public entities are prosecuting a action against numerous businesses that manufactured lead paint collectively referred to as defendants.the public entities are represented both by their own government attorneys and by several private law firms.the private law firms are retained by the public entities on a basis.after summary judgment was granted in favor of defendants on various tort causes of action initially advanced by the public entities,the complaint eventually was amended to leave the action as the sole claim,and abatement as the sole remedy.
defendants moved to bar the public entities from compensating their privately retained counsel by means of contingent fees.the superior court,relying upon this court decision in people ex rel.clancy superior court cal d clancy,ordered the public entities barred from compensating their private counsel by means of any agreement,reasoning that under clancy,all attorneys prosecuting actions must be absolutely neutral.the superior court concluded that clancy therefore precluded any arrangement in which private counsel has a financial stake in the outcome of a case brought on behalf of the public.on petition of the public entities seeking a writ of mandate,the court of appeal held that clancy does not bar all agreements with private counsel in abatement actions,but only those in which private attorneys appear in place of,rather than with and under the supervision of,government attorneys.
we must decide whether the court of appeal correctly construed our opinion in clancy,or if that case instead broadly prohibits all agreements between public entities and private counsel in any action prosecuted on behalf of the public.clancy arguably supports defendants position favoring a rule barring any attorney with a financial interest in the outcome of a case from representing the interests of the public in a abatement action.as set forth below,however,a reexamination of our opinion in clancy suggests that our decision in that case should be narrowed,in recognition of both the wide array of actions and the corresponding diversity in the types of interests implicated by various prosecutions,and the different means by which prosecutorial duties may be delegated to private attorneys without compromising either the integrity of the prosecution or the public faith in the judicial process.
the procedural history of this case is not in dispute.the public entities claims against defendants originally included causes of action for fraud,strict liability,negligence,unfair business practices,and public nuisance county of santa clara atlantic richfield th,santa clara.the superior court granted defendants motion for summary judgment on all causes of action.the court of appeal reversed the superior court judgment of dismissal and ordered the lower court to reinstate the,negligence,strict liability,and fraud causes of action.id.at.thereafter,the public entities filed a fourth amended complaint that alleged a single cause of action,for public nuisance,and sought only abatement.throughout this litigation,the public entities have been represented both by their government counsel and by private counsel.
upon remand following santa clara,supra,defendants filed a motion to bar payment of contingent fees to private attorneys,asserting that the government can not retain a private attorney on a contingent fee basis to litigate a public nuisance claim.defendants sought an order that precludes plaintiffs from retaining outside counsel under any agreement in which payment of fees and costs is contingent on the outcome of the litigation.
defendants attached to their motion a number of fee agreements between the public entities and their private counsel,and the public entities filed opposition to which they attached their fee agreements and declarations of their government attorneys and private counsel.the fee agreements and declarations disclose that the public entities and private counsel agreed that,other than that would be forwarded by santa clara to cover initial costs,private counsel would incur all further costs and would not receive any legal fees unless the action were successful.if the action succeeded,private counsel would be entitled to recover any unreimbursed costs from the recovery and a fee of percent of the net recovery.
some of the agreements in the present case specify the respective authority of both private counsel and public counsel to control the conduct of the pending litigation.the fee agreements between private counsel and san francisco,santa clara,alameda,monterey,and san diego explicitly provide that the public entities government counsel retain final authority over all aspects of the litigation.private counsel for those five public entities submitted declarations confirming that their clients government counsel retain complete control over the litigation the two remaining fee agreements contained in the involving solano and to grant private counsel absolute discretion in the decision of who to sue and who not to sue,if anyone,and what theories to plead and what evidence to present.during proceedings in the trial court,oakland disclaimed this fee agreement and asserted that its government counsel had retained complete control of the litigation and intended to revise the agreement to reflect this circumstance solano private counsel asserts that its public counsel have maintained and continue s to maintain complete control over all aspects of the litigation and all decision making authority and responsibility.the record before us does not contain the fee agreements between the three other petitioners and their respective private counsel 
the various fee agreements provide different definitions of recovery.some of the agreements define the term recovery as moneys other than civil penalties,whereas others define this term as the amount recovered,by way of judgment,settlement,or other resolution.some of the agreements include the phrase both monetary and in their definitions of recovery.the san diego agreement defines net recovery as the payment of money,stock,the value of the abatement remedy after the deduction of the costs paid or to be paid.the santa clara fee agreement provides that,i n the event that the litigation is resolved by settlement under terms involving the provision of goods,services or any other payment,the santa clara county counsel agrees to seek,as part of any such settlement,a mutually agreeable monetary settlement of attorneys fees and expenses.
in april,the superior court heard defendants motion to bar payment as well as the public entities motion for leave to file a fourth amended complaint.the court granted the public entities motion and ordered that the pleading be filed within days.
although some preliminary issues were raised concerning the ripeness of defendants motion,the superior court resolved the motion on its merits.the court rejected the public entities claim that clancy,supra,cal d,was distinguishable,concluding instead that under clancy,outside counsel must be precluded from operating under a contingent fee agreement,regardless of the government attorneys and outside attorneys intentions to have all decisions in this litigation made by the government attorneys.the court granted defendants motion and entered an order preclud ing plaintiffs from retaining outside counsel under any agreement in which the payment of fees and costs is contingent on the outcome of the litigation but the court allowed the public entities days to file with the court new fee agreements or declarations detailing the fee arrangements with outside counsel.
the public entities sought a writ of mandate in the court of appeal.after issuing an order to show cause,the appellate court ultimately set aside the superior court ruling and issued a writ commanding the lower court to set aside its order granting defendants motion,and enter a new order denying defendants motion.although acknowledging that clancy purported to bar the participation of private counsel on a basis in abatement lawsuits brought in the name of a public entity,the court of appeal held that the rule set forth in clancy is not categorical and does not bar the fee agreements made in the present case,because those agreements specified that the government attorneys would maintain full control over the litigation.the appellate court,briefly noting that the suit being prosecuted did not seek to impose criminal liability or infringe upon fundamental constitutional rights,reasoned that the circumstance that the private attorneys are being supervised by public lawyers vitiates any concern regarding the neutrality of outside counsel.we granted defendants petition for review.
we begin our inquiry with this court decision in clancy.in that case,the city of corona corona hired james clancy,a private attorney,to bring nuisance abatement actions against a business the book store,which sold adult materials.clancy,supra,cal d at.the hiring of clancy followed several attempts by corona to terminate the operations of this establishment.specifically,several months after the book store opened,corona adopted two ordinances that purported to regulate adult bookstores,one defining sex oriented material and the other restricting the sale of such material to certain zones in corona.ibid.after the owner of the book store,helen ebel,filed an action in federal court,the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit ultimately held both ordinances to be unconstitutional.ebel city of corona cir.
corona subsequently retained the services of clancy to abate nuisances under the authority of a new ordinance,proposed on the same day clancy was hired and seemingly targeted specifically at the book store.clancy,supra,cal d at.the ordinance defined a public nuisance as a ny and every place of business in the city in which obscene publications constitute all of the stock in trade,or a principal part thereof ibid.the employment contract between corona and clancy,who was an independent contractor rather than an employee id.at,provided that he was to be paid per hour for his work in bringing actions,except that he would be paid only per hour for his work in any action in which corona did not prevail or in which corona prevailed but did not recover attorney fees.id.at.
two weeks after the ordinance was enacted,corona passed a resolution declaring the book store to be a public nuisance and revoking its business license.thereafter,corona and clancy as the city special attorney filed a complaint against ebel,her son thomas ebel,another individual,and the book store,seeking abatement of a public nuisance,declaratory judgment,and an injunction.clancy,supra,cal d at.the ebels unsuccessfully attempted to disqualify clancy as the attorney for corona.clancy,at.the ebels then sought writ relief,contending it was improper for an attorney representing the government to have a financial stake in the outcome of an action to abate a public nuisance,and asserting that a government attorney prosecuting such actions must be neutral,as must an attorney prosecuting a criminal case.id.at.this court generally agreed,finding the arrangement between corona and clancy inappropriate under the circumstances.id.at.
we observe as a threshold matter that our decision to disqualify clancy from representing corona in the action was founded not upon any specific statutory provision or rule governing the conduct of attorneys,but rather upon the courts general authority to disqualify counsel when necessary in the furtherance of justice.clancy,supra,cal d at.invoking that authority,this court stated that it may order that clancy be dismissed from the case if we find the contingent fee arrangement prejudices the ebels.ibid.
we concluded that for purposes of evaluating the propriety of a agreement between a public entity and a private attorney,the neutrality rules applicable to criminal prosecutors were equally applicable to government attorneys prosecuting certain civil cases.clancy,supra,cal d at.accordingly,our decision set forth the responsibilities associated with the prosecution of a criminal case,noting that a prosecutor does not represent merely an ordinary party to a controversy,but instead is the representative of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all and whose interest,therefore,in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case,but that justice shall be done.clancy,supra,cal d at see people superior court cal d,greer.we noted that a prosecutor duty of neutrality stems from two fundamental aspects of his or her employment.as a representative of the government,a prosecutor must act with the impartiality required of those who govern.moreover,because a prosecutor has as a resource the vast power of the government,he or she must refrain from abusing that power by failing to act evenhandedly.clancy,supra,cal d at.with these principles in mind,we declared that not only is a government lawyer neutrality essential to a fair outcome for the litigants in the case in which he is involved,it is essential to the proper function of the judicial process as a whole.ibid.
recognizing that a city attorney is a public official,we noted that the rigorous ethical duties imposed on a criminal prosecutor also apply to government lawyers generally.clancy,supra,cal d at.thus,pursuant to the american bar association then model code of professional responsibility,a lawyer who is a public officer should not engage in activities in which his personal or professional interests are or foreseeably may be in conflict with his official duties.clancy,supra,cal d at,quoting former aba model code responsibility,ec.an attorney holding public office should avoid all conduct which might lead the layman to conclude that the attorney is utilizing his public position to further his professional success or personal interests.clancy,supra,cal d at,quoting aba com.on ethics,opn.notably,we held that because public lawyers handling noncriminal matters are subject to the same ethical rules applicable to public prosecutors,there is a class of civil actions that demands the representative of the government to be absolutely neutral.this requirement precludes the use in such cases of a contingent fee arrangement.clancy,supra,cal d at.
we further held that abatement actions belong to the class of civil cases in which counsel representing the government must be absolutely neutral.clancy,supra,cal d at.we came to this conclusion by analogizing a abatement action to an eminent domain type of proceeding in which we already had concluded that government attorneys must be unaffected by personal interest.id.at,citing city of los angeles decker cal d.
we explained t he abatement of a public nuisance involves a balancing of interests.on the one hand is the interest of the people in ridding their city of an obnoxious or dangerous condition on the other hand is the interest of the landowner in using his property as he wishes.and when an establishment such as an adult bookstore is the subject of the abatement action,something more is added to the balance not only does the landowner have a first amendment interest in selling protected material,but the public has a first amendment interest in having such material available for purchase.thus,as with an eminent domain action,the abatement of a public nuisance involves a delicate weighing of values.any financial arrangement that would tempt the government attorney to tip the scale can not be tolerated.clancy,supra,cal d at.moreover,a suit to abate a public nuisance can trigger a criminal prosecution of the owner of the property.this connection between the civil and criminal aspects of public nuisance law further supports the need for a neutral prosecuting attorney.ibid.
we concluded that james he was an independent contractor and not an employee of the city of was subject to the same neutrality guidelines applicable to corona public lawyers,because a lawyer can not escape the heightened ethical requirements of one who performs governmental functions merely by declaring he is not a public official.the responsibility follows the job if clancy is performing tasks on behalf of and in the name of the government to which greater standards of neutrality apply,he must adhere to those standards.clancy,supra,cal d at.
finally,we held that because clancy hourly rate would double in the event corona were successful in the litigation against the ebels and the book store,it was evident that clancy had an interest extraneous to his official function in the actions he was prosecuting on behalf of corona.accordingly,the contingent fee arrangement between the city and clancy is antithetical to the standard of neutrality that an attorney representing the government must meet when prosecuting a public nuisance abatement action.in the interests of justice,therefore,we must order clancy disqualified from representing the city in the pending abatement action.clancy,supra,cal d at.we expressly noted that corona was not precluded from rehiring clancy to represent it on other terms.id.at,fn.
importantly,we also noted that n othing we say herein should be construed as preventing the government,under appropriate circumstances,from engaging private counsel.certainly there are cases in which a government may hire an attorney on a contingent fee to try a civil case.clancy,supra,cal d at.as an example of such a permissible instance of representation,we cited denio city of huntington beach cal d,a case in which we had approved a arrangement between the city of huntington beach and a law firm hired to represent it in all matters relating to protection of the city oil rights.thus,we recognized that arrangements in ordinary civil cases generally are permitted.clancy,supra,cal d at.
as is evident from the preceding discussion,our decision in clancy,supra,cal d,was guided,in large part,by the circumstance that the action pursued by corona implicated interests akin to those inherent in a criminal prosecution.in light of this similarity,we found it appropriate to invoke directly the disqualification rules applicable to criminal that categorically bar agreements in all instances.as we observed in clancy,contracts for criminal prosecutors have been recognized to be unethical and potentially unconstitutional,but there is virtually no law on the subject.clancy,supra,cal d at.nonetheless,we noted it is generally accepted that any type of arrangement conditioning a public prosecutor remuneration upon the outcome of a case is widely condemned,citing aba stds.for criminal justice,prosecution function,com.to former std.e it is clear that fee systems of remuneration for prosecuting attorneys raise serious ethical and perhaps constitutional problems,are totally unacceptable under modern conditions,and should be abolished promptly.
accordingly,although there are virtually no cases considering the propriety of compensation of public prosecutors pursuant to a arrangement,it would appear that under most,if not all,circumstances,such a method of compensation would be categorically barred.this is so because giving a public prosecutor a direct pecuniary interest in the outcome of a case that he or she is prosecuting would render it unlikely that the defendant would receive a fair trial,subd.a see greer,supra,cal d at explaining that disqualification was required in order to protect the defendant fundamental due process right not to be deprived of liberty without a fair trial,and to enforce the prosecutor obligation to respect this mandate.
our opinion in clancy recognized that the interests invoked in that case were akin to the vital interests implicated in a criminal prosecution,and thus invocation of the disqualification rules applicable to criminal prosecutors was justified.and if those rules are found to be equally applicable in the case now before us,disqualification of the private attorneys hired to assist the public entities similarly would be required.
as explained below,however,to the extent our decision in clancy suggested that prosecutions always invoke the same constitutional and institutional interests present in a criminal case,our analysis was unnecessarily broad and failed to take into account the wide spectrum of cases that fall within the rubric.in the present case,both the types of remedies sought and the types of interests implicated differ significantly from those involved in clancy and,accordingly,invocation of the strict rules requiring the automatic disqualification of criminal prosecutors is unwarranted.
the broad spectrum of law may implicate both civil and criminal liability indeed,actions vary widely,as evidenced by penal code section,which broadly defines a public nuisance as a nything which is injurious to health,or is indecent,or offensive to the senses,or an obstruction to the free use of property,so as to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property by an entire community or neighborhood,or by any considerable number of persons,or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use,in the customary manner,of any navigable lake,or river,bay,stream,canal,or basin,or any public park,square,street or highway 
although in clancy we spoke generally of a balancing of interests and a delicate weighing of values clancy,supra,cal d at,our concerns regarding neutrality,fairness,and a possible abuse of the judicial process by an interested party appear to have been highly influenced by the circumstances of the case then before attempt by the city of corona to shut down a single adult bookstore.as set forth above,when corona first attempts at legislating the bookstore out of business were ruled unconstitutional,it hired a private attorney with a personal and pecuniary interest in the case to file a nuisance action against the bookstore pursuant to a newly enacted ordinance that clearly was intended to specifically target that business.
the history of corona efforts to shut down the bookstore revealed a profound imbalance between the institutional power and resources of the government and the limited means and influence of the vital property rights were threatened.under california law,the continued operation of an established,lawful business is subject to heightened protections.see goat hill tavern city of costa mesa th,continued operation of business that was making recent substantial improvements was recognized as a vested right livingston rock.county of cal d,noting that businesses generally can not be immediately terminated due to nonconformance with rezoning ordinances,because of the hardship and doubtful constitutionality of such discontinuance.it was in this factual setting that we noted that the abatement of a public nuisance involves a balancing of interests.on the one hand is the interest of the people in ridding their city of an obnoxious or dangerous condition on the other hand is the interest of the landowner in using his property as he wishes.clancy,supra,cal d at.
the case also implicated both the defendants and the public constitutional rights.as we recognized in clancy,the operation of the adult bookstore involved speech that arguably was protected in part,and thus curtailment of the right to disseminate the books in question could significantly infringe upon the ebels liberty interest in free speech.again,our focus upon the critical balancing of interests was guided by the circumstance that corona was attempting to abate a public nuisance created by an adult adding something more to the balance not only does the landowner have a first amendment interest in selling protected material,but the public has a first amendment interest in having such material available for purchase.clancy,supra,cal d at.
it is evident that the nature of the particular nuisance action involved in clancy was an important factor in leading us to conclude the rules governing the disqualification of criminal prosecutors properly should be invoked to disqualify james clancy the direct application of those rules was warranted because the abatement action at issue implicated important constitutional concerns,threatened ongoing business activity,and carried the threat of criminal liability.in light of these interests,the case required the same balancing of interests and delicate weighing of values on the part of the government attorney prosecuting the case as would be required in a criminal prosecution.because of this strong correlation,the disqualification of a private attorney with a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case was mandated.
the action in the present case,by contrast,involves a qualitatively different set of that are not substantially similar to the fundamental rights at stake in a criminal prosecution.we find this distinguishing circumstance to be dispositive.as set forth above,neutrality is a critical concern in criminal prosecutions because of the important constitutional liberty interests at stake.on the other hand,in ordinary civil cases,we do not require neutrality when the government acts as an ordinary party to a controversy,simply enforcing its own contract and property rights against individuals and entities that allegedly have infringed upon those interests.indeed,as discussed above,we specifically observed in clancy that the government was not precluded from engaging private counsel on a basis in an ordinary civil case.thus,for example,public entities may employ private counsel on such a basis to litigate a tort action involving damage to government property,or to prosecute other actions in which the governmental entity interests in the litigation are those of an ordinary party,rather than those of the public.clancy,supra,cal d at.
the present case falls between these two extremes on the spectrum of neutrality required of a government attorney.the present matter is not an ordinary civil case in that the public entities attorneys are appearing as representatives of the public and not as counsel for the government acting as an ordinary party in a civil controversy.a abatement action must be prosecuted by a governmental entity and may not be initiated by a private party unless the nuisance is personally injurious to that private party,a private person may maintain an action for a public nuisance,if it is specially injurious to himself,but not otherwise,a public nuisance may be abated by any public body or officer authorized thereto by law.there can be no question,therefore,that the present case is being prosecuted on behalf of the public,and that accordingly the concerns we identified in clancy as being inherent in a public prosecution are,indeed,implicated in the case now before us.
yet,neither are the interests affected in this case similar in character to those invoked by a criminal prosecution or the nuisance action in clancy.although the remedy for the successful prosecution of the present case is unclear,we can confidently deduce what the remedy will not be.this case will not result in an injunction that prevents the defendants from continuing their current business operations.the challenged conduct the production and distribution of lead paint has been illegal since.accordingly,whatever the outcome of the litigation,no ongoing business activity will be enjoined.nor will the case prevent defendants from exercising any first amendment right or any other liberty interest.although liability may be based in part on prior commercial speech,the remedy will not involve enjoining current or future speech.finally,because the challenged conduct has long since ceased,the statute of limitations on any criminal prosecution has run and there is neither a threat nor a possibility of criminal liability being imposed upon defendants.
the adjudication of this action will involve at least some balancing of interests,such as the social utility of defendants product against the harm it has caused,and may implicate the rights exercised by defendants when they marketed their products and petitioned the government to oppose regulations.nevertheless,that balancing process and those constitutional rights involve only past ongoing marketing,petitioning,or interests.instead,the trial court will be asked to determine whether defendants should be held liable for creating a nuisance and,if so,how the nuisance should be abated.this case will result,at most,in defendants having to expend resources to abate the nuisance they allegedly created,either by paying into a fund dedicated to that abatement purpose or by undertaking the abatement themselves.the expenditure of resources to abate a hazardous substance affecting the environment is the type of remedy one might find in an ordinary civil case and does not threaten the continued operation of an existing business.
of course,because this is a action,and the public entities are not merely pursuing abatement on government property but on private property located within their jurisdictions,defendants potential exposure may be very substantial.the possibility of such a substantial judgment,however,does not affect the type of fundamental rights implicated in criminal prosecutions or in clancy,supra,cal d.there is no indication that the arrangements in the present case have created a danger of governmental overreaching or economic coercion.defendants are large corporations with access to abundant monetary and legal resources.accordingly,the concern we expressed in clancy about the misuse of governmental resources against an outmatched individual defendant is not implicated in the present case.
thus,contrast to the situation in a liberty interest nor the right of an existing business to continued operation is threatened by the present prosecution,this case is closer on the spectrum to an ordinary civil case than it is to a criminal prosecution.the role played in the current setting both by the government attorneys and by the private attorneys differs significantly from that played by the private attorney in clancy.accordingly,the absolute prohibition on arrangements imported in clancy from the context of criminal proceedings is unwarranted in the circumstances of the present civil action 
nevertheless,as set forth above,because the abatement action is being prosecuted on behalf of the public,the attorneys prosecuting this action,although not subject to the same stringent rules governing the conduct of criminal prosecutors or adjudicators,are subject to a heightened standard of ethical conduct applicable to public officials acting in the name of the that would not be invoked in an ordinary civil case.
the underlying principle that guided our decision in clancy was that a civil attorney acting on behalf of a public entity,in prosecuting a civil case such as a abatement action,is entrusted with the unique power of the government and therefore must refrain from abusing that power by failing to act in an evenhanded manner.clancy,supra,cal d at see also greer,supra,cal d at a prosecuting attorney is the representative of the public in whom is lodged a discretion which is not to be controlled by the courts,or by an interested individual italics omitted city of los angeles decker,supra,cal d at a government lawyer in a civil action should not use his position or the economic power of the government to harass parties or to bring about unjust settlements or results.indeed,it is a bedrock principle that a government attorney prosecuting a public action on behalf of the government must not be motivated solely by a desire to win a case,but instead owes a duty to the public to ensure that justice will be done.greer,supra,cal d at.
these principles of heightened neutrality remain valid and necessary in the context of the situation presented by the case before us.a fair prosecution and outcome in a proceeding brought in the name of the public is a matter of vital concern both for defendants and for the public,whose interests are represented by the government and to whom a duty is owed to ensure that the judicial process remains fair and untainted by an improper motivation on the part of attorneys representing the government.accordingly,to ensure that an attorney representing the government acts evenhandedly and does not abuse the unique power entrusted in him or her in that that public confidence in the integrity of the judicial system is not thereby heightened standard of neutrality is required for attorneys prosecuting cases on behalf of the government.
we must determine whether this heightened standard of neutrality is compromised by the hiring of counsel to assist government attorneys in the prosecution of a abatement action of the type involved in the present proceedings.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that this standard is not compromised.because private counsel who are remunerated on a basis have a direct pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case,they have a conflict of interest that potentially places their personal interests at odds with the interests of the public and of defendants in ensuring that a public prosecution is pursued in a manner that serves the public,rather than serving a private interest.this conflict,however,does not necessarily mandate disqualification in cases when fundamental constitutional rights and the right to continue operation of an existing business are not implicated.instead,retention of private counsel on a basis is permissible in such cases if neutral,government attorneys retain the power to control and supervise the litigation.as explained below,because public counsel are themselves neutral,and because these neutral attorneys retain control over critical discretionary decisions involved in the litigation,the heightened standard of neutrality is maintained and the integrity of the government position is safeguarded.thus,in a case where the government action poses no threat to fundamental constitutional interests and does not threaten the continued operation of an ongoing business,concerns about neutrality are assuaged if the litigation is controlled by neutral attorneys,even if some of the attorneys involved in the case in a subsidiary role have a conflict of interest that present in a public disqualification.
this reasoning recently was embraced by the supreme court of rhode island,which approved the state attorney general employment of private counsel on a basis to prosecute abatement actions against lead paint case identical in all material respects to the underlying action here.state of rhode island,supra.that court considered the propriety of the agreements in light of the state attorney general status as a public servant,and his attendant responsibility to seek justice rather than prevail at all costs.id.at.the state high court noted that the attorney general was bound by the ethical standards governing the conduct of public prosecutors.ibid.ultimately,citing the underlying decision of the court of appeal in the present case,the court in state of rhode island concluded that there is nothing unconstitutional or illegal or inappropriate in a contractual relationship whereby the attorney general hires outside attorneys on a contingent fee basis to assist in the litigation of certain matters.indeed,it is our view that the ability of the attorney general to enter into such contractual relationships may well,in some circumstances,lead to results that will be beneficial to which otherwise might not have been attainable.however,due to the special duty of attorneys general to seek justice and their wide discretion with respect to same,such contractual relationships must be accompanied by exacting limitations i t is our view that the attorney general is not precluded from engaging private counsel pursuant to a contingent fee agreement in order to assist in certain civil litigation,so long as the office of attorney general retains absolute and total control over all critical in any case in which such agreements have been entered into.state of rhode island,at,original italics,boldface and fns.omitted.
we generally agree with the supreme court of rhode island and the court of appeal in the present case that there is a critical distinction between an employment arrangement that fully delegates governmental authority to a private party possessing a personal interest in the case,and an arrangement specifying that private counsel remain subject to the supervision and control of government attorneys.private counsel serving in a subordinate role do not supplant a public entity government attorneys,who have no personal or pecuniary interest in a case and therefore remain free of a conflict of interest that might require disqualification.accordingly,in a case in which private counsel are subject to the supervision and control of government attorneys,the discretionary decisions vital to an impartial prosecution are made by neutral attorneys and the prosecution may proceed with the assistance of private counsel,even though the latter have a pecuniary interest in the case.
it is true that the public attorneys decisionmaking conceivably could be influenced by their professional reliance upon the private attorneys expertise and a concomitant sense of obligation to those attorneys to ensure that they receive payment for their many hours of work on the case.this circumstance may fairly be viewed as being somewhat akin to having a personal interest in the case.nevertheless,this is not the type of personal conflict of interest that requires disqualification of the public attorneys.as this court has stated a lmost any fee arrangement between attorney and client may give rise to a conflict the contingent fee contract so common in civil litigation creates a conflict when either the attorney or the client needs a quick settlement while the other interest would be better served by pressing on in the hope of a greater recovery.the variants of this kind of conflict are infinite.fortunately most attorneys serve their clients honorably despite the opportunity to profit by neglecting or betraying the client interest.people doolin cal th.
as recognized by the american bar association,attorneys are expected to resolve conflicts between their personal interests and their ethical and professional responsibilities through the exercise of sensitive professionalism and moral judgment.aba model rules conduct,preamble,par.in other words,attorneys are presumed to comport themselves with ethical integrity and to abide by all rules of professional conduct.in light of the supervisory role played by government counsel in the their inherent duty to serve the public interest in any type of prosecution pursued on behalf of the presume that government attorneys will honor their obligation to place the interests of their client above the personal,pecuniary interest of the subordinate private counsel they have hired.
as we have explained above,in the type of abatement action being prosecuted in the present case,disqualification of counsel need not be governed by the stringent disqualification rules applicable to criminal prosecutors.nevertheless,the role of the prosecutor provides useful guidance concerning the type of discretionary decisions that must remain with neutral government attorneys to ensure that the litigation is conducted in a manner.a public prosecutor has broad discretion over the entire course of the criminal proceedings,from the investigation and gathering of evidence,through the decisions of whom to charge and what charges to bring,to the numerous choices at trial to accept,oppose,or challenge judicial rulings.hambarian,supra,cal th at.in greer,we emphasized that it is because the prosecutor enjoys such broad discretion that the public he serves and those he accuses may justifiably demand that he perform his functions with the highest degree of integrity and impartiality,and with the appearance thereof.greer,supra,cal d at.accordingly,the advantage of public prosecution is lost if those exercising the discretionary duties of the district attorney are subject to conflicting personal interests which might tend to compromise their impartiality.id.at see also hambarian,supra,cal th at holding that proper test for a disqualifying conflict of interest under section is whether the prosecutor discretionary decisionmaking has been placed within the influence or control of an interested party.
a prosecutor authority to make critical discretionary decisions in criminal cases is vital to ensuring the neutrality we require of attorneys entrusted with that position.this is so because such discretionary decisions provide the greatest opportunity to abuse the judicial process by placing personal gain above the interests of the public in a fair and just prosecution and outcome.for the same reason,in the context of abatement proceedings,critical discretionary decisions similarly may not be delegated to private counsel possessing an interest in the case,but instead must be made by neutral government attorneys.
accordingly,although the principles of heightened neutrality do not categorically bar the retention of counsel to assist public entities in the prosecution of abatement actions,those principles do mandate that all critical discretionary decisions ultimately must be made by the public entities government attorneys rather than by private other words,neutral government attorneys must retain and exercise the requisite control and supervision over both the conduct of private attorneys and the overall prosecution of the case.such control of the litigation by neutral attorneys provides a safeguard against the possibility that private attorneys unilaterally will engage in inappropriate prosecutorial strategy and tactics geared to maximize their monetary reward.accordingly,when public entities have retained the requisite authority in appropriate civil actions to control the litigation and to make all critical discretionary decisions,the impartiality required of government attorneys prosecuting the case on behalf of the public has been maintained.
defendants assert that even if the control of private counsel by government attorneys is viable in theory,it fails in application because private counsel in such cases are hired based upon their expertise and experience,and therefore always will assume a primary and controlling role in guiding the course of the litigation,rendering illusory the notion of government control.to the extent defendants assert that no contractual provision delegating the division of responsibility will or can be adhered to,we decline to assume that private counsel intentionally or negligently will violate the terms of their retention agreements by acting independently and without consultation with the attorneys or that public attorneys will delegate their fundamental obligations 
defendants also contend that the concept of control is unworkable as a standard to govern future cases,because it will be difficult if not impossible for a trial court to monitor whether government counsel for a public entity is adequately fulfilling his or her supervisory role and controlling all important aspects of the litigation,including procedural tactics,the gathering and presentation of evidence,the consideration and resolution of settlement negotiations,and other discretionary matters.defendants assert that short of egregious actions on the part of private counsel or the supervising government attorney,violations of the control exception would be difficult to detect 
these practical concerns do not require the barring of arrangements in all public prosecutions.instead,to ensure that public attorneys exercise real rather than illusory control over counsel,retainer agreements providing for retention should encompass more than boilerplate language regarding control or supervision,by identifying certain critical matters regarding the litigation that counsel must present to government attorneys for decision.the requisite specific provisions,described below,are not comprehensive panaceas and may not all operate perfectly in the context of every situation,but each of them will assist parties and the court in assessing whether private counsel are abusing their prosecutorial office.moreover,adherence to these provisions is subject to objective verification both by defendants and by the court without the need for engaging in discovery that might intrude upon the privilege or attorney work product protections.
in a case such as the present one,in which any remedy will be primarily monetary in nature,the authority to settle the case involves a paramount discretionary decision and is an important factor in ensuring that defendants constitutional right to a fair trial is not compromised by overzealous actions of an attorney with a pecuniary stake in the outcome.accordingly,retention agreements between public entities and private counsel must specifically provide that decisions regarding settlement of the case are reserved exclusively to the discretion of the public entity own attorneys.similarly,such agreements must specify that any defendant that is the subject of such litigation may contact the lead government attorneys directly,without having to confer with counsel.aba formal ethics opn,model rule of professional conduct generally does not prohibit a lawyer who represents a client in a matter involving an organization from communicating with the organization inside counsel about the subject of the representation without obtaining the prior consent of the entity outside counsel.
additionally,we adopt,in slightly modified form,the specific guidelines set forth by the supreme court of rhode island in state of rhode island,supra,at page,footnote.specifically,agreements between public entities and private counsel must provide that the attorneys will retain complete control over the course and conduct of the case that government attorneys retain a veto power over any decisions made by outside counsel and that a government attorney with supervisory authority must be personally involved in overseeing the litigation.
these specific provisions are not exhaustive.the unique circumstances of each prosecution may require a different set of guidelines for effective supervision and control of the case,and public entities may find it useful to specify other discretionary decisions that will remain vested in government attorneys.nevertheless,the aforementioned provisions comprise the minimum requirements for a retention agreement between a public entity and private counsel adequate to ensure that critical governmental authority is not improperly delegated to an attorney possessing a personal pecuniary interest in the case.
in the present case,five of the seven agreements between the public entities and private counsel contained in the record provide that the public entities government counsel retain final authority over all aspects of the litigation.declarations of public counsel for these five public entities confirm that these individuals retained and continue to retain complete control of the litigation,have been actively involved in and direct all decisions related to the litigation,and have direct oversight over the work of outside counsel.private counsel submitted declarations confirming that the government counsel for the five public entities retain complete control over the litigation the references in these agreements to final authority over all aspects of the litigation fairly can be read to mandate that the government attorneys will supervise the work of the private attorneys,and will retain authority to control all critical decisionmaking in the case.the declarations establish that such general control and supervision have been exercised and are,in fact,being exercised.
nevertheless,although five of the fee agreements between the respective public entities and private counsel contain language specifying that control and supervision will be retained by the government attorneys,none of the ten fee agreements in the present case contain the other specific provisions regarding retention of control and division of responsibility that we conclude are required to safeguard against abuse of the judicial process.accordingly,because the seven agreements that are in the record are deficient under the standard we set forth above,and because we can not assess the sufficiency of the three remaining agreements that are not contained in the record,we reverse the judgment rendered by the court of appeal and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.assuming the public entities contemplate pursuing this litigation assisted by private counsel on a basis,we conclude they may do so after revising the respective retention agreements to conform with the requirements set forth in this opinion.
i concur in the judgment insofar as it vacates the superior court order barring the plaintiff public entities from paying their private counsel under contingent fee agreements.
although i do not agree with every aspect of the majority reasoning,i do agree this court spoke too broadly in when it prohibited contingent fee agreements in all public nuisance cases.see people ex rel.clancy superior court cal d,clancy.as the majority explains,public nuisance cases comprise a wide range of factual situations,some of which do not necessarily entail a conflict of interest between plaintiffs and private attorneys retained under contingent fee agreements.to limit clancy is thus appropriate,as the majority concludes.
in this case,however,at least a possible conflict of interest arises from the combination of two circumstances the public entities assert they can not afford to pay private counsel other than a contingent fee,and some of the fee agreements at issue give private counsel a share of the value of any abatement ordered by the court.given the hypothetical choice between an abatement order of great public value and a less valuable cash settlement both the public and the private attorneys have an incentive to advocate the less valuable cash settlement,as it provides funds from which private counsel can be paid without an appropriation of public money representing the private attorneys share of the value of abatement.certainly this incentive does not amount to a personal conflict of interest requiring the public attorneys recusal,as the majority explains,ante,at,but it does lead me to question whether public attorneys under all foreseeable circumstances will be able to exercise the independent supervisory judgment the majority concludes is essential if private counsel are to be retained under contingent fee agreements.here,however,the parties briefing on the subject of possible remedies is so vague,any such conflict is merely speculative.
in concurring in the judgment,i am also influenced by the concern that to grant defendants motion might encourage parties in future cases to bring belated motions seeking to interfere with their opposing parties relationships for tactical reasons.although plaintiffs commenced this action in,and although defendants do not assert they learned of the contingent fee agreements only recently defendants did not challenge those agreements until,after losing pretrial dispositive motions on appeal see county of santa clara atlantic richfield th.in ruling on a motion to disqualify counsel,the court may properly consider the possibility that the motion is a tactical device people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems cal th,comden superior court cal d,and deny the motion when unreasonable delay has caused great prejudice in re complex asbestos litigation d,river west,nickel d.to grant defendants motion in this case could as a practical matter force plaintiffs to abandon their lawsuit after nearly a decade of pretrial litigation and discovery.while defendants have asked the court not to disqualify plaintiffs counsel but instead simply to bar plaintiffs from compensating counsel on a contingent basis,the only authority for defendants motion is the body of law concerning disqualification.because there is evidence indicating that an order prohibiting contingent fees would as a practical matter preclude private counsel effect disqualifying rule requiring timely presentation of the motion would logically apply.
the plaintiffs in this case are county of santa clara santa clara,county of san mateo san mateo,county of monterey monterey,county of solano solano,county of los angeles,county of alameda alameda,city and county of san francisco san francisco,city of oakland oakland,city of los angeles,and city of san diego san diego as a result of corporate acquisition and merger,the names of the defendants in the action below are atlantic richfield company,millennium inorganic chemicals,millennium holdings llc,american cyanamid company,conagra grocery products company,du pont de nemours and company,nl industries,company,the corporation,and does,inclusive.
four of these five public entities submitted declarations of government counsel stating that they had retained and continue d to retain complete control of the litigation,were actively involved in and direct ed all decisions related to the litigation,and have direct oversight over the work of outside counsel.san francisco submission declared that t he san francisco city attorney office has in fact retained control over all significant decisions in this case.
private counsel cotchett,pitre mccarthy submitted a declaration in which it stated it had been retained by santa clara,solano,alameda,oakland,monterey,san mateo,and san diego.this law firm asserted that these public entities government counsel have maintained and continue to maintain complete control over all aspects of the litigation and all decision making authority and responsibility.private counsel thornton naumes,private counsel motley,rice,and private counsel mary alexander submitted declarations asserting that they had been retained by san francisco to assist in this litigation,and that san francisco city attorney has retained complete control over this litigation and has exercised full authority and responsibility.
oakland submitted a declaration by one of its deputy city attorneys stating that notwithstanding any documents suggesting the contrary,the office of the city attorney has retained complete control over the prosecution of the public nuisance cause of action in this case as it relates to the interests of the people of the city of oakland.oakland asserted it was in the process of revising its fee agreement so that it reflects the reality of the relationship between oakland and its private counsel.
seven separate fee agreements between the various public entities and their private counsel were before the lower courts and are part of the record before this court.these fee agreements are between private counsel and santa clara,monterey,san francisco,solano,oakland,alameda,and san diego.the record does not contain the fee agreements between private counsel and san mateo,county of los angeles,and city of los angeles,respectively,although these three entities are and remain plaintiffs in the underlying case and petitioners here.

it also seems beyond dispute that due process would not allow for a criminal prosecutor to employ private cocounsel pursuant to a arrangement that conditioned the private attorney compensation on the outcome of the criminal prosecution.see state of rhode island lead industries,fn.state of rhode island explicitly refraining from allowing arrangement in the criminal context,because the court was unable to envision a criminal case where contingent fees would ever be if they were not explicitly barred,as is the case in this jurisdiction people eubanks cal th,finding cognizable conflict of interest because of the circumstance that the corporate crime victim paid the substantial debts and expenses incurred by the district attorney investigating the case,and that such payment evidenced a reasonable possibility the prosecutor might not exercise his discretionary functions in an evenhanded manner.
