robert moser prevailed against the federal government in a civil asset forfeiture action and became entitled to an award of attorney fees under the civil asset forfeiture reform act of cafra,b a.the district court fee award was significantly less than moser requested,and he now appeals.because the district court committed several errors in considering the unopposed fee request,we vacate and remand for recalculation of the award.
during a search of moser house for marijuana cultivation,federal agents seized in currency.the united states later instituted proceedings to forfeit the money.moser retained richard barnett,an experienced forfeiture specialist,to oppose the government claim and assert moser ownership of the funds.the fee agreement provided that barnett would be paid the greater of one third of recovery or any statutory fee award.
asserting that government agents interrogated moser without a warning and conducted warrantless searches of his home,barnett filed a motion to suppress all evidence relating to the seized currency.as the district court noted,although these constitutional violations were uncontested,t he government,for reasons that are not clear,obstinately opposed the claim and aggressive ly litigated the case.the district court granted moser motion to suppress and his motion for summary judgment,and ordered the money returned to him.
as the prevailing party,moser then moved for attorney fees under cafra.see united states in currency,cir.he requested fees of,based on barnett hourly rate of and hours of work.the motion was supported by declarations from attorneys knowledgeable about legal fees in the san diego market,including several specializing in forfeiture litigation.barnett provided a detailed accounting of his hours and eliminated hours from the fee request because he considered the work fruitless or unnecessary.the government opposition to the motion rested entirely on the argument that any award should be capped by the contingency fee in the retention agreement.
the district court rejected the government argument,correctly noting that the lodestar method,which calculates a fee award by multiplying the market billing rate by the hours reasonably expended,see blanchard bergeron,applies to cafra awards even when there is a contingency agreement,see in currency,at.but the court awarded moser only in fees.disregarding three declarations from forfeiture specialists,the district court incorrectly stated that moser declarations did not accurately reflect the forfeiture market rate because they discussed only litigation fees generally.the court then purported to apply its own knowledge of the market,and,based on its characterization of barnett work as essentially criminal in nature and a fee award mentioned in one of the declarations,determined that was a reasonable hourly rate.
turning to the hours expended,the court found that barnett gave the government aggressive and often specious litigation arguments more respect than they deserved,and that such an experienced attorney should have expended fewer hours opposing the government arguments.although the court specifically identified as questionable only hours of work on a reply brief,it reduced the hours for which fees would be awarded from to.finally,the court found that the resulting lodestar calculation of should be reduced by an additional because of the contingent fee agreement.
we have jurisdiction over moser appeal of the fee award under.in general,we review a district court determination of whether a requested fee is reasonable for abuse of discretion.see childress darby lumber,cir.f actual findings are reviewed for clear error.native vill.of quinhagak united states,cir.the legal analysis underlying a fee decision is reviewed de novo.childress,at.
moser opening brief contends that the government unsuccessful argument below that any cafra award was capped by the contingency fee in the retention agreement waived any challenge to the amounts he proposed.put differently,moser argues that the district court was required to award the entire requested fee because the government did not dispute either proffered component of the lodestar analysis the hourly rate or hours expended.
the evidentiary burdens governing fee motions are well established.the applicant has an initial burden of production,under which it must produce satisfactory evidence establishing the reasonableness of the requested fee.see blum stenson,camacho bridgeport,cir.this evidence must include proof of market rates in the relevant community often in the form of affidavits from practitioners,see camacho,at,and detailed documentation of the hours worked,see gates deukmejian,cir.if the applicant discharges its legal obligation as to the burden of production,the court then proceeds to a factual determination as to whether the requested fee is reasonable.see grove wells fargo fin,cir straw bowen,cir.in the usual case,that factual determination will involve considering both the proponent evidence and evidence submitted by the fee opponent challenging the accuracy and reasonableness of the facts asserted by the prevailing party.camacho,at alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.
in this case,the government presented no evidence in opposition to the fee application.it is clear,however,that the applicant initial duty of production is not excused by lack of opposition.see foley city of lowell,cir bode united states,cir per curiam explaining that an uncontested fee application failed to meet its initial burden.a district court does not improperly shoulder defendant burden of challenging the fee petition in finding that the applicant has failed to meet its initial burden of production.zabkowicz bend,cir see bode,at the united states was not required to put on any evidence challenging the reasonableness of the hours expended because the taxpayers had failed to meet their initial burden of establishing the actual number of attorney hours.we thus reject moser argument that,by itself,the government failure to challenge the evidence below mandated an award of the total amount requested in his fee motion.
but,the government failure to submit evidence is not without serious consequences.after a court determines that a fee application is supported with the requisite evidence of hours worked and the market legal rate,it must then determine the reasonableness of the fee sought.when a fee target has failed to offer either countervailing evidence or persuasive argumentation in support of its position,we do not think it is the court job either to do the target homework or to take heroic measures aimed at salvaging the target from the predictable consequences of lassitude.foley,at.thus,if the fee target does not dispute the market rate or hours reasonably expended,and poses no other valid legal reason for denying the fee request,the district court inquiry should end after it determines whether the applicant fee request is facially reasonable.see united steelworkers of am.phelps dodge,cir holding that the district court must presume reasonable an uncontested market fee rate supported by sufficient evidence toussaint mccarthy,cir awarding the full requested fee because the plaintiffs appropriately supported a fee application and the defendant did not contest the claimed rates or hours see also powell cir,cir explaining that an uncontested rate supported by evidence is prima facie reasonable.the fee target has,through its inaction in the district court,waived any right on appeal to present new evidence to challenge the district court factual finding of reasonableness nor can the target challenge the absence of an evidentiary hearing in the district court.see blum,at.
applying these principles,we turn to the district court analysis of moser fee application.we start from the premise that although a district court has a great deal of discretion in determining the reasonableness of the fee,camacho,at internal quotation marks omitted gates,at,it must set forth a concise but clear explanation of its reasons to allow for appellate review,chaudhry city of los angeles,cir.internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied.
