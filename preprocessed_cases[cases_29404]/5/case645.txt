factual and procedural background 
a detailed history of this case can be found in our previous opinion.see berger city of mayfield heights,cir.in relevant part,the facts reflected there indicate that plaintiff berger and one of his neighbors got into a dispute concerning the maintenance of berger intervening vacant lot,the dismay of his kept in a natural state.the neighbor succeeded in soliciting the mayfield heights city council to amend an ordinance to require owners of vacant lots with feet or less of street frontage to totally cut their lots to a height of no more than eight inches.not surprisingly,berger vacant lot contravened the ordinance,but he refused to comply with the city demand to his lot,resulting in his citation for a criminal violation.
in response to the citation,berger sued the city and certain other defendants in a complaint.the first two counts alleged constitutional violations,as follows 
count i that the amended ordinance is not substantially related to the public health,safety,and welfare of the city,violates ohio,and is unreasonable and arbitrary,constituting a substantive due process violation under the fourteenth amendment.
count ii that the amended ordinance is unconstitutional on equal protection grounds,because it treats similarly situated landowners differently,based solely on the square footage of their properties.
in the jurisdictional statement of his complaint,berger predicated jurisdiction on the basis of,and as well as a and and et berger sought relief,among other remedies,in the form of compensatory damages against the city compensatory and punitive damages against the other defendants an injunction against criminal prosecution for violation of the ordinance a declaratory judgment that the ordinance violated the federal and ohio constitutional equal protection and due process clauses and attorney fees and costs.the district court granted a temporary restraining order against criminal prosecution,and the city consented to hold in abeyance the criminal prosecution and its manicure of berger vacant lot pending final resolution of the litigation.after the other defendants were either dismissed by berger or found immune from liability,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the city on all counts of berger complaint.
on appeal,we reversed the grant of summary judgment to the city on counts and,finding,under a literal interpretation,that the ordinance violates both the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment and,under a interpretation,that it violates the equal protection clause.berger,at.following remand to the district court,berger petitioned for an award of attorneys fees pursuant to,and the city filed a for an award of attorneys fees pursuant to and and for sanctions against berger pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure.the district court denied both petitions.
discussion 
berger argues that the district court erred when it denied him an award of attorneys fees.undergirding berger claim for fees is,which provides 
in any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections,and of this title,the court,in its discretion,may allow the prevailing party,other than the united states,a reasonable attorney fee as part of the costs.
we review the denial of attorneys fees for abuse of discretion.phelan bell,cir citing perotti seiter,cir.abuse of discretion is defined as a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error of judgment.logan dayton hudson,cir citing balani immigration and naturalization service,cir.an abuse of discretion exists when the district court applies the wrong legal standard,misapplies the correct legal standard,or relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact.first technology safety systems depinet,cir.
although the district court acknowledged that berger successfully challenged the constitutionality of the city ordinance,it denied berger an award of attorneys fees with the following explication 
a constitutional challenge to a statute or ordinance is not,however,confined to an action under.clearly,a district court has jurisdiction under to entertain such constitutional challenges.neither the parties briefs,this courts memorandum opinions nor the sixth circuit decision characterize this case as a civil rights action.it is quite simply a constitutional challenge to a city ordinance.is merely a vehicle whereby a litigant may assert a constitutional violation.even assuming plaintiff pled a cause of action under,he did not prevail on his constitutional challenge through.see braley city of pontiac,cir creates a right of action for the vindication of constitutional guarantees found elsewhere.the basis upon which judgment was granted to defendant and then ultimately reversed by the sixth circuit was based upon a constitutional analysis and there is no mention of in either of those decisions.thus,plaintiff success in challenging the ordinance constitutionality was not based upon and plaintiff can not be considered a prevailing party for purposes of attorneys fees under b.
we can not endorse the district court reasoning,which appears to turn on the notion that berger case was not a civil rights action,and thus it was not a action entitling the plaintiff to an award of attorneys fees under.this distinction,however,has been expressly rejected by the supreme court in maine thiboutot,d.
there,the court was asked to decide whether proscription against the violation of federal laws should be limited to a subset of laws.the respondents in thiboutot brought a action in state court claiming that the state of maine had violated the social security act.they prevailed upon their claim,but the state court denied an award of attorney fees sought by the respondents pursuant to.upon review,the supreme judicial court of maine concluded that the respondents were eligible for attorney fees pursuant to.thiboutot,at.on certiorari to the united states supreme court,the state argued that the social security act did not constitute a law whose violation entitles an aggrieved litigant to the award of attorney fees under.id.at.
the supreme court,after recognizing that the plain language of undoubtedly embraces a claim for violation of the social security act,referred to prior cases to illustrate the resolution that the remedy broadly encompasses violations of federal statutory as well as constitutional law.id.at.citing monell new york city of social services,d there can be no doubt that was intended to provide a remedy,to be broadly construed,against all forms of official violation of federally protected rights greenwood peacock,d under,state officers may be made to respond in damages not only for violations of rights conferred by federal equal civil rights laws,but for violations of other federal constitutional and statutory rights as well see also loschiavo city of dearborn,cir federal regulations,in particular regulations promulgated pursuant to the cable communications policy act of,have the force of law and thus may create enforceable rights protected under.the court held that relief is not limited to the violation
