the nature of medical liens and attorney liens,and their priority with respect to a monetary recovery obtained in a lawsuit by an injured plaintiff against a tortfeasor,are subjects that consume much of a personal injury plaintiff lawyer time and they have been the subjects of numerous appellate decisions.see,fletcher davis cal th,d,cetenko united california bank cal d,waltrip kimberlin th,d pangborn plumbing carruthers skiffington th,d wujcik wujcik th,d nicoletti lizzoli d.see also carroll interstate brands th,d.
however,the parties in this proceeding have not pointed to,and we have not found,any decision that has directly decided which of a contractual medical lien and an attorney lien for fees and costs of litigation has priority over the other.we address the question now,without repeating all that has already been said about medical liens and attorney liens.
plaintiff,kevan gilman,is in the business of paying,at a discount,the cost of medical services provided to an injured person,and obtaining from the medical provider and the injured person an assignment of the medical lien for the full amount,to be collected from a judgment that might be obtained by the person in a lawsuit against the tortfeasor who caused the injury.the medical provider agrees to the arrangement to ensure that it immediately receives some compensation for the services it provides to a person who lacks the resources to pay for them.the patient agrees to the arrangement in order to obtain the services that otherwise might not be provided.and gilman agrees to the arrangement in hopes of getting more money via the medical lien than he paid for it.
defendants,lena dalby,roger dreyer,joseph babich,robert buccola,william callaham,and the law firm of dreyer,babich,buccola callaham,were retained by an injured person who had entered into such an arrangement with gilman while the person was represented by another attorney.
things did not come out as gilman,defendants,and the injured person hoped.the lawsuit was settled for slightly less than what was spent in litigation costs,and defendants waived their right to attorney fees under their contingency fee agreement,due to the fact that the settlement amount was less than the total of office costs that had been incurred.
claiming he is entitled to payment on his lien from the amount of the settlement,gilman sued defendants for,among other things,breach of fiduciary duty and conversion.defendants answer asserted,among other things,that gilman complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute causes of action and that there were other liens superior and prior to gilman lien thus,defendants were legally bound to pay said superior and prior liens,before any payment could be made to gilman.
gilman appeals from the judgment entered in favor of defendants after the trial court sustained their demurrer to the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty and granted their motion for summary judgment on the other causes of action.he contests only the rulings on his claims of breach of fiduciary duty and conversion,as well as the order granting defendants request for attorney fees and costs.
as we shall explain,gilman was not defendants client and,because defendants had not signed the lien,they did not have any contractual duty to him.his complaint is devoid of any allegations showing a traditionally recognized fiduciary relationship.the fact that defendants were aware of gilman lien is not enough to create a fiduciary duty.thus,the trial court correctly sustained,without leave to amend,the demurrer to the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action.as to the claim of conversion,we conclude that,as a matter of equity and public policy,defendants purported attorney lien for costs had priority over gilman medical lien,regardless of which came first in time.because the purported attorney lien for costs exceeded the amount of the settlement,there was nothing left for gilman to collect via his lien,and thus there was no basis for a claim of conversion.however,in the summary judgment proceeding,defendants did not submit any evidence that they had an attorney lien against the recovery,thus failing to establish that they were entitled to deduct their litigation costs from the settlement proceeds.consequently,we will reverse the summary judgment entered in defendant favor on the conversion cause of action and remand the matter for further proceedings on that claim.it follows that we must reverse the award of attorney fees and costs predicated upon defendants being the prevailing parties.
gilman is in the practice of factoring medical accounts and operates under the fictitious business name of lien medical.he pays,at a discount,the medical bills of injured persons who are pursuing litigation to recover damages for their injuries,and then obtains an assignment of the medical providers accounts receivable.he also obtains contractual liens from the injured persons and their counsel,which give gilman liens against any recoveries obtained in the lawsuits.
in april,james daprato was in an automobile accident.sacramento mri center provided medical services to daprato on may,and then sold and assigned to lien medical all of the center right,title,and interest in daprato account.on the same day,daprato signed a contractual lien,which gave lien medical a lien against any recovery that daprato might receive in litigation to recover damages for his injuries.the lien states with respect to any and all monies received as a result of this incident,you are not to disburse any such monies prior to paying lien medical in full for the lien that lien medical holds as a result of this incident.you must pay lien medical in full within days of receipt of any monies received as a result of this incident.daprato agreed that he remained personally liable for the money owed to lien medical.
daprato attorney,paige hibbert,also signed the lien and agreed to notify lien medical of any substitution of attorney and to provide the successor attorney with a copy of the lien.
in july,daprato changed attorneys,retaining dalby,an attorney with defendants law firm.according to gilman,dalby was aware of the lien,but dalby and the other defendants did not sign the lien.
daprato settled his lawsuit in june for,which was less than the litigation costs of,including filing fees the cost of process service,deposition fees,and deposition transcripts expenses for records and postage and other costs of professional services.defendant dalby submitted a declaration stating defendants should have received percent of the award,but waived their fees because the amount of the settlement was less than the amount of litigation costs.thus,other than covering most of their costs,defendants did not receive any money from the settlement nor did daprato and gilman.according to dalby,t here were no settlement proceeds subject to any lien.
gilman sued dalby,her law firm,and the individual members of the firm for breach of contract,account stated,open book account,conversion,unjust enrichment,breach of fiduciary duty,and an accounting.
defendants demurred to the entire complaint.the trial court sustained the demurrer as to the causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment.
defendants then moved for summary judgment on the remaining causes of action.gilman opposed the motion,but only as to the cause of action for conversion.defendants alleged that gilman could not pursue an action for conversion because he did not have an ownership interest in the settlement proceeds at the time of the alleged conversion and,in any event,there were no settlement proceeds for defendants to convert because the litigation costs exceeded the settlement amount.the court granted the motion and entered judgment for defendants.
on appeal,gilman challenges only the rulings on the causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty and conversion.
discussion 
gilman contends the trial court erred in concluding there is no factual or legal basis for his claim of breach of fiduciary duty,and in thus sustaining,without leave to amend,defendants demurrer to that cause of action.
on appeal from a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,we examine the complaint de novo to determine whether it alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any legal theory.mccall pacificare of,cal th,d.we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation and treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded however,we do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions,or conclusions of law.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d.we may take notice of exhibits attached to the complaint the facts in the exhibits take precedence if they contradict facts alleged in the complaint.mead sanwa bank california th,d.
if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment,then it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend.aubry hospital,supra,cal th at,d.the burden of proving that such a reasonable possibility exists is squarely on the plaintiff,who must demonstrate that he could amend the complaint and how the amendment would change the legal effect of his pleading.blank kirwan cal d,goodman kennedy cal d.
gilman complaint alleges that daprato retained defendants to represent daprato in a personal injury lawsuit,and that daprato received medical care for his injuries,the payment for which was secured by a written lien owned by gilman.according to the complaint,defendants either signed the lien or had knowledge of its existence.however,the copy of the lien attached to the complaint shows that defendants did not sign the lien and were not parties to the lien contract.the facts in the lien document take precedence over the allegations of the complaint.mead sanwa bank california,supra,th at,d.
the complaint further alleges that defendants received funds applicable to gilman lien and that,upon receipt of those funds,they owed him a fiduciary duty and obligation not to act in any manner that would compromise his claim of lien.according to the complaint,defendants had knowledge of the lien,knew that there was a dispute regarding entitlement to the funds,yet disbursed the monies rather than interpleading the funds to determine who had the superior right to them.therefore,the complaint alleges,defendants failed to exercise reasonable care causing detriment to gilman in the amount of his lien for.
as we will explain,the allegations are insufficient to state a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.
a fiduciary relationship is any relation existing between parties to a transaction wherein one of the parties is duty bound to act with the utmost good faith for the benefit of the other party.such a relation ordinarily arises where a confidence is reposed by one person in the integrity of another,and in such a relation the party in whom the confidence is reposed,if he voluntarily accepts or assumes to accept the confidence,can take no advantage from his acts relating to the interest of the other party without the latter knowledge or consent.a fiduciary relation in law is ordinarily synonymous with a confidential relation.herbert lankershim cal d,wolf superior court th,d hereafter wolf.
in the commercial context,traditional examples of fiduciary relationships include those of,corporate directors and majority shareholders,business partners,joint adventurers,and.wolf,supra,th at,d.inherent in each of these relationships is the duty of undivided loyalty the fiduciary owes to its beneficiary,imposing on the fiduciary obligations far more stringent than those required of ordinary contractors.ibid.absent such a relationship,a plaintiff can not turn an ordinary breach of contract into a breach of fiduciary duty based solely on the breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing contained in every contract.id.at,d.being of universal prevalence,the implied covenant can not create a fiduciary relationship it affords basis for redress for breach of contract and that is all.citation.ibid.
in this case,the lien created nothing more than a contractual duty to withhold money for gilman in the event the litigation was successful.t he contractual right to contingent compensation in the control of another has never,by itself,been sufficient to create a fiduciary relationship where one would not otherwise exist.wolf,supra,th at,d,citing downey humphreys d,the obligation to pay money is a debt,which is not a trust and does not create a fiduciary relationship,whether debtor liability is certain or contingent wiltsee california emp.com.d,employment contract entitling employee to percent of future profits did not create a joint venture or gave rise to a fiduciary relationship new new d,a contractual obligation to pay former spouse a percentage of future monies received from stock holdings,if any,was no different than an obligation to pay fixed monthly sum although an implied duty of good faith and fair dealing existed in the contract,the contingent nature of the debt and the debtor exclusive control of monies received did not create a fiduciary relationship.
gilman was not defendants client,and because defendants had not signed the lien,they did not have any contractual duty to him.his complaint is devoid of any allegations showing an agency,trust,joint venture,partnership,or other traditionally recognized fiduciary relationship.the complaint merely alleges defendants owed him a fiduciary duty because they were aware of his lien.however,such awareness is not enough to create a fiduciary duty.
gilman disagrees,relying on crooks state bar cal d,hereafter crooks and johnstone state bar cal d,hereafter johnstone.his reliance on those cases concerning attorney disciplinary matters is misplaced.
in crooks,an attorney who had agreed to be an escrow holder was disciplined by the state bar of california due to the attorney knowing disregard of his responsibilities as a fiduciary in handling escrow funds in a manner that violated explicit escrow instructions.crooks,supra,cal d at.johnstone involved an attorney who represented an injured worker and agreed with the workers compensation insurer to hold and disburse settlement funds in exchange for the insurer agreement to accept less money,but later reneged on the agreement.the attorney was disciplined for breaching his fiduciary duty after agreeing to act as a trustee.johnstone,supra,cal d at.
here,defendants did not have any agreement with gilman to act as his fiduciary.as shown by the copy of the lien attached to the complaint,defendants did not sign the lien.defendants mere awareness of the lien,as alleged by gilman,is not the equivalent of their agreeing to act as a trustee for gilman and it does not make them escrow agents with respect to the litigation proceeds.
because the allegations of the complaint do not establish that defendants had a fiduciary duty to gilman,the trial court correctly sustained,without leave to amend,the demurrer to gilman cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.
gilman next asserts that the trial court erred in granting defendants motion for summary judgment on the conversion cause of action,ruling that gilman did not have a sufficient interest in the settlement proceeds to support an action for conversion,and the settlement proceeds were all expended on litigation costs so there was no property for defendants to convert 
we agree with gilman that the first ground upon which the trial court relied is flawed.
gilman,the assignee of a health care provider medical account,possesses a lien for payment of services rendered in connection with the injury that gave rise to daprato lawsuit.gilman obtained the lien on the date daprato mri was same date that sacramento mri assigned daprato account to gilman in exchange for his payment of daprato medical bill.because the events occurred on the same day,it is reasonable to infer that gilman paid for daprato medical treatment in exchange for a lien on his potential recovery in the pending litigation because sacramento mri would not treat him if he was uninsured and unable to pay for treatment at the time that it was rendered,and daprato could not afford medical treatment without gilman assistance.
the medical lien assigned to gilman states in
